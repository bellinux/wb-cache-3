40|$|Capacity {{building}} for fish processors Cue: Access to land tenure and to credit, {{and having a}} role in local decision-making processes are recognised as key issues for women?s development, particularly those who make a living from agriculture. But what about women whose main source of income comes from fish processing? Do they face similar problems? Not surprisingly, the answer is yes, they do. Large quantities of fish are wasted, or sold at low prices, because of the difficulties involved in getting them to a market in a good condition. And processors who lack funds may struggle in accessing both the fish themselves, and the equipment they need to process and transport them. On the coast of The Gambia women dominate fish processing. Recently {{the importance of their}} role has been recognised by the FAO and the UK government?s Department for International Development, who are funding a wide-ranging project to support fish processors, through training, group organisation and raising awareness among local planning and financial institutions about the challenges they face. The project is currently in a pilot phase, and Ismaila Senghore spoke to Sirah Njie, the project manager. IN:		?The women they always lament? OUT:		? plans that were not there before. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 02 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sirah Njie, on a wide-ranging project to support women fish processors in The Gambia. Transcript Njie	The women they always lament on accessibility to fish supply. They do not have access and control to the fisheries resources. Most of them they do complain about insufficient working capital. That is basically the reason why most of them are operating on a small-scale basis. And most of them are also lamenting {{that they do not have}} sufficient processing facilities that they can use to at least process their fish. The women are the major work force within this post harvest sub sector. So it is important that all these constraints need to be addressed. Senghore	Are you going to offer training in management of credit for example? Njie	Absolutely yes. The pilot project will be training them because we realise that you cannot give credit facility services or you cannot construct processing facilities without training them on how to manage these facilities. A pilot project will be training these primary beneficiaries on business and financial management. There will be training the beneficiaries in adult literacy, so at least they are able to know how to manage their business activities. The pilot project will also be training these beneficiaries on fish handling and processing. Senghore	So in your anticipation how much do you think this project will go in reducing poverty? Njie	<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an example. For example if you trained these fish processors on proper fish handling and processing under good hygienic conditions for them to know that this is the way that it should be done and then given the proper smoking facilities that they do require then I think they will be able to at least produce high quality fish. And at the end of the day if they do produce high quality fish which will at least fetch good prices at the market and I think that it will also increase their income. Most of them do complain about lack of credit services. If they are organised properly and they are linked with microfinance institutions that can provide them with these credit services, and based on the training that they will be having on business management, financial management, they will be able to at least manage their businesses properly, and that will I think also improve their livelihoods. And I think it will also reduce their vulnerability as well. Senghore	Coming back to for example the constraints that maybe inherent in the project, what do you think are the main constraints that need to be looked at in order to facilitate the smooth running of the implementation? Njie	Most of the post harvest operators are all lamenting about inadequate smoking facilities, improved drying racks, access to road services. And I think it is important here to at least work with the local government authorities to get the post harvest operators involved in the decision-making processes, especially in the local development plans. For these local development plans to address some of the constraints that these post harvest operators are facing. This is one of the reasons why the local government is one of our key partners because we are trying to involve the post harvest operators to be working with these local government authorities in their different areas so that they will be able to be addressing some of their needs in their local development plans that were not there before. End of track. Sirah Njie describes the training and organisation of women fish processors in The Gambia, which is being carried out by an international project...|$|E

It is well to remember the many personal sacrifices and the endless long hours work­ing like a human dynamo, striving to improve the living standards of the worker and his family; putting more bread and butter on their table and, needless to say, the betterment of our community as a whole can be attributed to his interest in civic activities. He gave of himself so completely he ruined his own health. W are all better off be­cause of the principles he stands for and lives by. Among his many achievements in labor and public life and the many worthwhile things he founded, the following serve as living proof of Gosser's untiring efforts. The Childrens Summer Camp, The Diagnostic Clinic, The Health and Retiree Center with the Pharmacies, the Optical Department, the Dental Department, the Hearing Aid Department, United Labor Committee, 60 Now, Council of Elders, Golden Age Summer and Winter Centers. As President of Local 12 U. A. W., as Regional Director of Region 2 -B, U. A. W., as. Vice-president of the International Union, UAW-AFL-CIO, during which time he was Director of the Competitive Shops Department, Director of Skilled Trades Department, Director of Wage and Hours Department, Director of Die Casting Department, Director of Auto-Lite Department, Director of Dana-Spicer Department, Director of Champion Spark Plug Department, Director of Doehler-Jarvis Council, Director of Foundry Department and Director of several other wage and hour councils too numerous to mention. In civic life he served as a Charter Member of the Labor-Management-Citizens Com­mittee and the Toledo Industrial Development Committee. Dick Gosser also was an in­tegral part of the Toledo Port Authority and other civic committees. He helped in various major fund raising drives like the Newsboy Goodfellows, The Community Chest, hospi­tals, churches, and others. Only last year, through his efforts, every needy child had an opportunity to attend free the Children's Wonderland at the Lucas County Recreational Center. These are just an example of the many'ways Toledo's most renowned labor leader has helped people in all walks of life throughout the United States an. dCanada.. It is fitting this evening that over 2, 000 of us. gather together to break bread with this great man and our best 'friend, Richard T. Gosser. It is ·our way of demonstrati. ng to him and to everyone that we honor and appreciate his complete dedication to labor and the community. What's more, we publicly ackqowledge and respect his honesty, his courage, his leadership, and his efforts to obtain a fuller measure of life for all•. We sincerely' hope that his retirement as an active officer in the labor movement is not a conclusion to 'an illustrious past, but instead with the Good Lord willing and his health permitting, Dick Gosser will continue to be an inspiration and a guiding tower of light to a better and brighter future. In these troubled tiines, now more than ever, we need his unequaled quality of under­standing tolerance, perseverance, desire and ability to help people gain dignity as be­comes the brotherhood of man. 'I am deeply touched by this turnout tonite. I don't believe anyone came out here because they want a job as an international representative. My influence with the UAW has diminished since my retirement so I take it that those who are here are my friends. And I {{want to thank you for}} giving up your favorite TV program or breaking a bowling date or some other engagement to come. If I seem to be overwhelmed by gratitude [...] forgive me. During my long years as a Labor Leader I have found gratitude isn't our chief virtue. I can think back to a long list of associates whom I have tried to help and who are no longer with meÿoing back to Toots Martinÿ [...] But I don't think this is the place or the time to review history [...] , or to talk of my deeds or my misdeeds. After all the words that have been spoken it would be like putting more icing on the frosting of the cake. Looking back 30 years I would say we have come a pretty long way in getting a better deal for the worker. Now if we can mobilize only a small part of that spirit when we first started this industrial union movement; if we can get just a small part of the effort and the sacrifice that those fellows gave, we can gain more in the next 30 months than has been accomplished in the last 30 years. I donlt plan to make a long speech [...] , that is, long for me. But last week I told some negro ministers who met with me that thereWs a difference when a worker in a factory retires and a fellow who has made his living using his brains and his wits. If the last couple of months in Florida proved anything to me it proved I wasnlt going to be happy spending the rest of my life sunning myself on a rocking chair. If I can't do all I could 5 or i 0 years ago I still can outthink [...] and figure out a few short cuts to help the workers [...] . or the retirees. And having been doing this so long, I may as well go on doing it. But nowadays itls not the worker that needs help so much as the fellows that have given up workingo [...] or the young fellows that want to work but can't [...] . and they canlt because there is no job to be found for too many of them. Yet there is one simple remedy that can help both these groups of people [...] . the young fellow looking for a job and the old-timer who has given his up. That is our Sixty Now program where we make it possible for the older worker to retire with a decent pay check so he can enjoy life and live in dignity. While we are helping him to a well-earned and long deserved rest we are helping create a job opening for the younger fellow just out of school. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a few facts before I leave this point. The Social Security Department reports that the average monthly benefit to the 13 million people retired under this law is 76. 66. That is less than i, 000. 00 a year. If the President and the Congress really want to cure poverty herels a swell place to begin. LetWs raise Social Security [...] . and if we have to reduce anything, letts reduce the age [...] . NOT the Social Security benefit. The 1960 census report says there were nearly 3 and 3 / 4 million men and women between the ages of 60 and 64 working in this country. At the same time the United States Labor Department reported there were between 4 and 5 million persons unemployed. If we could make it possible and worthwhiled for these older persons to retire on a decent benefit it would nearly take care of all the unemployed. Now just let me make a final point. No one has to tell me that not all these young fellows have the skills or the aptitudes to take over all these jobs. So I would like to recommend to our school and university officials; to [...] 2 - our legislators in Congress, in the State, to the county commissioners and to the City Council that they find the money to make available the facilities needed for training. I think you would find the employers, the unions and the public willing to do their part and carry their share. It would mean that the present vocational facilities at Macomber and the University of Toledo would have to be expanded° I read that school officials in 5 counties in this area have gotten together to open a vocational school at the Rossford Erie Depot. What would be wrong with the employers forming a joint committee with the teachers and the labor unions and making up a flexible training program so these youngsters could be able to fill all the openings in the plants and elsewhere. And why not follow a program such as the UAW skilled trades which I directed combining training in the school with that on the job. I would recommend that once a fellow signs up for this training he has to finish the course and can't bid on some higher paid opening which might come up while hews learning. The youngsters today have to learn that it's not the quick or easy buck that counts but the ability and willingness to learn skills or trades that will stick with him a lifetime and give him the chance to get a job anytime, any place while the untrained worker is automated out of a livelihood. I could go on for a lot more but I think these points are important. I am willing to help in this in any way I can [...] . up to the limits of my resources. In closing I think I should say I deeply appreciate your coming and the sentiments that were expressed. I want to assure everyone that I shall continue to make any contribution I can to help people so long as I can draw a breath [...] - 3 -...|$|E

I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit. I would now talk about these in terms of immigrant multiculturalism for immigrant groups and multi-nation federalism for national minorities.
