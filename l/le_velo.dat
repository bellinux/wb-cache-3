25|$|The Dreyfus affair split France {{at the end}} of the 19th century {{over the}} guilt or innocence of a soldier, Alfred Dreyfus, who had been convicted of selling secrets to the Germans. In 1900 Clément-Bayard was one of the leading anti-Dreyfusard industrialists, along with comté Jules-Albert de Dion, who {{cancelled}} all advertising in the Drefusard newspaper <b>Le</b> <b>Vélo</b> and started a rival daily sports paper, L'Auto-Velo. The roots of both the Tour de France cycle race and L'Équipe newspaper, result from Clément's hostile anti-Dreyfusard stance. The Dreyfus affair was eventually concluded with the official exoneration of Dreyfus (as an innocent person who had been framed). With the end of official inquiries it may be said that Clément-Bayard and de Dion had been wrong for a decade.|$|E

2500|$|The Tour de France {{was created}} in 1903. The roots of the Tour de France trace back to the {{emergence}} of two rival sports newspapers in the country. On one hand was <b>Le</b> <b>Vélo,</b> the first and the largest daily sports newspaper in France which sold 80,000 copies a day. On the other was L'Auto, which had been set-up by journalists and business-people including Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Clément and Édouard Michelin in 1899. The rival paper emerged following disagreements over the Dreyfus Affair, a [...] (in which de Dion was implicated) that divided France {{at the end of the}} 19th century over the innocence of Alfred Dreyfus, a French army officer convicted—though later exonerated—of selling military secrets to the Germans. The new newspaper appointed Henri Desgrange as the editor. He was a prominent cyclist and owner with Victor Goddet of the velodrome at the Parc des Princes. De Dion knew him through his cycling reputation, through the books and cycling articles that he had written, and through press articles he had written for the Clément tyre company.|$|E
2500|$|Such was {{the passion}} {{that the first}} Tour created in spectators and riders that Desgrange said the 1904 Tour de France would be the last. Cheating was rife and riders were beaten up by rival fans as they neared {{the top of the}} col de la République, {{sometimes}} called the col du Grand Bois, outside St-Étienne. The leading riders, including the winner Maurice Garin, were disqualified, though it took the Union Vélocipèdique de France until 30 November to make the decision. McGann says the UVF waited so long [...] "...well aware of the passions aroused by the race." [...] Desgrange's opinion of the fighting and cheating showed in the headline of his reaction in L'Auto: THE END. Desgrange's despair did not last. By the following spring he was planning another Tour, longer at 11 stages rather than 6 – and this time all in daylight to make any cheating more obvious. Stages in 1905 began between 3am and 7:30am. The race captured the imagination. L'Auto's circulation rose from 25,000 to 65,000; by 1908 it was a quarter of a million. The Tour returned after its suspension during World War One and continued to grow, with circulation of L'Auto reaching 500,000 by 1923. The record claimed by Desgrange was 854,000 during the 1933 Tour. <b>Le</b> <b>Vélo,</b> meanwhile, went out of business in 1904.|$|E

40|$|A. Morice—Kaolack's Bikes. In Kaolack mopeds {{are used}} as cabs. This {{peculiar}} trade is more organized than it looks at first sight. Its history, since the time when hawkers began to repair and rent old bicycles, has been characterized by tense relations with the local author-ities, together with never-ending internai conflicts: hence the self-imposition of a compelling hierarchy. The drivers pay a daily fee to the owners {{in exchange for the}} right of using the vehicles for money-earning purposes. They, in turn, fre-quently employ 'apprentices' to ensure a maximal use of the bikes. Young 'taxi-men' station themselves around various strategie locations in the city 'garages' where they corne under the authority of elders who are tacitly recognized as spokesmen by the ofncialdom. Enquiries among these tradesmen have evidenced several traits common to a number of so-called 'informai' activities: exploitation of apprentices, functional turnover of juvenile labour force, persisting paternalistic social relationships, structuration effect of the dubious legal status of the trade. Following repeated requests from the motor-cabs, moped taxis have been prohib-ited. One may well wonder whether this prohibition is not more or less con-sciously aiming at reinforcing the precariousness of the apprentices' status as well as the power of elders.

On 19 July 1896 he organised the first Paris marathon and helped found the Automobile Club de France.

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Franck Ribéry to German club Bayern Munich ahead of the 2007–08 season, Valbuena was inserted as his replacement. It is during this season the midfielder acquired the nickname <b>le</b> petit <b>vélo</b> (the small bike), which is a play on Valbuena's size and his parent club's stadium, the Stade Vélodrome. Valbuena started the season off healthy under Gerets and featured primarily as a substitute, but by late August 2007, had become a starter forming partnerships in the midfield with Samir Nasri, Lorik Cana, and Benoît Cheyrou. Valbuena made his UEFA Champions League debut on 18 September 2007 against Turkish club Beşiktaş appearing as a substitute in a 2–0 win. In the team's next group stage match against English club Liverpool at Anfield, Valbuena scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory. The victory over Liverpool {{was the first time}} a French club had ever won at Anfield. Later that month, Valbuena signed a contract extension with Marseille, committing himself to the club until June 2012.|$|R

[...] Romney further commented: [...] "Shooting as usual with cinematographer Alain Marcoen, and in their familiar stamping ground of Seraing, the brothers this time bring a somewhat different, airier look to their locations, more suburban than in the past. Marcoen's camerawork, also, is rather more free-wheeling than the tightly constrained (and often imitated) tightness of The Son." [...] At the 2011 London Film Festival it was among Sight & Sounds 30 recommendations; according to them, [...] "The Dardenne brothers may be the most consistently high-achieving filmmakers of our time - the kings, if you like, of poetic neorealism. Like all their films, <b>Le</b> Gamin au <b>vélo</b> (The Kid with a Bike) is near perfect." [...] Upon its March 2012 UK release, Peter Bradshaw gave it [...] (four stars out of 5) and said it [...] "revives the memory of De Sica's 1948 classic Bicycle Thieves"; it is a [...] "heartfelt, boldly direct film composed in the social-realist key signature of C major, revisiting the film-makers' classic themes of parenthood, trust and love."Conversely, one critic called the film [...] "trite" [...] and its thinking [...] "lazy", while another reviewer called it [...] "formulaic" [...] and [...] "superficial".|$|R

50|$|The 'Dreyfus affair' split French opinion at {{the turn}} of the 20th century, causing passionate and {{physical}} arguments. Pierre Giffard, the Director of <b>Le</b> <b>Velo,</b> was a 'left-wing' 'Dreyfusard' while many of the manufacturers who funded the advertisements were anti-Dreyfusards, especially the Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, owner of the De Dion-Bouton car works. The comte was arrested and spent 15 days in gaol after a melee at the Auteuil horse-race course in 1899, because he had struck the President of France (Émile Loubet) over the head with a walking stick. Giffard's tone of reporting this led to a group of 'anti-Dreyfusards' including de Dion, Adolphe Clément and Édouard Michelin to withdraw advertising. Subsequently, in 1900, they entrusted Henri Desgrange (editor of Paris-Velo or Le Petit Velo) to create the L'Auto-Velo in direct competition to <b>Le</b> <b>Vélo.</b> The deliberate similarity of the names triggered a court case by <b>Le</b> <b>Vélo</b> for infringement of title, which it duly won on January 16, 1903 and thus L'Auto was renamed.|$|E

2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo.

Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|R
