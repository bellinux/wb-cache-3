5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a <b>letter</b> <b>opener</b> Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

Fans were relieved when Justine's reign of terror was put to an end when Carl finished her off with a <b>letter</b> <b>opener.</b> Wyndham was quoted as liking the storyline at first, but after it played out, she stated that {{she wished she had}} never appeared in it.|$|E

25|$|Preparation of pu'erh {{involves}} first separating a well-sized {{portion of}} the compressed tea for brewing. This {{can be done by}} flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration. A pu'erh knife, which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid <b>letter</b> <b>opener,</b> is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as tuocha or mushroom pu'erh are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling of the cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.|$|E

Before attempting to disconnect Alistair's life support, Liz confesses to Julian {{that she was the}} one who shot him in 2002. She tells Julian that he did not rape her, and that it was actually Alistair. Julian stops Liz from killing Alistair by encouraging her to let go of her hatred in order to find love in the future. She agrees to abandon her plans for revenge against Eve and Alistair in order to find a new direction for her life and leaves Harmony. In his comatose state, Alistair swears revenge against Liz.

5000|$|This stunt {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{developed}} by renowned magician and sideshow performer Melvin Burkhart (1907-2001) after his nose was broken in a boxing bout and he became fascinated by the way that the doctors inserted instruments into his nose.

5000|$|Bosse {{also turned}} {{his efforts to}} small, {{everyday}} items such as <b>letter</b> <b>openers,</b> keyrings, corkscrews, and pencil holders, all of which bear his distinctive [...] "black and gold" [...] look. A number of Bosse’s designs began to gain widespread popularity internationally, particularly his brass hedgehog ashtrays and hand-shaped bowls. But the designs' success led to forgeries popping up worldwide. His hedgehog ashtrays were reproduced by many forgers in various countries and {{with varying degrees of}} precision. To protect his designs, he engaged in court battles which would last {{the rest of his life}} and deplete most of his money. Because of these cases, he is considered to be a seminal figure relating to modern copyright law for designer goods.|$|R

There are accounts of good quality stainless steel nihontō, however, these are rare at best. Some replica nihontō {{have been used in}} modern-day armed robberies, which helped contribute to the enactment of a ban on sale, import and hire of samurai swords in the UK. As a part of marketing, modern ahistoric blade styles and material properties are often stated as traditional and genuine, promulgating disinformation.|$|R

"The letters {{accompanying}} the anthrax read like {{the work of}} a jihadist, suggesting that their author was an Arab extremist—or someone masquerading as one—yet also advised recipients to take antibiotics, implying that whoever had mailed them never really intended to harm anyone." [...] Experts have suggested that the anthrax mailings included a number of indications that the mailer was trying to avoid harming anyone with his warning letters. Examples: (1) None of the intended recipients of the letters were infected. (2) The seams {{on the backs of the}} envelopes were taped over as if to make certain the powders couldn't escape through open seams. (3) The letters were folded with the [...] "pharmaceutical fold", which was used for centuries to safely contain and transport doses of powdered medicines (and currently to safely hold trace evidence). (4) The media letters provided [...] "medical advice": [...] "TAKE PENACILIN NOW." [...] (5) The senate letters informed the recipient that the powder was anthrax: [...] "WE HAVE THIS ANTHRAX."

5000|$|The {{best known}} wood item {{is a kind}} of walking cane which is made in the town of San Esteban Tizatlan. Despite the origin, these canes are {{generally}} known as the [...] "walking canes of Apizaco" [...] because the arrival of the railroad to this town allowed the ir marketing in the larger city, popularizing them. Characteristic of these canes is the carving, which is complemented by different colors of wood and varnish and sometimes burning to add decorative motifs, which are often of pre Hispanic origin. Today, about eighty families depending on woodworking for a living, but the popularity of the canes has made the tlaxistle tree (Amelanchier denticulata), from which they are traditionally made, to become endangered. This has prompted a switch to sabine (sp.Juniperus) wood, but it is not as flexible and requires that the head be worked separately from the body. In addition to the canes, the town makes wooden bats, decorated in a similar fashion, and items of cedar and ayacahuite such as toys, chess sets, <b>letter</b> <b>openers,</b> furniture and religious figures for altars. Another important item is drum called teponaxtle, made from a hollowed log.|$|R

Erica tells Dimitri what happened all those years ago. This is the first time she told anyone besides Eric Kane and she is grateful he does not say she deserved it like her father did when she told him.

60|$|She {{dropped the}} <b>letter</b> <b>opener</b> and stood silent, motionless, {{awaiting}} his approach--a pose so eloquent {{of the sense}} of fatality strong in her as to strike him with apprehension, unused though he was to the appraisal of inner values. He read, darkly, something of this mystery in her eyes as they were slowly raised to his, he felt afraid; he was swept again by those unwonted emotions of pity and tenderness--but when she turned away her head and he saw the bright spot of colour growing in her cheek, spreading to her temple, suffusing her throat, when he touched the soft contour of her arm, his passion conquered.... Still he was acutely conscious of a resistance within her--not as before, physically directed against him, but repudiating her own desire. She became limp in his arms, though making no attempt to escape, and he knew that the essential self of her he craved still evaded and defied him. And he clung to her the more desperately--as though by crushing her peradventure he might capture it.|$|E

50|$|More {{than any}} other {{taxidermist}} of his age, Rowland Ward became known for making items from skins, horns, and skulls {{that could be used}} in the home, either for practical purposes or as decorations. Known as Victorian or Edwardian “animal furniture,” these items included a “dumbwaiter” in the form of a mounted bear standing up straight and holding a silver tray on which glasses could be placed; inkwells made from horse hoofs; and <b>letter</b> <b>openers</b> with the blade made from ivory, the handle made of a fox’s paw, and the two connected with an elegant silver sleeve. Then there were liquor cabinets made from elephants’ feet; stuffed birds that acted as lamp stands, and items that would seem very odd in the twenty-first century but were highly fashionable and desirable in Victorian England. In addition, Rowland Ward Ltd. was a great supplier of glass cabinets filled with colourful mounted birds; these were all the rage as home decorations at the time. Because rowing on the Thames was such a fashionable activity during Ward’s lifetime, the company also sold canoes imported from Canada. It appears that Rowland Ward Ltd. made a great deal of money from his ventures. Rowland Ward’s mounted heads and glass bird boxes are very collectible today in England, with several auction houses offering specialised sales each year.|$|R
