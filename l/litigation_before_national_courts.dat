In Part III, the Note will examine the confidentiality requirement imposed by the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and {{will discuss the}} arguments for and against keeping arbitral proceedings secret. In light of this examination and discussion, the Note will argue that the ICSID tribunal correctly denied injunctive relief to Indonesia, although the denial may be inconsistent with the spirit of confidentiality traditionally associated with arbitral proceedings. This Note will conclude by recommending that article 48 (5) of the ICSID Convention be changed to reflect a presumption against confidentiality, and in favor of the publication of awards...|$|E
40|$|The Acquired Rights Directive {{has been}} the subject of much <b>litigation</b> <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> and the Court of Justice of the European Union since it was adopted in 1977.

Th e CJEU’s decision in Case C- 426 / 11 Alemo-Herron v Parkwood Leisure Ltd, Judgment of 18 July 2013, however, marks a signifi cant shift in the CJEU’s approach to the Directive from one which seeks to protect employment rights in the case of a transfer to one which requires a balance to be struck between the interests of the transferee and the employee. In doing so, the judgment has the potential to have serious ramifi cations for British and European labour law...|$|E

50|$|Patents having {{effect in}} most European {{states may be}} {{obtained}} either nationally, via national patent offices, or via a centralised patent prosecution process at the European Patent Office (EPO). The EPO is a public international organisation established by the European Patent Convention. The EPO is not a European Union or a Council of Europe institution. A patent granted by the EPO {{does not lead to}} a single European patent enforceable before one single court, but rather to a bundle of essentially independent national European patents enforceable <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> according to different national legislations and procedures.

50|$|Europe {{does not}} {{comprise}} a unitary patent system. European patent law is instead {{characterized by the}} coexistence of national patent systems, and thus national patent offices, and a European patent system associated with the European Patent Convention (EPC), {{in the context of}} which the European Patent Office (EPO) grants European patents through a central prosecution procedure. Enforcement of European patents are conducted and decided at a <b>national</b> level, i.e. <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> The patent offices in Europe therefore include, on the one hand, the plurality of national patent offices and, on the other hand, the European Patent Office.

Jessup thought that transnational law includes “all law which regulates actions or events that transcend national frontiers. ” 1 Within this umbrella definition of transnational law, one can discern an intertwining {{of public and private}} law norms and the blurring of the distinctions between public international law and private international law. This chapter considers an area which brings into sharp relief the interplay between these two areas of law. The focus is on the situation where victims of breaches of fundamental human rights pursue civil claims against the foreign perpetrator states <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> The claim would be a private international law claim, usually one sounding in tort. However, in adjudging such a claim, the <b>national</b> <b>court</b> will have to consider public international law principles, most notably, the doctrine of state immunity...|$|R

This paper provides an analysis of the new Government Procurement Agreement that was negotiated between a subset of GATT members in the Uruguay Round, focusing in particular on the expansion of coverage to services and strengthening of enforcement mechanisms. The latter represent an innovation by allowing for private parties to invoke the Agreement <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> The question of why membership of the Agreement remains limited is explored. Pursuit of tariffication is suggested as an avenue through which the Agreement might be expanded to cover all WTO Members. Government Procurement; Multilateral Agreements; Trade Policy...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine a}} central {{assumption}} of the neo-functionalist theory of European integration empirically: that interest groups use the preliminary reference system strategically in order to pursue their policy interests and to push European integration further. Focusing on EU environmental policy, I first analyse all preliminary references in this field and show that the pattern found cannot be explained by current theories. I then report the findings of expert interviews {{on the use of}} the preliminary reference system carried out with French, German and Dutch environmental organisations that have litigated <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> to enforce the Natura 2000 Directives. I show that there is no evidence that environmental organisations use the preliminary reference system in a way suggested by neo-functionalist theory...|$|R
50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} Van Duyn could be denied entry {{if it was}} for reasons related to her {{personal}} conduct, as outlined in the Directive 64/22/EEC. TEEC article 48 was directly effective, even though {{the application of the}} provision was 'subject to judicial control'. Furthermore, the Directive was directly effective against the UK government. First, it would be incompatible with the binding effect of Directives to exclude the possibility of direct effect. Second, the practical efficacy of the Directive would be reduced unless individuals could invoke them <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> Third, because the ECJ has jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings under TFEU article 267 (then TEEC article 177) on 'acts of the institutions... of the Union' this implied all acts should be directly effective.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{political}} {{progress of the}} Communities was hesitant in the 1960s, this was a fertile period for European legal integration. Many of the foundational legal doctrines of the Court of Justice were first established in landmark decisions during the 1960s and 1970s, above all in the Van Gend en Loos decision of 1963 that declared the [...] "direct effect" [...] of European law, that is to say, its enforceability <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> by private parties. Other landmark decisions during this period included Costa v ENEL, which established the supremacy of European law over national law and the [...] "Dairy Products" [...] decision, which declared that general international law principles of reciprocity and retaliation were prohibited within the European Community.|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} reasons why private enforcement of E. U. competition law remains underdeveloped in Europe. The main reason is perhaps {{that it is}} not regulated by E.

A system that creates optimal conditions for individuals to challenge infringements of competition rules <b>before</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> ensures a high level of compliance. It is therefore no surprise that the European Commission (2 ̆ 2 Commission 2 ̆ 2) is keen to see the general use of private enforcement, and in particular of actions for damages, in Europe increase. This paper focuses on one particular aspect of private enforcement of competition law in the European Union, namely actions for damages, and compares the situation in the European Union with that of the United States...|$|R
