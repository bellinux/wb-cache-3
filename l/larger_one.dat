5|$|The {{rooms on}} {{the north and east}} sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> above the great chamber. The <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of the}} private staircase.|$|E
5|$|A soap bubble forms a sphere, {{a surface}} with minimal area — the {{smallest}} possible surface {{area for the}} volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the <b>larger</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

25|$|Smaller turbochargers {{have less}} turbo lag than <b>larger</b> <b>ones,</b> so often two small turbochargers are {{used instead of}} <b>one</b> <b>large</b> <b>one.</b> This {{configuration}} is popular in engines over 2,500 CCs and in V-shape or boxer engines.|$|R
50|$|Intrusions {{from the}} {{formation}} of the Alps themselves are relatively rare. The <b>largest</b> <b>ones</b> can be found along the Periadriatic seam, the <b>largest</b> <b>one</b> is the Adamello granite. In the Penninic nappes migmatites and small melts can be found.|$|R
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the <b>larger</b> <b>one,</b> with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E

5|$|In January 1985, {{production}} of Ran was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned {{to finish his}} film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> abroad and, {{as he had done}} with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.|$|E

Determined to save Merry, the Doctor and Clara come face-to-face with the parasite of Akhaten, who requires memories, stories, and items of sentimental value.|$|E
5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E

5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width at the back, so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> at the back.|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E

5|$|Non-conformist {{meetings}} {{took place}} on Hen Lane (later Jermyn Street) from about 1776. The Congregationalists who met there constructed a chapel on Southgate in 1867–68; in 1972, it became Sleaford Reformed Church. Wesleyans first met in the 1790s {{at the house of}} Thomas Fawcett on Westgate. They built a chapel nearby in 1802, which was replaced in 1823; it housed the congregation until 1848 when a <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> was built on North Street. It was demolished and replaced by another on the same site in 1972. A Baptist chapel was built in Old Sleaford in 1811 to house a congregation of 250, it served the Strict Baptists until possibly the mid-20th century. The premises have been converted into a house. A Wesleyan Reform Methodist chapel opened in West Banks in 1864, but since 1896 has been occupied by the Salvation Army.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the kitchen is the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E
5|$|St Mary Redcliffe is {{cruciform}} in plan, with {{a chapel}} extending {{to the east}} of the chancel, and a large 13th-century tower placed asymmetrically {{to the north of the}} west front. The tower was added to the building in the 13th century. It has broad angle buttresses and Y tracery to the windows. The bell stage has ogee gables and polygonal corner pinnacles. After the collapse of the original spire in 1446 it remained truncated until the 1870s when George Godwin rebuilt it. The nave, chancel and choir are vaulted with richly decorated with bosses in a variety of styles. The Lady Chapel has a star vault. The transepts has large pointed spandrels and a blind arcade with mullions descending from the clerestory windows. Beneath the Lady Chapel is a small crypt, with a <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> beneath the transept of three by two bays.|$|E

5|$|The absolutist {{restoration}} in Spain and {{the growing}} influence of Artigas generated a political crisis in Buenos Aires, forcing Posadas to resign. Alvear became the new Supreme Director, but had to resign after three months. San Martín's plan was complicated as well by the Disaster of Rancagua, a royalist victory that restored absolutism in Chile, ending the Patria Vieja period. San Martín initially proposed a regular-sized army, simply to reinforce Chile, but changed to propose a <b>larger</b> <b>one,</b> to liberate the country from the occupation. Chileans Bernardo O'Higgins, José Miguel Carrera, Luis Carrera and Manuel Rodríguez, {{the leaders of the}} deposed Chilean rule, sought refugee in Cuyo, along with their armies. O'Higgins and Rodríguez were well received, but the Carrera brothers intended to act as a government in exile. They ignored the local laws of Cuyo, and their soldiers committed acts of vandalism. San Martín imprisoned them and sent them to Buenos Aires. They proposed a plan to liberate Chile, different to the one outlined by San Martín, who rejected it as impractical. This initiated a rivalry between the Carrera and San Martín.|$|E
5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the <b>larger</b> <b>one.</b> From late October to December 1941, the ghetto {{was subject to}} Aktions, selections of people for deportation and execution in Ponary. Gens was afraid that {{the actions of the}} Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.|$|E
5|$|Halsey's message reached Wilkinson on Guadalcanal on 15 March, {{by which}} time ships were already loading for the Kavieng operation, which had {{originally}} been scheduled for 18 March. This operation {{was to have been}} carried out by Major General Roy S. Geiger's I Amphibious Corps, with the 40th Infantry Division and 3rd Marine Division, reinforced by the 4th Marines. For Emirau, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Shapley's 4th Marines would be sufficient, reinforced by Company C, 3rd Amphibian Tractor Battalion; Company A (Medium), 3rd Tank Battalion, equipped with M4 Sherman tanks; a company of pioneers from the 2nd Battalion, 19th Marines; signals, ordnance and motor transport detachments; and a composite anti-aircraft battery of the 14th Defense Battalion. This would be the first operation for the 4th Marines, which had been reformed on 1 February 1944 from four battalions of Marine Raiders, the original 4th Marines having been destroyed in the Battle of Corregidor. Commodore Lawrence F. Reifsnider was appointed to command the amphibious operation. Brigadier General Alfred H. Noble, the Assistant Division Commander of the 3d Marine Division would command the expeditionary troops. Noble, who was also slated to become island commander, was given a small staff created from I Amphibious Corps and 3rd Marine Division personnel. An air command was organized for Emirau under Colonel William L. McKittrick from the <b>larger</b> <b>one</b> intended for the Kavieng operation.|$|E
