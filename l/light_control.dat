Following World War II, the naval {{facility was}} acquired by RCA. RCA Lancaster, as it became known, was the base for development and production of commercial television products.

25|$|A {{range of}} options have been {{proposed}} as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where <b>light</b> <b>control</b> is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to cloacal cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require <b>light</b> <b>control</b> inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E

In the tunnels, only one tram can operate in each direction; this is regulated by lights and an automatic Train Protection system. Signaling uses the German BOStrab system, not traditional Norwegian light signals.

2500|$|In 2011 {{the display}} {{had a major}} overhaul, all the lights were swapped out for LED lights {{including}} all the ropelight. During this overhaul the lighting control was updated to a [...] "state of the art" [...] entertainment lighting system using <b>light</b> <b>control</b> boards from the company [...] This means all the previously choreographed dancing sequences had to be redone. While all these updates the production team wanted to change one more major element to the display, the canopy. [...] The canopy in previous years was all red and separated in only 8 circuits, 4 on each side; now each light has 3 completely controllable LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) giving the canopy an almost video-like appearance. Now the canopy has 21,600 pixels capable of over 16 million colors.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, {{there is quite a}} bit of roiling darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and <b>light,</b> <b>control</b> of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (do they really have any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne into the middle of next week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, a neatly segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E

40|$|Tangible {{lighting}} controls' {{is used as}} {{an umbrella}} term to describe <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> systems {{that are easy to}} understand and pleasurable to use by end-users. The crucial question posed is, {{what is the nature of}} interface designs sought by end-users for maximising interaction with <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> systems? The manner in which this question is posed implies a fundamental assumption that improved usability and end-user experience are the primary goals. The concept of end-user understanding of <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> interfaces is proposed as a basis for improving the usability and end-user experience of <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> interfaces. Usability engineering methods involving survey research, experimental mock-ups and prototyping have been used to enable end-users to design and evaluate <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> interfaces. The essential difference is to include end-users' point of view about ease of understanding control functions and pleasure of performing control tasks along with a technical point of view about meeting required standards. Manufacturers' claims about the effectiveness of existing <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> interfaces are challenged, and an entirely different way of thinking about interface design is revealed. Such a change of thinking may be seen as a new framework for improved designs of <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> interfaces as well as evaluation of their usability and end-user experience...|$|R
