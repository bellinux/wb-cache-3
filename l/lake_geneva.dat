5|$|The bell {{remained}} submerged {{for over}} 40 years before a wealthy resident of <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva</b> decided to surface the bell in 1960. The resident located the bell, and surfaced it with great difficulty, intent {{on making the}} future Illinois Freedom Bell {{the focal point of}} his new home. After the bell was salvaged he decided it did not suit his purposes. A young farmer from Johnsburg purchased the bell, and it was again kept in storage.|$|E
5|$|Caesar's policy {{aimed at}} {{controlling}} the territory {{west of the}} Jura and Rhine, {{as well as at}} blocking the potential incursion routes from the East along the Jura. The Raetians, described as savage warriors by Strabo, continued to launch incursions into the Swiss Plateau and also had to be contained. To that end, Caesar charged the Helvetii and the Rauraci with defending their territory and established two colonies of veterans – one, the Colonia Julia Equestris (now Nyon) on the shores of <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva</b> and the other through Lucius Munatius Plancus in northwestern Switzerland, preceding the larger Augusta Raurica founded by Augustus in around 6AD.|$|E
5|$|Many Swiss also follow {{ice hockey}} and support {{one of the}} 12 teams of the National League, {{which is the most}} {{attended}} league in Europe. In 2009, Switzerland hosted the IIHF World Championship for the 10th time. It also became World Vice-Champion in 2013. The numerous lakes make Switzerland an attractive place for sailing. The largest, <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva,</b> is the home of the sailing team Alinghi which was the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007. Tennis has become an increasingly popular sport, and Swiss players such as Martina Hingis, Roger Federer, and most recently, Stanislas Wawrinka have won multiple Grand Slams.|$|E

5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) ran {{off with}} Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, accompanied by Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister. After six weeks of travelling, they returned to England but continued to live together. Mary returned pregnant with Percy's child, but their infant daughter died soon after her premature birth. Percy was alienated from his family and received little financial support from them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had a second child, William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra. The group spent the summer of 1817 with Byron at <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva,</b> where Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. That fall, Percy's wife, Harriet, committed suicide, and in December Percy and Mary were married. In September 1817, Mary and Percy had another child, Clara.|$|E
5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva.</b> She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell {{is located}} in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. The bell was created for a church in <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva,</b> Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and the bell sank {{to the bottom of the}} lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The family's {{first home}} in exile was Wartegg Castle in Rorschach, Switzerland, a {{property}} {{owned by the}} Bourbon-Parmas. However, the Swiss authorities, worried about the implication of the Habsburgs living near the Austrian border, compelled them {{to move to the}} western part of the country. The next month, therefore, found them moving to Villa Prangins, near <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva,</b> where they resumed a quiet family life. This abruptly ended in March 1920 when, after a period of instability in Hungary, Miklós Horthy was elected regent. Charles was still technically King (as Charles IV) but Horthy sent an emissary to Prangins advising him not to go to Hungary until the situation had calmed. After the Trianon Treaty Horthy's ambition soon grew. Charles became concerned and requested the help of Colonel Strutt to get him into Hungary. Charles twice attempted to regain control, once in March 1921 and again in October 1921. Both attempts failed, despite Zita's staunch support (she insisted on travelling with him on the final dramatic train journey to Budapest).|$|E
5|$|During a thunderstorm, {{glass and}} {{porcelain}} items at Marlinspike Hall shatter inexplicably. Insurance salesman Jolyon Wagg {{arrives at the}} house, annoying Captain Haddock. Gunshots are heard in the Hall's grounds, and Tintin and Haddock discover a wounded man with a foreign accent who soon disappears. The next morning, Professor Calculus leaves for Geneva to attend a conference on nuclear physics. Tintin and Haddock use the opportunity to investigate Calculus' laboratory, there discovering that his experiments {{were responsible for the}} glass-shattering of the previous night. While exploring, they are attacked by a stranger, who then escapes; fearing that Calculus is in danger, Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy head for Geneva. In Geneva, they learn that Calculus has gone to Nyon to meet Professor Topolino, an expert in ultrasonics. The group travel there in a taxi, but their car is attacked by two men in another car, who force the taxi into <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva.</b> Surviving the attack, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy continue to Nyon, where they find Topolino bound and gagged in his cellar. As Tintin questions the professor, the house blows up, but they all survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} nevertheless sent Feynman to Geneva for the September 1958 Atoms for Peace Conference. On {{the beach}} on <b>Lake</b> <b>Geneva,</b> he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from Ripponden, Yorkshire, {{and working in}} Switzerland as an au pair. Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with his Albert Einstein Award medal and, {{on the advice of}} an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and blackmailed him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 a week to be his live-in maid. That this sort of behavior was illegal was not overlooked; Feynman had a friend, Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but eventually decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in Altadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men but Feynman proposed in the spring of 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in Baja California, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{distribution}} of Mysis diluviana comprises the Great Lakes of North America, {{and many other}} coldwater lakes across Canada and in northern parts of the United States, including Wisconsin (e.g. Green Lake, Trout <b>Lake,</b> and <b>Geneva</b> <b>Lake)</b> and northern New York State (e.g. Finger Lakes, Lake Champlain).

It lay on important trade routes leading from the Alpine passes of the Great St Bernard and Simplon along its lakeside paths northwards into Germany and westward into France.|$|R
