5|$|Each clan has {{specific}} Disciplines, {{which can}} be used in combat and to create approaches to quests. Although some powers overlap clans, no two clans share the same three Disciplines. More physical vampires can enhance themselves to become fast and lethal killers or summon spirit allies to attack their foes; others can mentally dominate their targets to force their cooperation or render themselves invisible to hide from detection; and others can boil their opponent's blood from afar. Some Disciplines, such as Auspex (which boosts perception, highlighting other characters' auras through obstacles) and Blood Buff (which temporarily upgrades strength, dexterity, stamina and lockpicking), are common to all vampires. Several abilities can be active at the same time. Blood is a primary currency in Bloodlines, used to activate Disciplines and abilities. It is drained with each use, and can be replenished by drinking from rats, visiting blood banks or drinking from humans by attacking or seducing them; the player can feed on enemies during combat. Drinking from innocents for too <b>long</b> <b>can</b> kill them, costing a character humanity points.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for Becker muscular {{dystrophy}} yet. Treatment {{is aimed at}} control of symptoms to maximize {{the quality of life}} which can be measured by specific questionnaires. Activity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bed rest) or sitting down for too <b>long</b> <b>can</b> worsen the muscle disease. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength.

The stem fibers resemble jute and can be used to produce raw textiles. The leaf fibers can be used as an alternative to cotton and linen in clothing. The yield of leaf fiber is 30 to 40 percent and Typha glauca can produce 7 to 10 tons per hectare annually.|$|E

In later years, Acharya's influence on the institute saw it adopts a number of statutes in 1947 and subsequently the institute adopted the name of Libertarian Socialist Institute. His views on economic matters were profound and in 1951, Free Society Group of Chicago published his work How <b>Long</b> <b>Can</b> Capitalism Survive? in 1951.

25|$|Other methods address {{different}} types of DNA modifications using the MinION platform. Stoiber et al examined 4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA), along with 5mC, and also created a software to directly visualize the raw MinION data in human-friendly way. Here they found that in E. coli, which has a known methylome, event windows of 5 base pairs <b>long</b> <b>can</b> be used to divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals. A straightforward Mann-Whitney U test can detect modified portions of the E. coli sequence, as well as further split the modifications into 4mC, 6mA or 5mC regions.|$|E
25|$|Fractionation regimens are individualised between {{different}} radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2Gy per day, {{five days a}} week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too <b>long</b> <b>can</b> allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within {{a certain amount of}} time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.|$|E
25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too <b>long</b> <b>can</b> exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, {{especially if you are}} trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E

By the early 1980s the brewery had beer production volumes of around 400,000 barrels per annum and employed around 600 people. At this time, the brewery {{was described as}} [...] "wonderfully traditional" [...] by Roger Protz and had open fermentation vessels, mash tuns and copper brewing vessels.

500|$|The Cestida ("belt animals") are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals, {{with the}} mouth and aboral organ aligned {{in the middle of}} {{opposite}} edges of the ribbon.

There are two types in the breed, distinguished by their coats; one is long-coated and the other smooth-coated. The smooth-coated dog has a short, shiny, close-lying coat. The long-coated variety has a longer coat and profuse feathering in the ears, legs and tail. The feathering or [...] "fringe" [...] on the ears is usually 3 to 5cm <b>long,</b> <b>can</b> be straight or with a slight wave.

500|$|The episode {{received}} consistently positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "One of the strengths of 'Monday' is in showing us Scully's evolution and how her experiences with Mulder allow her to embrace, albeit reluctantly, ideas that are not grounded in science." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the sixth season and wrote, [...] "Time loops, if dragged on for too <b>long,</b> <b>can</b> become tedious, but in small doses they can be hilariously funny or achingly poignant. This episode is definitely the latter, as the downtrodden girlfriend of a bank robber is forced to witness the deaths of her boyfriend, Mulder, Scully and {{a large group of}} innocent people die over and over again until finally she breaks the loop by dying herself [...] The onus of saving everyone being largely on the shoulders of an unknown woman effectively brings in a change of pace and a welcome breath of fresh air." [...] Earl Cressey from DVD Talk called [...] "Monday" [...] one of the [...] "highlights of season six." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "a script which balances humor, structural brilliance, and compassion in equal measure." [...] Handlen compared and contrasted the episode to Groundhog Day, noting that, while both feature a character who is able to restart a day, in [...] "Monday", the characters have the benefit of free will and can change factors: [...] "Every Monday to her has certain basic requirements: boyfriend with bomb, bank robbery, the FBI agents [...] and the earth-shattering Kaboom. Aside from that, nothing is certain." [...] Handlen concluded that the episode managed to be both [...] "a very funny hour", as well as possess serious [...] "sadness".|$|E
