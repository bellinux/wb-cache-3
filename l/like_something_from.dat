They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the game began {{in the summer of}} 2002, when Sammy Studios' first internal development team, informally called [...] "Team 1", decided to [...] "bring a refreshing theme to a genre riddled with the stereotypical sci-fi, fantasy, and military themes," [...] an idea soon approved by the Sammy Corporation president Hajime Satomi. The original game concept was not very dark and the vampires [...] "felt more like a cartoon property". In the early derivatives of the project, the game [...] "looked more <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> Pixar" [...] and its protagonist was supposed to be Chaz Bartlett, a [...] "vaguely bumbling sort of comic relief character", described as an [...] "Eastern dude who was a card cheat" [...] similar to Bret Maverick.|$|E
500|$|Christina Aguilera. Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani {{said the}} song [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> Michael Jackson's last studio album as sung by Christina Aguilera...that the closest {{she gets to}} another human being {{involves}} being tied up and bitten is revealing." [...] Blogcritics' Clayton Perry said [...] "Teeth", along with the tracks [...] "Monster" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "thump harder than anything she's released thus far". In his review for Consequence of Sound, Tony Hardy describes the song as a [...] "repetitive chant which gets its point across in the first verse, rendering {{the rest of it}} almost redundant". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said [...] "Teeth" [...] is [...] "the most sonically intriguing thing GaGa's put her name to, an ode to rough sex conducted over an intense, tribal production that recalls Cher's 'Half Breed' and Fleetwood Mac's 'Tusk'." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed as}} if Cedric's words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had he uttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in the {{garments}} of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and <b>like</b> <b>something</b> arisen <b>from</b> the dead! [59] ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{reviewer}} for Next Generation {{opined that}} the game has [...] "stunning" [...] graphics, but a plot which [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> taken <b>from</b> a second-rate sci-fi novel" [...] and repetitive, minimally interactive rail shooter gameplay. He gave it two out of five stars.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Country Universe reviewer Kevin John Coyne gave the song a D rating, saying [...] "empty barrels {{make the most}} noise." [...] Juli Thanki of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-down rating, saying that the song [...] "sounded <b>like</b> <b>something</b> stolen <b>from</b> Jason Aldean’s recycle bin." ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{very large}} Brutalist {{building}} at Government Center, less prominently located and thus {{less well known}} than City Hall, is the Government Service Center, designed by architect Paul Rudolph. The building is unfinished as the tall central tower in the original plan was never built. In the mid-1990s, the adjacent space {{was filled with the}} Edward W. Brooke Courthouse, which houses a division of the Boston Municipal Court. This irregularly shaped, sloping lot was the last parcel to be developed of the Government Center urban renewal plan; in the interim the space was used as surface parking. [...] In a 2014 article, architectural historian Timothy M. Rohan praised the building for having [...] "a wondrous interior courtyard <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> baroque Rome, a space that even in its incomplete and neglected state contrasts sharply with nearby City Hall and its alienating plaza." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{was engaged}} {{for a time}} in the late 1950s to Henriette von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm. Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to {{interview}} Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson. Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were [...] "killing me with cream". Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry. Lee had met him some years before whilst filming Tales of Hans Anderson, where he received his blessing. However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement. He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she [...] "deserved better" [...] than being [...] "pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor". She understood, and they called the wedding off.|$|E

"Why, it is {{past her}} time--even her time," [...] said Lady Penelope--"dinner was kept back half an hour, and our poor invalids were famishing, {{as you may}} see by the deeds they have done since.--But Clara is an odd creature, and if she took it into her head to come hither at this moment, hither she would come--she is very whimsical.--Many people think her handsome--but she looks so <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> another world, that she makes me always think of Mat Lewis's Spectre Lady." ...|$|E
60|$|Pan leaped like a tiger {{and struck}} Hardman a terrible blow in the face. <b>Like</b> <b>something</b> thrown <b>from</b> a {{catapult}} {{he went into}} the crowd next the bar, and despite this barrier and the hands grasping at his flying arms he crashed to the floor. But before he fell Pan had leaped back in the same position he had held in front of Matthews.|$|R
5000|$|Vincent Canby of the New York Times was not impressed: [...] "(It) is a big, {{expensive}} Western that doesn't contain {{one moment}} {{that might be}} called genuine. In {{spite of all the}} care, the money and the hardships that apparently went into its production, the movie looks prefabricated, <b>like</b> <b>something</b> assembled <b>from</b> other people's earlier, better inspirations." [...] Canby did find the cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. to be [...] "spectacularly beautiful." ...|$|R

60|$|He was {{received}} there with much obsequiousness, and was plainly a great authority there. Christina, weary and frightened, descended from her mule, and was put {{under the protection}} of a wild, rough- looking peasant woman, who stared at her <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> another world, but at length showed her a nook behind a mud partition, where she could spread her mantle, and at least lie down, and tell her beads unseen, if she could not sleep in the stifling, smoky atmosphere, amid the sounds of carousal among her father and his fellows.|$|E
60|$|Delicious sounds! {{those little}} bright-eyed things That float about {{the air on}} azure wings, Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang Of {{clattering}} hoofs; into the court he sprang, Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain, Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein; While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss, What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand! How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann'd! Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone, While whisperings of affection Made him delay to let their tender feet Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent: And whether there were tears of languishment, Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses, He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye All the soft luxury That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand, Fair as some wonder out of fairy land, Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers: And this he fondled with his happy cheek As if for joy he would no further seek; When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond Came to his ear, <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> beyond His present being: so he gently drew His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new, From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending, Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending; While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd; A hand that from the world's bleak promontory Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.|$|E
5000|$|Publishers Weekly {{called the}} novel a [...] "smart and {{surprisingly}} serious debut", noted its [...] "sweeping narrative", and classified it as [...] "a novel as entertaining {{as it is}} thought provoking, <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the imagination of a borscht belt H.G. Wells." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nature Boy" [...] is so otherworldly in its {{melody and}} lyric that {{any number of}} interpretations over the decades, from Nat Cole's to Alex Chilton's, {{have never been able}} to make it ordinary. It sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> that, <b>from</b> the minute it was written, existed out of time and place—all {{thousand}} and one Arabian Nights compressed into two and a half minutes as mediated by a cracked Mojave Debussy slugging down the last of the absinthe from his canteen.|$|R

5000|$|Sports Illustrated {{photographer}} Walter Iooss recalled watching Zimmerman edit {{photographs of}} basketball player Wilt Chamberlain in 1961. “It {{was the first}} time a photojournalist had placed a camera above the rim of a basket…it was <b>like</b> looking at <b>something</b> <b>from</b> another planet. It had never been done before. No one had seen the game from there.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Arwulf stating: [...] "anyone else putting {{on such a}} show would {{run the risk of}} {{sounding}} foolish, Hibbler had so much class mingled with chutzpah that each performance feels <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> an impossible or imaginary jazz/lieder recital".|$|E
5000|$|Actor Patrick Troughton was reputedly {{particularly}} {{unhappy about}} the production. He {{is reported to}} have described the show as having [...] "ridiculous costumes and make-up of the fish people". Producer Innes Lloyd appeared to concur, admitting [...] "it did look <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> a '50s American 'B' movie".|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} a product like the Scanadu Scout {{occurred}} to CEO Walter De Brouwer in 2003 after his five-year-old son fell about 40 feet and lapsed into a coma for 11 weeks. De Brouwer learned that none of his son’s various health data was being consolidated for collective analysis. “To someone from the tech world, this was <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the dinosaur age,” he told The New York Times.|$|E

5000|$|Zenith {{returned}} for Phase IV in 1992 but Morrison's attention was elsewhere: [...] "I'd moved on and was more {{excited by the}} possibilities of working with American superheroes. By 1992, Zenith seemed <b>like</b> <b>something</b> dragged up <b>from</b> my past." [...] However, {{that does not mean}} he thinks any less of the story: [...] "I like a lot of things I write under duress. I actually really like the last book of Zenith. I'm very fond of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Journalist David Neiwert, {{wrote in}} The American Prospect that Goldberghas drawn {{a kind of}} history in absurdly broad and comically wrongheaded strokes. It is not just history done badly, or mere revisionism. It's a {{caricature}} of reality, <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> a comic-book alternative universe: Bizarro history. ... Goldberg isn't content to simply create an oxymoron; this entire enterprise, in fact, is classic Newspeak. ... Along the way, he grotesquely misrepresents the state of academia regarding the study of fascism...|$|E
5000|$|Robert Taylor at AllMusic gave Guitar Dominance! 1.5 stars out of 5, {{calling it}} [...] "a rather mediocre debut" [...] {{and that it}} [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the '80s rather than the '90s." [...] Regarding Stump's guitar work, he said [...] "What Stump lacks in {{originality}} he makes up for in technique, but his blatant purloining of Yngwie Malmsteen's style and licks is embarrassing and unnecessary." [...] The album's production values were also criticized as lackluster.|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot {{criticized the}} game's {{graphics}} and audio, writing, [...] "The visual presentation in GT Pro Series looks <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the Nintendo 64 era, {{and the sound}} isn't any better." [...] IGN complimented the gameplay, stating, [...] "GT Pro Series feels like a quick cash-out title, and Wii players deserve better." [...] Eurogamer pointed out how the game shows serious problems for any future serious racers on the Wii, while commenting that the game itself was [...] "absolutely, unequivocally, shockingly awful." ...|$|E

5000|$|A firm {{supporter}} of the Soviet Union, McShane visited Russia in 1932. He was shocked {{by some of the}} things he saw there, particularly the working conditions in a coal mine in the Donbas region, which he described as being <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the previous century. He met a young American journalist who had come to the USSR as a firm supporter, but had become disillusioned, as [...] "people kept disappearing...and no-one asked any questions". McShane remembered later that his faith in the Soviet Union remained strong, but he had his first doubts after the trip.|$|E
5000|$|The Dugu museum models' {{packaging}} {{is intriguing}} and apparently done to mimic other 1:43 scale modelers, {{but also to}} be appropriate for museum sales. The Cisitalia's box panels alternate in blue and yellow {{with the name of}} the museum on the blue sides. The round seal of the museum appears on the end flaps with a representation of the 1899 'first' FIAT. The flat yellow sides of the box show the Cisistalia in profile and the opposite side names the car with bookman-like type font in blue. The overall packaging effect looks more <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>from</b> the 1950s than the 1970s.|$|E
60|$|Well, not settled exactly; Mr. Buzzacott wouldn't {{go so far}} as to say settled. A villine for {{the summer}} months. The winter in Rome. One was forced to live abroad. Taxation in England.... Soon they were all talking. Barbara looked at them. Beside the marquis they all seemed half dead. His face flashed as he talked; he seemed to be boiling with life. Her father was limp and pale, <b>like</b> <b>something</b> long buried <b>from</b> the light; and Mr. Topes was all dry and shrivelled; and Mrs. Topes looked more than ever <b>like</b> <b>something</b> worked by clockwork.
