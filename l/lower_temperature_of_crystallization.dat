40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} <b>of</b> polymer <b>crystallization</b> under high and {{constant}} cooling rates, {{a new survey}} is presented. The growth kinetics of spherulites from the molten state and the corresponding <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> under similar cooling rates are considered. An industrial grade of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) is investigated {{in the range of}} slow (from 1 to 10 °C/min), of relatively moderate (from 30 to 500 °C/min) and of high (from 500 to 1600 °C/min) constant cooling rates. The growth kinetics for the α-modification of iPP versus the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> is in agreement with the data published by Janeschitz-Kriegl [Macromolecules, 2006]. To understand the growth mechanism, the Hoffman equation is used and then extrapolated to <b>lower</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization.</b> Finally, to describe the non-isothermal <b>crystallization,</b> the equation <b>of</b> Ozawa is used. The benefits to use the spherulitic growth kinetics to extrapolate data from alternative methods, i. e., differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lowering</b> the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> by {{deposition}} <b>of</b> {{thin films}} on a heated substrate represents {{the easiest way}} to find new means to develop and improve new working devices based on nanocrystals embedded in thin films. The improvements are strongly related with the increasing of operation speed, substantially decreasing the energy consumption and reducing unit fabrication costs of the respective semiconductor devices. This approach avoids major problems, such as those related to diffusion or difficulties in controlling of nanocrystallites size, which appear during thermal treatments at high temperatures after deposition. It is reported here the significant progress introduced by synthesis procedure to the in-situ structuring of Ge nanocrystallites in SiO 2 thin films by heating the substrate at low temperature, 400 °C during co-deposition of Ge and SiO 2 by magnetron sputtering. As a proof-of-concept, a Si/Ge-NCs:SiO 2 photo-sensitive structure was fabricated thereof and characterized.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the results that we obtained and reported {{over the last few years}} on the structural, optical and light emitting properties of Si-SiO 2 and Si-Al 2 O 3 films that were fabricated using a specific configuration of RF magnetron sputtering. In these films the Si volume fraction, x, varies along the film (which is typically 14 cm long) from a value of ~ 0. 1 at one end to ~ 0. 9 at the other end. For the films with x > 0. 3, the formation of amorphous Si clusters was observed in as-deposited Si-SiO 2 and Si-Al 2 O 3 films. Si nanocrystals (Si-ncs) were generated by high-temperature annealing of the films in nitrogen atmosphere. We found that two processes can contribute to the Si-ncs formation: (i) the <b>crystallization</b> <b>of</b> the existing amorphous Si inclusions in the as-deposited films, and (ii) the thermally stimulated phase separation. Process (i) can be responsible for the independence of Si-ncs mean sizes on x in annealed films with x > 0. 5. At the same time, difference in the structural and the light emitting properties of the two types of films was observed. For the samples of the same x, the Si-ncs embedded in the Al 2 O 3 host were found to be larger than the Si-ncs in the SiO 2 host. This phenomenon can be explained by the <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> required for phase separation in Si-Al 2 O 3 or by the <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crystallization</b> <b>of</b> Si-ncs in alumina. The latter suggestion is supported by Raman scattering and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. In contrast with the Si-SiO 2, the Si-ncs embedded in Si-Al 2 O 3 films were found to be under tensile stress. This effect was explained by the strains at the interfaces between the film and silica substrate as well as between the Si inclusions and the Al 2 O 3 host. It was also shown that exciton recombination in Si-ncs is the dominant radiative channel in Si-SiO 2 films, while the emission from the oxide defects dominates in Si-Al 2 O 3 films. This can be due to the high number of non-radiative defects at Si-ncs/Al 2 O 3 interface, which is confirmed by our electron paramagnetic resonance data and is consistent with our above suggestion of mechanical stresses in the Si-Al 2 O 3 films...|$|R

40|$|Amorphous alloys or {{metallic}} glasses have attracted significant {{interest in the}} materials science and engineering communities due to their unique physical, mechanical, and chemical properties. The viscous flow of amorphous alloys exhibiting high strain rate sensitivity and homogeneous deformation {{is considered to be}} an important characteristic in thermoplastic forming processes performed within the supercooled liquid region because it allows superplastic-like deformation behavior. Here, the correlation between the superheated liquid fragility, and the onset <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> for Al-based alloys, is investigated. The activation energy for viscous flow of the liquid is also investigated. There is a negative correlation between the parameter of superheated liquid fragility and the onset <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> in the same Al-based alloy system. The activation energy decreases as the onset <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> increases.

The discrepancy between the experimental data and the field petrologic observations lies {{in the nature of}} the experiments done by Rosenberg (1972). The <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> was derived from synthesis experiments on the assemblage topaz, qvartz, and mullite or pyrophyllite from oxide mixes. Synthesis experiments are well known to give higher <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> stability than equilibrium phase-boundary determinations (Johannes, 1968; Moody, 1976). The few higher temperature (> 600 oC) rever-sals (Fig. 7, Rosenberg, 1972) do not give enough constraint on the slope of the curve to use that curve to extrapolate to <b>lower</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The synthetic mullite-bearing assemblages with topaz may have the proper bulk composition for comparison with the as-semblage topaz*andalusite observed at Hillsborough (Sykes and Moody, 1978), but the crystallization temperature determined from those experiments (Rosenberg, 1972) wrll not be valid for the andalu-site-topaz assemblage for the same reasons as noted above. Therefore, this re-examination of the experi-mental data on topaz stability indicates that it is not applicable to setting a thermal limit to the metamor-phic regime in the Carolina Slate Belt.

40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) {{characteristics of}} quartz are highly dependent of its thermal history.

However, little is know about the influence <b>of</b> the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> quartz <b>crystallization</b> on its TL characteristics. In the present study, we evaluate the TL sensitivity and dose response curves of hydrothermal and metamorphic quartz with crystallization temperatures from 209 +/- 15 to 633 +/- 27 degrees C determined through fluid inclusion and mineral chemistry analysis. The studied crystals present a cooling thermal history, which allow the acquiring of their natural TL without influence <b>of</b> heating after <b>crystallization.</b> The TL curves of the studied samples present two main components formed by different peaks overlapped around 110 C and 200 - 400 degrees C. The TL sensitivity in the 200 - 400 degrees C region increases linearly with the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> quartz <b>crystallization.</b> No relationship was observed between <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> quartz <b>crystallization</b> and saturation doses (< 100 Gy). The elevated TL sensitivity <b>of</b> the high <b>temperature</b> quartz is attributed to the control exerted by the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> on the substitution of Si(4 +) by ions such as Al(3 +) and Ti(4 +), which produce defects responsible for luminescence phenomena.

The relative abundance of quartz in the earth crust and the easiness to measure TL are advantageous in relation to geothermometry methods based on chemistry of other minerals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
