5000|$|<b>Leather-hard</b> {{refers to}} a clay body that has been dried partially. At this stage the clay object has {{approximately}} 15% moisture content. Clay bodies at this stage are very firm and only slightly pliable. Trimming and handle attachment often occurs at the <b>leather-hard</b> state.|$|E
5000|$|Slipware is pottery {{identified}} by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the <b>leather-hard</b> clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, {{which is a}} mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. The slip placed onto a wet or <b>leather-hard</b> clay body surface by a variety of techniques including dipping, painting, piping or splashing.|$|E
50|$|While {{decorated}} ware {{was usually}} adorned using cobalt oxide, decorative {{techniques such as}} incising were also used. Flowering plants, birds, or other decoration were cut into the <b>leather-hard</b> clay using a stylus to produce detailed recessed images on the vessels; these were usually also highlighted in cobalt. Stamped or coggled designs were sometimes impressed into the <b>leather-hard</b> clay, as well. Potters occasionally substituted manganese or iron oxide for cobalt oxide to produce brown, instead of blue, decorations on the pottery.|$|E
5000|$|... yumi - are {{wire and}} bamboo {{trimming}} harps that {{double as a}} fluting tool. They are used to cut off uneven or torn rims {{as well as to}} facet <b>leather-hard</b> forms.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Canteen, China, Jiangxi Province, 15th century, {{porcelain}} with cobalt under colorless glaze. As {{with nearly}} all Chinese {{blue and white}} porcelain, this was painted when <b>leather-hard,</b> and probably the spout and rings were added.|$|E
50|$|After a pot {{has been}} thrown it {{is left to}} dry to the <b>leather-hard</b> phase on the wheel. To prevent {{distortion}} in the drying process, throwers will often tie twine made from straw around the pot so it retains its circular shape. This is especially important to the stacking process.|$|E
5000|$|In pottery, luting is a {{technique}} for joining pieces of unfired <b>leather-hard</b> clay together, using a wet clay slip or slurry as adhesive. The complete object is then fired. Large objects are often built up in this way, for example the figures of the Terracotta Army in ancient China. The edges being joined might be scored or cross-hatched to promote adhesion, but clay and water are the only materials used.|$|E
5000|$|Suttie shaped his {{articles}} principally with rolled {{slabs of}} <b>leather-hard</b> clay body to create geometric forms, which he cut and reassembled into larger forms. Suttie's preference was for hand-building {{and he was}} inspired by objects and forms from pre-industrial societies. These were often in pastiche of traditional domestic objects including anthropomorphic vessels such as jugs and teapots, which were part container and part figurative form. His functional, yet slightly baroque works, are vividly colored, and often stand on oddly positioned legs or are seemingly off-balanced.|$|E
5000|$|Pieces {{produced}} in Ding ware were mostly open vessels {{of a relatively}} small size, with shapes and decoration often borrowed from metalwork, as in the bowls with lobed rims. Vases are relatively uncommon. [...] Initially pieces were mostly thrown on the potter's wheel, often with templates, but in the late 11th century moulds began to be used, which included the inside decoration, previously carved or incised with a knife on the <b>leather-hard</b> piece. Any decoration {{on the outside of}} pieces continued to be hand-carved for some time.|$|E
50|$|In pottery, <b>leather-hard</b> is the {{condition}} of a clay or clay body when it has been partially dried {{to the point where}} all shrinkage has been completed, and it has a consistency similar to leather of the same thickness as the clay. At this stage the clay object has approximately 15% moisture content. The clay is still visibly damp (normally a darkish grey, if it began whiteish) but has dried {{enough to be able to}} be handled without deformation. The body is able to be gouged or incised without breaking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conventional}} view, {{developed in}} modern times in view {{of a lack of}} contemporary accounts, was that painted Greek pottery received a single firing, after the shaped pot had been dried <b>leather-hard</b> and then painted. But the firing had three phases, designed to create the intended colours. Sometimes further painting in other colours was added after firing, especially in white-ground and Hellenistic vases. However, new studies instead provide material evidence that the pottery was made with two or more separate firings [...] in which the pottery is subjected to multiple firing stages. The conventional view is described in more detail below, but the possibility of different firings for the phases described should be kept in mind.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} Bunzlau {{is rich in}} clays suited to the potter's wheel. Typically, {{utilitarian}} Bunzlauer pottery was turned on a kick wheel, dried <b>leather-hard,</b> dipped in a slip glaze and then burnt in a rectangular, cross-draft kiln. Although fired at temperatures of up to 2,400 F and often classified as stoneware, the clay actually does not vitrify and Bunzlauer pottery is better categorized as high-fired earthenware. In order to make their pottery watertight, Bunzlauer potters applied a coating of liquid clay, or slip. When fired, the slip glaze varied from a chocolate to dark brown. Since the fabric of Bunzlauer ware retains some porosity, the pottery conveniently has been suited for cooking over an open fire or for baking in an oven, {{as well as for}} storage.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{solid cast}} mould, ceramic {{objects such as}} handles and plates are {{surrounded}} by plaster on all sides with a reservoir for slip, and are removed when the solid piece is held within. For a hollow cast mould, for objects such as vases and cups, once the plaster has absorbed most of the liquid from the outside layer of clay the remaining slip is poured off for later use. After a period for further absorption of water, the cast piece {{is removed from the}} mould once it is <b>leather-hard,</b> that is, firm enough to handle without losing its shape. It is then [...] "fettled" [...] (trimmed neatly) and allowed to dry out further, usually overnight or for several hours. This produces a greenware piece which is then ready to be decorated, glazed and fired in a kiln.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of Saint-Porchaire ware was labour-intensive, and in overall decorative design, no two pieces are alike. The basic clay shapes were thrown {{on the wheel}} and perhaps refined on the lathe or were assembled from shaped slabs of clay; the candlesticks, for example, were assembled {{from more than a}} hundred separate components. Mould-formed sculptural decoration was applied with slip to make relief masks, festoons, and the like. Additionally, hand-modelled figures might serve as handles for ewers. Banding and fields of fine geometrical decoration or rinceaux were made by repeatedly impressing metal dies into the <b>leather-hard</b> body; after further drying the impressions were filled with dark brown, rust red or ochre yellow clay slip that was rubbed off the surface to give an inlay with a discreet range of colors. Further touches of colored slip, such as a spinach green, were applied.|$|E
5000|$|Slipware is pottery {{decorated}} by slip placed onto a wet or <b>leather-hard</b> clay body surface by dipping, painting or splashing. Often only pottery where the slip creates patterns or images will {{be described as}} slipware, {{as opposed to the}} many types where a plain slip is applied to the whole body, for example most fine wares in Ancient Roman pottery, such as African red slip ware (note: [...] "slip ware" [...] not [...] "slipware"). Decorative slips may be a different colour than the underlying clay body or offer other decorative qualities. Selectively applying layers of colored slips can create the effect of a painted ceramic, such as in the black-figure or red-figure pottery styles of Ancient Greek pottery. Slip decoration is an ancient technique in Chinese pottery also, used to cover whole vessels over 4,000 years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Regarded as the [...] "national" [...] pottery {{of ancient}} Etruria, bucchero ware is {{distinguished}} by its black fabric {{as well as}} glossy, black surface achieved through the unique [...] "reduction" [...] method {{in which it was}} fired. After the <b>leather-hard</b> unfired ware was arranged in the kiln and the fire started, the vent holes were closed, thus reducing the supply of oxygen required in a normal kiln firing. In the smoke-filled atmosphere of the kiln, the oxygen-starved flames drew oxygen molecules from the iron oxide of the pottery. This process caused the fabric of the clay to change color from its natural red to black. Thus, in contrast to the black-glazed Campanian ware of the Greek colonists in southern Italy, the lustrous, shiny, black surface of many bucchero pots was achieved by diligent burnishing (polishing) or, occasionally, through the application of a thin slip (clay emulsion).|$|E
50|$|Slipware {{is a type}} {{of pottery}} {{identified}} by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the <b>leather-hard</b> clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. A coating of white or coloured slip, known as an engobe, {{can be applied to the}} article to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. Sgraffito involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state. One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture.|$|E
