40|$|Oceans cover 70 % of the world's {{surface and}} {{are a source of}} 90 % of the world's biomass. Oceans provide the world's populations with food and {{facilitate}} international trade in goods. The shipping industry is a notable source (although not leading source) of marine pollution both from operational discharges and maritime incidents. With a vast number <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> navigating the world's oceans the impact of maritime incidents, especially of bulk carriers of oil, on the marine environment can be devastating. Ships which become distressed often attempt to find a 'place of refuge', being nearby port or a sheltered area within the territorial waters of a nearby coastal state. Traditionally these ships in distress had the customary <b>law</b> right <b>of</b> entry into port {{in order to ensure that}} persons on board could be saved. This position seems to have changed in the modern age. With the advancement of modern technology persons on board can be saved without bringing the distressed ship into port. In addition, these ships in distress present a serious risk to the marine environment within the waters of the coastal state. Coastal state practice seems to indicate that coastal states prioritise the preservation of their own sovereign waters over the needs <b>of</b> the particular <b>ship</b> in distress, especially where there is no risk to human life. It would seem that the traditional customary <b>law</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in distress do not apply to circumstances where there is no risk to the persons on board and where there is only a risk to the marine environment. These ships are now commonly called <b>ships</b> in need <b>of</b> assistance and are differentiated from ships in distress due to the fact that the risk is one to the marine environment and not to human life. The result of the refusing places of refuge creates the problem <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in need <b>of</b> assistance as such ships proceed to beg for entry from other nearby coastal states usually being refused along the way. Through the discussion of notable maritime incidents of this nature it will be shown that such refusal of entry by coastal states into a place of refuge is a leading factor that increases the probability of a maritime incident occurring and thereby increasing the likelihood of damage to the marine environment. The concept of state sovereignty has been utilised as a justification for coastal states refusing entry into a place of refuge. This dissertation will discuss the concept of coastal state sovereignty paying particular attention to the legislative and enforcement rights of coastal states in the regulation of pollution and the protection of the marine environment. The international community has long since recognised that the protection of the marine environment is a general state duty and a principle <b>of</b> international customary <b>law.</b> The duty to protect and preserve the marine environment guides, informs and restricts coastal state action. This dissertation analyses the relationship between sovereignty and the duty to protect the marine environment in the context <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in need <b>of</b> assistance in modern international law. This dissertation seeks to conclude with an overall analysis of the current customary and modern international <b>law</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in need <b>of</b> assistance in order to determine whether coastal states are obliged to grant places of refuge. The IMO Guidelines will be discussed to analyse whether same add any value to the problem <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in need <b>of</b> assistance and to what end such guidelines indicate further development on this issue...|$|R

40|$|In a {{recently}} published official Report from the Swedish Government (SOU 2010 : 73) a leg- islative proposal has been introduced. Its main {{purpose is to}} prevent parallel registrations <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> that are bareboat chartered to other countries. The legislative proposal claims that by preventing parallel registration <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> the Swedish Maritime Code will better corre- spond with the UN convention on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the sea. The UN convention on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the sea clearly states that ships are forbidden to fly two flags. There is however no restriction concerning parallel registration, simultaneously, in two registers. A ship that is bareboat chartered out from Sweden does not fulfil criteria re- quired {{in order to be}} deregistered, according to the Swedish maritime code. In matter of fact ownership remains unchanged in a bareboat procedure. The situation leads to parallel registration, and uncertainty can arise regarding which country has full state control over the ship. This may cause problems, and should be dealt with. There are however more ap- propriate ways of dealing with the issue rather than prohibiting parallel registration, and that are compatible with the UN convention on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the sea. By allowing bareboat registration according to the UN convention on conditions for regis- tration <b>of</b> <b>ships,</b> the issue <b>of</b> which country has full state control over the ship is resolved, and assures that the ship sails under only on states flag. Sweden has held a passive position regarding the issue of parallel registration <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and a legislative change is necessary, mainly because parallel registration, as it is currently con- ducted in Sweden today, is in conflict with the UN convention on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the sea, but also because it leads to uncertainty concerning which country has full state control over the ship. However, a prohibition against parallel registration is not compatible with the rest of EU, where the majority has chosen to permit parallel registration. Bareboat registration ac- cording to the UN convention on conditions for registration <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> is not in conflict with the UN convention on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the sea and should therefore be permitted in Sweden...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{maritime}} norm, the nationality <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> is authorized with the registration <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> {{by the state}} concerned, and the ship registered is allowed to fly {{the flag of the}} state. The Japanese legislation for the registration <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> requires that the nationality <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> shall be genuinely linked with the nationality of owner(s) <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> and does not allow a bareboat chartered-out vessel to the foreign state to temporarily terminate the registration <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> in Japan. Under the regime of EEZ, many Japanese far seas fishing vessels(FSFVs) were decommissioned or forced to transfer of ownership to the coastal state if they wanted continuation of fishing operation in the EEZ of coastal states concerned, which led drastic reduction of Japanese FSFVs.

40|$|Common core, PECL and DCFR, {{could they}} change {{shipping}} and transport law? This question {{was included in}} the call for papers for this book. The great response to the call suggests that even though harmonization <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> and transport <b>law</b> has a much greater tradition than harmonization <b>of</b> general private <b>law,</b> still uniformity in shipping and transport law could benefit from the harmonization instruments. This should come as no surprise: despite the long standing tradition, unification <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> and transport <b>law</b> didn’t go as far as would be desirable from a trade perspective and three major shortcomings are harmful to uniformity. First of all, some important areas <b>of</b> transport <b>law</b> are still excluded from uniform <b>law.</b> The lack <b>of</b> such uniform rules in these fields is often also detrimental for uniformity in unified fields <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> For example, the lack of uniform rules on transport intermediaries impacts the qualification by national courts of a service provider as a carrier or rather as a transport intermediary and creates therefore also a crack in uniform carriage law. Secondly, even in fields that are unified, there is often only a partial unification, addressing only specific questions. Consequently other questions are left outside the unification. Again, fields that are left outside unification can strongly impact the uniformity of decisions in cases subject to uniform law. For example, the lack of uniform rules on contract interpretation and validity of the contract will obviously impact the interpretation of contracts subject to uniform law in different member states, and will can also lead to diverging court decisions in these member states. The possible impact of the harmonization instruments on contract interpretation are discussed by professor Legros in chapter 1. Other questions that Finally, even for subjects falling within the scope <b>of</b> uniform <b>law,</b> uniform rules are often nonetheless interpreted in a different way by national courts, as these courts read their national law concepts into the uniform rules. This prevents these uniform legislations from resulting in uniform law. As great parts <b>of</b> uniform transport <b>law</b> apply mandatorily, the impact of these cracks in uniformity is even greater. Commercial law is in general Darwinist, in this sense that parties provide for their own contractual framework if uniform law is not considered adequate to govern the specific contract, resulting eventually in the disuse of inadequate regimes. The mandatory nature of said regimes prevents this however, causing inefficient legislation to create obstacles to trade. Taking into account these shortcomings, further unification <b>of</b> private <b>law</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> and transport <b>law</b> seems highly desirable. Nevertheless, some legislative fatigue has crept into unification <b>of</b> private <b>law</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> and transport <b>law.</b> Here, a two-fold role can come to the harmonisation instruments. First of all from a methodological point of view, the grassroots perspective taken by harmonisation instruments could offer an example for shipping and transport law. Second, the provisions of the harmonisation instruments could be beneficial for shipping and transport law from different points of view. First of all, some of these provisions could be very useful when developing future European shipping and transport law instruments. Secondly these harmonisation instruments could offer a useful tool for gap-filling. For example parties could contractually incorporate these instrument as to create a neutral gap-filling mechanism. Finally de lege ferenda, if these harmonisation instruments would result in an (optional) European instrument, there can be a direct impact of such instrument for topics that are still subject to national law. From this introduction it follows that there could come a role to the harmonization instruments. All authors examine for their field of expertise if the instruments could have any impact, and if so, what this impact would be. All three the aforementioned problems are addressed in some contributions: the impact on fields left outside the harmonisation, on topics not addressed in uniform law and finally on different interpretations of uniform rules.

40|$|The {{starting}} point for this analysis of flag State responsibilities is to recall {{the historical development of}} the extant regulatory regime for jurisdiction and control of ships; from the genesis <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> registration in the thirteenth century, through {{to the development of the}} nation State and concept of the flag State, on to the gradual evolution <b>of</b> national <b>law</b> for control <b>of</b> <b>ships,</b> and eventual codification <b>of</b> this <b>law</b> into international law in the twentieth century. The United Nations Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> the Sea (LOSC) provides for a State to grant its nationality to ships, to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality, to register ships in its territory, and for those ships to fly its flag. With these rights come flag State responsibilities. The flag State has a duty to effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical, social and environmental protection matters over ships flying its flag. The flag State can undertake these duties or has the ability to entrust them to private organizations. A regulatory framework in international maritime law has been established that allows delegation of flag State responsibilities and recognizes the customary role of Classification Societies in inspection, survey and certification <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> The LOSC also requires that a ship be surveyed before registration. As the flag State has the right to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality it can choose to not require this survey for reasons of expediency and easy entry <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> onto its register. The regulatory framework for jurisdiction and control <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> provides opportunities for the establishment of regulatory inefficient flag States who have the right in law to delegate, or derogate, all of their statutory functions to equally inefficient private organizations. Such flag States are attractive to shipowners seeking minimum compliance costs and regulatory oversight. Issues of flag State responsibility and performance are analysed in depth to test the hypothesis that the extant regulatory framework is adequate in law but, due to inadequate implementation, monitoring and enforcement, does not deliver the intent of the LOSC that flag States exercise effective jurisdiction and control over ships flying their flag. For the purpose of analysis in this thesis flag States are categorized into National, Quasi-National, International and Pseudo-National according to their degree of regulatory efficiency. It is concluded that the regulatory framework is fundamentally sound but that it requires effective implementation and enforcement through strengthening in law, supported by sanctions upon recalcitrant flag States, and a greater degree of global oversight and monitoring of flag State performance by the International Maritime Organization...|$|R
