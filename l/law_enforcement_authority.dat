5|$|Because DUI in New Jersey is a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI {{laws are}} not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for drunk driving, {{military}} bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, and it is a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Postal Service. Similar to New Jersey, federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E

25|$|DIA's {{intelligence}} operations {{extend beyond}} the zones of combat, and approximately half of its employees serve overseas at hundreds of locations and U.S. Embassies in 140 countries. The agency specializes in collection and analysis of human-source intelligence (HUMINT), both overt and clandestine, while also handling American military-diplomatic relations abroad. DIA concurrently serves as the national manager for the highly technical measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) and the Defense Department manager for counterintelligence programs. The agency has no <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority,</b> but it is sometimes portrayed so in American popular culture.|$|E
25|$|In Illinois, {{the sheriff}} {{is the highest}} <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority</b> in each county; however, {{incorporated}} municipalities, regardless of their sizes, are responsible for primary law enforcement within their jurisdiction. Therefore, the sheriffs' departments generally concentrate their police functions on unincorporated areas. In addition, many small municipalities pay the sheriff's department {{a portion of their}} law enforcement funds for the sheriff to act as their primary law enforcement: usually either overnight, which allows the local police department to operate with local officers during the day; or full-time, relieving the village of needing its own police department.|$|E
25|$|Because the City and County of San Francisco are {{consolidated}} and coterminous—the only consolidated {{city and}} county in California—the San Francisco Sheriff historically possessed <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority.</b> However, as the San Francisco Police Department provides general police service for the city, the Sheriff's Department handles judicial duties, staffs the jail, and provides law enforcement services for city facilities such as San Francisco City Hall and San Francisco General Hospital. San Francisco Sheriff's deputies back up the San Francisco Police as needed, as well as make arrests for criminal and vehicle-code violations while performing their duties.|$|E

25|$|Although {{many of the}} FBI's {{functions}} are unique, its activities in support of national security are {{comparable to those of}} the British MI5 and the Russian FSB. Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has no <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority</b> and is focused on intelligence collection overseas, the FBI is primarily a domestic agency, maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States, and more than 400 resident agencies in lesser cities and areas across the nation. At an FBI field office, a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence.|$|E
25|$|In Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City, Howard County, and Montgomery County the Sheriff's Office still {{retains its}} <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority</b> in all areas, however, their duties are {{strictly}} limited to enforcing {{orders of the}} court except in rare instances where called upon by the County Police or other law enforcement to assist. In Prince George's County, the Sheriff's Office and the County Police share the responsibility of county law enforcement. The Prince George's County Police still enforce {{the vast majority of}} crimes and traffic laws. Along with the traditional duties of enforcing all orders of the court, the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office responds to all domestic calls for service within the county's District III, {{is a part of the}} Homeland Security Task Force, US Marshal Taskforce, and the FBI Task Force. Within Maryland, the size of each county's Sheriff's Office varies greatly from forces of approximately 30 sworn to well over 500 in the more populated counties.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia {{does not}} have {{overlapping}} County and City jurisdictions, whereas in the other 49 states most municipalities fall within (and share jurisdiction and many other governmental responsibilities with) a County. In Virginia, governmental power flows down from the State (or in Virginia's case, Commonwealth) directly to either a County or an Independent City. Thus, policing in Virginia is more streamlined: the County Sheriff's Office/Department or County Police Department does not overlap with an Independent City Police Department. Unincorporated Townships remain part of their parent County, but may have Town Police Departments to augment their County law enforcement. Town Police Departments are often small, and may deploy a combination of paid and nonpaid, full and part-time law enforcement officers, including auxiliary officers who typically serve as part-time, unpaid volunteers. If present, Independent City Sheriff's Offices usually follow the Restrictive model shown below for Sheriff's Departments, with limited <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority</b> including warrant service, jail bailiff, etc. Mutual assistance compacts may exist where neighboring law enforcement agencies will assist each other, however, in addition to State (Commonwealth) law enforcement resources.|$|E

[...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E
