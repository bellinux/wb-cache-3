Smith {{played for}} Hearts and Dundee later in his career and became the only player to have won the Scottish league {{championship}} with three different clubs. James McGhee scored at least 24 goals for Hibs {{in the early years}} of the fixture. The real figure is probably higher as he played in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> where only the result is known and not all the scorers were recorded.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{discussion}} of appointing McGann player-manager of the Doves, the role {{was assigned to}} Kelley. Agreeing to terms with George Dovey, president of the Doves, McGann played 135 games during the 1908 season, but batted only [...]240. During an April 1908 game between the Doves and the Giants, McGraw insulted McGann as slow, referring {{to him as a}} [...] "damned ice wagon", noting [...] "that's how the Giants lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> last season". After the game, McGann went to the Giants' hotel, waited for McGraw to return from the theatre, and fought him in a billiard room. Dovey released McGann from the Doves after the 1908 season.|$|E

[...] In response to being chosen by Cleveland, McCoy said, [...] "I can't wait to be a Cleveland Brown and that we're going to win a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games.</b> Cleveland has a little orange in their jerseys just like UT.

500|$|The 1999–2000 season {{would be}} Barkley's final {{year in the}} NBA. Initially, Barkley {{averaged}} 14.5 points on [...]477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game. Along with Shaquille O'Neal, Barkley was ejected from a November 10, 1999 game against the Los Angeles Lakers. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal. Barkley's season and career seemingly ended prematurely {{at the age of}} 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999 in Philadelphia, where his career began. Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback, a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list, and walked off the court to a standing ovation. He stated, [...] "I can't explain what tonight meant. I did it for me. I've won and lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games,</b> but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn't get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own." [...] After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year Hall of Fame career.|$|E
500|$|Scott Butterworth of GameSpot {{thought that}} the analog {{navigation}} tools – a hand-held compass and paper map – were [...] "immersive" [...] but [...] "occasionally frustrating". He found that the visual beauty of the setting allowed for a more rewarding form of exploration and noted that the sound design complemented the depth of its atmosphere. Judging {{the development of the}} characters through dialog to be [...] "bold" [...] and [...] "admirable", he opined that it served as [...] "a patient, reflective examination of how two people grow to trust and care for each other". According to Butterworth, the voice acting was brilliant and layered with emotional nuance, as he had evolved a strong attachment to the characters. GamesRadar's Justin Towell described Firewatch as [...] "one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced". He commended the voice acting for having successfully defined each character's personality traits. Towell added that the music, alongside the sound design, worked well in service of the atmosphere. However, he disparaged a few noticeable continuity problems that left him disillusioned. Ryan McCaffrey at IGN hailed the sense of realism elicited by the setting, despite the stylized level design and artwork. He also approved of the script, saying that voice acting enhanced it further. Of the writing, McCaffrey said, [...] "It's tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> can successfully claim that". He deemed the ending polarizing because of the story's promising escalation. Polygon's Colin Campbell appreciated the use of humor and empathy to develop the characters, considered the game's mystery to be successful and the story to be [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "satisfying". He criticized the conclusion, regarding it as unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2012 was {{a roller}} coaster ride for the Knights as they start the season seeing {{themselves}} sinking down {{as far as the}} 6th spot and it didn't stop there as star center Raymond Almazan was missing a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> in the first round due to unknown reasons. Almazan vowed to come back in the 2nd round and with him back in the lineup, the Knights became the hottest team in the NCAA as they won 7 of their 9 games just enough to secure the #3 spot to force a Final 4 rematch against San Sebastian. In the first game Kevin Alas made history as he scored 43 points (the most in Final 4 history)to force a knockout game. In the do-or-die game, the game went down to the wire just like the previous year but Jojo Belorio made sure it will be Letran this time by scoring the game winning free throws to book the last ticket to the Finals. They met their archrivals, San Beda in the finals. Although they avoided defeat by winning the second game after losing the first game, they were blown out in the last game of the finals by the Red Lions. This season, the battlecry W17NESS LETRAN was formulated for their bid to attain the school's 17th overall title in the men's basketball tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Kaplan has {{expressed}} that this theme {{continued into the}} aesthetics of the game, commenting, [...] "when {{it comes to the}} setting and art style and tone of the universe, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> like to approach the future in either a very dystopian way, or a post-apocalyptic way," [...] and adding, [...] "we wanted to make something bright and welcoming, that featured a lot of deep, rich colors. A lot of the modern realistic games tend to focus on gritty gray, brown palettes." [...] Several of the initial maps, Ilios, Dorado, and Nepal, were developed based on the idea of vacation spots and drew from various imagery of those locations. Kaplan noted that Dorado, set in Mexico, was inspired by a photograph they found while searching for images of colorful Mexican towns, but only later realized that the photo was that of Manarola, Italy. Others, like the Hollywood map, were created by a multicultural team that used only their perception of what Hollywood was like, rather than any reference material, with the result being better than a realistic version, according to Kaplan. A more recent map, Oasis, set in Iraq, was portrayed as [...] "one of the most technologically-advanced places in the world" [...] to contrast how other games set in the near-future present the country as ravaged by war.|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{long while}} since I've felt so good for nothing as I do this morning. My very {{wristbands}} curl up in a dog's-eared and disconsolate manner; my little room is all a heap of disorder. I've got a hoarseness and wheezing and sneezing and coughing and choking. I can't speak and I can't think, I'm miserable in bed and useless out of it; {{and it seems to}} me as if I could never venture to open a window or go out of a door any more. I have the dimmest sort of diabolical pleasure in thinking how miserable I shall make Susie by telling her all this; but in other respects I seem entirely devoid of all moral sentiments. I have arrived at this state of things, first by catching cold, and since by trying to [...] "amuse myself" [...] for three days. I tried to read [...] "Pickwick," [...] but found that vulgar,[24] and, besides, I know it all by heart. I sent from town for some chivalric romances, but found them immeasurably stupid. I made Baxter read me the Daily Telegraph, and found that the Home Secretary had been making an absurd speech about art, without any consciousness that such a person as I had ever existed. I read a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>games</b> of chess out of Mr. Staunton's handbook, and couldn't understand any of them. I analyzed the Dock Company's bill of charges on a box from Venice, and sent them an examination paper on it. I think that did amuse me a little, but the account doesn't. £1 8s. 6d. for bringing a box two feet square from the Tower Wharf to here! But the worst of all is, that the doctor keeps me shut up here, and I can't get my business done; and now there isn't the least chance of my getting down to Brantwood for Christmas, nor, as far as I can see, for a fortnight after it. There's perhaps a little of the diabolical enjoyment again in that estimate; but really the days do go, more like dew shaken off branches than real sunrisings and settings. But I'll send you word every day now for a little while how things are going on.|$|E
