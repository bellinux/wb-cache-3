40|$|Animal manure is an {{important}} source of anthropogenic GHG (greenhouse gas) : methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The livestock contributes with 37 % of global CH 4 emission. The sources of GHG (CO 2 and CH 4) are the <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> or <b>slurry</b> <b>storage</b> and the compact solid manure. Measurement systems of GHG emission are important for the selection of the appropriate technology. By using the closed chamber method for soil, landfills, volcanoes etc., the present study evaluates the estimation of total emissions of methane and carbon dioxide from an experimental farm in Cluj County, Romania. The investigated area covered with sheep solid manure was about 579 m 2 and ~ 5 cm thick, for cattle was about 12 m 2 and 5 m thick and for swine was about 1. 5 m 5 and 0. 5 m thick. The total methane emission measured for sheep manure was 0. 83 t CH 4 /year and for cattle manure was 0. 185 t CH 4 /year. The total carbon dioxide emission measured for sheep manure was 61. 3 t CO 2 /year and for cattle manure was 4. 7 t CO 2 /year. The measurement for pigs manure was high and this could be due to the freshness of the manure. The estimated emissions showed that a considerable amount of CH 4 and CO 2 is produced also by an experimental farm and an appropriate management of manure is important for reducing greenhouse gas. In this respect, we believe that the future solution for a green economy is to use manure in biogas plants...|$|R

Slurry with nearly 10 % TSw was stored, from January to October (285 days) in two tanks and, similarly, from June to November (146 days). Slurry samples were periodically collected {{from each of}} the tanks at two locations at depths of 0. 3, 1. 0, 1. 8 and 2. 5 m below the surface. Slurry TS, were determined by high-speed centrifuging. Substantial spatial and temporal concentration variations occurred in slurry TSw, TSv, FS and VS. Most of the concentration change and loss of TSw, TSv and VS was limited to the top 1 m of the slurry. Settling of solids {{did not appear to be}} an important process in the stored slurry. Large concentration changes were limited to the top 0. 3 m only for about 6 months after winter and 3 months after summer-filling of the tanks. Thus, most of the initial organic matter and biogas generation potential was probably retained in the slurry at depths of 1 m or more. The rate and location of TSw concentration decreases suggested that VS biodegradation occurred mainly due to aerobic processes, starting near the surface and progressing downwards with time. Mass balances indicated that about one quarter of the initial TSw, VS and TC were lost by the end of the storage period in all tanks. Correlations between TSw and TSv and between wet-basis TC and TSw or TSv were highly significant...|$|R

The in ﬂuence of nutrient injection on yield and weed control seemed to be modulated by the time of emergence and the early growth rate of the crop relative to weeds.

The construction of robust known-source libraries is expensive and requires an informed sampling strategy. In {{many types of}} farming systems, waste is stored for several months before being released into the environment. In this study we analyzed, by means of repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus primers and comparative analysis using the Bionumerics software, collections of E. coli obtained from a dairy farm and from a swine farm, both of which stored their waste as a slurry in holding tanks. In all fecal samples, obtained from either barns or holding tanks, {{the diversity of the}} E. coli populations was underrepresented by collections of 500 isolates. In both the dairy and the swine farms, the diversity of the E. [*]coli community was greater in the manure holding tank than in the barn, when they were sampled on the same date. In both farms, a comparison of stored manure samples collected several months apart suggested that the community composition changed substantially in terms of the detected number, absolute identity, and relative abundance of genotypes. Comparison of E. coli populations obtained from 10 different locations in either holding tank suggested that spatial variability in the E. coli community should be accounted for when sampling. Overall, the diversity in E. coli populations in <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>storage</b> facilities is significant and likely is problematic with respect to library construction for microbial source tracking applications...|$|R

In this study CH 4 production rates were determined in 20 pig slurry and 11 cattle slurry samples collected beneath slatted floors on six representative farms; rates were determined within 24 h at temperatures close to the temperature in slurry pits {{at the time of}} collection. Methane production rates in pig and cattle slurry differed significantly at 0. 030 and 0. 011 kg CH 4 kg- 1 VS (volatile solids). Current estimates of CH 4 emissions from pig and cattle manure management correspond to 0. 032 and 0. 015 kg CH 4 kg- 1, respectively, indicating that slurry pits under animal confinements are a significant source. Fractions of degradable volatile solids (VSd, kg kg- 1 VS) were estimated using an aerobic biodegradability assay and total organic C analyses. The VSd in pig and cattle slurry averaged 0. 51 and 0. 33 kg kg- 1 VS, and it was estimated that on average 43 and 28 % of VSd in fresh excreta from pigs and cattle, respectively, had been lost at the time of sampling. An empirical model of CH 4 emissions from slurry was reparameterised based on experimental results. A sensitivity analysis indicated that predicted CH 4 emissions were highly sensitive to uncertainties in the value of lnA of the Arrhenius equation, but much less sensitive to uncertainties in VSd or slurry temperature. A model application indicated that losses of carbon in VS as CO 2 may be much greater than losses as CH 4. Implications of these results for the correct estimation of CH 4 emissions from manure management, and for the mitigation potential of treatments such as anaerobic digestion, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>manure</b> lagoons {{are known}} to be sources of odor and {{environmentally}} damaging gas emissions. Land application of the <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> after <b>storage</b> can lead to detrimental nutrient runoff and leaching. Floating lagoon covers (biocovers) are one option for reducing emissions, but to date they have only been used to address odors and emissions but not {{to address the problem of}} nutrient loss. This study evaluated the potential of floating biochar covers to reduce odor and gas emissions while simultaneously capturing nutrients from <b>liquid</b> dairy <b>manure.</b> The unique physical and chemical properties of biochars make them promising materials for odor, gas, and nutrient sorption. This new approach has the potential to mitigate multiple environmental problems. Two biochars were used to test this approach: one made from Douglas-fir chips under a low oxygen combustion environment at 650 °C (FC 650), and the other made from Douglas-fir hog fuel pyrolyzed at 600 °C (HF 600). The HF 600 biocover reduced mean headspace ammonia (NH 3) concentration by 7. 5 to 13. 6 μL/L. No significant reduction was found with the FC 650 biocover. These biochars were able to sorb and hold nutrients while floating on the surface. Nutrient uptake by the two biochars ranged from 0. 21 to 4. 88 mg nitrogen g biochar- 1 and 0. 64 to 2. 70 mg phosphorus g biochar- 1. Potassium ranged from a loss of 4. 52 to a gain of 2. 65 mg g biochar- 1. The biochars also sorbed calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, aluminum, manganese, and silicon. In a separate experiment, a panel of judges evaluated the odor offensiveness (- 10 to 10 scale) and odor threshold (1 to 10 scale) of five cover treatments including four biochars. Mean odor offensiveness ranged from - 0. 4 to - 1. 4 vs. - 2. 1 for the control. Mean odor threshold ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 1 vs. 2. 6 for the control.

40|$|The {{interactive}} effects of soil texture {{and type of}} N fertility (i. e., manure vs. commercial N fertilizer) on N 2 O and CH 4 emissions have not been well established. Th is {{study was conducted to}} assess the impact of soil type and N fertility on greenhouse gas fluxes (N 2 O, CH 4, and CO 2) from the soil surface. The soils used were a sandy loam (789 g kg− 1 sand and 138 g kg− 1 clay) and a clay soil (216 g kg− 1 sand, and 415 g kg− 1 clay). Chamber experiments were conducted using plastic buckets as the experimental units. The treatments applied to each soil type were: (i) control (no added N), (ii) urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), and (iii) <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurry.</b> Greenhouse gas fluxes were measured over 8 weeks. Within the UAN and swine manure treatments both N 2 O and CH 4 emissions were greater in the sandy loam than in the clay soil. In the sandy loam soil N 2 O emissions were significantly different among all N treatments, but in the clay soil only the manure treatment had significantly higher N 2 O emissions. It is thought that the major differences between the two soils controlling both N 2 O and CH 4 emissions were cation exchange capacity (CEC) and percent water-filled pore space (%WFPS). We speculate that the higher CEC in the clay soil reduced N availability through increased adsorption of NH 4 + compared to the sandy loam soil. In addition the higher average %WFPS in the sandy loam may have favored higher denitrification and CH 4 production than in the clay soil...|$|R

40|$|On-farm {{emissions}} from animals and manure {{must be taken}} into account when the GHG mitigation potential of grassland management strategies involving grazing are evaluated. Greenhouse gas (GHG) {{emissions from}} manure management include direct emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O, as well as indirect emissions of N 2 O derived from NH 3 /NOx. Quantification of GHG emissions from manure are typically based on national statistics for manure production and housing systems combined with emission factors which have been defined by the IPCC or nationally. The quality of GHG inventories for manure management is critically dependent on the applicability of these emission factors. Animal manure is collected as solid manure + urine, as <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> (<b>slurry)</b> or as deep litter, or it is deposited outside in drylots or on pastures. These manure categories represent very different potentials for GHG emissions, as also reflected in the methane conversion factors and nitrous oxide emission factors, respectively. However, even within each category the variations in manure composition and storage conditions can lead to highly variable emissions in practice. This variability is a major source of error in the quantification of the GHG balance for a system. To the extent that such variability is influenced by management and/or local climatic conditions, it may be possible to improve the procedures for estimating CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from manure. Manure (dung and urine) deposited during grazing influences fluxes of both CH 4, N 2 O and NH 3 from the pasture. In particular, urine patches are important point sources of NH 3 and N 2 O, whereas the N input may locally reduce CH 4 oxidation activity. Ammonia losses from pastures are not specifically represented in the IPCC methodology, which calculates NH 3 volatilization as a fixed proportion of total N excreted. However, ammonia losses from excretal returns to the pasture increase with N surplus in the diet since this N is mainly excreted as urea in the urine. Also, several methodologies exist for mitigating NH 3 losses from storage facilities. Hence, both optimized feeding and restricted access to grazing with collection of manure on the farm are available as NH 3 mitigation options, though not identified by the IPCC methodology. Technical solutions to reduce NH 3 volatilization from <b>storages</b> may reduce (<b>slurry)</b> or increase (solid manure) CH 4 emissions, an aspect that must also be taken into account. The N 2 O emission factor for N deposited on pastures is higher than for N in manure collected during housing, indicating that restricted access to grazing is also a N 2 O mitigation option. Several studies have suggested that N 2 O emissions from excreta deposited during grazing interact with factors like feed composition, stock density, N fertilization, soil compaction and climate. However, there is presently little evidence to suggest that emissions of N 2 O can be consistently changed via management practices. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of storage {{temperature}} on the emission of methane (CH) and carbon dioxide (CO) and on recovery of nutrients from raw dairy <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> (RS) and slurry digested in a methane digester (DS), both slurries were stored in closed 100 L steel tanks under psychrophilic conditions (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C) for a 150 day period. As the storage temperature increased, total methane emission increased in both types of slurry. The amount of methane emitted per unit of volatile solids of the RS and DS was 0. 19 L/g and 0. 10 L/g, respectively. The respective carbon dioxide emissions were 0. 20 L/g for RS and 0. 12 L/g for DS at 20 °C of storage temperature. At temperatures greater than 15 °C, the methane concentration in the emitted gas remained more than 40 % of the total gas. During the experimental period, in excess of 90 % of the total Kjeldahl nitrogen in these slurries was recovered (91. 4 - 93. 7 % for RS and 93. 7 - 98. 4 % for DS) after storage, and ammonium nitrogen was recovered in excess of 100 % (100. 1 - 143. 2 % for RS and 106. 7 - 143. 2 % for DS storage tanks) because of the mineralization of organic nitrogen in the influent. These results indicate that <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> characteristics and <b>storage</b> temperature have significant impacts on methane emission. It can be concluded that on typical farms located in northern Japan, methane emission from manure storage tanks during late fall, winter and early spring may be negligible, because of manure temperatures less than 10 °C. During late spring, summer and early fall, methane emissions can be substantially reduced by using underground storage to maintain lower manure temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Biochar is {{a carbon}} {{sequestration}} technology that has shown potential to inhibit greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and nutrient leaching from soils, however {{the majority of}} biochar research thus far has focused on arable cropland rather than livestock systems or grasslands. Livestock production is an important agricultural system, and manure generated from livestock systems {{is a source of}} GHG emission as well as nutrient loading to surface- and groundwater. The high environmental impact of livestock production in the very areas that biochar has shown potential may suggest that this would be an ideal system for biochar incorporation. However, as grassland systems in the context of livestock production often receive high nutrient inputs in the form of manure which increases the potential for nutrient leaching or runoff, the high-nutrient ash content of biochar may potentially exacerbate this problem rather than suppress nutrient loss from soils. As private companies and government-funded programmes discuss the possibility of scaling the global manufacturing and soil-incorporation of biochar to a rate of gigatonnes per year, understanding the potential of biochar for use within a livestock system could be crucial in helping to develop an appropriate deployment plan for this material. This thesis is therefore focused on the use of biochar in grassland and livestock systems. It first examines the nutrient release from biochar in a sequential leaching experiment. Phosphorus (P) release indicated that provision of soil P (though quantitatively small) may be sustained over time whilst potassium (K+) release was quantitatively large but declined rapidly following the first extraction. An incubation study was then carried out using soil columns amended with farmyard <b>manure,</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> (<b>slurry)</b> or fertiliser (plus an unamended control), each with and without biochar, which sought to determine the impact of biochar on N 2 O release and N and P leaching from soils with diverse nutrient sources. N 2 O emission from the columns was significantly suppressed by the presence of biochar, as was the leaching of mineral N. However, the amount of PO 4 3 [...] P in leachate was increased in biocharamended columns, relative to their unamended counter-parts. A slurry incubation study was then conducted, with a control slurry and four biochar-amended treatments, which explored whether biochar could suppress GHG and NH 3 emission from manure prior to land application. The resulting data indicated that biochar demonstrates potential for GHG suppression but does not demonstrate potential for NH 3 suppression from <b>slurry</b> in <b>storage.</b> Finally, a one-year field-based experiment was completed which analysed the impact of biochar on CH 4, N 2 O, and NH 3 emission as well as nutrient leaching from grassland soils that had been amended with a high rate of manure application (151. 4 m 3 ha- 1 or 409 kg N ha- 1). In this study, biochar demonstrated the potential to suppress each of the three types of gaseous emissions from manure-amended soil, though the differences between mean values were not statistically significant. Extracts from ion exchange resins indicated that annual cumulative K+ leached from biochar-amended plots was significantly higher than the control, and that P and NH 4 + leached from biochar-amended plots was higher than the control {{at the time of the}} first rain event following biochar and manure application. Together, the results of these component studies indicate that biochar may indeed have potential to suppress GHG emissions from livestock systems, most likely through suppression of microbial activity by organic compounds that are sorbed to the char, though (as the mechanisms of GHG suppression by biochar are thus far not well understood) the capacity of biochar to do so may vary based on the type of biochar used, the soil characteristics, and other factors. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that some types of biochar should be used with caution in systems with high rates of nutrient application, unless the ash is removed prior to soil application...|$|R

40|$|Forced {{precipitation}} of struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4. 6 H 2 O) {{can reduce}} dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurries.</b> Optimization {{of this process}} requires that the swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> pH be increased, that magnesium be added, and that sufficient reaction time be allowed for struvite precipitation. To gather data {{that could be used}} for a full-scale continuous-flow struvite precipitation reactor, a bench-scale (14 -L) continuous flow reactor was designed, constructed, and tested. The bench-scale reactor used air sparging for both pH adjustment and mixing, used a peristaltic pump to continuously inject magnesium chloride (MgCl 2. 6 H 2 O), and was operated at a 10 -min hydraulic retention time. The bench-scale system provided a 95 % reduction of DRP in swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> collected from a concrete storage tank with a permeable cover, and a 78 % reduction of DRP in swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> collected from a shallow under floor pit collection system. A bench-scale up-flow clarifier was designed, constructed, and tested for continuous flow separation of the precipitated struvite in order to provide total phosphorus (TP) removal. The up-flow clarifier was unable to continuously settle struvite particles formed in the bench-scale reactor and provided no significant TP removal through the system. The implication of this work for full-scale systems is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} system that {{identified}} magnesium demand for struvite formation by monitoring conductivity changes during continuous injection of magnesium chloride in several swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurries.</b> The conductivity of six <b>manure</b> <b>slurries</b> was monitored to identify the response due to magnesium chloride injection (MgCl 2) and struvite precipitation. Struvite precipitation is a technically feasible treatment method for phosphorus removal and recovery from <b>manure</b> <b>slurries</b> (Burns et al., 2003; Bowers and Westerman, 2005 a). Swine <b>manure</b> <b>slurries</b> often require the addition of magnesium (Mg 2 +) to force struvite precipitation. The quantity of Mg 2 + required for maximized phosphorus removal can be determined through laboratory tests. Optimized struvite precipitation in a field setting requires a real-time method to determine Mg 2 + addition rates during a land application event. This article discusses the requirements of an automated control system which monitors and controls the injection of Mg 2 + to force struvite precipitation, accounting for real-time variations of magnesium demand. Theoretical predictions and pure solution tests provided information capable of determining the magnesium demand for struvite precipitations. After testing six different manures in triplicate, the conductivity responses did not follow theoretical predictions and failed to provide any indication of optimum magnesium injection rates for phosphorus removal...|$|R

40|$|For {{the farming}} {{industry}} {{it is essential}} to use <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> as natural fertilizer. Through new agricultural regulation 2015 in Germany the industry must develop new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader systems because the ammonia and methane emission are limited. In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader. The new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader should use pulsating air to distribute the <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> exactly. The pulsating air, which flows through the pipelines, should be analysed at a test station. For examinations at this test station it is important to find another substitute fluid because <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> smells strong, is not transparent and is also not homogeneous enough for scientific investigations. Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like <b>liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> a non-Newtonian fluid. The substitute fluid must be a shear-thinning substance - this means the viscosity decrease at higher shear rate. Many different samples like soap-water-farragoes, jelly-water-farragoes, agar-water-farragoes, soap-ethanol-farragoes and more are, for the project, examined in regard of their physical properties to find the best substitute fluid. The samples are examined at the rotational viscometer for viscosity at various shear rates and then compared with the viscosity values of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fresh feces, <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> (from earthen lagoons and/or {{concrete}} pits), {{and drinking}} and surface water {{samples were collected}} from 28 pig farms in the Midwestern United States. All samples were tested for hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA by reverse transcription-PCR. Seven of 28 farms had fecal samples that contained HEV. Of 22 farms where pit samples were accessible, 15 contained HEV, and of 8 farms that had lagoons, 3 contained HEV. The highest virus titers were 10 and 103 genome equivalents per 60 ml of <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> in lagoon and pit samples, respectively. None of the water samples tested HEV positive. To determine the infectivity of the HEV found in the positive farm 19 lagoon (designated L 19) or farm 12 pit (designated P 12) samples, pigs were inoculated either intravenously (n = 3) or orally (n = 3) with the L 19 or P 12 <b>manure</b> <b>slurry.</b> Four pigs inoculated intravenously with prototype swine HEV served as positive controls. All positive-control pigs shed HEV in feces and 3 of 4 developed anti-HEV antibodies. Two pigs in the intravenously inoculated P 12 group shed HEV in feces, {{and one of the}} pigs seroconverted to anti-HEV antibodies. None of the pigs in the negative-control, L 19 oral, L 19 intravenous, or P 12 oral group shed HEV in feces. The findings indicate that HEV found in pig <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> was infectious when inoculated intravenously.
