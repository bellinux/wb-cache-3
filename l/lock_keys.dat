2500|$|On March 27, 1996, Lexmark's {{contract}} to make keyboards for IBM expired, and Lexmark transitioned its keyboard business to IBM and other vendors. Some of its manufacturing assets {{were sold to}} a group of Lexmark employees, who formed Unicomp. Unicomp still manufactures its version of the Model M (similar to part number 42H1292 but first renamed 42H1292U and subsequently the [...] "Customizer"), as well as other configurations including updated 104- and 105-key layouts; a Unix layout (where the Ctrl and Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>keys</b> and Esc and tilde keys are transposed); models with integrated pointing sticks or trackballs; and POS-specific models such as those with built-in magstripe readers. When Lexmark discontinued keyboard production in March 1996, IBM continued production in Greenock, Scotland and subcontracted production of the Model M13 keyboard (IBM Enhanced Keyboard with TrackPoint II) to Maxi Switch in Mexico. These companies stopped producing Model M's in 1999 and 1998 respectively. Although current Unicomp models may still be purchased, original production models retain their value well among collectors and computer enthusiasts.|$|E

In the Japanese 106/109-key layout, it {{is located}} on the Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key.</b> Pressing Alphanumeric/Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> alone actually means alphanumeric function, a user has to press [...] key to get caps lock function.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the SHIFT <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT <b>key,</b> the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|R

2500|$|Tilt {{and rotate}} {{movements}} are {{transferred to the}} ball carrier (the mechanism that supports the type element), which moves across the page, by two taut metal tapes, one for tilt and one for rotate. The tilt and rotate tapes are both anchored {{to the right side}} of the carrier. [...] They both wrap around separate pulleys at {{the right side of the}} frame; the tilt pulley is fixed, while the rotate pulley is attached to the shift arm, actuated by the Shift and Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>keys.</b> [...] The tapes extend across the machine behind the carrier, and then wrap around two separate pulleys at the left side of the frame. [...] The tilt tape is then anchored to a small, quarter-circle pulley which, through a link, tips the tilt ring (the device to which the type element is connected) to one of four possible locations. [...] The rotate tape is wrapped around a spring-loaded pulley located in the middle of the carrier. [...] The rotate pulley under the tilt ring is connected through a universal joint (called a [...] "dog bone", which it resembles) to the center of the tilt ring. [...] The type element is spring-latched onto that central post. [...] The type element rotates counter-clockwise when the rotate tape is tightened. [...] The spiral [...] "clock" [...] spring underneath the rotate pulley rotates the element in the clockwise direction. [...] As the carrier moves across the page (such as when it returns), the tapes travel over their pulleys, but the spring-loaded pulleys on the ball carrier do not pivot or rotate.|$|E

50|$|To {{prevent a}} {{screensaver}} from starting, xine sends a scroll <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> {{signal to the}} environment to pretend keyboard interaction took place. This can often lead to issues with other programs running as they receive the scroll <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> as normal input. One example is the Konsole terminal emulator, which changes the behaviour of the arrow <b>keys</b> when scroll <b>lock</b> is used.|$|R
50|$|Num Lock or Numeric Lock (⇭) {{is a key}} on the numeric keypad of most {{computer}} keyboards. It is a <b>lock</b> <b>key,</b> like Caps <b>Lock</b> and Scroll Lock. Its state (on or off) {{affects the}} function {{of some of the}} keys, and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.The Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have cursor control or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had separate number keys and cursor control keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to choose between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} source of mode errors {{may be the}} Caps Lock key. Other common modes {{available}} in PC keyboards are Insert and the other <b>lock</b> <b>keys,</b> Num lock and Scroll lock. Dead keys for diacritics also create a short-term mode, at least if they don't provide visual feedback that the next typed character will be modified.|$|E
5000|$|In a word processor, {{the status}} bar often shows cursor position, {{the number of}} pages in the document, {{and the state of}} the caps lock, num lock, and scroll <b>lock</b> <b>keys.</b> Additionally, many word {{processors}} assign the insert key a behavior similar to that of these three, to allow toggling the insertion modethe state of that is also displayed in the status bar.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards in Poland {{are laid out}} according to the standard US visual and functional layout. Polish diacritics are accessed by using the AltGr key with a corresponding similar letter from the base Latin alphabet. Normal capitalization rules apply with respect to Shift and Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>keys.</b> For example, to enter [...] "Ź", one can type Shift+AltGr+X with Caps Lock off, or turn on Caps Lock and type AltGr+X.|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} these users, WordStar emulation {{programs were}} created. One such program is CtrlPlus by Yoji Hagiya, which remaps the standard PC keyboard, making many WordStar commands available in most Windows programs. CtrlPlus switches the Control and Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>keys</b> {{so that the}} Ctrl key is back where it was on older keyboards, next to the A key. It also gives functionality to the chief cursor diamond commands mentioned in this article.|$|E

5000|$|Keyboard, video, mouse {{switches}} (KVM) {{often use}} the Scroll <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> {{on the keyboard}} connected to the KVM switch for selecting between computers. On KVM switches with On-screen display (OSD), a [...] "double click" [...] of the Scroll <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> often brings up the OSD, allowing the user to select the desired computer from a list or access the configuration menu of the KVM. Some models, especially those which lack an OSD, switch to the input corresponding to the number key pressed after Scroll Lock, {{or in the case}} of some 2-port switches, the up and down arrow keys. Simple models with only two or four inputs may immediately switch to the next input following a double press of the Scroll <b>Lock</b> <b>key.</b>|$|R

50|$|These keys {{were common}} in both {{cabinetry}} and door locks in early Colonial America and remained in common usage within the United States through the 1940s, giving way after World War II to the pin tumbler lock. Most keys {{of this type}} and their locks were formed of brass, although pewter was sometimes used. They were commonly available at hardware and other stores. Today, lever <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are associated with fine cabinetry.|$|E
50|$|In June 2007, Microsoft {{introduced}} the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 7000. This keyboard {{has the same}} key layout as the older Natural Ergonomic 4000. The biggest {{difference between the two}} is that the Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard is wireless. Besides the color palette, the other difference is that the Natural Ergonomic 4000 includes light indicators that signal when the Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and F <b>Lock</b> <b>keys</b> have been depressed and active. In their place, on the Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard, resides the battery indicator light.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are {{scattered}} around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. Some ergonomic keyboards instead place the lock indicators in between the key split. Some brands of keyboards have a function mode key (also called F mode or Office Lock), and may replace the scroll lock indicator with an office lock indicator. Office Lock, when enabled, will enable alternate functions of the function keys, meant for use with various word processing or email programs.|$|E

50|$|A {{lever lock}} {{is made up}} of a set of 'levers' (typically between two and five) which are raised to {{different}} heights by the key when it is turned. Once all the levers have been moved to the correct height, the locking bolt is free to slide across and secure the door. The teeth or bittings of the key have flat tops rather than being pointed. Lever <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> tend to be bigger and less convenient for carrying, although lever locks are considered to be harder to pick and so are recommended by most insurance companies.|$|E
50|$|When {{the control}} key is held down, letter keys {{produce the same}} control {{characters}} regardless {{of the state of}} the shift or caps <b>lock</b> <b>keys.</b> In other words, it does not matter whether the key would have produced an upper-case or a lower-case letter. The interpretation of the control key with the space, graphics character, and digit keys (ASCII codes 32 to 63) vary between systems. Some will produce the same character code as if the control key were not held down. Other systems translate these keys into control characters when the control key is held down. The interpretation of the control key with non-ASCII ("foreign") keys also varies between systems.|$|E
5000|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move the cursor to {{different}} positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor {{to the beginning of}} the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop.The Insert key is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The Backspace key deletes the preceding character.Lock keys lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The <b>lock</b> <b>keys</b> are scattered around the keyboard.
