40|$|International audienceSoftware {{transactional}} memory (STM) {{can lead}} to scalable implementations of concurrent programs, as the relative performance of an application increases {{with the number of}} threads that support it.

In this paper, we propose FASTLANE, a new STM system that bridges the performance gap between sequential execution and classical STM algorithms when running on few cores. FASTLANE seeks to reduce instrumentation costs and thus performance degradation in its target operation range. We introduce a family of algorithms that differentiate between two types of threads: One thread (the master) is allowed to commit transactions without aborting, thus with minimal instrumentation and management costs, while other threads (the helpers) can commit transactions only when they do not conflict with the master. Helpers thus contribute to the application progress without impairing on the performance of the master. We implement FASTLANE within a state-of-the-art STM runtime and compiler. Multiple code paths are produced for execution on a single, few, and many cores. Applications can dynamically select a variant at runtime, depending on the number of cores available for execution.

40|$|Abstract. Mutual {{exclusion}} (mutex) locks limit concurrency but offer low single-thread latency. Software transactional memory (STM) typically {{has much}} higher latency, but scales well. We present transactional mutex locks (TML), which attempt {{to achieve the}} best of both worlds for read-dominated workloads. We also propose compiler optimizations that reduce the latency of TML to within a small fraction of mutex overheads. Our evaluation of TML, using microbenchmarks on the x 86 and SPARC architectures, is promising. Using optimized spinlocks and the TL 2 STM algorithm as baselines, we find that TML provides the low latency of locks at <b>low</b> <b>thread</b> levels, and the scalability of STM for read-dominated workloads. These results suggest that TML is a good reference implementation to use when evaluating STM algorithms, and that TML is a viable alternative to mutex locks for a variety of workloads. ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, dressmakers {{struggled}} {{to compete with the}} burgeoning ready-made industry. Anna and Laura Tirocchi, Italian immigrants from Guarcino, owned a prominent dressmakers shop in the Federal Hill area of Providence, Rhode Island, from 1915 to 1947. The Tirocchi sisters made dresses, blouses, and coats with imported 2 ̆ 2 robes 2 ̆ 2 from Paris, which are defined as pre-embellished lengths of fabric, as a competitive strategy against the advancing ready- made industry. These robes arrived folded together and sewn to a <b>low</b> <b>thread</b> count strip of fabric with a tag identifying the country of origin and importer. They included plain fabric for a slip and fabric with the ornamentation already complete that required minimal stitching to create a garment. The unfitted, tubular shape of twenties fashions made construction especially simple.

This research examined robes and extant garments from the Tirocchi collections housed in the Historic Textile and Costume Collection at the University of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum and evaluated their use as a strategy in dressmaking businesses, an industry in transition. The Tirocchis use of robes as a competitive business strategy against the ready-made industry was short-lived. Anna and Laura used robes most heavily during the fall of 1922 through 1923, after which the sisters increasingly began to rely on the sale of ready-made garments rather than custom made garments. ...|$|E
40|$|In this project, we {{implement}} modern metal {{organic chemical}} vapor deposition (MOCVD) technology to fabricate monolithic platforms which integrate traditionally incompatible materials with {{the ultimate goal of}} achieving high brightness green to amber light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs). Unconventional compositions of aluminum indium gallium phosphide (AlInGaP), with lattice constants less than that of GaAs, offer improved electrical and optical characteristics over commonly used GaAsmatched material. Also, integration of optical III-V material on the CMOS platform has long been a technological goal, and these compositions of AlInGaP are amenable to monolithic integration on the (100) Si platform. In this thesis, we pioneer technology to integrate high quality, novel AlInGaP alloys on III-V substrates (and elsewhere, this technology is successfully extended for III-V integration on (100) Si). We first focus on creating a virtual substrate upon which any lattice constant intermediate to GaAs and GaP is available. Large amounts of lattice mismatch are ultimately relaxed through incremental introduction of strain in compositionally graded epitaxial layers, thus breaking the typical lattice-matched constraint of semiconductor systems. Tensile relaxed gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) graded layers yield virtual substrates with extremely low threading defect densities ([rho]t= 104 cm- 2), while extremely thin, 1. 3 [mu]m compressively graded GaAsP buffers also yield <b>low</b> <b>thread</b> densities ([rho]t= 105 cm- 2). The lack of phase separation defects along with the atomically smooth nature of the tensile films leads to suppression of dislocation nucleation and efficient dislocation glide which together facilitate complete strain relaxation with minimal escalation of [rho]t. (cont.) Next we present microstructural studies of AlInGaP lattice-matched to these virtual substrates. Atomic mechanisms of formation of defects including CuPt-B atomic order, phase separation defects and GaAsP surface undulation are understood. A competitive two-step model which describes their creation at the growth surface and subsequent destruction in a high diffusivity subsurface layer makes possible intuitive adjustment of MOCVD growth parameters for defect-free AlInGaP heterostructures. Finally, fabrication of LEDs is discussed. As predictions show, electroluminescence color ranges from green (570 nm) to amber (606 nm).

40|$|Reweaving and reknitting {{techniques}} rebuild {{losses in}} textiles by replacing damaged yams to duplicate original structures and patterns. Traditionally viewed as restorative methods used mainly for consumer clothing and household furnishings, reweaving and reknitting have much potential for {{adaptation to the}} repair and stabilization of historic and collectible textiles. Standard textile conservation repair and stabilization techniques utilize handsewn underlay and overlay patches and adhesive-coated underlay supports. Although these techniques can provide practical and time-saving approaches {{for a wide variety}} of situations, problems with these techniques can sometimes develop over the long term when issues of structural integrity and appearance are concerned. While reweaving and reknitting techniques can provide superior aesthetic and structural results, they require more time and are more costly. This study evaluated the possibility of expanding the use of reweaving and reknitting techniques in the repair and stabilization of damaged textiles to meet textile conservation challenges. The research involved a panel review of actual textiles that had received various stabilizing treatments and a statistical analysis of the evaluation data. This report includes detailed instructions outlining basic reweaving and reknitting techniques and a discussion of applying these and traditional treatments to woven and knit fabrics. Three different reweaving or reknitting techniques, applying an underlay with hand stitching, and attaching an adhesive-coated backing were used to repair damaged fabrics. The textiles treated represented a range of woven and knitted structures including a plain weave I <b>low</b> <b>thread</b> count, plain weave I high thread count, twill weave, patterned weave, stockinet knit, double knit, and patterned knit. Each of the three treatments was applied to each of the seven fabrics. The 21 fabric I treatment combinations were examined by a panel of reviewers and evaluated with respect to specific qualities of visual appearance, structural integrity, and effect of repair on drape. They recorded their rating on a Visual Analogue Scale. The evaluators (n = 49) of the treated fabrics gave the reweaving and reknitting treatments statistically significantly higher ratings in all of the three qualities reviewed compared with the treatment samples repaired with standard textile conservation repair and stabilization techniques. These repairs took the longest time to complete with average completion times ranging from 2. 63 to 17. 50 hours per sample. The treatment samples repaired with the textile conservation techniques of applying an underlay with hand stitching and an adhesive-coated backing received the lowest ratings in all of the three qualities with no statistically significant difference between the means of these two conservation techniques. Both textile conservation techniques took the least time to complete with average completion times ranging from 0. 88 to 2. 00 hours. The high ratings that the reweaving and reknitting treatment samples received in this research suggest the need for curators and conservators to be aware of the benefits of reweaving and reknitting and consider using these techniques to repair objects that merit the time and expenditure required. This research confirmed the lack of current, thorough information on reweaving and reknitting techniques and negligible commentary in the textile conservation literature to explain the application of these methods; this seems to indicate their minimal use or consideration in the field...|$|E

Pure thermal diffusion cannot explain the present results which are applied to improve the strain relaxation of pseudomorphic SiGe/Si (1 0 0) ultra thin buffer layers with <b>low</b> <b>threading</b> dislocation densities.
