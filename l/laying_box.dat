5000|$|... 1974, the {{administration}} of Postes et Télécommunications chose to bury 40,000 km of networks. The company invented the lateral translation of the wheel and the <b>laying</b> <b>box</b> to facilitate work {{on the verge of}} the road.|$|E
50|$|The Jenter kit uses {{a system}} of plastic cups or 'cells' in which a queen bee can lay her eggs. The cells {{containing}} the eggs can then {{be removed from the}} <b>laying</b> <b>box</b> and placed into an isolated box for larval development - with no direct handling of the larvae.|$|E
60|$|Wardour {{persisted in}} letting the dice fall out carelessly, {{just as they}} <b>lay</b> in the <b>box.</b>|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{towards the}} wheel, where, in two rough wooden <b>boxes,</b> <b>lay</b> {{a mass of}} shrivelled vegetation, {{supposed}} by all the ship to represent Assam orchids of fabulous value.|$|R
60|$|But Margery {{had hardly}} given herself time to heed these things. Her eye {{had been caught}} by objects of quite another quality. A large white oblong paper <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> against {{the inside of the}} tree; over it, on a splinter, hung a small oval looking-glass.|$|R
50|$|Kor tells it: “On {{the table}} in my studio there <b>lay</b> an open <b>box</b> of {{cigarettes}} and a ray of sunshine fell on the silver paper and sparkled inside it and in {{a fraction of a}} second the idea was born to write a book about a silver fish".|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the party had reached the automobile. As Dick had surmised, several straps and ropes <b>lay</b> in the <b>box</b> under the back seat, and with these they bound the man's hands behind him. Once he started to resist, but when Tom raised his shining pistol he wilted.|$|R
60|$|The box was a tin one, {{and not all}} rusty. Gale pried {{open the}} {{reluctant}} lid. A faint old musty odor penetrated his nostrils. Inside the <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> a packet wrapped in what once might have been oilskin. He took it out and removed this covering. A folded paper remained in his hands.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{with the}} aid of a big {{jack-knife}} and the dining-room poker, Jeekie had prized off the lid of the box. Chancing to look round Barbara saw him on his knees muttering something in a strange tongue, and bowing his white head until it touched an object that <b>lay</b> within the <b>box.</b>|$|R
60|$|When Pierston {{got to his}} floor {{again he}} found that the cellar door was open; some bottles were {{standing}} empty that had been full, and many abstracted altogether. All other articles in the house, however, appeared to be intact. His letter to his housekeeper <b>lay</b> in the <b>box</b> as the postman had left it.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the table}} stood a little wooden box, open, and empty. On {{one side of}} the <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> some jewellers' cotton. On the other side, was a torn sheet of white paper, with a seal on it, partly destroyed, and with an {{inscription}} in writing, which was still perfectly legible. The inscription was in these words: ...|$|R
60|$|The search {{took only}} a few moments. The monkeys ran and jumped around them, gibbering as though with pleasure. The leopard watched them always with a snarl and an evil light in his eye. They found nothing unusual until {{they came to the}} distant corner, where a huge piano <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> on its side with the opening turned to the wall.|$|R
60|$|Aaron rummaged in his shed at {{the bottom}} of the garden, and found a spade and a box that was suitable. Then he came out to his neat, bare, wintry garden. The girls flew towards him, putting the elastic of their hats under their chins as they ran. The tree and the <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> on the frozen earth. The air breathed dark, frosty, electric.|$|R
25|$|Kirkman was {{inspired}} to box by his older brother, Steve, whom he frequently sparred with for fun. A school friend who noticed his {{lack of interest in}} reading suggested the book Somebody Up There Likes Me to him. In a short time, he had finished the book. Shortly thereafter, the book was made into a self-titled film, to which Kirkman was elated to discover. The duo convinced Kirkman that his future <b>lay</b> in <b>boxing.</b> Kirkman's first training sessions at age 14 involved traveling to a south Seattle gymnasium to work out from his school in Renton, Washington. The venue was suggested to him by former professional Joey Velez. Kirkman took a year-long hiatus from boxing due to injury, but returned to the gym and won several local Golden Gloves events afterward, slowly building a reputation.|$|R
6000|$|So {{she wished}} {{for a nice}} boat, and in the <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> a key with the name [...] "Water Lily" [...] on it. She guessed what it meant, {{and in the morning}} told her brother to come to the river and see what she had for him. There lay a pretty green and white boat, with {{cushioned}} seats, a sail all spread, and at the mast-head a little flag flying in the wind, with the words [...] "Water Lily" [...] on it in gold letters.|$|R
60|$|The dolls took a nap of some hours, {{and were}} roused by a general {{tumbling}} {{out on a}} long shelf, where many other parcels lay, and lively men sent letters and papers flying here and there as if a whirlwind was blowing. A long <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> beside the dolls who stood nearly erect leaning against a pile of papers. Several holes were cut in the lid, and {{out of one of}} them was thrust a little black nose, as if trying to get air.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate pens switching, closing nest <b>boxes</b> after egg <b>laying</b> and nest <b>boxes</b> switching inside the same pen as management procedures for controlling broodiness in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders and their role in circulating prolactin. Black bronze turkey (n. = 350) and Muscovy duck (n. = 700) were randomly selected and housed on deep litter. The results showed a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) increase in egg production in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pens switching and closing nest boxes after end of egg laying. While, there was no significant (P > 0. 05) difference in egg production in response to switching of nest boxes in turkey hens but a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) result was found in Muscovy ducks. On the other hand, there were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) decreases in circulating prolactin level and broodiness in both turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pen switching, closing nest <b>boxes</b> after egg <b>laying</b> and nest <b>boxes</b> switching. In conclusion, application of these management procedures was associated with increased egg production while decreased expression of broodiness (incubation behaviour) and circulating prolactin in turkey hens and Muscovy ducks...|$|R
60|$|A {{few hours}} later, alarmed {{at what she}} {{had heard of the}} inroads of the sea, which had risen higher than ever known to the oldest settler, and perhaps mindful of yesterday's footprints, she sought her old secluded haunt. The wreck was still there, but the sea had reached it. The {{excavation}} between its gaunt ribs was filled with drift and the seaweed carried there by the surges and entrapped in its meshes. And there, too, caught as in a net, <b>lay</b> the wooden <b>box</b> of securities Sol. Catlin had abandoned to the sea.|$|R
60|$|That luckless box {{containing}} the stones had first been ornamented with a baron's coronet, when Beatrix {{was engaged to}} the young gentleman from whom she parted, and afterwards the gilt crown of a duchess figured on the cover, which also poor Beatrix was destined never to wear. Lady Castlewood opened the case mechanically and scarce thinking what she did; and behold, besides the diamonds, Esmond's present, there <b>lay</b> in the <b>box</b> the enamelled miniature of the late Duke, which Beatrix had laid aside with her mourning when the King came into the house; and which the poor heedless thing very likely had forgotten.|$|R
60|$|Aynesworth {{made his}} way upstairs. Lady Ruth was alone, and he noticed that she had {{withdrawn}} to a chair where she was invisible to the house. Even Aynesworth himself could not see her face clearly at first, for she had chosen the darkest corner of the box. He gathered an impression of a gleaming white neck and bosom rising and falling rather more quickly than was natural, eyes which shone softly through the gloom, and the perfume of white roses, a great cluster of which <b>lay</b> upon the <b>box</b> ledge. Her voice was scarcely raised above a whisper.|$|R
60|$|This gave Lanty an idea. A {{little round}} <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> near, which, as he remembered, {{contained}} a Jack-in-the-box, or Polichinelle, which the poor little Chevalier had {{bought at the}} fair at Tarascon. This he contrived to secrete and hand to Victorine. 'Keep the secret,' he said, 'and you will find your best guardian in that bit of a box.' And when that very evening an Arab showed some intentions of adding her to his harem, Victorine bethought herself of the box, and unhooked in desperation. Up sprang Punch, long-nosed and fur-capped, right in the bearded face.|$|R
5000|$|Rushin and Lobo {{live with}} their four {{children}} in Western Connecticut. In May, 2007, he was the Commencement Day speaker at Marquette, where he was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters for [...] "his unique gift of documenting the human condition through his writing." [...] "Sometimes it pays to think inside a box. And so my daughter and I <b>lay</b> in that <b>box</b> and gazed out at the dozens upon dozens of tulips my wife planted in rows last fall. They bloomed this month, tilting ever so slightly toward the sun. And I thought how remarkable it is that in nature, life wants to grow towards the light." ...|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy {{lay there}} on the box, and he {{certainly}} was pathetic looking. A dead animal or bird is always pathetic looking, and none was ever more so than Unc' Billy Possum as he <b>lay</b> on that <b>box.</b> His hair was all rumpled up, as it usually is. It was filled with dust {{from the floor and}} bits of straw. His lips were drawn back and his mouth partly open. His eyes seemed to be closed. As a matter of fact, they were open just a teeny, weeny bit, just enough for Unc' Billy to watch Farmer Brown's boy. But to have looked at him you would have thought him as dead as the deadest thing that ever was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{try to live}} up to my privileges," [...] said Bartley, with a sigh of relief. He {{gave her}} a kiss, and then he unclasped Kinney's nugget from his watch-chain, and {{fastened}} it on the baby's necklace, which <b>lay</b> in a <b>box</b> Marcia had just taken from her trunk. She did not speak; but Bartley felt better to have the thing off him; Marcia's gentleness, the tinge of sadness in her tone, made him long to confess himself wrong in the whole matter, and justly punished by Ricker's contempt and Witherby's dismissal. But he did not believe that he could trust her to forgive him, and he felt himself unable to go through all that without the certainty of her forgiveness.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{back in his}} {{own room}} a fearful joy possessed the young man’s mind; and as he {{recalled}} her face struck suddenly white and the broken utterance of her last words, his heart at once exulted and misgave him. Love had indeed looked upon him with a tragic mask; and yet what mattered, since {{at least it was}} love—since at least she was commoved at their division? He got to bed with these parti-coloured thoughts; passed from one dream to another all night long, the white face of Teresa still haunting him, wrung with unspoken thoughts; and in the grey of the dawn, leaped suddenly out of bed, in a kind of horror. It was already time for him to rise. He dressed, made his breakfast on cold food that had been laid for him the night before; and went down to the room of his idol for the box. The door was open; a strange disorder reigned within; the furniture all pushed aside, and the centre of the room left bare of impediment, as though for the pacing of a creature with a tortured mind. There <b>lay</b> the <b>box,</b> however, and upon the lid a paper with these words: ‘Harry, I hope to be back before you go. Teresa.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the table}} beside me burned a lamp, and near it <b>lay</b> a little <b>box.</b> It was of no {{remarkable}} character, and I had seen it frequently before, for it was {{the property of the}} family physician; but how came it there, upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were in no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:--"Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas." [...] Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins? ...|$|R
50|$|Later in 1921, Horace Goldin, {{a magician}} {{working in the}} United States, {{presented}} the first version which might look familiar to modern audiences. Goldin's assistant <b>lay</b> in a <b>box</b> from which her feet, head and hands protruded. Goldin sawed {{through the middle of}} the box, inserting metal sheets to cover the cut ends, and then pushed the two halves a little way apart. This process was then reversed, and the assistant released unharmed. Goldin later developed a sawing illusion that dispensed with boxes and used a large buzzsaw. The success of Selbit and then Goldin led to more and more magicians trying to imitate them with copies or improved versions of sawing illusions. By November 1921 the Thayer magic company in America was advertising a version for sale. A complete prop from Thayer would cost $175 or they would sell plans for $5.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked him}} {{sincerely}} and departed; and, as I passed the station, I {{saw that the}} agent evidently had not felt energetic yet, for my two <b>boxes</b> <b>lay</b> just {{where they had been}} flung out beside the track. As a preliminary experience it was all somewhat daunting, and the country forbidding, raw, even more unfinished than smoke-blackened Lancashire, and very cold; but I had found that every one seemed contented, and many of them proud of that new land, and I could see no reason why I too should not grow fond of it. At least I had not seen a hungry or a ragged person since I landed in Canada. Besides, Carrington Manor was less than fifty miles away, though it was evident now that a great gulf lay between Ralph Lorimer, the emigrant seeking an opportunity to learn his business as farm-servant, and the heiress of Carrington.|$|R
60|$|In {{advance of}} the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At {{the rear of the}} sled toiled a second man. On the sled, in the <b>box,</b> <b>lay</b> a third man whose toil was over,--a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor {{struggle}} again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man--man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.|$|R
60|$|Forgetting the Count's earnest injunctions, I threw {{aside the}} rug and, stooping down, tried {{to lift it}} by the handles. In those days I was proud of my muscles, and not {{altogether}} without reason, but it needed all my strength to lift that small box {{from the ground and}} hold it for a moment in my arms. What could it contain? Papers, cards, gambling appliances? Surely it could be none of these! The very idea was ridiculous! The Count de Cartienne had deceived me. I had been made the catspaw of those pale, anxious men who had watched me start so eagerly and scanned me over with many furtive glances. What it was of which I was in charge, I could not tell; but in that <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> their secret, and my first indignant impulse was to open the carriage door and kick it out into the road.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 September 2003 Dodson met Varuzhan Davtyan, {{the man who}} had inflicted {{his first}} career defeat and gained revenge with a victory at The Pavilions in Plymouth. [...] In his next fight Dodson {{traveled}} to the Kings Hall in Belfast to compete for the full British title, eventually beating Allan Foster via stoppage in the 11th round of their contest to lift the belt and become British champion. [...] Following the fight, Dodson took a long <b>lay</b> off from <b>boxing</b> and didn't fight at all in 2004, only returning to the ring at the back end of 2005 with another victory over Varuzhan Davtyan on 23 September. [...] Two more victories followed against international opposition before on 16 June 2006 Dodson met Jamie Hearn for the English super middleweight title. The fight, in Liverpool, resulted in a fifth round stoppage win for Dodson.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{approach is to}} scan in a non-overlapping regular grid or lattice pattern. To illustrate, Figure 2a shows the typical pattern used in software that calculates box counting dimensions from patterns extracted into binary digital images of contours such as the fractal contour illustrated in Figure 1 or the {{classic example of the}} coastline of Britain often used to explain the method of finding a box counting dimension. The strategy simulates repeatedly <b>laying</b> a square <b>box</b> as though it were part of a grid overlaid on the image, such that the box for each [...] never overlaps where it has previously been (see Figure 4). This is done until the entire area of interest has been scanned using each [...] and the relevant information has been recorded. When used to find a box counting dimension, the method is modified to find an optimal covering.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} {{stations}} on the line, Legbourne was provided with staggered platforms situated {{either side of}} the crossing; a signal <b>box</b> <b>lay</b> on the northern side of the crossing and as well as controlling the gates, also regulated access to the two sidings on the down side adjacent to the crossing, which were the station's only goods facilities. The station did not handle livestock. The stationmaster's house is similar in style to that found at other stations on the line and was sited adjacent to the crossing on the down side. The July 1922 timetable saw four up and down weekday services, plus one Sunday service each way, call at Legbourne Road. The station was closed to passengers on 7 December 1953, one of the first such closures on the East Lincolnshire Line, but goods facilities (downgraded to an unstaffed public siding) remained for a further ten-and-a-half years until 15 June 1964.|$|R
2500|$|The {{station was}} {{initially}} named Waltham and Humberstone, {{although it was}} in fact two miles from each village. It consisted of staggered platforms either side of a level crossing; the down platform to the north and the up to the south. The stationhouse, which was visible from the road, was situated {{on the south side of}} the crossing, on the down side of the line. Opposite, at the end of the [...] <b>lay</b> a signal <b>box</b> of typical East Lincolnshire Railway construction; this controlled the crossing and a small goods yard adjacent to the down line. The yard initially handled coal and potatoes, but was later expanded to take cattle with the addition of a large cattle holding pen at its southern end. The goods yard was served by a single siding trailing off the down line which forked either side of the cattle pen. A row of three terraced railwayman's cottages were built on the south side of the crossing, adjacent to the signal box.|$|R

5000|$|It is best {{to leave}} {{photographs}} lying flat on the table when viewing them. Do not pick it up from a corner, or even from two sides and hold it at eye level. Every time the photograph bends, even a little, this can break down the emulsion. [...] The very nature of enclosing a photograph in plastic encourages users to pick it up; users tend to handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently than non-enclosed photographs, simply because they feel the plastic enclosure makes the photo impervious to all mishandling. As long as a photo is in its folder, {{there is no need}} to touch it; simply remove the folder from the <b>box,</b> <b>lay</b> it flat on the table, and open the folder. If for some reason the researcher or archivist does need to handle the actual photo, perhaps to examine the verso for writing, he or she can use gloves if there appears to be a risk from oils or dirt on the hands.|$|R
