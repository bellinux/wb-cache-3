2500|$|An {{hour after}} dawn, Fort de <b>la</b> <b>Crèche</b> near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was {{captured}} by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt {{that there would be}} no reinforcements from Calais. Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring. By [...] the determined German attack from the south had forced the Irish Guards back into the town. At midday, HMS Vimy arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a Royal Marine shore party, then began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from Vimy to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.|$|E
2500|$|Venomous and Wild Swan {{entered the}} harbour next, at 20:35 hours, {{followed}} by Venetia at 20:40 hours. The Germans {{opened fire on}} Venetia with heavier guns {{as she entered the}} harbour, apparently in an attempt to sink her in the harbour entrance to trap Venomous and Wild Swan and bring the evacuation operation to an end. A German shell, probably from a tank, hit Venetia, starting a fire aft and prompting her crew to jettison her torpedoes and burning Carley floats. Another shell hit her [...] "B" [...] gun turret, blowing overboard and killing some of the men there, and German gunfire also inflicted casualties among the men on her bridge, causing her to go out of control and briefly run aground. Gunners aboard Venomous, seeing that Venetia was in danger of being sunk, realized that the Germans had captured [...] Fort de <b>la</b> <b>Crèche</b> on a hill overlooking the entrance and were using its coastal artillery to fire on Venetia. Venomous opened fire on the fort; her first salvo went over it, but her second salvo silenced the forts guns by blowing off one side of the fort and much of the hillside it was on, causing artillery pieces to tumble down the hill. Venomous also detected a German light field gun in the garden of a house and fired on it; her first salvo flattened all of the trees in the garden, set the house on fire, and caused German troops in the vicinity to flee. All heavy German guns fell silent after this and, given a reprieve, Venetia, which had been hit seven times and been unable to embark any troops, was quickly refloated and backed out of the harbour at full speed at 20:48 hours. Venomous—using her engines to manoeuvre because her steering gear had jammed—and Wild Swan followed Venetia out of the harbour, also in reverse, carrying about 400 evacuees each, along the way knocking out a German tank and shooting up two German troop columns. Venomous and Wild Swan then escorted the damaged Venetia to Dover.|$|E

5000|$|During construction, {{a second}} fort, {{a copy of}} the Fort de l'Heurt, was also built at Wimereux. It was called the Fort de <b>la</b> <b>Crèche.</b> Napoleon's letters often talk on the work of {{advancing}} the [...] "forts of l'Heurt and of the Crèche." [...] Of the latter there is nothing left, except the foundations are visible in some places to the discerning eye. The Fort de <b>la</b> <b>Crèche</b> resisted very bad storms because on the drawings of Mr. Vaillant (in the Boulogne Library) they show that in 1870 it was already almost irreparable, while on other sketches by the same painter dating from 1870, Fort de l'Heurt appears whole and undamaged. (warning, another fort is also called Fort of the Crèche, which, more recent, dates from the 1870s. An association has restored it gradually to its original appearance).|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Fort of the Crèche is {{a coastal}} battery of type Séré de Rivières whose {{construction}} {{was completed in}} 1879.

50|$|Jullien's Premier Livre d'orgue has {{a number}} of {{interesting}} features. One of these is that in the preface Jullien claims to have invented five-voice genres, even though such pieces appeared earlier, in collections by Nicolas Gigault and André Raison, published in the late 1680s. Furthermore, the collection concludes, very unusually, with a choral piece, Cantantibus organis. Another vocal work by Jullien, <b>La</b> <b>Crèche</b> de Bethléem, is known by name only, and the second organ book was apparently planned, but never appeared.|$|E
50|$|After {{much damage}} due to storms and {{relentless}} attacks of the British, the fort was finally operational on 16 July 1804.
