The Patagonian steppe {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the guanaco and Darwin's rheas (Rhea pennata), which had been hunted for their skins by the Tehuelches, on foot using boleadoras, before the diffusion of firearms and horses; they were formerly the chief means of subsistence for the natives, who hunted them on horseback with dogs and bolas. Vizcachas (Lagidum spp.) and the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum) are also characteristic of the steppe and the Pampas to the north.|$|R
5000|$|Pseudalopex is a South American genus of canine distantly {{related to}} wolves and is {{technically}} not a fox. When Charles Darwin collected a specimen from San Pedro Island in Chiloé Archipelago in December 1834 during the Beagle survey expedition, {{he observed that}} this [...] "fox (of Chiloe, a rare animal) sat on the point & was so absorbed in watching work, that he allowed me to walk behind him & actually kill him with my geological hammer". In the 1839 publication of his Journal and Remarks, Darwin said [...] "This fox, more curious or more scientific, but less wise, than the generality of his brethren, is now mounted in the museum of the Zoological Society." [...] He said it was [...] "an undescribed species", indicating that it was distinct from the species (L. culpaeus and L. griseus) that occur on the mainland. Later, Darwin's fox was classified as a subspecies (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>griseus</b> fulvipes) of the latter.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{landscape}} transformation {{has been more}} intense and extended in the central depression of central and southern Chile than in the nearby mountain ranges. The original forest cover has almost disappeared; only small fragments persist inserted into a matrix of agroecosystems. This situation may influence the distribution of carnivorous mammals, depending on their degree of habitat specialization and home range size. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate, through the study of feces dsitribution, the habitat selection of the carnivore assemblage in a fragmented environment in southern Chile. We document the selective use of exotic forest plantations of Pinus radiata with a scrub understory by Puma concolor, Galictis cuja, and <b>Lycalopex</b> <b>griseus.</b> Leopardus guigna, despite not showing a statistically significant selection of the native forest, presents a greater number of records in this type of habitat. Habitat selection by the predators studied shows a variable degree of use of altered and fragmented environments. Surrounding forest plantations present an understory ofnative vegetation, which fits the requirement ofmost ofthe carnivores. The levels of spatial overlapping and the adequacy to new environments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} annual and {{seasonal}} food habits of sympatric grey fox (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>griseus)</b> and culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) in a protected area, in southeastern Argentine Patagonia, {{to test the}} hypothesis that both foxes partition prey. Grey foxes consumed a larger proportion of rodents than culpeos (66. 1 % versus 37. % of occurrences in feces, respectively), and culpeos consumed a larger proportion of the introduced European hare (Lepus europaeus) (32. 8 % versus 7. 1 %, respectively). Additionally, arthropods made up {{a significant portion of the}} diet of the grey fox, and occurred in the 95. 5 % of the analyzed feces. Despite the great differences in size of culpeo and grey foxes, the former being significantly larger, both species consumed the same type of prey, and no significant differences in the mean weight of vertebrate prey were detected in their diets. Culpeo and grey foxes diets differed during spring – summer with low values of mean diet overlap (31 %). But in autumn – winter, when prey diversity is lower in Patagonia, diet was more similar and diet overlap (73 %) increased. An exploratory analysis of habitat use by culpeo and grey foxes suggested that both species utilize habitat in a similar way. Our data agree with generalizations about competitive interactions between the large and the small canid in an assemblage. Although both foxes can potentially consume the same type of prey, through interference the larger culpeo would exclude the smaller grey fox from habitats with high-quality prey, resulting in prey partitioning. The possibility that both foxes partition habitat at a finer scale in our study area should be explored. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{function of}} animal seed dispersal depends on species interactions {{and can be}} affected by drivers such as the management interventions applied to protected areas. This {{study was conducted in}} two protected areas in the Monte Desert: a fenced reserve with grazing exclusion and absence of large native mammals (the Man and Biosphere Ñacuñán Reserve; FR) and an unfenced reserve with low densities of large native and domestic animals (Ischigualasto Park; UFR). The study focuses on Prosopis flexuosa seed removal by different functional mammal groups: "seed predators", "scatter-hoarders", and "opportunistic frugivores". Under both interventions, the relative contribution to seed removal by different functional mammal groups was assessed, as well as how these groups respond to habitat heterogeneity (i. e. vegetation structure) at different spatial scales. Camera traps were used to identify mammal species removing P. flexuosa seeds and to quantify seed removal; remote sensing data helped analyze habitat heterogeneity. In the FR, the major fruit removers were a seed predator (Graomys griseoflavus) and a scatter-hoarder (Microcavia asutralis). In the UFR, the main seed removers were the opportunistic frugivores (<b>Lycalopex</b> <b>griseus</b> and Dolichotis patagonum), who removed more seeds than the seed predator in the FR. The FR shows higher habitat homogeneity than the UFR, and functional groups respond differently to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. In the FR, because large herbivores are locally extinct (e. g. Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores are excluded, important functions of large herbivores are missing, such as the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity, which provides habitats for medium-sized opportunistic frugivores with consequent improvement of quality and quantity of seed dispersal services. In the UFR, with low densities of large herbivores, probably one important ecosystem function this group performs is to increase habitat heterogeneity, allowing for the activity of medium-sized mammals who, behaving as opportunistic frugivores, did the most significant seed removal...|$|R
40|$|Species {{morphological}} {{changes can}} be mutually influenced by environmental or biotic factors, such as competition. South American canids represent a quite recent radiation of taxa that evolved forms very disparate in phenotype, ecology and behaviour. Today, in {{the central part of}} South America there is one dominant large species (the maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus) that directly influence sympatric smaller taxa via interspecific killing. Further south, three species of similar sized foxes (Lycalopex spp.) share the same habitats. Such unique combination of taxa and geographic distribution makes South American dogs an ideal group to test for the simultaneous impact of climate and competition on phenotypic variation. Using geometric morphometrics, we quantified skull size and shape of 431 specimens belonging to the eight extant South American canid species: Atelocynus microtis, Cerdocyon thous, Ch. brachyurus, <b>Lycalopex</b> culpaeus, L. <b>griseus,</b> L. gymnocercus, L. vetulus and Speothos venaticus. South American canids are significantly different in both skull size and shape. The hypercarnivorous bush dog is mostly distinct in shape from all the other taxa while a degree of overlap in shape—but not size—occurs between species of the genus Lycalopex. Both climate and competition impacts interspecific morphological variation. We identified climatic adaptations as the main driving force of diversification for the South American canids. Competition has a lower degree of impact on their skull morphology although it might {{have played a role in}} the past, when canid community was richer in morphotypes...|$|R
40|$|Streptomyces {{metalloproteinase}} inhibitor (SMPI) {{is a small}} proteinaceous inhibitor which inhibits metalloproteinases such as thermolysin (if, = 1. 14 X 10 ~ 10 M). When incubated {{with the}} enzyme, it is gradually hydrolyzed at the Cys 64 -Val 65 peptide bond, which was identified as the reactive site by mutational analysis. To achieve a further understanding of the inhibition mechanism, we attempted to resynthesize the cleaved reactive site by using the enzyme catalytic action. The native inhibitor was resynthesized from the modified in-hibitor (Ki = 2. 18 X 10 ~ 8 M) by incubation with a catalytic amount of thermolysin under the same conditions as used for hydrolysis (pH 7. 5, 25 °C), suggesting that SMPI follows the standard mechanism of inhibition of serine proteinase inhibitors. Temporary inhibition was observed when the native inhibitor and thermolysin were incubated at a 1 : 100 (mol/ mol) enzyme-inhibitor ratio at 37 °C. SMPI showed temporary inhibition towards all the enzymes it inhibited. The inhibitory spectrum of SMPI was analyzed with various metalloproteinases based on the Kt values and limited proteolysis patterns. Pseudomonas elastase and Streptomyces <b>griseus</b> metalloproteinase <b>II</b> formed more stable complexes and showed much lower Kt values (~ 2 pM) than thermolysin. In the limited proteolysi...|$|R
