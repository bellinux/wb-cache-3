On constant external exposure, UV rays gradually degrade the film coating resulting in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss.</b> In this study, two commonly used finishes namely spirit shellac and polyurethane finish were used to investigate the pattern of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> due to UV interference. Two coatings of polyurethane (PU) and spirit shellac finish were applied on {{the surface of}} eucalyptus samples. The gloss levels of these and unfinished samples were monitored for different times of exposure of them to UV light. Gloss was measured at 600 gloss head using a Tri micro gloss meter regularly for 20 hours durations of UV exposure. Observations and analysis revealed that the natural gloss of uncoated samples of eucalyptus were least affected on UV exposure with only 8, 3 %- 10 % loss in gloss. The PU and shellac coated surfaces also showed very little reduction in gloss (6, 9 %- 15, 4 %) most of which happened in the first 40 hours of exposure. Thus both the finishes in this study were found effective to a good extent in maintaining the gloss of the finished surface against exposure to UV light...|$|E

This short review summarises the fundamental semiconductor processes undergone by TiO 2 on UV irradiation and the consequent chemical action of the reactive intermediates so generated.

Paints and polymers, in particular Kapton used on the television camera thermal blanket, showed significant change. Generally, the change was a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>gloss</b> on the polymer with apparent aging on the paint surfaces. The Kapton surfaces showed the greatest change, and postflight analyses showed mass <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 4. 8 percent on STS- 2 and 35 percent on STS- 3 for most heavily affected surfaces. Strong shadow patterns were evident. The greatest mass loss was measured on surfaces which were exposed to solar radiation in conjunction with exposure in the vehicle velocity vector. A mechanism which involves the interaction of atomic oxygen with organic polymer surfaces is proposed. Atomic oxygen is the major ambient species at low orbital altitudes and presents a flux of 8 x 10 to the 14 th power atoms/cu cm sec for reaction. Correlation of the expected mass loss based on ground-based oxygen atom/polymer reaction rates shows lower mass <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the Kapton than measured.

30|$|VEGF mainly {{consisted}} of epoxy vinyl phenolic resin, {{and the color}} change probably because the molecular chain of the phenolic groups was prone to degradation under high temperature, manifesting as coking, yellowing, or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> on its appearance. The deformation of FRP might have occurred because the molecular chains stretch at high temperature but fail to shrink back into the original state when the temperature decreases. Russel (2011) summarized that deformation can be either elastic or viscous. The former often led to cracking and peeling, while the latter produced a pore-free solid. Roberts et al. (2011) concluded that deformation results in dramatic color change at high temperatures, although the films had to be irreversibly elastically deformed to achieve this. It can be concluded that VEGF could withstand the temperature of 120  °C, {{but was unable to}} withstand the thermal shock of 180  °C. Thus, VEGF may be damaged by the high temperature flue gas of power plant bypass. The utilization of FRP may cause corrosion failure under the long-running process of power plant stacks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to detect local gloss and surface {{structure}} changes of sodium chloride tablets. The changes in surface structure were reflected by gloss variation, which was measured using a diffractive optical element-based gloss-meter (DOG). By scanning a surface area, we constructed a 2 -dimensional gloss map that characterized the tablet’s surface structure. The gloss variation results were compared with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and average surface roughness values that were measured by conventional diamond stylus profilometry. The profilometry data showed a decrease in tablet surface roughness as a function of compression force. In general, a smoother surface contributes to higher average gloss values. The average gloss values for this material, in contrast, showed a decrease as a function of the compression force. The sequence of particle fragmentation and deformation together with crack formation in sodium chloride particles resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss</b> for single sodium chloride particles at the tablet surfaces, which could be detected by the DOG.

40|$|International audienceFor several decades, authors {{relied upon}} the {{carbonyl}} index {{to monitor the}} photo-oxidation of polypropylene and {{to account for the}} degradation of the mechanical properties. This paper starts from one question: is the carbonyl band at 1712 cm− 1 in infrared spectroscopy really appropriate to quantitatively measure the extent of oxidation of polypropylene? This article brings a negative answer to this question, and the results given in this paper suggest that carbonyl detection by infrared spectroscopy, despite it has been used for years, is not the absolute probe to monitor the photooxidation of polypropylene. Hence, the article aims to provide new relevant and quantitative criteria. These criteria allow the photo-oxidation of PP to be correlated with properties degradation, the one of interest in this case being the gloss loss, which reflects the loss of the surface mechanical properties. These criteria give an early warning of the degradation and permit anticipating the loss of polypropylene functional properties. There are various criteria that can be proposed, the methyl band at 1456 cm− 1 being the easiest way to measure the oxidation. It is shown that the modifications of the methyl absorbance fit quite well the increase of crystallinity, molecular weight, and it quite-well reflects the micro-hardness, this last parameter being well correlated to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss...</b>|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{symmetry}} of the contour plot in Figs.  3 and 4, indicates that UA, chosen for its extreme photocatalytic activity [5], {{has the same}} effect on the gloss decay as ZnO. Even though it is known that zinc oxide can behave as a photocatalyst, this similar behavior was unexpected as the photocatalytic activity of ZnO is considered to be lower [45]. The similarity may alternatively stem from a dispersion effect, as mixtures containing ZnO, based on the initial gloss, may have a lower quality of dispersion. Thus less oil needs to be degraded for a similar relative <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gloss.</b> Nevertheless, ZnO-containing paints also reach the chalking stage. Thus ZnO definitely contributes to the degradation. It would be interesting to investigate different qualities of ZnO pigments and their effect on oil degradation rates. Furthermore, the relation between ZnO photocatalytic activity and other ZnO-related degradation problems such as soap formation [46, 47] may be an interesting avenue to pursue further. While ZnO is known for its reactivity towards stearates, the interaction between ZnO and AlSt does not {{play a role in the}} gloss decay, either indicating that soap formation does not influence the gloss of a painting (at this time scale) or indicating that photocatalytic degradation is preferred over soap formation under the conditions used. While both degradation phenomena may be competitive in natural aging, soap formation was not noted as being enhanced by the UV light aging regime used in this study.|$|E
