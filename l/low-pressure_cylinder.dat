25|$|Melville mounted Maines engines {{with the}} {{cylinders}} in vertical mode, {{a departure from}} conventional practice. Previous ships had had their engines mounted in horizontal mode, {{so that they would}} be completely protected below the waterline. Melville believed a ship's engines needed ample room to operate and that any exposed parts could be protected by an armored deck. He therefore opted for the greater efficiency, lower maintenance costs and higher speeds offered by the vertical mode. Also, the engines were constructed with the high-pressure cylinder aft and the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> forward. This was done, according to the ship's chief engineer, A. W. Morley, so the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> could be disconnected when the ship was under low power. This allowed the high and intermediate-power cylinders to be run together as a compound engine for economical running.|$|E
25|$|In 1824, the Allaire Works {{built the}} engine for , the first {{steamship}} {{in the world}} fitted with a compound engine. The high-pressure cylinder was 12inches in diameter and the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> 24inches, with both having a stroke of 4 feet. In the same year, the Allaire Works also supplied a compound engine for a 200-ton towboat called Post Boy, and another for a small steamer, Linnaeus.|$|E

25|$|In 1889 Samuel M. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works {{devised the}} Vauclain {{compound}} locomotive. This design used a double-expansion engine fitted {{into the space}} occupied by a conventional single-expansion engine on the locomotive, using a single piston valve with conventional gear to control both the high- and low-pressure cylinders. The high-pressure cylinder could be placed above or below the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinder,</b> each had its own piston rod connected to a common crosshead, so that one connecting rod and crank was required for each pair of cylinders. Substantial fuel efficiencies were achieved, but maintenance difficulties doomed the type. Most were converted to conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, the cylinders are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of the forward cylinder is usually the forward wall of the rear cylinder. The piston rod of the rear cylinder {{is connected to the}} crosshead in the usual way, but the forward cylinder may have its piston rod, or rods, in either of two forms: either the piston rod of the rear cylinder is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if the forward cylinder be the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> (and thus larger in diameter than the high-pressure cylinder behind), it may have two long piston rods which pass above and below, or to either side, of the high-pressure cylinder in order to reach the common crosshead.|$|E
500|$|On 16 October, Cormoran and her newly {{commissioned}} {{sister ship}} [...] left Germany, bound for East Africa. They arrived in Lourenço Marques, {{the capital of}} Portuguese Mozambique, on 15 December. Cormoran remained there {{for the next seven}} months. In January 1895, she towed the Portuguese cruiser Afonso de Albuquerque back to Lourenço Marques. In July, Condor arrived there to replace Cormoran; the latter was now free to return to her original deployment to East Asian waters. She left East Africa on 5 July. While en route, she stopped in Muscat, Oman, where she paid an official visit to the sultan. On 5 August while steaming in the Strait of Hormuz, the safety valve on the starboard <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the starboard engine was damaged. As a result, Cormoran had to put into Bushehr, Persia, for repairs. Following completion of the repair work, Cormoran cruised to Basra via the Shatt al-Arab, where she paid visits to the local German consul and Turkish authorities.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used saturated steam. The high-pressure cylinders had piston valves arranged {{above the}} <b>cylinders,</b> while the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> had Allen Richardson balanced slide valves, also arranged above the cylinders and all actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Copper steam pipes were arranged {{on each side}} of the dome and passed vertically down outside the boiler to the steam chests of the high-pressure cylinders. The exhaust from the high-pressure cylinders passed through a receiver pipe along the centre of the engine to the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The exhaust from the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> passed to the smokebox and blast pipe through a pipe fitted with flexible connections.|$|R
50|$|Considerable {{trouble was}} {{experienced}} with the tandem arrangement, since the piston rod packing between the high- and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{could not be}} inspected or serviced without removing the high-pressure cylinder.

This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day. The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s.

2500|$|An annular {{engine is}} an unusual type of engine that has an annular (ring-shaped) cylinder. Some of American {{pioneering}} engineer James P.
