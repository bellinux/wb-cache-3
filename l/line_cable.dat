25|$|In {{more recent}} years, TfL has {{expanded}} its rail services, notably with {{the expansion of the}} London Overground network, which has taken over a number of National Rail lines and brought them into the TfL network, each of these converted lines being added to the Tube map. Further additions have been made such as the Emirates Air <b>Line</b> <b>cable</b> car and the boundaries of fare zones. Some commentators have suggested that Beck's design should be replaced with a new design that can incorporate the new lines more comfortably.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{knowledge}} of the statistical distribution of the overvoltages stressing the insulation of a <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> is fundamental for the insulation coordination. The estimation of such distributions requires the utilization of complex numerical programs. In this paper a simplified method which takes into account a typical configuration in a power system “overhead <b>line</b> – <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> – transformer ” is introduced. The results, although in a general form, highlight that the {{knowledge of}} an overvoltage reduction factor, estimated once for all for different cables and power system configurations, {{can be used to}} evaluate in an easy way the distribution of the overvoltages stressing the insulation of a <b>cable</b> <b>line</b> starting from the statistical distribution of the overvoltages impinging the <b>cable</b> <b>line.</b> Index Terms—Overvoltages, <b>cable</b> <b>lines,</b> frequency dependent <b>cable</b> model, overvoltages statistical distributions, insulation coordination...|$|R

25|$|During {{the morning}} Self-Defense Force {{helicopters}} drop water four {{times on the}} spent-fuel pools of units 3 and 4. They measure radiation field of 3.75 Sv/h above Unit 3. In the afternoon it is reported that the unit 4 spent-fuel pool was filled with water {{and none of the}} fuel rods were exposed. Construction work is started to supply a working external electrical power source to all six units of Fukushima I. Starting at 7pm, police and fire water trucks attempt to spray water into the unit 3 reactor with high pressure hoses. Japanese authorities inform the IAEA that engineers are laying an external grid power <b>line</b> <b>cable</b> to unit 2. After watching the helicopter effort on TV Kazunori Hasegawa, president of Chuo Construction, calls the government and offers the use of his two truck-mounted concrete boom pumps to spray water directly into the reactors. TEPCO did not respond for three days, and then stated it would wait for the arrival of similar pumps obtained elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|Transmission <b>line</b> <b>cables</b> require {{impedance}} matching to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses. The distinguishing feature of most transmission <b>line</b> <b>cables</b> {{is that they}} have uniform cross sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform electrical characteristic impedance. Signal terminators are designed to specifically match the characteristic impedances at both cable ends. For many systems, the terminator is a resistor, with a value chosen to match the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and chosen to have acceptably low parasitic inductance and capacitance at the frequencies relevant to the system. Examples include 75 ohm resistors often used to terminate 75-ohm video transmission coaxial cables.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the crosstalk of multiconductor <b>cable’s</b> different core <b>lines,</b> based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, the Crosstalk of the four core <b>lines</b> <b>cable</b> without metal shield layer is researched by simulation. Results show {{that because of the}} cable’s distributed parameters, the far end voltage of disturbing core line is smaller than near end voltage, the voltage of disturbed core lines is smaller than that of disturbing core line evidently. But when cable is working in thunder and rain, the grounding <b>line</b> of the <b>cable</b> may induce very high voltage, and the high voltage may disturb the core <b>lines</b> of <b>cable</b> that used to transfer useful signals, so the crosstalk can’t be neglected. Experiment is done with four core <b>lines</b> <b>cable</b> without metal shield layer that lay on the earth. Experimental and simulation results are nearly same, which are compared. Because of the influence of experimental loss waste, wire connection and so on, voltage got by experiment is smaller than that got by simulation. Results show that FDTD method is effective in analyzing the influence of the lightning voltage signal...|$|R

2500|$|A typical {{parabolic}} antenna {{consists of a}} metal parabolic reflector with a small feed antenna suspended {{in front of the}} reflector at its focus, pointed back toward the reflector. The reflector is a metallic surface formed into a paraboloid of revolution and usually truncated in a circular rim that forms the diameter of the antenna. [...] In a transmitting antenna, radio frequency current from a transmitter is supplied through a transmission <b>line</b> <b>cable</b> to the feed antenna, which converts it into radio waves. [...] The radio waves are emitted back toward the dish by the feed antenna and reflect off the dish into a parallel beam. In a receiving antenna the incoming radio waves bounce off the dish and are focused to a point at the feed antenna, which converts them to electric currents which travel through a transmission line to the radio receiver.|$|E
2500|$|The basic rode {{system is}} a <b>line,</b> <b>cable,</b> or chain several times longer than {{the depth of the}} water running from the anchor to the mooring buoy, the longer the rode is the {{shallower}} the angle of force on the anchor (it has more scope). [...] A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the swinging circle of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight {{to the bottom of the}} rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor. A buoy can be added along the lower portion of rode to hold it off the bottom and avoid this issue.|$|E
