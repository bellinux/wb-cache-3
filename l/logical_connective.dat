25|$|When {{a single}} <b>logical</b> <b>connective</b> or Boolean {{operator}} is functionally complete by itself, {{it is called}} a Sheffer function or sometimes a sole sufficient operator. There are no unary operators with this property. NAND and NOR , which are dual to each other, {{are the only two}} binary Sheffer functions. These were discovered, but not published, by Charles Sanders Peirce around 1880, and rediscovered independently and published by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} such a rule for every <b>logical</b> <b>connective</b> then the {{procedure}} will eventually produce a set which consists only of atomic formulae and their negations, which cannot be broken down any further. Such a set is easily recognizable as satisfiable or unsatisfiable with respect to the semantics of the logic in question. To keep track of this process, the nodes of a tableau itself are set out {{in the form of a}} tree and the branches of this tree are created and assessed in a systematic way. Such a systematic method for searching this tree gives rise to an algorithm for performing deduction and automated reasoning. Note that this larger tree is present regardless of whether the nodes contain sets, multisets, lists or trees.|$|E

40|$|Learning from {{textbooks}} {{is challenging}} because students must understand novel concepts while also comprehending {{the language used}} to convey those concepts. In the domain of science, one posited reason for the perceived difficulty in the reading comprehension of science texts is the low frequency of <b>logical</b> <b>connectives</b> (words that signal relationships between sentences and ideas). To test this claim and discuss its potential effects on the reading comprehension of texts used {{at the middle school}} level, this study measured whether the usage of <b>logical</b> <b>connectives</b> (e. g., therefore, so) differed between science and social studies textbooks. Our findings from a large corpus of 12 science and 12 social studies textbooks showed that science texts contained a higher rate of <b>logical</b> <b>connectives</b> than social studies texts. This main effect of subject area also interacted with grade level: The rate of <b>logical</b> <b>connectives</b> usage increased over grade levels in science but not in social studies. Our results showed further differences in the types of <b>logical</b> <b>connectives</b> used across subject areas, with science texts favoring inferential connectives (e. g., furthermore) and social studies texts favoring contrastive connectives (e. g., however).

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{addressing}} the non-truth-conditional meaning of discourse connectives from a cognitive perspective, relevance theorists have for long pursued {{the argument that the}} relevant expressions do not carry conceptual (≈denotational) meaning, but rather encode procedures, i. e. instructions which guide pragmatic inference by creating cognitive ‘shortcuts’ that the hearer takes advantage of during utterance interpretation. At the same time, they assume that <b>logical</b> <b>connectives</b> are conceptual, rather than procedural encodings.
