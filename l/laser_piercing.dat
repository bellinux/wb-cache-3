40|$|Dental pulp {{stem cells}} (DPSC), a cell type of mesenchymal origin showing high {{proliferation}} and plasticity, are an emerging source of {{adult stem cells}} offering interesting features in view of potential applications in regenerative medicine. These features prompted us {{to develop a new}} method to cryopreserve DPSC inside a whole tooth, thus avoiding the need to purify the cells before cryopreservation and reducing the initial costs and workload of tooth banking. In this study we cryopreserved 4 human deciduous whole teeth after digging micro-channels into the tooth with an Nd:YAG laser beam (<b>laser</b> <b>piercing)</b> to allow the cryopreservative to reach the dental pulp and preserve the cells at - 80 °C. Then, we isolated, expanded and characterized in vitro the stem cells after tooth thawing and mechanical fracture. In parallel, we characterized cells extracted from 2 teeth cryopreserved without <b>laser</b> <b>piercing</b> and from 4 non cryopreserved, non laser pierced, freshly fractured teeth. Our data demonstrate that DPSC isolated from laser pierced cryopreserved teeth show mesenchymal stem cells morphology, immunophenotype, viability and proliferation rate similar to those of cells isolated from fresh, non cryopreserved teeth, whereas significant loss of cell viability and proliferation rate was shown by cells isolated from teeth cryopreserved without <b>laser</b> <b>piercing.</b> These data support the use of this method for prospective whole tooth banking. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} experimental {{investigations of}} laser cutting and piercing, with {{theoretical and practical}} discussions of the results. The thesis {{is made up of}} an introduction to laser cutting and six scientific Papers. These Papers are linked {{in such a way that}} each of them studies a different aspect of laser cutting: process efficiency in Paper I, morphology and melt flow on the laser cut front in Papers II, III and IV and <b>laser</b> <b>piercing</b> in Papers V and VI. Paper I investigates the effect of material type, material thickness, laser wavelength, and laser power on the efficiency of the cutting process for industrial state-of-the-art CO 2 and fibre laser cutting machines. Here the cutting efficiency is defined in its most fundamental terms: as the area of cut edge created per Joule of laser energy. In Paper II a new experimental technique is presented which has been developed to enable high speed imaging of laser cut fronts produced using standard, commercial parameters. The results presented here suggest that the cut front produced when cutting 10 mm thick medium section stainless steel with a fibre laser and a nitrogen assist gas is covered in humps which themselves are covered in a thin layer of liquid. Paper III presents numerical simulations of the melt flow on a fibre laser ablation-driven processing front during remote fusion cutting, RFC. The simulations were validated with high speed imaging observations of the processing front. The simulation results provide explanations of the main liquid transport mechanisms on the processing front, based on information on the temperature, velocity and pressure fields involved. The results are of fundamental relevance for any process governed by a laser ablation induced front. In Paper IV cutting fronts created by CO 2 and fibre lasers in stainless steel at thicknesses between 2 mm and 10 mm have been ‘frozen’ and their geometry has been measured. The resulting three-dimensional shapes have been curve fitted as ninth order polynomials. Various features of the cutting front geometry are discussed, including the lack of correlation of the cut front inclination with either the relevant Brewster angle or the inclination of the striations on the cut edge. In this paper, mathematical descriptions of the cutting fronts are obtained, which can be used as input parameters by any researcher in the field of laser cutting simulations. Paper V investigates the subject of <b>laser</b> <b>piercing.</b> Before any cut is started the laser needs to pierce the material. In this paper the <b>laser</b> <b>piercing</b> process is investigated using a wide range of laser pulse parameters, for stainless steel using a fibre laser. The results reveal the influence of pulse parameters on pierce time and pierced hole diameter. A high speed imaging camera was used to time the penetration event and to study the laser-material interactions involved in drilling the pierced holes. In Paper VI a ‘dynamic’ or ‘moving beam’, <b>laser</b> <b>piercing</b> technique is introduced for processing 15 mm thick stainless steel. One important aspect of <b>laser</b> <b>piercing</b> is the reliability of the process because industrial laser cutting machines are programmed for the minimum reliable pierce time. In this work a comparison was made between a stationary laser and a laser which moves along a circular trajectory with varying processing speeds. High speed imaging was employed during the piercing process to understand melt behavior inside the pierce hole. Throughout this work experimental techniques, including advanced high speed imaging, have been used in conjunction with simulations and theoretical analysis, to provide new knowledge for understanding and improving laser beam cutting and its associated piercing process...|$|E

The pierced hole is normally larger than the kerf width, which means that it cannot lie on the cut line. An experimental program investigating the piercing process as a function of laser and assist gas parameters is presented. An Nd:YAG fibre laser with a maximum power of 2 kW was used in continuous wave mode to pierce holes in 2 mm thick mild steel. Oxygen and nitrogen were used as assist gases, with pressures ranging from 0. 3 to 12 bar. The sizes, geometries and piercing time of the holes produced have been analysed. The pierced hole size decreases with increasing gas pressure and increasing laser power. Oxygen assist gas produced larger diameter holes than nitrogen. A new technique is presented which produces pierced holes no larger than the kerf with and would allow the pierced hole to lie on the cut line of the finished product – allowing better material usage.

40|$|Fibre {{laser cutting}} of mild steel using oxygen and {{nitrogen}} {{is widely used}} in industries throughout the world. An IPG YLR- 2000 Ytterbium fibre machine with a maximum power of 2 kW and a wavelength of 1. 06 µm is used throughout this research. The effects of oxygen and nitrogen as assist gases on the feature of laser cutting process are different in terms of kerf width, surface roughness, heat affected zone and striation pattern. The kerf width in oxygen laser cutting is wider than that for nitrogen. The striation pattern on oxygen cut edge is smoother than that for the nitrogen cut edge. When using oxygen, the cut edge is covered by a fragile oxide layer while this feature is not seen on the nitrogen cut edge. After laser cutting with oxygen, the cut edge is dross free whilst nitrogen cut edge is drossy. <b>Laser</b> <b>piercing</b> is used to generate {{a starting point for}} laser cutting.

Specific point energy (SPE) is a concept that has been successfully used in laser welding where SPE and power density determine penetration depth. This analysis allows welding carried out by different laser systems to be directly compared. This work investigates if the SPE concept can be applied to laser cutting. Laser cutting of various thicknesses of mild steel, two different optical set ups and three different delivery fibres with a range of powers and translation speeds is done to gain results for numerous different parameter combinations. It is found that the SPE concept is applicable to laser cutting and the following effects noted: for given material thickness and any given value of SPE, cost is decreased by using a larger beam diameter; for given cut sheet thickness, cutting efficiency increases with SPE; for given value of SPE, cutting efficiency increases as material thickness decreases...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} experimental {{investigations of}} laser cutting with {{theoretical and practical}} discussions of the results. The thesis {{is made up of}} three papers which are linked {{in such a way that}} each of them studies a different aspect of laser cutting: In paper I the two major laser types in cutting, namely CO 2 and fiber lasers, are compared to each other by a self-defined cut efficiency. Next in paper II the laser cutting process is observed with a high speed imaging, HSI, camera to give information about the melt flow in the cut zone. In paper III the initiation of the laser cutting process, called piercing, is studied. Paper I is about investigating the effect of material type, material thickness, laser wavelength, and laser power on the efficiency of the cutting process for industrial state-of-the-art cutting machines. Here the cutting efficiency is defined in its most fundamental terms: as the area of cut edge created per Joule of laser energy. This paper presents phenomenological explanations for the relative cutting efficiencies of fiber lasers and CO 2 lasers and the mechanisms affecting these efficiencies for stainless steels and mild steel over a range of thicknesses. The paper also involves a discussion of both theoretical and practical engineering issues. In Paper II a new experimental technique has been developed which enables High Speed Imaging of laser cut fronts produced using standard, commercial parameters. The results presented here suggest that the cut front produced when cutting 10 mm thick medium section stainless steel with a fibre laser and a nitrogen assist gas is covered in humps which themselves are covered in a thin layer of liquid. A combination of HSI results and theoretical analysis has revealed that these humps move down the cut front at an average speed which is a factor three less than the liquid flow speed. Paper III addresses a specific topic: Before any cut is started the laser needs to pierce the material. The two most important aspects of the piercing process are: a) How long does it take to pierce the material? And b) How wide is the pierced hole? If the hole is no wider than the cut line, the material can be pierced on the line to be cut. In this paper the <b>laser</b> <b>piercing</b> process is investigated using a wide range of laser pulse parameters, for stainless steel using a fibre laser, to discover their influence on pierce time and pierced hole diameter. A high speed imaging camera is used to time the penetration event and to study the laser-material interactions involved in drilling the pierced holes. Optimum parameters have been identified for both pierce time and pierce hole width.

50|$|Gunstar Heroes is a run-and-gun side-scrolling shooter much in {{the vein}} of Contra. The playable characters, Red and Blue, {{represent}} different control schemes: Red being free shot, which allows the player to move freely while shooting; and Blue being Fixed Shot, which makes the player stay fixed in one spot while firing. There are four different basic weapon types the player can choose from {{at the beginning of}} the game: Force, which fires a rapid series of small bullets; Lightning, which fires straight <b>lasers</b> that <b>pierce</b> through enemies; Chaser, which fires stars that home in on enemies; and Flame, a short range flamethrower that is very powerful. These weapons are dropped as power-ups throughout the game, and the play may hold onto two at a time. By combining two weapons, a new weapon can be formed. For example, combining Lightning and Flame results in a short range beam weapon that ignores most collision from walls and enemies. Counting the basic weapons, there are a total of 14 different possible weapons in the game. In addition to using weapons, the player can engage enemies in close quarters combat. Enemies can be tossed, and other moves can be performed, such as sliding and jumping attacks, and a long-range skid.|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} and numerically demonstrate deterministic {{creation and}} manipulation {{of a pair}} of oppositely charged singly quantized vortices in a highly oblate Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Two identical blue-detuned, focused Gaussian <b>laser</b> beams that <b>pierce</b> the BEC serve as repulsive obstacles for the superfluid atomic gas; by controlling the positions of the beams within the plane of the BEC, superfluid flow is deterministically established around each beam such that two vortices of opposite circulation are generated by the motion of the beams, with each vortex pinned to the in situ position of a laser beam. We study the vortex creation process, and show that the vortices can be moved about within the BEC by translating the positions of the laser beams. This technique can serve as a building block in future experimental techniques to create, on-demand, deterministic arrangements of few or many vortices within a BEC for precise studies of vortex dynamics and vortex interactions.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} technologies that are required for magnesium to be taken up in structural applications. CAST research has focused on a number of these in the value chain. One of the key developments required is new wrought alloys that are more easily processed and have superior properties to the current suite of wrought Mg alloys. A new alloy has been developed that can be extruded more than twice as fast as AZ 31 with similar strength and better ductility. Furthermore, the processability rivals 6000 series Al alloys and better specific strength and ductility. The alloy has been developed primarily for extrusion but could also be used in sheet applications. A key enabling technology required for the uptake of magnesium alloys is joining. Self-pierce riveting (SPR) is a promising solid state joining technique for magnesium, especially for spot joining to dissimilar metals because the formation of brittle inter-metallic phases encountered in fusion joining such as resistance spot welding is avoided. However, while SPR joining of aluminium intensive car, truck and recreational vehicle bodies is well established with over 10 years of commercial application in the automotive industry, SPR joining of magnesium needs further development to prevent cracking of magnesium, especially when placed on the bottom {{in the design of the}} joint. This is because magnesium alloys are generally not ductile enough at room temperature to be joined mechanically by processes such as SPR and clinching which involve forming and plastic deformation. CAST has proven that <b>laser</b> assisted self <b>piercing</b> riveting is able to produce crack free joints of high integrity, even when Mg alloys are on the bottom ply. Another important area of consideration is the deformation of magnesium alloys in crash situations. It has been shown that many magnesium alloys tend to have large plastic hinges upon deformation due to their high work hardening rates. This shows great advantages in some situations where deformation occurs in a larger volume and hence more energy is absorbed. However, this same phenomenon can also cause fracture when the plastic hinge is forced to be a lower radius of curvature than the alloy would naturally bend. Hence, magnesium alloys will provide the greatest benefit when used in applications where deformation is not constrained or global buckling is the most likely deformation mechanism...|$|R
