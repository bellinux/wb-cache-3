25|$|With {{the close}} of the Victorian Era, the {{character}} of Sydney began to change in various ways.

Arguably the world's first surf lifesaving club was founded at Bondi Beach, Sydney, in 1906. In the summer of 1915, Duke Kahanamoku of Hawaii introduced surf board riding to Sydney's Freshwater Beach, amazing locals and starting a long-term <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sport in Australia.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} <b>love</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> man."

500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies.

Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom.

Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him, but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie says he can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer, one of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's <b>Love</b> <b>Affair</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Prom: Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time. Songs played in the episode include [...] "The Streak" [...] by Ray Stevens , [...] "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" [...] by Elton John, [...] "Colour My World" [...] by Chicago, [...] "Pick Up the Pieces" [...] by Average White Band, and [...] "The Hustle" [...] by Van McCoy.|$|E

Queen Margherita was also involved in state affairs: viewing democracy as a potential threat to the monarchy, she supported F. Crispi against in parliament.
