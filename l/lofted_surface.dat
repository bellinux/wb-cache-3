40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} B-spline surface approximation to rows of points by B-spline surface lofting. Lofting is a well known surface create technique and {{has been used in}} CAD and CAGD. However, the traditional lofting approach tends to result in an astonishing number of control points in the process of merging the different knot vectors. This paper presents a new approach fixing this problem. The approach includes a novel process of creating a set of compact B-spline curves from the given points. The process is based on the binary search and the least-squares method, determining a set of local common knot vectors of most of rows of points, which meet the given conditions. Then, fully common knot vectors have been determined by the method of merging different knot vectors. The proposed approach is efficient in computation and can realize more efficient data reduction than previous approach without losing the shape of the <b>lofted</b> <b>surface.</b> Several experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and quality of the proposed approach.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} constructing a smooth surface to fit rows of data points. A special class of T-spline surfaces is examined, which is characterized to have a global knot vector in one parameter direction and individual knot vectors from row to row in the other parameter direction. These T-spline surfaces are suitable for <b>lofted</b> <b>surface</b> interpolation or approximation. A skinning algorithm using these T-spline surfaces is proposed, which {{does not require the}} knot compatibility of sectional curves. The algorithm consists of three main steps: generating sectional curves by interpolating data points of each row by a B-spline curve; computing the control curves of a skinning surface that interpolates the sectional curves; and approximating each control curve by a B-spline curve with fewer knots, which results in a T-spline surface. Compared with conventional B-spline surface skinning, the proposed T-spline surface skinning has two advantages. First, the sectional curves and the control curves of a T-spline surface can be constructed independently. Second, the generated T-spline skinning surface usually has much fewer control points than a lofted B-spline surface that fits the data points with the same error bound. Experimental examples have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{developments}} {{in the field of}} medical imaging modalities have pushed the frontiers of modern medicine and biomedical engineering, prompting the need for new applications to improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases. Biomedical data visualization and modeling rely predominately on manual processing and utilization of voxel and facet based homogeneous models. Biological structures are naturally heterogeneous and in order to accurately design and biomimic biological structures, properties such as chemical composition, size and shape of biological constituents need to be incorporated in the computational biological models. Our proposed approach involves generating a density point cloud based on the intensity variations in a medical image slice, to capture tissue density variations through point cloud densities. The density point cloud is ordered and approximated with a set of cross-sectional least-squares B-Spline curves, based on which a skinned B-Spline surface is generated. The aim of this method is to capture and accurately represent density variations within the medical image data with a <b>lofted</b> <b>surface</b> function. The fitted B-Spline surface is sampled at uniformly distributed parameters, and our preliminary results indicate that the bio-CAD model preserves the density variations of the original image based point cloud. The resultant surface can thus be visualized by mapping the density in the parametric domain into color in pixel domain. The B-Spline function produced from each image slice can be used for medical visualization and heterogeneous tissue modeling. The process can be repeated for each slice in the medical dataset to produce heterogeneous B-Spline volumes. The emphasis of this research is placed on accuracy and shape fidelity needed for medical operations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Lofting {{is widely}} used to {{approximate}} the scanned data in row-wise fashion, but this method is prone to result an astonishing number of control points {{in the process of}} making the rows curve compatible. A novel algorithm of B-spline surface approximation to the scanned data is presented in this paper to solve this problem. Firstly, the scanned data are interpolated by rows of curves; then these curves are approximated by other curves using least square approximation. In this process, all curves are approximated by a common knot vector, and it is different form the traditional method that each curve is approximated by a different knot vector, so we neednâ€™t insert many knots in each curve to make curves compatible. We also can meet high accuracy without losing the shape of <b>lofting</b> <b>surface</b> because we firstly interpolate the data, the best least square approximation substitute insertion of knots in lofting. Numerical example shows that the proposed method is efficient in reducing control points of the <b>lofting</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a mathematical method for producing hard-chine ship hulls {{based on a}} set of numerical parameters that are directly related to the geometric features of the hull and uniquely define a hull form for this type of ship. The term planing hull is used generically to describe the majority of hard-chine boats being built today. This article is focused on unstepped, single-chine hulls. B-spline curves and surfaces were combined with constraints on the significant ship curves to produce the final hull design. The hard-chine hull geometry was modeled by decomposing the surface geometry into boundary curves, which were defined by design constraints or parameters. In planing hull design, these control curves are the center, chine, and sheer lines as well as their geometric features including position, slope, and, {{in the case of the}} chine, enclosed area and centroid. These geometric parameters have physical, hydrodynamic, and stability implications from the design point of view. The proposed method uses two-dimensional orthogonal projections of the control curves and then produces three-dimensional (3 -D) definitions using B-spline fitting of the 3 -D data points. The fitting considers maximum deviation from the curve to the data points and is based on an original selection of the parameterization. A net of B-spline curves (stations) is then created to match the previously defined 3 -D boundaries. A final set of <b>lofting</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the previous B-spline curves produces the hull surface...|$|R

Consequence may be fatal {{in case of}} breakage; a way to treat it is Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) where a stent graft is placed inside the aorta without open surgery requirement. Because of the standards, stent graft can be chosen between several sizes: in some cases, this device cannot fit perfectly with the anatomy of the patient and {{this can lead to}} a not optimal behavior of the prosthesis and further complications. This study present a method to design and test specific custom-fit stent graft able to better adapt to the patient artery improving the efficiency of the prosthesis and reducing the risk of the migration of the graft as well as the fabric torn. The design method is based on a 3 D geometric model of the aorta, generated from CT scan data. Centrelines and geometric data for cross sections along the aorta are the inputs necessary to define the mesh of the stent. A custom algorithm is developed to size the stent in relation to the geometric data of the specific patient; when the frame of the prosthesis is defined, a CAD-based <b>Loft</b> <b>Surface</b> has used to define surfaces between the stent rings. For the bifurcation, again CAD-based Boundary Surfaces is used.

40|$|We use the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) online {{chemical}} transport model to simulate a middle latitude cyclone in East Asia at three different horizontal resolutions (45, 15, and 5 km grid spacing). The cyclone contains a typical warm conveyor belt (WCB) with an embedded squall line that passes through an area having large surface concentrations (> 400 ppbv) {{of carbon monoxide}} (CO). Model output from WRF-Chem is used to compare differences between the large-scale CO vertical transport by the WCB (the 45 km simulation) with the smaller-scale transport due to its convection (the 5 km simulation). Forward trajectories are calculated from WRF-Chem output using HYSPLIT. At 45 km grid spacing, the WCB exhibits gradual ascent, <b>lofting</b> <b>surface</b> CO to 6 â€“ 7 km. Upon reaching the warm front, the WCB and associated CO ascend more rapidly and later turn eastward over the Pacific Ocean. Convective transport at 5 km resolution with explicitly resolved convection occurs much more rapidly, with <b>surface</b> CO <b>lofted</b> to altitudes greater than 10 km in 1 h or less. We also compute CO vertical mass fluxes to compare differences in transport due to the different grid spacings. Upward CO flux exceeds 110 000 t h âˆ’ 1 in the domain with explicit convection when the squall line is at peak intensity, while fluxes from the two coarser resolutions are {{an order of magnitude}} smaller. Specific areas of interest within the 5 km domain are defined to compare the magnitude of convective transport to that within the entire 5 km region. Although convection encompasses {{only a small portion of}} the 5 km domain, it is responsible for ~ 40 % of the upward CO transport. We also examine the vertical transport due to a short wave trough and its associated area of convection, not related to the cyclone, that lofts CO to the upper troposphere. Results indicate that fine-scale resolution with explicitly resolved convection is important when assessing the vertical transport of surface emissions in areas of deep convection...|$|R

Finally, we extend the Catmull-Clark scheme to produce surfaces that interpolate the given curve network. Near the curve network, these <b>lofted</b> subdivision <b>surfaces</b> are CÂ² bicubic splines, except for those points where three or more curves meet.

The {{first step in the}} process of reverse engineering was CT scanning and digitalization of data. CT data were obtained with Toshiba MSCT scanner Aquillion 64 and saved in DICOM format.

The process continues in CAD program with identification and determination of Referential Geometrical Entities (RGEs) which are crucial for RE process. These RGEs are the basis for definition of axis and planes of intersection.

30|$|The Moon {{has a very}} dusty {{environment}} and the charged dusts are <b>lofted</b> by the <b>surface</b> potentials. They would reach up to altitudes about 100 km near the terminator region, relatively higher than the dayside (e.g., Stubbs et al. 2006). Such charged dusts can modify the plasma medium to lead the wave steepening by reducing Landau damping (e.g., Luo et al. 1999). The high occurrence regions of the harmonic waves roughly agree with the dusty region, which are near the terminator at the higher altitudes approximately 100 km {{and even in the}} dayside at lower altitudes. Thus, the dusts possibly affect the wave steepening. The local plasma inhomogeneities around the magnetic anomalies would also contribute to the harmonic waves. The inhomogeneities can refract the waves (Katoh 2014) and make them compressive to develop the nonlinearity (Hada et al. 1987). Furthermore, cusp-like configurations of the magnetic anomalies might enhance the wave energy resulting in the anomalous development of the nonlinearity.|$|R

Here we develop a simplified, idealized model of impact conditions that can be adapted to fit the details of specific deflection-test scenarios, such as what is being proposed for the AIDA project. Ongoing studies based upon the methodology described here can be used to inform observational strategies and safety conditions for an observing spacecraft. To account for ejecta evolution, the numerical strategies we are employing are varied and include a large N-Body component, a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) component, and an application of impactor scaling laws. Simulations that use SPH-derived initial conditions show high-speed ejecta escaping at low angles of inclination, and very slowly moving ejecta <b>lofting</b> off the <b>surface</b> at higher inclination angles, some of which re-impacts the small-body surface.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has become a}} state of the art analysis tool for nearly all phases of aircraft design. In contrast to CFD, computer aided design (CAD) is traditionally used in later design phases of an aircraft, when the design is almost frozen. However, with the appearance of parametric CAD systems a new design methodology was enabled, which was based on the capability of a parametric CAD system to replay construction sequences with varied design parameters. A parametric wing can be re-used to create a vertical tail plane or parts can be associated to other parts, which allow concurrent engineering practices. In the present study, these capabilities have been exploited to generate extremely variable aircraft CAD models ready for CFD. Furthermore, parametric construction strategies, which have been developed in the past, are applied to model the primary aircraft parts, such as wing, fuselage and nacelle and also secondary parts, such as the belly fairing, wing tips and pylon, with the CAD system CATIA V 5. For the construction of curves, which are used to create <b>surface</b> <b>lofts,</b> primarily B-splines are utilized, where the coordinates of the control points can later be used as the design parameters.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{conducted}} the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) mission during 2008 {{as a part}} of the International Polar Year (IPY). The purpose of ARCTAS was to study the factors responsible for changes in the Arctic's atmospheric composition and climate. A major emphasis was to investigate Arctic haze, which is most pronounced during winter and early spring. This study focuses on the spring phase of ARCTAS (ARCTAS-A) that was based in Alaska during April 2008. Although anthropogenic emissions historically have been associated with Arctic haze, biomass burning dominated the ARCTAS-A period and has been the focus of many ARCTAS related studies. This study determines the common pathways for anthropogenic emissions during ARCTAS-A. Trajectories (air parcels) are released each day from three historically significant regions of anthropogenic emissions (Asia, North America, and Europe). These fifteen day forward trajectories are calculated using data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 45 km horizontal resolution. The trajectories then are examined to determine: origins of emissions that reach the Arctic (defined as north of 70 Â° N) within fifteen days, pathways of the emissions reaching the Arctic, Arctic entry locations, and altitudes at which the trajectories enter the Arctic. These results serve as regional "climatologies" for the ARCTAS-A period. Three cases during the ARCTAS-A period (one for each of the regions above) are examined using backward trajectories and chemical fingerprinting based on in situ data sampled from the NASA DC- 8. The fingerprinting utilizes volatile organic compounds that represent pure anthropogenic tracers, Asian anthropogenic pollution, incomplete combustion, and natural gas emissions. We determine flight legs containing anthropogenic emissions and the pathways travelled by these emissions. Results show that the DC- 8 sampled anthropogenic emissions from Asia, North America, and Europe during the spring phase of ARCTAS. The pathways travelled by these emissions agree with our derived "climatologies" and previous studies of Arctic transport. Meteorological analysis and trajectory calculations indicate that middle latitude cyclones and their associated warm conveyor belts play an important role in <b>lofting</b> the <b>surface</b> based emissions to their sampling altitude in all three cases...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that within any member of a significant class of close binary asteroid sys-tems with super-synchronously rotating, roughly spheroidal primary and synchronous elongated secondary, continued YORP angular acceleration of the primary causes it to spin at rates where loose material near its equator is <b>lofted</b> from the <b>surface.</b> Subsequent interaction of the material with the secondary causes that material to lose angular momentum and re-impact alpha, {{but in the process}} angular momentum is transferred to the orbit causing it to expand. We confirm this hypothesis through precise dynamic and ap-proximate statistical simulation, using the well-characterized 1999 KW 4 system model, as KW 4 typifies the class of binaries of interest. Our results visibly demonstrate the transfer of angular momentum and our orbit evolution mechanism. In particular, we observe regulation of Alpha spin rate at the rate for which material lofting begins {{on the same side of}} Alpha as Beta, but not yet on the opposite side, and nearly constant Alpha angular momentum while the orbit angular momentum grows steadily. The linear fit to that growth is consistent with the YORP torque angular acceleration applied. Lofting occurs in fast transient episodes separated by long periods of slow spin-up under that acceleration. The average amount of material aloft and rate of mass lofting are interesting metrics for the systemâ€™s lofting activity level contained in our results, but arenâ€™t physically descriptive at any particular instant given episodic lofting.

40|$|Comet 103 P/Hartley 2 has diurnally controlled, CO 2 -driven {{activity}} {{on the tip of}} the small lobe of its bilobate nucleus. Such activity is unique among the comet nuclei visited by spacecraft, and suggests that CO 2 ice is very near the surface, which is inconsistent with our expectations of an object that thermophysically evolved for ~ 45 million years prior to entering the Jupiter Family of comets. Here we explain this pattern of activity by showing that a very plausible recent episode of rapid rotation (rotation period of ~ 11 [10 - 13] hours) would have induced avalanches in Hartley 2 's currently active regions that excavated down to CO 2 -rich ices and activated the small lobe of the nucleus. At Hartley 2 's current rate of spindown about its principal axis, the nucleus would have been spinning fast enough to induce avalanches ~ 3 - 4 orbits prior to the DIXI flyby (~ 1984 - 1991). This coincides with Hartley 2 's discovery in 1986, and implies that the initiation of CO 2 activity facilitated the comet's discovery. During the avalanches, the sliding material would either be <b>lofted</b> off the <b>surface</b> by gas activity, or possibly gained enough momentum moving downhill (toward the tip of the small lobe) to slide off the nucleus. Much of this material would have failed to reach escape velocity, and would reimpact the nucleus, forming debris deposits. The similar size frequency distribution of the mounds observed on the surface of Hartley 2 and chunks of material in its inner coma suggest that the 20 - 40 meter mounds observed by the DIXI mission on the surface of Hartley 2 are potentially these fallback debris deposits. As the nucleus spun down from a rotation period of ~ 11 hours to 18. 34 hours {{at the time of the}} DIXI flyby, the location of potential minima, where materials preferentially settle, migrated about the surface, allowing us to place relative ages on most of the imaged terrains of the nucleus.

Seasonal composites of TES retrievals, reprocessed {{to remove the}} artificial geographic and seasonal structure added from the a priori, exhibited strong seasonal differences.

Offshore O 3 -CO slopes were generally 0. 15 â€“ 0. 20 mol mol âˆ’ 1 in JJA, indicative of photochemical O 3 production. Composites for 4 predominant circulation patterns or map types in DJF revealed that export to the lower free troposphere (681 hPa level) was enhanced by the warm conveyor belt (WCB) airstream of cyclones while stratospheric intrusions increased TES O 3 levels at 316 hPa.
