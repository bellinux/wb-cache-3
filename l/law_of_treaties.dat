25|$|Similarly, Article 80 of the Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaties</b> (which {{entered into}} force in 1980) {{requires}} {{a party to}} the convention to register any treaty to which it is a party once the treaty enters into force. However, neither Article 102 of the UN Charter nor Article 80 of the Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaties</b> has preserved the latter part of Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Consequently, failure to register a treaty is a violation of the Charter and Convention, but does not render the treaty invalid or ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili {{says that}} the Security Council manifestly lacks the {{competence}} to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition {{of the use of}} force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaties.</b> A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.|$|E

40|$|The {{pacta sunt servanda}} is one of universally {{recognized}} legal principles {{by which}} its existence has been known. Its mere relevance is related to treaty since this principle determines that agreed stipulations concluded among parties become legally binding and cause rights and duties to be fulfilled in good faith manner. As it is recognized and accepted among parties to the treaty, it becomes integral part <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treaty</b> particularly <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> international <b>treaty.</b> The preamble and Article 26 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaty</b> and the 1986 Vienna Convention reiterate its legal existence as the guiding principle to make and to implement international treaty. In the Indonesian legal system, the existence of that principle inspires the formation of Article 1338 of Indonesian Civil Code and of Article 4 (1) the <b>Law</b> Number 24 <b>of</b> 2000. It can be concluded firmly {{that the existence of}} the pacta sunt servanda has formed and evolved as a legal system including the international law legal system today. </p...|$|R

25|$|Criticism of United States {{foreign policy}} {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of opinions and views on failures and shortcoming of United States policies and actions. There is a partly-held sense in America which views America as qualitatively different from other nations and therefore cannot be judged by the same standards as other countries; this belief is sometimes termed American exceptionalism and {{can be traced to the}} so-called Manifest destiny. American exceptionalism has widespread implications and transcribes into disregard to the international norms, rules and laws in U.S. foreign policy. For example, the U.S. refused to ratify a number of important international treaties such as Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaties,</b> and American Convention on Human Rights; did not join the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention; and routinely conducts drone attacks and cruise missile strikes around the globe. American exceptionalism is sometimes linked with hypocrisy; for example, the U.S. keeps a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons while urging other nations not to get them, and justifies that it can make an exception to a policy of non-proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaties</b> which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed {{in such a way as}} to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.|$|E

The Cuban government opposes the treaty, arguing that it violates article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Treaties,</b> titled [...] "Coercion of a State by the threat or use of force".
