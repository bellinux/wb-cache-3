5000|$|The term myopia is of Koine Greek origin: [...] myōpia (or [...] myōpiasis) [...] "short-sight(-ness)", from Ancient Greek [...] myōps [...] "short-sighted (man), (man) {{with eyes}} getting shut", from [...] myein [...] "to shut the eyes" [...] and [...] ōps [...] "eye, look, sight" [...] (GEN [...] ōpos). The {{opposite}} of myopia in English is hyperopia (<b>long-sightedness).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Laser Blended Vision is {{suitable}} in general {{for anyone with}} presbyopia {{who is also a}} candidate for corneal laser eye surgery; the range of preoperative prescriptions that can be treated varies, but results have been published for laser blended vision using the Carl Zeiss Meditec MEL80 excimer laser for myopia (short-sightedness) up to -8.50D with astigmatism, hyperopia (<b>long-sightedness)</b> up to +6.00D with astigmatism [...] and for patients who have emmetropia (good distance vision) but only need reading glasses for computers or near vision. Laser Blended Vision can also be performed after cataract surgery in order to increase the independence from spectacles. Similarly, cataract surgery can be performed together with Laser Blended Vision to provide a patient with better spectacle independence than can be afforded by simple monovision and without the decrease in quality of vision that is produced by a Multifocal intraocular lens. Multifocal intraocular lenses work by splitting the light entering the eye into different focal planes, hence resulting in an eye that never achieves 100% of light at distance or near, however these are increasingly commonly employed for the correction of presbyopia.|$|E

40|$|Analogous to <b>long-sightedness,</b> {{hyperopia}} {{describes the}} condition {{of being able to}} grasp with acuity matters which are far removed from current experience (temporally, spatially or cognitively) while encountering difficulty in interpreting and acting on that which is close at hand. We examine data from a top management team's activity in which they collectively display a hyperopic approach. A single in-depth field study is analysed retroductively to examine the plausibility of potential causal mechanisms that might explain the emergence of hyperopia. In the case examined, hyperopia appears to emerge from a strategic learning approach that emphasises foresightful learning mechanisms while neglecting experiential learning from direct exposure to operations. To avoid the emergence of pathologies of managerial approaches, such as hyperopia or myopia, practitioners are encouraged to engage with balanced strategic learning mechanisms of varying temporal, spatial and cognitive scope...|$|E

We surface insights into the under-researched topic of hyperopic top management team (TMT) strategic practice and seek to better understand influences on and between hyperopia and TMT scenario planning approaches. We present empirical findings from a contemporary case where scenario planning practices are used extensively by the TMT. We also critically review an analogous historical case of hyperopic TMT strategic practice in a comparable sectoral context. Our {{findings suggest that the}} business impacts of hyperopia might be masked by munificent institutional conditions but as these conditions evolve, damaging effects of hyperopic strategic practice might be experienced. We also argue that further research is required to elaborate the relationship between TMT hyperopia and an over-reliance on scenario planning practices...|$|E

The paper gives a method for detecting the Myopia (Short-Sightedness) or Hypermetropia (<b>Long-Sightedness)</b> eyesight problem in the vision and to define the problem (if it is found), by getting eyesight distance (SPH) and deviation (CYL) measurements., whenever the measurements of SPH or CYL are in normal range then there is no problem for physician to diagnose, but when measurements any of each of them are out of normal range then- it is relatively difficult to diagnose and physician take more time to take decision.

40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{is considered}} a key technology in reaching targets for renewable energy and CO 2 emissions reduction. This study evaluates policy instruments affecting the profitability of biomass gasification applications integrated in a Swedish district heating (DH) system for the medium-term future (around year 2025). Two gasification applications are included: co-production of SNG (synthetic natural gas) for use as transportation fuel and DH heat in a biorefinery, and BIGCC CHP (biomass integrated gasification combined cycle, combined heat and power). Using an optimisation model the level of policy support necessary to make biofuel production competitive to electricity generation, {{and the level of}} tradable green electricity certificates necessary to make gasification based electricity generation competitive to conventional steam cycle technology, are identified. The results show that in order for investment in SNG production to be competitive to investment in electricity production in the DH system, support policies promoting biofuels in the range of 16 - 22  EUR/MWh are needed. For investment in BIGCC CHP to be competitive to investment in conventional steam cycle CHP tradable green electricity certificates in the range of 4 - 15  EUR/MWh are necessary. The necessary policy support levels are very sensitive to variations in investment costs. It is concluded that the large capital commitment and strong dependency on policy tools makes it necessary that DH suppliers believe in the <b>long-sightedness</b> of future policy tools, in order for investments in large-scale biomass gasification in DH systems to be realised...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, {{we study}} {{possible}} pathways for {{the introduction of}} hydrogen technology in the Swedish automobile sector. It is an environmentally much preferable alternative to the current, fossil-fuel based, system which emits large amounts of greenhouse gases. However, the transport sector is hard to affect since the current technologies enjoy benefits from several different positive feedback loops. A vicious circle is created since new technologies, like our, must benefit from the feedback loops to reach competitiveness {{but they will not}} start gaining from them as they are not competitive yet. By applying the multi-level perspective introduced by Rip and Kemp (1998), we identified important steps in trying to realise a transition away from the fossil fuel-based transport system. The framework was applied on hydrogen technology for the automobile sector and as further input a number of interviews were conducted. Our studies helped us identify a number of results such as the need for technology specific policies and <b>long-sightedness</b> in Swedish energy politics. These actions are needed since hy- drogen technology is today too far from competitiveness to be seriously helped by economy wide policies. Furthermore, to gain new business in this area the companies should cooperate with each other to a larger extent than in their normal business, something called "running in packs". The rationale for the companies to cooperate is that it is better to have a limited share in a large successful market than being monopolist on one that never takes off...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{is considered}} a key technology in reaching targets for renewable energy and CO 2 emissions reduction. This study evaluates policy instruments affecting the profitability of biomass gasification applications integrated in a Swedish district heating (DH) system for the medium-term future (around year 2025). Two polygeneration applications based on gasification technology are considered in this paper: (1) a biorefinery plant co-producing synthetic natural gas (SNG) and district heat; (2) a {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant using integrated gasification combined cycle technology. Using an optimisation model we identify the levels of policy support, here assumed to be in the form of tradable certificates, required to make biofuel production competitive to biomass based electricity generation under various energy market conditions. Similarly, the tradable green electricity certificate levels necessary to make gasification based electricity generation competitive to conventional steam cycle technology, are identified. The results show that in order for investment in the SNG biorefinery to be competitive to investment in electricity production in the DH system, biofuel certificates in the range of 24 - 42 EUR/MWh are needed. Electricity certificates are not a prerequisite for investment in gasification based CHP to be competitive to investment in conventional steam cycle CHP, given sufficiently high electricity prices. While the required biofuel policy support is relatively insensitive to variations in capital cost, the required electricity certificates show high sensitivity to variations in investment costs. It is concluded that the large capital commitment and strong dependency on policy instruments makes it necessary that DH suppliers believe in the <b>long-sightedness</b> of future support policies, in order for investments in large-scale biomass gasification in DH systems to be realised.

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} {{visual system}} (CVS) is a feedback pathway of predominantly visual {{information from the}} brain to both eyes, but principally to the contralateral retina. The CVS is often considered {{to be something of}} a peculiarity, regarded as being specific to birds (Aves). Indeed, so-called ‘higher’ vertebrate species are assumed not to even possess such a centrifugal pathway when, in fact, an efferent projection to the retina has been conclusively demonstrated in all vertebrate groups (including humans). Perhaps this point of view reflects the lack of progress made in the elucidation of function in the bird, the dominant model for CVS research in the 120 years since being first described. In the series of experiments presented here, I have begun to investigate the role of the CVS in the modulation of eye growth. In addition, I have addressed a number of unknowns that exist regarding the midbrain connectivity of the CVS. In a series of four parallel lesion experiments, the centrifugal efferent pathway to the retina was unilaterally disrupted in post hatch chicks, raised under different developmental conditions. Under normal visual conditions but in the absence of centrifugal efferents, eyes contralateral to the lesion developed shorter eyes and moderate, relative hyperopia (<b>long-sightedness).</b> In contrast, under constant light conditions, ipsilateral eyes became significantly shorter than fellow (i. e. contralateral) eyes. Compensation for, and recovery from, plus and minus lens-imposed defocus in contralateral eyes was largely unaffected. Centrifugal efferents emanate from two distinct midbrain populations: the isthmo-optic nucleus (ION) and the surrounding scattered cells within the ectopic area (EA). From experiments using pathway tracing techniques, I have demonstrated that, unlike cells of the ION, EA cells do not receive input from primary visual areas. In addition I present evidence for a possible ‘cross-talk’ pathway between centrifugal cells {{on either side of the}} midbrain, and discuss its potential involvement in the normally symmetrical eye growth...|$|E
40|$|Lean has {{during the}} past two decades grown to become a {{worldwide}} management concept. The purpose of lean is mainly to create value for customers and reduce the downtime for organizations. It origins from the automotive industry and was firstly introduced by Toyota. The concept eventually caught on and spread to other industries, service businesses and most recently to the public sector. A few years ago municipalities in Sweden introduced lean in their organizations and used it as a solution to many of their operational challenges. However, research suggests that the knowledge within the field of lean in the context of municipalities is limited. The study was designed as a single case study of the municipality Södertälje which was one of the first municipalities to adopt the concept of lean. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with key individuals in Södertälje municipality who had been a part of the introduction of lean or in some way influenced the process. In addition, interviews were held with middle managers who were currently working with lean. Furthermore, text documents such as decisions, objectives and budget documents provided by Södertälje municipality were also analyzed. To get a better understanding of how lean can be used in the context of municipalities the aim of this study was to examine how Södertälje municipality introduced lean, how it was applied and which forms the concept has taken. More specific the study has used institutional and translational theory to investigate how lean has been transferred and translated from the private- to the public context. The empirical data was analyzed through two phases. The first phase was decontextualization which was used to understand how lean was differentiated from the private context by the municipality. The second phase was contextualization which has been used to see how Södertälje municipality introduced lean in their organization and how they interpreted the concept. The findings suggest that the municipality had a problem-oriented approach where lean was considered a possible solution. To transfer lean, Södertälje municipality first recruited Robert Kusén, an executive from Scania, to “carry out” his knowledge and experience from working with lean. Second, the management of the municipality visited Scania and the social district in Copenhagen to “bring in” knowledge about the lean concept. Therefore, the municipality partly used organizational arenas in the same sector and partly organizational arenas in a different and more distant sector than the municipality. The study conclude that the contexts included in the transfer of a concept affects the translation. To translate the concept of lean, Södertälje municipality applied “the translation hierarchical chain” with few exceptions. Further, the municipality developed their lean philosophy and what they thought about lean by what they call “Växthuset”. By doing this and by interlocking lean with their existing vision and values, enrollment rules were used to establish lean in the local context. Using pilot projects also helped creating local references to the idea. Furthermore the municipality used specific rules for translating and reshaping lean. The mainly emphasized instrument was imitation, but there have also been indicators of addition and subtraction. This was expressed through the political context which narrowed the use of <b>long-sightedness</b> and instead resulted in a focus on democratic aspects. The municipality’s use of lean was from the beginning intended to include the entire organization but had instead mainly been practiced by the social welfare department. The poor adaption was largely caused by a lack of interest from the personnel and because key stakeholder had left the organization or had been replaced...|$|E
40|$|The key {{question}} {{addressed by the}} literature on money and growth {{is whether or not}} changes in the rate of monetary expansion have real effects on the growth path of the economy. This question is usually phrased in terms of the superneutrality of money. Superneutrality is distinguished from the more commonly used term of neutrality by the former’s reference to monetary growth rates, as distinct from one-shot changes in the money stock; superneutrality is thus a dynamic concept of neutrality. Superneutrality has also appeared in the literature in the guise of the natural rate of interest. The idea of a natural rate of return on capital, determined solely by real factors and thereby invariant to monetary behaviour is an attractive concept. The proposition is usual attributed to Wicksell although its recent popularization owes much to Friedman’s influential 1968 Presidential address. The early contributions to the literature, based on descriptive analysis, unanimously rejected superneutrality. They argued that money and capital are substitutes in the eyes of portfolio holders. A change in the rate of monetary expansion chnages the rate of inflation and thus the rate of return on real money balances. In principle this should set in motion a complex interaction of income and substitution effects which would alter the equilbrium of the economy. This view was largely overthrown by Sidrauski who put forward a model based on explicit optimization in which the real economy was invariant to the rate of monetary expansion. The accepted interpretation of his model is that far-sighted individuals “see through” the veil of money, and choose a pattern of behaviour that will set the economy on an optimal real expansion path. Sidrauski’s work appeared {{at the same time that}} Friedman was expounding his views on the natural rate of interest, and between them they have dominated thinking on this topic for a decade or more. Recently, however, several economists have expressed doubts about some of Sidrauski’s assumptions. The main objective of this paper is to determine whether Sidrauski’s results depend on unrealistically restrictive assumptions, and if so, whether anything can be said about the likely direction of any real effects associated with a change in the monetary growth rate. The essence of Sidrauski’s model is utility-maximization over time by an immortal household. The household has preferences over consumption in each period and real money balances. The apparent weak links in his model are: (i) the infinite horizon of the individuals involved (ii) the assumption that all individuals are identical and have the same rate of time discount (iii) the assumption that the individuals like consumption in all periods equally except for the use of the time discount rate to weight current consumption higher than future consumption (iv) the assumption that the production process is independent of money balances held by firms and (v) the assumption that money yields a return to the individual that varies with the amount held. Using an overlapping-generations framework in which individuals live for a finite length of time, but are still linked to the future by concern for their children it is possible to replicate Sidrauski’s superneutrality result. The advantage of this approach is that, unlike Sidrauski’s original model, the overlapping generations model allows a much wider range of alternative assumptions. Indeed, it is shown that superneutrality requires all five of the assumptions listed above. Superneutrality has little to do with the <b>long-sightedness</b> of Sidrauski’s household. It is more accurately described as a technical accident of combining certain types of assumptions. When any one of these assumptions is abandoned, monetary growth has real effects. What are these real effects? From the assumptions listed above it should be apparent that superneutrality requires two types of restrictions on the productive process and on the behaviour of individual consumers. Real effects can be generated by relaxing either of these two sides of the model. In general the effects will be an indeterminate mixture of income and substitution effects. There are, however, two cases in which an unambiguous outcome can be predicted. The first, due to Dornbusch and Frenkel arises when we relax the production side of the model to allow money to affect production directly as an input. In this case, an increase in the monetary growth rate will decrease the real growth rate of output provided cross-effects are positive (that is, an increase in the price of one good increases the demand for all other goods) and own-effects are dominant (that is, the demand (supply) for each good responds more to movements in its own price than it does to movements in the prices of other goods). The essence of this result is that since money and capital are usually hypothesised to be complementary inputs in production, a decrease in the rate of return on money will lead to a reduction in the use of money and, through complementarity, a reduction in the use of capital. The second arises when we relax the restrictions on the consumer (e. g. assumptions (i) -(iii), and (v) above). In this case an increase in the rate of monetary growth will increase the real rate of growth of output if money is held at the margin purely for its properties as an asset. If this is the case, the financial returns on money and capital will be forced into alignment. A decrease in the rate of return on money will decrease the rate of return on capital thereby implying a higher capital-labour ratio. ...|$|E
