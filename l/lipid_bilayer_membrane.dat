5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> <b>membrane</b> pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{hypothesis}} of a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> <b>membrane</b> composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of {{a huge number of}} theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle, actually a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. Such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles which would have allowed Darwinian natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Overton (a {{distant cousin}} of Charles Darwin) first {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by electrostatic repulsion. Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane. Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> <b>membrane</b> covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of resting frog muscle was permeable to both K+ and Cl-, but apparently not to Na+, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to K+ , H+, and Cl- as well as the impermeability to Na+, Ca+, and Mg++.|$|E

40|$|Measurements with {{different}} chemically modified gramicidins in <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> <b>membranes</b> {{were used to}} discriminate between the dimeric πL,D helix proposed by Urry and the dimeric parallel or antiparallel helices proposed by Veatch and Blout. Evidence for the πL,D helix was obtained {{on the basis of}} the different actions of a negatively charged O-pyromellitylgramicidin and a negatively charged N-pyromellityldesformylgramicidin on <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> <b>membranes.</b> O-Pyromellitylgramicidin forms ionic channels in lipid membranes when it is applied to both sides of the membrane. In contrast to unmodified gramicidin, O-pyromellitylgramicidin is inactive when it is applied only to one side of the membrane. N-Pyromellityldesformylgramicidin does not form ionic channels in <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> <b>membranes</b> whether it is applied to one or both sides of the membrane. These results support the view that the gramicidin channel is formed by two πL,D helices. Dimer formation by head-to-head association of two πL,D helices needs six intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which are located at the formyl end of the molecule and which occur deep within the lipid membrane. In the head-to-head associated πL,D helix the absence of the formyl group leads to an inactivation of the peptide, whereas in a parallel or antiparallel double-stranded helix the absence of the formyl group should have only minor effects...|$|R
