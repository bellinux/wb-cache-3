5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} academic world, a model which {{is referred to as}} T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, <b>lead</b> <b>user,</b> etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} innovation factor includes customers buying {{products or}} using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in focus groups (user centred approach), {{work closely with}} so called lead users (<b>lead</b> <b>user</b> approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The <b>lead</b> <b>user</b> method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate Europe’s surface transportation system, employs such workshops. Regarding this user innovation, {{a great deal of}} innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become entrepreneurs, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like open source. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.|$|E

In contrast to the traditional market research techniques that collect information from the users {{at the center of the}} target market, the <b>Lead</b> <b>User</b> method takes a different approach, collecting information about both needs and solutions from the leading edges of the target market and from analogue markets, markets facing similar problems in a more extreme form.|$|E

40|$|It {{makes no}} doubt that the {{development}} of innovative products benefits from being considered under the perspective of networks and communities. <b>Lead</b> <b>User’s</b> theory (LUT) focused mainly on the process by which user innovation may be transformed into commercial product. However, when LUT methodology was proven successful for products such as scientific instrument, sports equipment or even medical instruments, very few experiences were reported for services. Thus, the specific contribution of the paper is to adapt <b>lead</b> <b>user’s</b> theory and practice to the specific case of the intangible processes and services such as Banks, Call centers, etc [...] , in the purpose of improving efficiency of innovative efforts. In a first theoretical part, the paper reviews service characteristics which prevent adoption of LUT methods. Four main factors are identified and investigated in details: intangibility, inseparability, process based aspects of services and investment cycle in services. Based on these analyses, the paper suggests a specific framework for applying LUT methodologies in the case of services. It details first recommendation on the way to select potential <b>lead</b> <b>users.</b> Then, it recommends the way <b>lead</b> <b>users</b> should be associated and involved so that potential innovation may be proposed. The concept of communities applied to services is proposed and discussed from managerial point of view. Perspective of further research is then detailed.

40|$|The Product Development and Management Association {{indicates}} that between 17. 8 %- 47. 1 % of products {{introduced into the}} market are not successful (Markham & Lee, 2013). A high failure rate represents an enormous inefficiency in the conversion of user input into thoughtful products. Therefore, {{it is important to}} consider ways to improve the process by which products are conceived. In the field of textiles and apparel, there has been little research, which can offer specific data about apparel product success or failure rates. This dissertation explores ways to improve product success by involving consumers, or users, as active participants in the creation of products which meet their needs. Specifically, this research addressed <b>lead</b> <b>users</b> as collaborators who can make valuable contributions to the design and development process. User contributions are important to consider in the development process so that designers can move away from abstract representations of perceived use to concrete ideas and solutions that are grounded in insightful understandings of users' needs. The research is conducted in three steps: First, by interviews with 15 design professionals who detailed how users are currently engaged in the functional apparel design process. Second, by exploring the efficacy of <b>lead</b> <b>users</b> as a theory to identify influential user-collaborators through developing a method to identify <b>lead</b> <b>users.</b> Third, by examining the overall experience of designers and users and the influence of facilitation on the overall collaborative design process and product outcome. This research demonstrated that users can be influential collaborators, specifically <b>lead</b> <b>users.</b> Interviews with industry professionals revealed a duality in the collaborative experience for designers when working with users. Designers view user input as valuable, but designers still use their personal insights and experiences to transform user insights into workable product concepts. Product concepts developed by <b>lead</b> <b>users,</b> especially when a professional facilitator assisted the group, were highly rated among their peers. This research shows promise of utilizing <b>lead</b> <b>users</b> and professional facilitators in a collaborative design scenario to enhance functional apparel products. <b>Lead</b> <b>users</b> and professional facilitators can make valuable contributions to the design and development process. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R

40|$|How can {{disabled}} non-designers play {{a leading}} role in product development? As part of early phase product ideation, designers often rely on methods (Pahl & Beitz, 1996, Chapter 4). These methods help designers develop appropriate solutions to design problems. However, ideation processes may also involve non-designers. These could be end-users, managers, domain experts or other stakeholders. A very specific form of user involvement is through <b>lead</b> <b>users.</b> <b>Lead</b> <b>users</b> can be identified as: 1) being at the leading edge of an important market trend, and experiencing needs that will later be experienced by many users in that market, and 2) anticipating relatively high benefits from obtaining a solution to their needs. This motivates them to participate. They are often a limited group of persons with specialized skills or experiences (Urban & von Hippel, 1988). In this paper discuss the involvement of disabled <b>lead</b> <b>users</b> in early product development. We will focus on generative methods used {{for the creation of a}} wearable mobility device.
