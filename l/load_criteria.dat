40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2011 This report {{provides}} {{design guidelines}} and recommendations for side-berthing loads on ferry landing structures. Berthing loads on ferry berthing structures are not well understood {{due to a lack}} of information and research for ferry class vessels. The <b>load</b> <b>criteria</b> for the design of ferry berthing structures are thus often based on a number of assumptions, often leading to uneconomical or unreliable structures. The Alaska Department of Transportation (AKDOT&PF) recognizes the need for an improved information base on berthing loads from ferry class vessels, for the design and operation of future facilities within the Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS). This study involves a one year empirical investigation into side-berthing loads at the Auke Bay ferry landing located in Juneau, Alaska. Measurements of fender displacement, approach velocity, and pile strain were used to determine berthing loads from scheduled berthings from four different vessels. Measured parameters were analyzed statistically, and used to establish distributions and design recommendations for berthing energy, force, velocity, and berthing coefficient based on reliability theory. This study provides an assessment of <b>load</b> <b>criteria</b> currently used by the AK DOT&PF Marine Department, as well as design load recommendations for both service and ultimate side-berthing loads from ferry class vessels...|$|E

40|$|Sublevel caving (SLC) is an {{underground}} mass mining method used to extract iron ore from the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines. Although both mines use SLC as the mining method, their implementation varies {{in terms of}} mine design, ring design and draw control strategy. The Kiirunavaara mine has a continuous and massive ore deposit which allows a standard mine design layout, while the Malmberget mine has scattered ore bodies with varying mine design parameters. The two mines also employ different opening techniques for production drifts. Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) uses different information systems to run these highly mechanized mines. The information generated by the various systems is transferred between the different unit operations and is used to optimize the mining process. The mines use GIRON to create, store and display different information related to the mining operation. Information on all unit operations is stored {{in a number of}} databases inside GIRON. The two loading related information systems which support the loading operation are the Wireless Loader Information System (WOLIS) and the Loadrite system. The Loadrite system measures the bucket weights being loaded by the Load Haul Dump (LHD) machines at the draw point. This information, along with information on planned ring tonnage etc., is displayed to the LHD operator inside the LHD machine using WOLIS. WOLIS provides online data on the ring performance such as grades, tonnage extracted etc. to the LHD operators and the production team. In SLC, the different aspects of loading at the draw point include loading procedures, <b>loading</b> issues, <b>loading</b> <b>criteria</b> and <b>loading</b> constraints. Loading procedures include the practices and precautions taken during loading at the draw point. Loading issues include events observed at both mines, such as brow failure, ring freeze, hang-ups etc. Although most loading issues are handled in a similar manner, hang-up handling techniques are different at the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines. <b>Loading</b> <b>criteria</b> and constraints along with the nature of material flow collectively provide a complete understanding of the draw control strategy. <b>Loading</b> <b>criteria</b> comprise a set of rules or guidelines for loading and closing a draw point. LKAB uses WOLIS to enforce the <b>loading</b> <b>criteria</b> for its SLC operations. Loading constraints include production constraints, grade control and mining constraints which must be followed for a safe and sustainable mining operation. A baseline analysis of the draw control and loading operations at the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines is summarized in this report using information collected through internal documents, meetings, e-mails and manuals.   Improved Resource Efficiency through Dynamic Loading Contro...|$|R

The storehouses consisted of a proprietary profiled light gauge steel arch faced with sprayed concrete. The light gauge steel shell thus acted as expendable formwork and also contributed to the reinforcement of the arch. The resulting structure was covered with earthfill in accordaflce with standard specifications. In two previous trials, three 13 m span receptor arch s t r u c m successfully withstood the blast effects generated by the detonation of 75, 000 kg TNT.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} a study {{examining}} the potential of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector by substituting multi-storey steel and concrete building structures with timber structures. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to compare the climate change impact (CC) of a reinforced concrete (RC) benchmark structure to the CC of an alternative timber structure for four buildings ranging from 3 to 21 storeys. The timber structures are dimensioned to meet the same <b>load</b> <b>criteria</b> as the benchmark structures. The LCA comprises three calculation approaches differing in analysis perspective, allocation methods, and modelling of biogenic CO 2 and carbonation of concrete. Irrespective of the assumptions made, the timber structures cause lower CC than the RC structures. By applying attributional LCA, the timber structures are found to cause a CC that is 34 - 84 % lower than the RC structures. The large span is due to different building heights and methodological assumptions. The CC saving per m 2 floor area obtained by substituting a RC structure with a timber structure decrease slightly with building height up to 12 storeys, but increase from 12 to 21 storeys. From a consequential LCA perspective, constructing timber structures can result in avoided GHG emissions, indicated by a negative CC.

The adhesion performance of the ALD Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, TiN, and TaCNþRu coatings with a thickness range between 20 and 600 nm and deposition temperature between 30 and 410 C on silicon wafers was investigated.

This study aims to understand the influence of the intrusion and the OLC on the resulting impact severity independently of each other by quantifying the possible crash severity reduction for the car’s occupant in frontal car crashes. In this project, real world data, containing frontal collisions derived from the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS), was used to estimate how the ΔV, the vehicle body intrusion and the Occupant <b>Load</b> <b>Criterion</b> (OLC) affected the occupant´s injury. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between injury severity, ΔV and intrusion.
