The impact on the female labour force Maria Jepsen * and Dani&egrave;le Meulders** Summary This article aims at analysing {{the quality of the}} potential <b>employment</b> created by <b>local</b> <b>employment</b> <b>initiatives</b> and more specifically the impact on the female labour force. The discussion on gender and the quality of created employment seems to be of importance as most European Union Member States are promoting job creation linked to local initiatives in typical female work areas such as caring and domestic work. The second section outlines important elements for the development of local initiatives, while the third section estimates the potential employment which is likely to be occupied by women. In section four an analysis {{of the quality of the}} created employment and the impact on the male and female labour force can be found. Section five briefly summarises the employment policies put forward in the Europea...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of social and}} vocational integration is directly linked to local development and <b>local</b> <b>employment</b> <b>initiatives,</b> as part of which a number of agents are actively engaged in the integration process, namely <b>employment</b> and <b>local</b> development agents. These agents target their resources and efforts to social and vocational integration, mainly {{within the framework of}} local government, and help promote the social economy by supporting the creation of local companies. Given the prominent role that these agents perform in terms of social and vocational integration, this paper represents an empirical study of the current reality of agents of social and vocational integration in Spain, involving the creation and analysis of a national and regional directory of agents. The aim is to demonstrate the enormous complexity of the concept and the significant regional variations in the implementation and performance of this model of local development. Local development, agents of social and vocational integration, social economy, <b>local</b> <b>employment</b> policies, self-employment and company creation. ...|$|R
40|$|In this Policy Review Section Neil Marshall and John Bachtler {{explore the}} role of the service sector in {{regional}} policy within the member states of the European Community focusing in particular on {{the role of}} the public sector and the application of financial incentives and controls. They conclude that greater attention needs to be given to the relationships with national industrial and technological policies, that there is considerable scope to employ public services, that regional policy incentives should be tailored more closely to the needs of service enterprises and that there is a case for decentralized policy delivery. In the second article S. J. Syrett examines the implications for Portugal of the introduction of a programme of local economic initiatives which has been inspired in large measure by the OECD and European Community's own <b>Local</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Initiatives</b> programmes. Syrett stresses the dangers of the international transference of policy initiatives without reference to the political framework within which they were devised and without them being tailored to the particular circumstances of the country concerned...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the transformation of}} New Zealand's welfare state in the movement to a new phase of capitalist development. It adopts a multi-level approach linking the global, national and local levels. The global level analysis provides the overall rationale for the development and subsequent restructuring of welfare states and reordering of the welfare mix more toward the market. At the national level, highlighting the collapse of its foundations, this study contends that New Zealand's welfare state has transformed into a 'well-being enabling state'. The goal of the well-being enabling state is to ensure private provision of welfare through labour market participation in a deregulated labour market, rather than through direct state provision. Employment policy, including policies for enhancement of human capital, are therefore discussed as 'enablers' of participation in paid employment and private procurement of well-being. At the local level, specific characteristics of the local labour market have {{to be included in}} the analysis. The need for community action for employment creation in order to respond to the challenges of the global economy and a transformed national welfare state, is a major theme of the study. A case study of community employment creation, conducted through a participatory research methodology, highlights the need for innovative local efforts for job creation at the micro or grassroots level. <b>Local</b> <b>employment</b> <b>initiatives,</b> especially those that build on a partnership approach and tap into the cultural wealth of the community through market-leading community entrepreneurship, are shown to be crucial to the mitigation of the current ethnic unemployment problem in New Zealand...|$|R

National governments, by contrast, should on the one hand aim to improve the vertical co-ordination of regional labour market policies by using best practice management tools of new public management in PES organisations and take an active role as a partner in Pacts/LEIs. They should also align the vertical distribution of formal competencies for labour market policy making in their respective countries with the tasks of (and the results expected from) regional policy organisations.
