50|$|A lattice phase {{equaliser}} or <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> is {{an example}} of an all-pass filter. That is, the attenuation of the filter is constant at all frequencies but the relative phase between input and output varies with frequency. The <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> topology has the particular property of being a constant-resistance network and for this reason is often used in combination with other constant resistance filters such as bridge-T equalisers. The topology of a <b>lattice</b> <b>filter,</b> also called an X-section is identical to bridge topology. The lattice phase equaliser was invented by Otto Zobel. using a filter topology proposed by George Campbell.|$|E

30|$|Previously, plant {{identification}} via adaptive {{convex combination}} of least mean square (LMS) transversal filters with different step sizes and new algorithms for improved adaptive convex combination of least mean square (LMS) transversal filters {{were introduced in}} [48, 49] respectively. In this presentation, {{the objective is to}} address the implementation issues related to combining adaptive filters by developing modular, order-recursive, and reconfigurable combination schemes. In order to capture the statistical variations in the CR environment, the combination of multiple <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> with different exponential weighting factors has been considered so as to bring together the convergence properties of fast filters that have small exponential weighting factors and steady-state MSD properties of slow filters that have large exponential weighting factors. Accordingly, the author envisions multiple adaptive <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> as channels of sequential processing multichannel lattice stages (SPMLSs) [19 – 22, 50] and proposes to sequentially combine these multiple <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> in a CR channel identification task. In view of the aforementioned issues concerning convex vs. affine combinations, the focus is on convex combinations of multiple adaptive <b>lattice</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R

40|$|A new speckle {{reduction}} algorithm {{based on}} 2 -D <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> for SAR imaging is presented. In the new method, the subband decomposition of the speckled image {{is performed using}} 2 -D <b>lattice</b> <b>filters.</b> The noisy image is decomposed into subband images using high-pass and low-pass <b>filters</b> having <b>lattice</b> structure, then a threshold value is estimated according to noise variance in each subband and soft-thresholding is applied on the subband images. The despeckled image is obtained from the thresholded subband images using the inverse <b>lattice</b> <b>filters.</b> The proposed speckle reduction method is applied to RADARSAT/SAR images. The performance of the proposed method has also been compared with median filtering, and stationary wavelet transform based speckle reduction methods.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{convergence}} of a recently proposed CORDIC adaptive <b>lattice</b> <b>filtering</b> (CALF) algorithm is proved. It is shown that the update of the rotation angle (which {{is equivalent to the}} reflection coefficient) can be modeled by the state transition of a regular Markov chain, with each rotation angle being a state. The convergence of the CALF algorithm then is established as this Markov chain converges from an initial state probability distribution to its limiting state probability distribution. Formulae that enable explicit calculation of the limiting state distribution are derived. Moreover, it is shown that the algorithm has an exponential convergence rate.

This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, {{yet it is}} constructed out of inductors and capacitors.

50|$|The {{prototype}} <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> {{shown here}} passes low frequencies without modification but phase shifts high frequencies. That is, it is phase correction {{for the high}} end of the band. At low frequencies the phase shift is 0° but as the frequency increases the phase shift approaches 180°. It can be seen qualitatively that this is so by replacing the inductors with open circuits and the capacitors with short circuits, which is what they become at high frequency. At high frequency the <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> is a cross-over network and will produce 180° phase shift. A 180° phase shift is the same as an inversion in the frequency domain, but is a delay in the time domain. At an angular frequency of ω = 1 rad/s the phase shift is exactly 90° and this is the midpoint of the filter's transfer function.|$|E

Two main variants of BAW filters are making their way into devices: thin-film bulk acoustic resonator or FBAR and solid mounted bulk acoustic resonators.|$|R

50|$|Another {{property}} of the <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> {{is that it is}} an intrinsically balanced topology. This is useful when used with landlines which invariably use a balanced format. Many other types of filter section are intrinsically unbalanced and have to be transformed into a balanced implementation in these applications which increases the component count. This is not required in the case of lattice filters.|$|E
50|$|The phase {{equaliser}} {{based on}} T topology is the unbalanced {{equivalent of the}} <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> and has the same phase response. While the circuit diagram may looklike a low pass filter it is different in that the two inductor branches are mutually coupled. This results in transformer action between the two inductors and an all-pass response even at high frequency.|$|E

System identification results are presented for both simulated and experimental tests and they are compared with those predicted using finite element modelling. The <b>lattice</b> <b>filtering</b> approach works well for simulated data based on finite element modelling. However, considerable discrepancy exists between estimates obtained from experimental data and the finite element analysis. It is believed that this discrepancy is the result of inadequacies in the finite element modelling to represent the damped motion of the laboratory apparatus...|$|R

50|$|The EMI 2001 used band {{defining}} filters in {{all four}} channels. For the colour channels and narrow-band luminance, the low-pass filters had a Gaussian shaped pass-band and, although such filters were not ‘sharp-cut’, they were linear phase and gave negligible overshoots on transients. The wide-band luminance channel had its bandwidth defined by a linear phase low pass filter with a 3 dB cut-off at 6.8 MHz. Its design follows the <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> methods of Bode.|$|E
50|$|The SP0256 (and its predecessor, the SP0250) {{implement}} a 12-pole, Linear Predictive Coding (aka LPC-12) all-pole Vocal Tract Model (VTM). The SP0256 generates speech with a 10 kHz sample rate. The SP0256 realizes its 12-pole filter {{with a series}} of cascaded 2-pole IIR filter sections. This is in contrast to its contemporaries, such as Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips, which used an 8 kHz sample rate with a 10-pole model, and realized their VTM with a <b>lattice</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the example}} diagram, the {{resistors}} placed {{in series with}} the capacitors, R1, are made equal to the unwanted stray resistance present in the inductors. This ensures that the attenuation at high frequency {{is the same as}} the attenuation at low frequency and brings the filter back to a flat response. The purpose of the shunt resistors, R2, is to bring the image impedance of the filter back to the original design R0. The resulting filter is the equivalent of a box attenuator formed from the R1's and R2's connected in cascade with an ideal <b>lattice</b> <b>filter</b> as shown in the diagram.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{recursive}} <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> {{for identification}} and adaptive control of large space structures is studied. <b>Lattice</b> <b>filters</b> {{were used to}} identify the structural dynamics model of the flexible structures. This identification model is then used for adaptive control. Before the identified model and control laws are integrated, the identified model is passed {{through a series of}} validation procedures and only when the model passes these validation procedures is control engaged. This type of validation scheme prevents instability when the overall loop is closed. Another important area of research, namely that of robust controller synthesis, was investigated using frequency domain multivariable controller synthesis methods. The method uses the Linear Quadratic Guassian/Loop Transfer Recovery (LQG/LTR) approach to ensure stability against unmodeled higher frequency modes and achieves the desired performance...|$|R
30|$|Sequential convex {{combinations}} of multiple adaptive <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> using different exponential weighting factors in cognitive radio (CR) channel identification framework {{have been considered}} in this presentation. First, the sequential processing multichannel lattice stages (SPMLSs) are modified {{so as to be}} used in filter combination task. Then, two different combination schemes, i.e., regular combination of multiple <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> (R-CMLF) and decoupled combination of multiple <b>lattice</b> <b>filters</b> (D-CMLF), that utilize modified SPMLSs as filter structure have been proposed. A modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of multiple channels of data, which is constituted in multiple filter combination task, is accomplished. A highly modular, regular, and reconfigurable filter structure, which is suitable for cognitive radios, is achieved with the combination processing implemented in an order-recursive fashion. The mean square deviation (MSD) performances of the schemes under stationary and nonstationary conditions have been presented and compared with the performances of multiple combination of least mean square (M-CLMS), decoupled combination of least mean square (D-CLMS) schemes, and component filters. It has also been shown that the fault tolerances of the proposed schemes are better than those of the component filters due to the redundancy introduced with combination processing, and that the proposed schemes bring together the desired adaptive filter features such as fast convergence and low steady-state MSD levels, which do not normally coexist.|$|R
