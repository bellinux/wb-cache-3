Kenny responded by asking what is a trophy house. To this O'Connor responded with [...] "A house <b>like</b> <b>yours,</b> probably." [...] After some hesitation, Kenny quoted: ...|$|E

He was heavily recruited particularly by Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban, who {{was in need of}} a true nose tackle for his 3–4 defense. Cody recalls Saban telling him, [...] "We need a body <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> in the middle, to stop the run, to change the rhythm of the game." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{groups of}} policyholders (those whose {{pensions}} had vested {{and those that}} had not) received further bad news. In July 2001 deferred pensioners (the second group) were angered to be told their savings had been reduced by 16%, and then in November 2002 pensioners were told that [...] "with-profits annuities, <b>like</b> <b>yours,</b> are now out of line by about 30%." [...] 50,000 Annuitants suffered a 20% [...] reduction in income.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the rematch, Louis visited President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House. The New York Times quoted Roosevelt as telling the fighter, [...] "Joe, we need muscles <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> to beat Germany." [...] In his 1976 biography, Louis wrote, [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own {{personal}} reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me." [...] This time, Louis took training for the bout seriously, giving up golf and women throughout his training.|$|E
2500|$|Duke University Provost Peter Lange responded, [...] "I cannot {{tell you}} how disappointed, saddened and appalled I was to receive this letter from you. A form of {{prejudice}} - one felt so often by minorities whether they be African American, Jewish or other - is the act of prejudgment: to presume that one knows something 'must' have been done by or done to someone because {{of his or her}} race, religion or other characteristic." [...] He continued, [...] "We do not know much about the worst of what may have happened in the incident that has inflamed our community," [...] and concluded, [...] "Sadly, letters <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> do little to advance our common cause." ...|$|E

2500|$|A rematch was {{scheduled}} later in New York City. In the build-up {{to the event}} U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt offered his support: [...] "Joe, we need muscles <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> to beat Germany." [...] Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money {{would be used to}} build German tanks. Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Landa {{gave the}} game a {{positive}} review for Electronic Gaming Monthly. He scored it a 9.0/10, praised the overall presentation and gameplay, and stated: [...] "Games like NBA 2K16 {{will tend to}} overreach in how it chooses to occupy your time outside of the virtual arena. This is where most players will find the fault with 2K16, as not every mode external to game time is as fleshed out or competent as the main course. Not every returning 2K player will welcome the minor adjustments to the control scheme. Some online hiccups will frustrate others, {{and the addition of}} a MyCareer that doesn’t always feel <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> will split many down the middle. Still, NBA 2K16 remains a refined technical masterpiece that rewards rookies and veterans alike with a showcase that belongs in the basketball hall-of-fame." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rematch between Louis and Schmeling {{would become}} one of the most famous boxing matches of all time and is remembered as one of the major sports events of the 20th century. Following his defeat of Louis in 1936, Schmeling had become a {{national}} hero in Germany. Schmeling's victory over an African American was touted by Nazi officials as proof of their doctrine of Aryan superiority. When the rematch was scheduled, Louis retreated to his boxing camp in New Jersey and trained incessantly for the fight. A few weeks before the bout, Louis visited the White House, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt told him, [...] "Joe, we need muscles <b>like</b> <b>yours</b> to beat Germany." [...] Louis later admitted: [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 25, 2007, after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{declared}} [...] "the war is lost", Hunter wrote [...] "my highest obligation is, <b>like</b> <b>yours,</b> owed to {{our forces}} in uniform, especially {{during this time}} of war... Given your position of leadership within the United States Government, I find your pronouncement of failure irresponsible and dissering to America's armed forces. In {{light of the fact}} that this statement has both been used by our adversaries and has exhibited a marked lack of leadership to U.S. troops, I call on you to resign your leadership position". Hunter further wrote that Reid's declaration [...] "can have no effect but to demoralize the brave men and women, who are honorably fulfilling their mission in Iraq, and to encourage our adversaries... Even if you sincerely believe it to be true, your pronouncement of failure will undoubtedly be used by terrorist leaders to rally their followers – inevitably leading to increased attacks on U.S. and coalition forces".|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, President Barack Obama was {{interrupted}} at {{a speech in}} New Hampshire {{by a group of}} Occupy Wall Street protesters who attempted to chant slogans during the speech; the protesters later delivered a paper message to the press, which read, [...] "Mr. President: Over 4,000 peaceful protesters have been arrested while bankers continue to destroy the economy. You must stop the assault on our First Amendment rights. Your silence sends a message that police brutality is acceptable. Banks got bailed out. We got sold out." [...] The crowd quickly drowned the protesters out with chants of “Obama!” Obama then responded, [...] "I appreciate you guys making your point. Let me go ahead and make mine." [...] Later in the speech, Obama said, “Families <b>like</b> <b>yours,</b> young people like the ones here today— including the ones who were just chanting at me— you’re the reason that I ran for office in the first place.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "Heat Wave" [...] {{became the}} group's first million-seller, Martha and the Vandellas quickly rose {{to become one}} of the label's top draws both as {{recording}} stars and as a successful live act. Martha was the one consistent member of the group staying throughout all the group's incarnations and lineups. After the exits of original members Annette Beard and Rosalind Ashford, members replacing them included Betty Kelly, Sandra Tilley (both formerly of the Velvelettes) and one of Martha's sisters Lois Reeves. Among the singles released that became signature hits for the group are [...] "Quicksand", [...] "In My Lonely Room", [...] "Live Wire", [...] "Nowhere to Run", [...] "A Love <b>Like</b> <b>Yours</b> (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)", [...] "I'm Ready for Love", [...] "Jimmy Mack", [...] "Honey Chile" [...] and the group's most popular single, [...] "Dancing in the Street".
