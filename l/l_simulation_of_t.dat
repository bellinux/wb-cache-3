These problems are solved by using varying transparencies for different isovalues. The quality of visualizations using isosurfaces also highly depends on the choice and number of the isovalues. In order to choose those isosurfaces that represent important features of the data, topological information is computed. For this purpose, an algorithm originally applied to grayscale images of CT scans is modified to use it on the scalar data.

40|$|Foragers of the ant Lasius niger {{exploiting}} a 1 M sugar source {{were found}} to lay 43 % more trail marks than those exploiting a O. 05 or a O. 1 M source. The trail laying per forager decreased {{during the course of}} individual recruitment episodes, and the mean lifetime of the trail pheromone was estimated to be 47 min. A mathematical function describing the probability that a forager chooses one of two paths in relation to the amount of trail pheromone on them closely fitted experimental data. These results were incorporated into a model describing the recruitment dynamics <b>of</b> <b>L.</b> niger. <b>Simulations</b> <b>of</b> this model showed that the observed modulation of trail laying with respect to food source quality is sufficient in itself to account for the systematic selection of the richer source seen in the experiments.
