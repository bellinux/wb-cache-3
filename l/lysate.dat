5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude <b>lysate.</b> The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this <b>lysate.</b> Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte <b>lysate,</b> which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|In research, {{purified}} antibodies {{are used}} in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate intracellular and extracellular proteins. Antibodies {{are used in}} flow cytometry to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins. They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell <b>lysate,</b> in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope. Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using ELISA and ELISPOT techniques.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of added double-stranded RNA or oxidized glutathione, protein synthesis in heminsupplemented reticulocyte <b>lysates</b> declines abruptly after 8 - 12 min of incubation at 30 degrees. The kinetics of amino-acid incorporation {{are very similar to}} those seen when <b>lysates</b> incorporation are very similar to those seen when <b>lysates</b> are incubated in the absence of added hemin. The inhibitory effects of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) are partially overcome by a homogeneous initiation factor, IF-MP, which also stimulates protein synthesis in hemin-deficient <b>lysates.</b> This factor is involved in the binding of Met-tRNAfmet to 40 S ribosomal subunits during protein chain initiation.

25|$|Since 1893, it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that Coley's toxin, a mixture of bacterial cell <b>lysate,</b> has immunostimulatory properties that could reduce the progression of some carcinomas, {{but it was not}} until 1983 that Tokunaga et al. specifically identified bacterial DNA as the underlying component of the <b>lysate</b> that elicited the response. Then, in 1995 Krieg et al. demonstrated that the CpG motif within bacterial DNA was responsible for the immunostimulatory effects and developed synthetic CpG ODN. Since then, synthetic CpG ODN have been the focus of intense research due to the Type I pro-inflammatory response they elicit and their successful use as vaccine adjuvants.|$|E
25|$|Another {{strategy}} is to remove dendritic cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated {{in the presence of}} tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor cell <b>lysate</b> (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.|$|E
25|$|Also proteases are {{released}} during cell lysis, which will start digesting the proteins in the solution. If the protein {{of interest is}} sensitive to proteolysis, it is recommended to proceed quickly, {{and to keep the}} extract cooled, to slow down the digestion. Alternatively, one or more protease inhibitors can be added to the lysis buffer immediately before cell disruption.

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method is to perform a Western blot against the protein of interestâ€”this gives information {{on the size of}} the protein in addition to its identity. A sample (often cellular <b>lysate)</b> is separated on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane and then probed with an antibody to the protein of interest. The antibody can either be conjugated to a fluorophore or to horseradish peroxidase for imaging and/or quantification. The gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate, but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein, for example proteolysis or ubiquitination, from changes in size.|$|E
500|$|For natural proteins, {{a series}} of {{purification}} steps {{may be necessary to}} obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity.

As a result, when the <b>lysate</b> is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel, the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the <b>lysate</b> pass unimpeded. A number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.|$|E
2500|$|Polyhistidine-tags {{are often}} used for {{affinity}} purification of polyhistidine-tagged recombinant [...] proteins expressed in Escherichia coli [...] and other prokaryotic expression systems.

[...] This mixture is incubated with an affinity resin containing bound divalent nickel or cobalt ions, which are available commercially in different varieties. Nickel and cobalt have similar properties and as they are adjacent period 4 transition metals ((v. iron triad)). These resins are generally sepharose/agarose functionalised with a chelator, such as [...] iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) for nickel and carboxylmethylaspartate (Co-CMA) for cobalt, which the polyhistidine-tag binds with micromolar affinity.

[...] With Ni-based methods, washing efficiency can be improved {{by the addition of}} 20 mM imidazole (proteins are [...] usually eluted with 150-300 mM imidazole).

40|$|A hemin-independent {{translational}} inhibitor {{that prevents}} synthesis of rabbit globin when uninduced Friend leukemia (FL) cell and rabbit reticulocyte <b>lysates</b> are mixed [Cimadevilla, J.

Mixing of <b>lysates</b> of FL cells induced with hexamethylene bisacetamide or aminonucleoside of puromycin and rabbit reticulocytes {{does not cause}} inhibition of rabbit globin synthesis. Induction also results in the cells acquiring sensitivity to the inhibitor from uninduced FL cells. A reduction in total protein synthesis is observed when uninduced and induced FL cell <b>lysates</b> are mixed. Inhibition does not result from competition by an excess of uninduced FL cell mRNA species for the translational machinery because uninduced FL cell <b>lysates</b> retain their inhibitory activity after treatment with micrococcal nuclease. Rabbit globin mRNA recovered from rabbit reticulocyte <b>lysates</b> that have been incubated with <b>lysates</b> of uninduced FL cells can still be translated effectively, indicating that inhibition does not result from modification of other species of mRNA by uninduced FL cell <b>lysates.</b> A switch to hemin-dependent translational control does not follow induction of differentiation. The rate of amino acid incorporation in induced FL cell <b>lysates</b> [...] like that in uninduced FL cell <b>lysates</b> [...] is unaffected by omission of exogenous hemin from the system.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the presence of}} histones and nucleosomes in cell <b>lysates</b> of freshly isolated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC), fully activated lymphoblasts, or lymphoblasts after induction of apoptosis. METHODS: Each histone class (H 1, H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3, and H 4) was detected by western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed for each treatment to distinguish viable, early, and late apoptotic, and necrotic cells. DNA degradation was evaluated by PI staining in a hypotonic buffer. RESULTS: All five histones were detected in cell <b>lysates</b> of activated lymphoblasts in higher concentrations than in <b>lysates</b> of PBMC. An additional significant increase of H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3, H 4, and complete nucleosomes in cell <b>lysates</b> of lymphoblasts was found during interleukin (IL) 2 deprivation for 8 or 24 hours. The content of these histones or nucleosomes in cell <b>lysates</b> decreased after delayed IL 2 readdition. H 1 content in cell <b>lysates</b> was not affected by IL 2 deprivation or addition. Quantities of H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3, and H 4 in cell <b>lysates</b> correlated significantly with signs of early apoptosis. UV-B light exposure or etoposide treatment of lymphoblasts resulted in a distinct increase for each histone class in cell <b>lysates</b> compared with standard curves. No bands for post-translationally modified histones were detected in cell <b>lysates</b> in contrast with signals in nuclear preparations. CONCLUSION: Extranuclear accumulation of histones and nucleosomes is an early event of apoptosis in human lymphoblasts. Dysregulation of early apoptosis might support the induction of autoimmunity against nuclear components...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} are {{promising}} candidates in regenerative cell therapy. Conventional culture methods involve the use of animal substances, specifically fetal bovine serum as growth supplement. Since the use of animal-derived products is undesirable for human applications, platelet <b>lysates</b> produced from human platelets are an attractive alternative. This is especially true if platelet <b>lysates</b> from already approved transfusion units at blood banks can be utilized. The {{purpose of this study}} was to produce human platelet <b>lysates</b> from expired, blood bank-approved platelet concentrates and evaluate their use as growth supplement in the culture of mesenchymal stem cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were cultured with one of three culture supplements; fetal bovine serum, <b>lysates</b> from freshly prepared human platelet concentrates, or <b>lysates</b> from expired human platelet concentrates. The effects of these platelet-derived culture supplements on basic mesenchymal stem cell characteristics were evaluated. All cultures maintained the typical mesenchymal stem cell surface marker expression, trilineage differentiation potential, and the ability to suppress in vitro immune responses. However, mesenchymal stem cells supplemented with platelet <b>lysates</b> proliferated faster than traditionally cultured cells and increased the expression of the osteogenic marker gene RUNX- 2; yet no difference between the use of fresh and expired platelet concentrates was observed. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that human platelet <b>lysates</b> produced from expired platelet concentrates can be used as an alternative to fetal bovine serum for mesenchymal stem cell culture to the same extent as <b>lysates</b> from fresh platelets...|$|R
