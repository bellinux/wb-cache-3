5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface.

Due to its mass it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|Poor {{performance}} on the Useful Field of View (UFOV® test) <b>has</b> been linked <b>to</b> negative driving outcomes, such as crashes. The UFOV® test was given {{to a sample of}} drivers 75 + years across the state of Alabama (N= 2235) as a means of attaining a reduction in insurance rates if successful on the test. Results revealed that retrospectively, participants who failed the assessment were 1. 65 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> at-fault crash and 1. 66 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> at-fault insurance claim in the previous five years as compared to participants who passed the assessment. Prospectively, these same participants were 1. 85 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> at-fault crash and 2. 73 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> at-fault claim in the subsequent 1. 29 years after assessment as compared to participants who passed the assessment. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first translational study to investigate the impact of offering an insurance discount for passing such an assessment on prospective at-fault crashes and at-fault insurance claims...|$|R

5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|The house sparrow's main predators are {{cats and}} birds of prey, {{but many other}} animals prey on them, {{including}} corvids, squirrels, and even humans—the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people {{in many parts of}} the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater impact on house sparrow populations. The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Walter Goffart {{argues that}} Bede based {{the structure of}} the Historia on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For {{the early part of the}} work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used Gildas's De excidio. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury was framed on the anonymous Life of Gregory the Great written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid. Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> native Briton presence.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{accepted}} the RAAF's recommendation, and delayed its decision on a MirageIII replacement until late 1981. This gave General Dynamics {{an opportunity to}} offer the improved F-16C to the RAAF. The capability of these aircraft was closer {{to that of the}} F-18 as they were equipped with BVR missiles. Richardson and another RAAF pilot test-flew F-16Cs in May 1981. The F-18 design was also improved during 1981, and was redesignated the F/A-18. When RAAF test pilots flew these aircraft during 1981, they found that the deficiencies they had detected in 1980 were now addressed. Overall, the RAAF concluded that while both aircraft met its requirements and the F-16 was less expensive, the F/A-18 was the superior design as it was more technologically mature, easier to maintain during operational deployments, and <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> much lower attrition rate. The Government accepted this advice, and announced on 20 October 1981 that 75 F/A-18s would be ordered. As part of this announcement, Minister for Defence Jim Killen acknowledged that the F-16 would have been seven percent cheaper to purchase, but stated that the F/A-18's lower running costs and expected attrition rate greatly reduced the difference between the lifetime cost of the two designs.|$|E
