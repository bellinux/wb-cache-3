40|$|Subject of research. The {{problem of}} {{software-based}} compensation of technological variation in chromaticity coordinates of liquid crystal panels is considered. A method of software-based compensation of technological variation in chromaticity coordinates is proposed. The method provides the color reproduction {{characteristics of the}} series-produced samples on-board indication equipment corresponding to the sample equipment, which is taken as the standard. Method. Mathematical calculation of the profile is performed for the given model of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel.</b> The coefficients that correspond to the typical values of the chromaticity coordinates for the vertices of the triangle color coverage constitute a reference mathematical model of the plate LCD panel from a specific manufacturer. At the stage of incoming inspection the sample of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel,</b> {{that is to be}} implemented within indication equipment, is mounted on the lighting test unit, where Nokia-Test control is provided by the formation of the RGB codes for display the image of a homogeneous field in the red, green, blue and white. The measurement of the (x,y) -chromaticity coordinates in red, green, blue and white colors is performed using a colorimeter with the known value of absolute error. Instead of using lighting equipment, such measurements may be carried out immediately on the sample indication equipment during customizing procedure. The measured values are used to calculate individual LCD-panel profile coefficients through the use of Grassman's transformation, establishing mutual relations between the XYZ-color coordinates and RGB codes to be used for displaying the image on the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel.</b> The obtained coefficients are to be set into the memory of the graphics controller together with the functional software and then used for image displaying. Main results. The efficiency of the proposed method of software-based compensation for technological variation of chromaticity coordinates of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel</b> was estimated by the ratio criterion of the areas of cross sections of the histograms p(x,y) at a given probability confidence level, calculated before and after compensation procedure. The sections of histograms, representing distributions of chromaticity coordinates were obtained by mathematical simulation in MathCad 15. 0. The simulation software of the method of software-based compensation gives the possibility to obtain the mutual arrangement between the figures formed by sections of the histograms of (x,y) -chromaticity coordinates, and it may be observed as significant reduction of the area after compensation procedure is performed, and changes in the geometry of the cross section shape as well. Sets of dependency curves were obtained, depicting the efficiency criterion value versus resolution of the colorimeter that is used for measuring the chromaticity coordinates. Practical relevance. Research results are usable for engineers who are designing modern indication equipment based on LCD-panels and by manufacturers for colorimetric calculations and for estimation of technological tolerance of chromaticity coordinates among display units in mass production as well...|$|E

40|$|Complete depth {{information}} can be extracted from analyzing all angles of light rays emanated from a source. However, this angular information is lost in a typical 2 D imaging system. In order to record this information, a standard stereo imaging system uses two cameras to obtain information from two view angles. Sometimes, more cameras are used to obtain information from more angles. However, a 4 D light field imaging technique can achieve this multiple-camera effect through a single-lens camera. Two methods are available for this: one using a microlens array, and the other using a moving aperture. The moving-aperture method can obtain more complete stereo information. The existing literature suggests a modified <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel</b> [LC (<b>liquid</b> <b>crystal)</b> <b>panel,</b> similar to ones commonly used in the display industry] to achieve a moving aperture. However, LC panels cannot withstand harsh environments and are not qualified for spaceflight. In this regard, different hardware is proposed for the moving aperture. A digital micromirror device (DMD) will replace the liquid crystal. This will be qualified for harsh environments for the 4 D light field imaging. This will enable an imager to record near-complete stereo information. The approach to building a proof-ofconcept is using existing, or slightly modified, off-the-shelf components. An SLR (single-lens reflex) lens system, which typically has a large aperture for fast imaging, will be modified. The lens system will be arranged so that DMD can be integrated. The shape of aperture will be programmed for single-viewpoint imaging, multiple-viewpoint imaging, and coded aperture imaging. The novelty lies in using a DMD instead of a LC panel to move the apertures for 4 D light field imaging. The DMD uses reflecting mirrors, so any light transmission lost (which would be expected from the LC panel) will be minimal. Also, the MEMS-based DMD can withstand higher temperature and pressure fluctuation than a LC panel can. Robotics need near complete stereo images for their autonomous navigation, manipulation, and depth approximation. The imaging system can provide visual feedbac...|$|E

40|$|A <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel</b> for a video {{projector}} {{is often used}} for holographic television. However, its pixel size and pixel number are not enough for practical holographic 3 -D display. Therefore, a multipanel configuration is generally used to increase the viewing window and displayed image size, and many spatial light modulators {{should be used in}} them. We propose a novel method to increase the viewing window of a holographic display system. The proposed method, which is implemented by using a mirror module and 4 -f lens set, is to reconfigure the beam shape reflected by a spatial light modulator. The equipment is applied to a holographic display system, which has only a single spatial light modulator; a hologram could be displayed in a wider viewing window by the equipment than that of the conventional method. By the proposed method, the resolution of the reconfigured spatial light modulator has double resolution in the horizontal direction. Inversely, the vertical resolution is decreased. Even if the vertical resolution is decreased, a viewer could get 3 -D effect because humans get more 3 -D information in the horizontal direction. We have experimented using a liquid crystal on silicon (LcOS), whose resolution is 4096 × 2160 pixels. The reconfigured resolution by the mirror module is 8192 × 1080 pixels. From the experiments, the horizontal viewing window is almost two times wider than that without the mirror module. As a result, the hologram can be observed binocularly. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|E
40|$|Super-resolution {{microscopy}} {{is already}} showing huge benefits across the biosciences, but all widely-used techniques require {{the addition of}} fluorescent probes. We have demonstrated optical-super-resolution imaging in unlabelled living cells, using the phenomenon of super-oscillation. Super-oscillation is a mathematical phenomenon, first described in quantum mechanics. It is widely accepted that any function that is band-limited (in frequency) oscillates no faster (in time) than its fastest Fourier component. However, a band-limited super-oscillatory function may oscillate arbitrarily fast in regions of relatively low intensity. In optics, this means that we can create an arbitrarily small hotspot at {{the focus of a}} lens using engineered interference of light. However, super-oscillatory hotspots are necessarily surrounded by sidebands that contain some fraction of the optical power - trading efficiency for resolution. We replace the objective in a confocal microscope with a super-oscillatory lens and use the confocal pinhole to reject the light scattered from the sidebands. The resolution of the image is determined {{by the size of the}} super-oscillatory hotspot. We have developed a super-oscillatory system to image unlabelled cells at super-resolution and high speed. To do this we combine our super-oscillatory microscope with advanced polarisation-contrast imaging. The instrument is a modification of a standard confocal microscope, with two key components: spatial light modulators to shape the laser beam entering the microscope, and a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panel</b> to control the input polarisation. We capture four differently-polarised super-resolved images of the sample and then calculate the anisotropy and orientation angle of each pixel.

40|$|We {{studied the}} changes in the {{transmission}} and contrast properties of a super-twisted nematic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> display <b>panel,</b> induced by the light impinging on the panel it-self. Upon illumination by laser radiation with power density close to that used in practice, the transmittance of the panel increases or decreases according to the brightness voltage that sets the transmittance level. The dynamics of the transmittance change are typically bi-exponential, with a shorter decay time of the order of the fraction of a second and a longer decay of the order of the tens of seconds. The observed changes were interpreted and modeled by considering local temperature changes in the crystal because of the light impinging onto it. The temperature changes produce a shift of the transmittance curve and a change of slope in its central region. The presence of the dip after the Frederickzs region accounts for the anomalous behavior of the transmittance in that portion of brightness voltages.

The solution of accounting problem of the statistical nature of the color characteristics spread for the screens has a particular relevance to aviation instrumentation. Method. Evaluation of chromaticity coordinates shift of the image is based on the application of the Grassmann laws of color mixing. Basic data for quantitative calculation of shift are the profiles of two different <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>panels</b> defined by matrixes of scales for components of primary colors (red, green, blue). The calculation is based on solving the system of equations and calculating the color difference in the XY-plane. In general, the calculation can be performed in other color spaces: UV, Lab.
