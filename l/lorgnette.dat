500|$|The {{birth date}} that Edwards gave {{as his own}} varied {{depending}} on {{the time and place}} he was asked. Parish records show he was christened in England on September 14, 1827, and corroborating this date he gave his age as 25 in June 1853 when he first arrived in Australia. However, when questioned in San Francisco for the 1870 United States Census, he gave his birth year as 1830. Ten years later in Boston, he reported his age as 45, implying a birth year of 1835, but he returned to supplying the year 1830 along with the date August 27 for the brief biographical sketches used by theater and entomological publications. Two years before he died, he told a reporter from the <b>Lorgnette</b> that he was born in 1832. A prominent obituary in The New York Times reported that his family gave his birthday as September 23, 1830, but that some published lists of actors' ages, [...] "not always trustworthy", put his birth year at 1824.|$|E
500|$|The {{paragraph}} she {{distributed to}} publicize the NAACP dance {{caught the eye}} of Floyd J. Calvin, the New York editor for an influential African-American newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, who subsequently named Major as the paper's New York social editor. The paper's announcement of her appointment included a photograph showing her elegantly dressed and posed. The announcement called Major a leader in Harlem society and a [...] "prime favorite in Gotham's best circles." [...] Major's first piece for the paper, which appeared over the byline, Mrs. H. Binga Dismond, reported on plans for the Urban League's costume ball to be held in November 1925. From 1925 to 1927 Major wrote a weekly column called [...] "New York Society" [...] in which she reported the doings of prominent members of the African American community. In 1927 Major began a new column called [...] "Through the <b>Lorgnette</b> of Geraldyn Dismond" [...] which, instead of New York society news, contained essays and reviews on theater, books, and cultural topics. Soon afterward she began writing a weekly column of New York social news called [...] "In New York Town" [...] for the Chicago Bee, and the following year (1928) she started yet another society column, this one called [...] "New York Social Whirl" [...] appearing in the Baltimore Afro-American. She continued to write for the Chicago Bee and the Afro-American {{through the end of the}} 1930s. In 1933 she worked as writer and editor for the short-lived Harlem Daily Citizen, and between 1927 and 1931, in addition to her other news work, she was a writer and editor for the Inter-State Tattler for which she wrote columns called [...] "Social Snapshots of Geraldyn Dismond" [...] and [...] "Between Puffs by Lady Nicotine." [...] She subsequently served a four-year stint as columnist for the New York Age following which, from 1939 to 1952 she was a columnist and editor for the New York Amsterdam News. In 1953 she began a long career as writer and editor for two sister magazines: the monthly, Ebony, and the weekly, Jet.|$|E

60|$|The Baroness {{had dropped}} her <b>lorgnettes</b> on the floor. She stooped {{instantly}} to discover them, rejecting almost peremptorily Wrayson's aid. When {{she sat up}} again she pushed her chair a little further back.|$|R
60|$|Lady Carey {{suddenly}} {{dropped her}} partner's arm. She {{had seen a}} man standing by himself with folded arms and moody face {{at the entrance to}} the ball-room. She raised her <b>lorgnettes.</b> His identity was unquestionable.|$|R

60|$|The {{manager was}} a small man, and Isobel's eyes {{travelled}} over his head. She {{did not seem to}} hear him speak. The Archduchess recovered herself. She took the shattered <b>lorgnettes</b> from the hand of her lady-in-waiting. She pointed to Isobel.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, {{it is the}} {{greatest}} possible compliment to us. All these <b>lorgnettes</b> turned to our box proclaim us indisputable belles. Men would not take the trouble to look at us if we were not pretty. There, child, don't colour up so; the only way is to look perfectly indifferent, {{as if you were}} quite unconscious of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, dear," [...] said Mrs Jehoram, {{putting down}} the <b>lorgnette.</b> [...] "What I {{was going to}} say was, that {{possibly}} he might be a genius in disguise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's disgusting," [...] {{said his}} wife; {{and at this}} General Triscoe, who had been {{watching}} the actress through his <b>lorgnette,</b> said, as if his contrary-mindedness were irresistibly invoked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The canary creeper's got {{in among}} the pine trees now," [...] said {{the man with the}} <b>lorgnette.</b> [...] "It wasn't there this morning. You can see it grow while you watch it." ...|$|E
60|$|From the South {{returned}} that opera troupe whose {{manager is}} never in despair, whose tenor never sulks, whose prima donna never fails, {{and in the}} orchard bona fide matinees were held, to which buttercups and clovers crowded in their prettiest spring hats, and verdant young blades twinkled their dewy <b>lorgnettes,</b> as they bowed and made way for the floral belles.|$|R
6000|$|... "To dine at half-past seven," [...] the Duchess remarked, as {{she looked}} around the {{entresol}} of the great restaurant through her <b>lorgnettes,</b> [...] "is certainly a little trying for one's temper and for one's digestion, but so long as those men accepted, I certainly think they ought to have been here. They know that the play begins at a quarter to nine." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{had reached}} {{the bottom of the}} steps, and were out into the front, when {{suddenly}} the strange lady turned around and gave a little cry of disappointment. [...] "Mes <b>lorgnettes!</b> Mes lorgnettes!" [...] she said. Then glancing round carelessly to me she went on in English: [...] "I have left my opera-glasses inside on the vacant seat. I think, if you will excuse me, I'll go back and fetch them." ...|$|R
60|$|The rope was thrown, and {{the boat}} dragged high and dry upon the pebbly beach. The Princess, after a glance at him through her <b>lorgnette,</b> {{surrendered}} herself willingly to Andrew's outstretched hands.|$|E
60|$|The Duchess {{finished}} her lobster {{and leaned back}} in her chair. Through her tiny platinum <b>lorgnette</b> she looked around the room for several moments. Then a little abruptly she turned again to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{powerful}} face. I wouldn't care anyhow {{to be up}} against it--as people say." [...] And the <b>lorgnette</b> shut with a click. [...] "What is this? Peaches!--Yes, and give me some cream." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{the belle}} in {{question}} {{happened to be}} a gentlewoman--descended from gentlewomen--and after Dashboard's ironical introduction, in which the Man from Solano was not spared, she comprehended the situation instantly. To Dashboard's surprise she drew a chair to her side, made the Man from Solano sit down, quietly turned her back on Dashboard, and {{in full view of the}} brilliant audience and the focus of a hundred <b>lorgnettes,</b> entered into conversation with him.|$|R
50|$|Opera glasses, {{also known}} as theater {{binoculars}} or Galilean binoculars, are compact, low-power optical magnification devices, usually used at performance events, whose name is derived from traditional use at opera performances. Magnification power below 5× is usually desired in these circumstances {{in order to minimize}} image shake and maintain a large enough field of view. A magnification of 3× is normally recommended. The design of many modern opera glasses of the ornamental variety is based on the popular <b>lorgnettes</b> of the 19th century.|$|R
60|$|Just then {{a rabbit}} band of nearly fifty pieces marched in, playing upon golden {{instruments}} {{and dressed in}} neat uniforms. Following the band came the nobility of Bunnybury, all richly dressed and hopping along on their rear legs. Both the ladies and the gentlemen wore white gloves upon their paws, with their rings {{on the outside of}} the gloves, as this seemed to be the fashion here. Some of the lady rabbits carried <b>lorgnettes,</b> while many of the gentlemen rabbits wore monocles in their left eyes.|$|R
60|$|In stalked Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson, bony, durable, tall, high-nosed, frigid, well-bred, thirty-five, in-the-neighbourhood-of- Gramercy-Parkish. She {{put up a}} <b>lorgnette.</b> Mrs. Widdup hastily stooped and {{arranged}} the bandages on Mr. Coulson's gouty foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{certainly}} is a fine woman," [...] said Brimmer gravely, borrowing his companion's <b>lorgnette.</b> [...] "By the way, Markham, do you usually keep an opera-glass in your office {{in case of an}} emergency like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charming, isn't she?" [...] said Lady Viping, and I {{discovered}} those infernal {{glasses were}} {{for a moment}} honoring me. They shut with a click. [...] "Ham," [...] said Lady Viping. [...] "I told him no ham--and now I remember--I like ham. Or rather I like spinach. I forgot the spinach. One has the ham for the spinach,--don't you think? Yes,--tell him. She's a perfect Dresden ornament, Mr. Stratton. She's adorable ... (<b>lorgnette</b> and search for fresh topics). Who is the dark lady with the slight moustache--sitting there next to Guy? Sir Godfrey, who is the dark lady? No, I don't mean Mary Fitton. Over there! Mrs. Roperstone. Ooh. The Mrs. Roperstone. (Renewed <b>lorgnette</b> and click.) Yes--ham. With spinach. A lot of spinach. There's Mr. Evesham laughing again. He's greatly amused. Unusual for him to laugh twice. At least, aloud. (Rustle and adjustment of <b>lorgnette.)</b> Mr. Stratton, don't you think?--exactly like a little shepherdess. Only I can't say I think Mr. Justin is like a shepherd. On the whole, more like a large cloisonné jar. Now Guy would do. As a pair they're beautiful. Pity they're brother and sister. Curious how that boy manages to be big and yet delicate. H'm. Mixed mantel ornaments. Sir Godfrey, how old is Mrs. Roperstone?... You never know on principle. I think I shall make Mr. Stratton guess. What do you think, Mr. Stratton?... You never guess on principle! Well, we're all very high principled. (Fresh exploratory movements of the <b>lorgnette.)</b> Mr. Stratton, tell me; is that little peaked man near Lady Ladislaw Mr. Roperstone? I thought as much!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, with Pyramids {{beside me}} day by day, I re-wrote the play, and {{whenever}} I felt {{a thing to}} be utterly impossible and false I put it down with a grin. And every character I made to talk clap-trap sentiment while Pyramids purred, and I took care that everyone of my puppets did that which {{was right in the}} eyes of the lady with the <b>lorgnettes</b> in the second row of the dress circle; and old Hewson says the play will run five hundred nights.|$|R
50|$|A giant sized filly at 17.1 hands, she was bred {{and raced}} by E. P. Taylor's Windfields Farm. She was sired by the Val de l'Orne, a {{multiple}} stakes winner in France including the Group One Prix du Jockey Club. Val de L'Orne's sire was Val de Loir, the Leading sire in France for three straight years between 1973 and 1975. La <b>Lorgnette's</b> dam was The Temptress, {{a daughter of}} the 1970 British Triple Crown champion Nijinsky who was also bred at Windfields Farm. She was trained by Macdonald Benson.|$|R
60|$|I {{became aware}} of the two old ladies, presences of black and purple silk and fur and shining dark things; they had walked up through the Warren, while the horses took the hill easily, and so had come upon us. Beatrice had gone to them at once with an air of taking refuge, and stood beside and a little behind them. We both rose dejectedly. The two old ladies were evidently quite dreadfully shocked, and peering at us with their poor old eyes; and never had I seen such a tremblement in Lady Drew's <b>lorgnettes.</b>|$|R
