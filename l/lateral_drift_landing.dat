Simple navigation tasks like driving {{in a straight line}} can lead to a strong <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> over time in an unknown environment. In this paper we propose a fast and simple solution for the <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> problem for vision guided robots by real-time scene analysis. Without an environment-specific calibration of the robot’s drive system, we balance the differential drive speed on the fly. Therefore, a feature detector is used on consecutive images.

This paper establishes a new cellular automata model to study typical characteristics of mixed bicycle traffic induced by <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> and its accompanying behavior. Based on derived positive correlation between passing speed and drift speed through survey, the occurrence probability of <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> {{and the degree of}} maintained lateral clearance are both introduced in accordance with the variance of passing speed. Then, in whole density region, firm conformity between simulation results and actual survey data is reached, which has seldom been achieved in previous studies. It is further verified that speed distortions in intermediate and high density region induced by assumption of constant lateral clearance requirements can be revised by introducing its variability characteristics. In addition, two contrastive impacts of <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> behavior are observed. That is, it causes speed fluctuation in low density while alleviating the speed fluctuation in relatively high density. These results are expected to be helpful to improve the simulation performance of mixed bicycle flow as well as depict more realistic vehicle-bicycle conflicts and so on...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of different types and orientations of bracing on the frame structure in terms of <b>lateral</b> <b>drift.</b> Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of ANSYS 12. 0 software has been used to model 30 -storey of 90 m height steel frame building subjected to substantial basic wind speed, or 3 -second gust, of 24 meter per second, and wind load of 0. 969 kPa. Four types of bracing: X-bracing, Inverted V-bracing, K-bracing and single-diagonal bracing were explored and 84 models of different configurations were run.

For specimen SW 8, the bending cracks appeared {{at the base of the}} piers; however, the first crack was observed at 18.50  kN with a <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> of (0.02 %). The first yield of the horizontal reinforcing steel bar was detected at the extremities of the coupling beam, at a load level of 61  kN.

The <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> of the piers and spandrel panel was decomposed in a part associated with both bending and shear deformations and another part associated with rocking rotations of end sections. FE analysis results show that: (1) the ratio between rocking rotations of the spandrel panel {{and those of the}} piers can be predicted through a simple geometrical relationship; (2) overturning moment can induce significant axial force variations in piers, changing their lateral behaviour. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that rocking response was not significantly affected by variations in fracture energies of masonry units and mortar, opposed to the case of individual solid masonry walls. Finally, a simplified analysis of individual piers and macro-element matrix analysis of the as-built sub-assemblage was performed. Several options in terms of pier effective heights, spandrel effective length, size/stiffness of spandrel-pier overlapping zones, and reduction of elastic properties have been tested against experimental and numerical results. It is shown that: (1) <b>lateral</b> <b>drifts</b> in uncracked elastic conditions can be predicted via equivalent frame models with rigid end offsets and different effective heights of piers, depending on their location and performance level considered; (2) reduction factors of elastic properties lower than those allowed by some national and international codes may be required to capture large rocking-induced <b>lateral</b> <b>drifts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} tall {{reinforced}} concrete buildings must satisfy serviceability criteria for <b>lateral</b> <b>drift.</b> It is therefore important to accurately assess the lateral deflection of a structure {{to account for}} the nonlinear effect of cracking in concrete. Iterative procedures are necessary for this serviceability analysis of tall reinforced concrete buildings, because the concrete members that contribute to lateral stiffness have varying degrees of cracking. Two procedures for the determination of <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> in reinforced concrete structures are presented in this paper. These procedures have been verified from the experimental data of tests on full-size structural subassemblages. Both procedures initially consider all the concrete members to be uncracked. An initial analysis then determines the cracked members and their stiffnesses are modified using probability-based effective stiffness relationships. The redistribution of force and subsequent modifications of the member stiffnesses are applied iteratively until convergence of the structural response is obtained. These procedures are computationally more efficient and direct than the general nonlinear finite-element method and are compatible with linear elastic analysis software that is commonly available in most structural engineering design offices...|$|R

40|$|Flat-slab {{buildings}} {{designed and}} detailed for gravity loads only typically {{do not have}} the ability to resist moderate earthquakes without experiencing severe damage. The damage potential of such seismically deficient buildings therefore needs to be assessed and strategies developed to improve their seismic resistance. Punching failure at slab-column connections in non-ductile flat-slab buildings during earthquakes can trigger progressive collapse of floor slabs. Based on the test results {{of a large number of}} interior and exterior connections, a methodology is developed to predict shear and unbalanced moment-transfer capacities of connections under combined gravity and lateral loads. Furthermore, a frame analysis procedure is developed based on the equivalent frame concept which targets both the moment-transfer capacity as well as stiffness of the interior and exterior slab-column connections. The approach employs a parametric hysteretic model and is based on the effective slab-width concept. The proposed procedure for evaluating the seismic capacity of flat-slab connections and frames is verified by comparing the calculated and measured responses of two-bay flat-slab subassemblies tested under earthquake-type loading. Seismic reliability against punching failure of slab-column connections in flat-slab buildings designed for gravity loads was investigated using the proposed equivalent frame approach. The reliability analysis indicated that the flat-slab buildings constructed prior to the 1960 's could experience significant damage during moderate intensity earthquakes. By limiting the gravity load on floor slabs and by controlling the <b>lateral</b> <b>drift,</b> the potential for punching failure in flat-slab buildings can be minimized. The seismic resistance of older flat-slab buildings can be improved by retrofitting interior connections to protect against progressive collapse and by utilizing infill walls to control <b>lateral</b> <b>drift.</b> An economical connection retrofit scheme is proposed and verified experimentally. The equivalent strut concept is used to model masonry infills whose effectiveness in controlling the <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> is demonstrated through theoretical analysis of typical flat-slab frames...|$|R

The vehicle front and rear suspension are modelled using multi-body dynamic analysis software. The front suspension model represents theMacPherson strut design of the vehicle and includes a rack and pinion steering system, brake system, engine subframe, and a powertrain unit. The model has been analysed under two steering control methods: fixed and free control. Suspension characteristics and the effect of deflections arising from the subframe and the lower control arm on these suspension characteristics have been analysed. The simulations confirmed that variation of component stiffness and interactions within components give rise to side-to-side deflections that could affect <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> during braking. It is concluded that side-to-side variation of suspension characteristics can have a detrimental effect on <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> during braking and that compliant components whose stiffness varies from side to side can cause different side-to-side deflections that can induce and influence variation in suspension characteristics such as toe steer angle that can lead the vehicle during braking...|$|R

An operational definition of subjective reliability was developed based on measures of the proportion of <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> warnings that the drivers responded to in the 24 -hour period preceding a warning event that elicited a steering correction (called the day proportion). Age, gender, weather condition, light level, road class, and day proportion were used to model response latency to make a steering correction in a linear model. A main effect of day proportion was found, suggesting that reaction time to respond decreases by about 300 msecs as the day proportion increases from 0 to 1. The study illustrates a method of quantifying subjective reliability and performance using naturalistic data.

40|$|The use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcement {{is currently being}} explored by the construction industry as a new and innovative material. A significant force behind this consideration is the superior performance of FRP material in corrosive environments. FRP possesses high strength-to-weight ratio, favorable fatigue strength, and low relaxation characteristics when compared with steel reinforcement, offering economically and structurally sound alternative for most applications. The majority of current FRP applications {{have been in the}} area of rehabilitation and strengthening of existing structures, although some attempts have been made for application to new construction. The research program consisted of four phases; (i) columns under eccentric monotonic loading; (ii) reinforced cylinders under concentric compression; (iii) columns under constant axial compression and lateral load reversals, and (iv) cantilever beams subjected lateral monotonic or cyclic loading. The results of tests conducted at the Structures Laboratory of the University of Ottawa indicate that CFRP reinforcement can be used effectively in new concrete members. CFRP reinforced columns subjected to eccentric loading were able to develop their expected moment capacities as governed by the crushing of concrete. All columns under cyclic loading sustained a <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> level exceeding 2 % and 2. 5 % limits specified for earthquake resistant columns in the National Building Code of Canada (1995, 2005). Failure in these columns was initiated by the spalling of concrete cover, followed by the buckling of FRP bars in compression at approximately 0. 45 % to 0. 60 % compressive strain, and subsequent crushing of the core concrete. The failure of FRP bars in compression was due to instability. The stability failure of FRP bars in compression was different than that observed in steel reinforcing bars. The hysteretic relationship of flexure dominant FRP reinforced beams indicated stiffness degradation under cyclic loading due to the progressive cracking of concrete and associated softening in the member, developing approximately 3 % <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> ratio prior to failure. This level of <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> may be considered to be sufficient for earthquake resistant construction.

40|$|The {{national}} {{building code}} of Canada (NBCC) {{has been under}} constant evolution since its first issue in 1941. Over the years, knowledge related to structural engineering and more specifically seismic response has continued to evolve through research and field investigations. Recently, the 2005 NBCC has been made available with {{a new perspective on}} seismic design, including uniform hazard spectra provided for each city for static and dynamic analyses. Due to a greater understanding of seismic response of structures and the Canadian seismicity, the NBCC has increased the values of elastic base shears over the years. Between the 1970 and 2005 editions of NBCC, the elastic design base shear has increased by a factor as high as 2. 6. A structure designed in 1970, if subjected to 2005 NBCC compatible design earthquake record would potentially be labeled as seismically deficient and fail under code specified loads. Multiple technologies currently exist to retrofit seismically deficient structures. The purpose of this research is to explore the possibilities of using diagonal prestressing, in various configurations, to increase structural stiffness and decrease <b>lateral</b> <b>drift</b> demands under seismic loading. Shallouf (2005) successfully demonstrated experimentally that a 1 bay, 1 storey R/C frame with masonry infill panels, designed based on the ACI 318 - 1963 building code, hence seismically deficient, could be retrofitted with prestressed cables to reduced <b>lateral</b> <b>drift.</b> In addition, analytical modeling of the 1 storey frame and analysis of a 5 storey structure in a high seismic region (i. e.

The objective of this research is to continue investigating the effectiveness of the retrofit methodology for structures in two different seismic zones, such as Vancouver and Ottawa. Also, it is examined for buildings with different heights. Structures varying between five and fifteen storeys are analyzed.

The fundamental period of Dieh-Dou structures is about 1. 0 s higher than that calculated by the simplified approach of the codes for regular frames; a modal analysis is, therefore, essential for this typology of structure. The elastic analysis, either lateral force or {{response spectrum}}, is shown to be reliable to assess Dieh-Dou frames when quick results are desired. However, a non-linear step-by-step pushover analysis has the advantage of greater accuracy, as it allows mapping the failure trend and indicating the critical elements.
