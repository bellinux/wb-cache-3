40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services in the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1925 he {{published}} a historical novel called L'Aube Rouge ("The Red Dawn") about the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom of Imerina. In it he honored Rainandriamampandry, {{the governor of}} Toamasina who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the Menalamba rebellion. Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, Sylves ("Woodlands") and Volumes, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, L'interférence ("Interference"), which depicts {{the life of a}} noble family from the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the monarchy until colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Rilke, Whitman, and Góngora; he also translated traditional Malagasy kabary (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus {{spent the}} <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life {{wandering}} {{from place to}} place. Hungary's central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or mutilation. He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which {{marked the beginning of}} an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, Unicamp saw {{a period}} of renewal and restructuring.

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E

5|$|Although {{the early}} Meiji era {{witnessed}} a warming between the imperial court and foreign powers, relations with France temporarily soured {{due to the}} initial support by France for the Shogun. Soon however a second military mission was invited to Japan in 1874, and a third one in 1884. A high level of interaction resumed around 1886, when France helped build the Imperial Japanese Navy's first large-scale modern fleet, {{under the direction of}} naval engineer Louis-Émile Bertin. The modernization of the country had started during the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Shogunate, and the Meiji government ultimately adopted the same policy.|$|E
