50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{agriculture}} that fungus-growing ants practice: lower, coral fungi, yeast, generalized higher, and leafcutter agricultural systems. Lower agriculture {{is the most}} primitive system and is currently practiced by 80 species in 10 genera. Coral-fungus agriculture is practiced by 34 species by a single derived clade within the genus Apterostigma. The coral fungus farmers underwent a switch of cultivars between 10 and 20 million years ago to a non-leucocoprineacoeous fungus, which makes its choice of cultivar different from all other attines. Yeast agriculture is practiced by 18 species of Cyphomyrmex rimosus. The C. rimosus group is hypothesized to have evolved growing fungus in a yeast form between 5 and 25 million years ago. Generalized higher agriculture is practiced by 63 species in two genera and refers to the condition of highly domesticated fungus. The fungi used in higher agriculture cannot survive without its agriculturalists to tend it and has phenotypic changes that allow for increased ease of ant harvesting. Leafcutter agriculture, which is a more highly derived form of higher agriculture, is practiced by 40 species in two genera and has the most recent evolution, originating between 8 and 12 million years ago. Leaf cutters use <b>living</b> <b>biomass</b> as the substrate to feed their fungi, whereas in all other types of agriculture, the fungus requires dead biomass.|$|E

The radioindicator method with radionuclide 109 Cd was used to obtain precise and reliable data characterizing Cd compartmentalization in bacterial cells. The following cellular distribution of Cd in <b>living</b> non-growing <b>biomass</b> after 4 h incubation in solutions containing different concentration of Cd 2 + ions (100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 µmol/L) spiked with 109 CdCl 2 under aeration at 30 °C were obtained: in M. luteus almost 85 % of Cd was localized on the cell surface and 15 % in cytoplasm. Similarly, in K. palustris 83 % of Cd was localized on the cell surface and 17 % in cytoplasm. The data were obtained by gamma spectrometry of extracts and solids after sequential extraction of biomass with 5 mM Ca(NO 3) 2 and 20 mM EDTA. Biosorption of Cd by non-living bacterial biomass is a rapid process strongly affected by solution pH and as was confirmed by FTIR analysis beside carboxylate ions also other functional groups such as amino and phosphate contribute to Cd binding by bacterial cell surfaces.

40|$|The {{management}} of forest ecosystems to increase carbon storage {{is a global}} concern. Fire frequency {{has the potential to}} shift considerably in the future. These shifts may alter demographic processes and growth of tree species, and consequently carbon storage in forests. Examination of the sensitivity of forest carbon to the potential upper and lower extremes of fire frequency will provide crucial insight into the magnitude of possible change in carbon stocks associated with shifts in fire frequency. This study examines how tree biomass and demography of a eucalypt forest regenerating after harvest is affected by two experimentally manipulated extremes in fire frequency (i. e., ~ 3 year fire intervals vs. unburnt) sustained over a 23 year period. The rate of post-harvest biomass recovery of overstorey tree species, which constituted ~ 90 % of total <b>living</b> tree <b>biomass,</b> was lower within frequently burnt plots than unburnt plots, resulting in approximately 20 % lower biomass in frequently burnt plots {{by the end of the}} study. Significant differences in carbon biomass between the two extremes in frequency were only evident after > 15 – 20 years of sustained treatment. Reduced growth rates and survivorship of smaller trees on the frequently burnt plots compared to unburnt plots appeared to be driving these patterns. The biomass of understorey trees, which constituted ~ 10 % of total <b>living</b> tree <b>biomass,</b> was not affected by frequent burning. These findings suggest that future shifts toward more frequent fire will potentially result in considerable reductions in carbon sequestration across temperate forest ecosystems in Australia...|$|R
