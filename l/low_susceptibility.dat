The {{potential}} role of polymorphisms in the pfcrt and pfmdr 1 {{genes and}} in vitro susceptibility to amodi-aquine and desethylamodiaquine were explored in 15 chloroquine-resistant Colombian Plasmodium falciparum isolates. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pfcrt gene, including a newly reported mutation (S 334 N), {{were seen in}} isolates with decreased susceptibility to amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine.

This exploratory study suggests that polymorphisms in the pfcrt and pfmdr 1 genes play a role in amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine resistance and warrants further study. The development and expansion of resistance to the main-stay antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) are the major causes for the increased morbidity and mortality of P. falciparum. In response to the increasing resistance, combination therapy, and especially ar-temisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), is now increas-ingly advocated as first-line therapy. 1 The hypothesis is that...|$|R

40|$|Background: Bolivia {{is among}} the lowest-resourced South American countries, with very few data {{available}} on antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of bacterial isolates responsible for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the Bolivian Chaco are reported here. Methods: All clinical isolates from UTIs collected in the Hospital Basico Villa Montes between June 2010 and January 2014 were analyzed (N =  213). Characterization included susceptibility testing, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection, identification of relevant resistance determinants (e. g., CTX-M-type ESBLs, 16 S rRNA methyltransferases, glutathione S-transferases), and genotyping of CTX-M producers. Results: Very high resistance rates were observed. Overall, the <b>lowest</b> <b>susceptibility</b> was observed for trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. Of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, 11. 6 % were ESBL producers. Resistance to nitrofurantoin, amikacin, and fosfomycin remained <b>low,</b> and <b>susceptibility</b> to carbapenems was fully preserved. CTX-M- 15 was the dominant CTX-M variant. Four E. coli ST 131 (two being H 30 -Rx) were identified. Of note, isolates harbouring rmtB and fosA 3 were detected. Conclusions: Bolivia is not {{an exception to the}} very high resistance burden affecting many South American countries.
