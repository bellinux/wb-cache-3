25|$|Dual-process {{theories}} of persuasion (such as the elaboration likelihood model) {{maintain that the}} persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes; central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process. An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag <b>lapel</b> <b>pin,</b> smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirt. Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not {{last as long as}} persuasion based on the central route. If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed, and their previous voting record, this would be using the central route, and would result in longer lasting change, but would require a good deal of motivation to process.|$|E
