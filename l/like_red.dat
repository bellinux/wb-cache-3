5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species <b>like</b> <b>red</b> maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|An {{approximately}} 1,000-person team developed Grand Theft Auto V, an action-adventure video game, {{over several}} years. Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto V on 17 September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 18 November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows, as the fifteenth {{entry in the}} Grand Theft Auto series. Development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was led by Rockstar North's core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects <b>like</b> <b>Red</b> Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, viral marketing strategies and special editions. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point {{has been}} {{designated}} {{as one of the}} most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators <b>like</b> <b>red</b> foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of Arctic terns and a few Mediterranean gulls in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh. The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously. The pastures contain breeding northern lapwings, and species such as sedge and reed warblers and bearded tits are found in patches of common reed.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} pub rock acts managed to achieve {{mainstream}} success after {{the advent of}} punk rock, often being re-categorised as new wave music, including Graham Parker and the Rumour, Nick Lowe, Squeeze and Elvis Costello. London-based R pub rock bands received a major boost when The Jam kicked off the mod revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City, which mixed R standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. Pub rock bands <b>like</b> <b>Red</b> Beans and Rice, The Little Roosters, The Inmates, Nine Below Zero and Eddie and the Hot Rods, became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London. Other bands grew up to feed the desire for mod music, often combining the music of 60s mod groups with elements of punk music, including The Lambrettas, The Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early 80s. Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed The Style Council, who abandoned most {{of the elements of}} punk to adopt music much more based in R and early soul. Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood, re-emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s, being as defined as blue-eyed soul singers.|$|E

25|$|The late 1980s also {{witnessed}} {{the beginnings of}} Indo Western fashion and the haute couture fashion in India that would eventually gain global recognition in the 90s. Colors <b>like</b> <b>red</b> and white were popular, often with intricate embroidery. Although most women continued to wear the saree, Bollywood actresses also had access to Western designer outfits and locally designed garments like the Anarkali ballgown.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture is the {{economical}} back bone of the Chikmagalur {{district with}} coffee cultivation forming the {{major part of}} it. Agricultural production in the district is spread over three seasons— namely Kharif, Rabi and Summer. Important crops grown are cereals, i.e. rice, ragi, jowar, maize and minor millets, pulses <b>like</b> <b>red</b> gram, horse gram, green gram, avrekai (Hyacinth Beans), black gram and Bengal gram. Oil seeds like groundnut, sesamum, sunflower, castor and commercial crops like sugarcane, cotton, and tobacco are also grown here.|$|E
25|$|The main {{land use}} within {{the site is}} grazing by sheep. Deer grazing is also common. The woods in the park are {{currently}} severely overgrazed by sika deer. Grazing has caused damage to many terrestrial habitats, causing heath and blanket bogs to degrade and preventing woodland regeneration. In the upland areas erosion caused by grazing is exacerbated by the exposed nature of the terrain. Pressures from native grazers <b>like</b> <b>red</b> deer and Irish hare have increased since their main natural predators, the wolf and golden eagle, became extinct. Grazing and disturbance of vegetation greatly aids the spread of rhododendron.|$|E
5000|$|Protanopia is {{a severe}} form of red-green color blindness, {{in which there}} is {{impairment}} in perception of very long wavelengths, such as reds.

This problem occurs because patients do not have the red cone cells in the retina. Protanomaly is a less severe version.|$|R

The beach shore has a mentioning in the verse no. 2297 of the 4000 Divya Prabandham written by Peyalwar. The verse, dating back to 7th century AD, was written in Tamil, and it says that the sea was so rich with white waves bringing to the shore very precious gems <b>like</b> <b>red</b> corals and white pearls and that {{the light of the}} dusk (moonlight) falls on these gems at the shore and makes the area brightened with beautiful colours.|$|E

In 2008 a new kit was introduced featuring a red cross {{on the front and}} red strips down the sides of the jersey, shorts and socks were white too with red strips. Also in 2008, the Rugby Football League chose to abandon the traditional English lion on the badge in favour of a much simpler shield and cross design.|$|E
