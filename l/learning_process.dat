Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the <b>learning</b> <b>process</b> by promoting a continuous <b>learning</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator <b>learning</b> <b>process</b> would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the <b>learning</b> <b>process.</b> Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load <b>learning</b> <b>process</b> that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

Drawing on multiple case studies concerning teaching and <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> in large and small Hong Kong secondary-school classes, it highlights the qualitative differences in teaching and <b>learning</b> <b>processes.</b> On the basis of those studies, the book argues for a more purposeful, dynamic approach to education for teachers working in small or reduced-size classes...|$|R
40|$|The {{organisational}} learning literature {{has so far}} focused primarily on intraorganisational <b>learning</b> <b>processes.</b> However, during the last 10 years or so, {{a growing number of}} {{organisational learning}} studies have focused explicitly on interorganisational learning.

40|$|Research {{objective}} Due to {{the significance}} of tacit knowledge in management consulting industry, the successful customer knowledge management (CKM) is critical. Furthermore, when client relationships are crucial, the efficient CKM can create obvious business benefits. The research object is case company’s strategic client teams, which serve company’s strategic clients, which are big (i. e. different industries, organizational structures, and locations). Therefore, the research context is particularly interesting due {{to the importance of}} CKM in these client teams. The goal of this thesis is to explore the relationship of organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> and capabilities in CKM. Because there is limited research in linking these constructs together and hence the further goal of this thesis is to provide new insights on how CKM is influenced by organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> and capabilities {{in the context of a}} Finnish management consulting company. Methodology The foundations of this thesis lie in a qualitative single case study and utilization of abductive research approach. Research data was collected through ten semi-structured one-to-one interviews with strategic client team members. Organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> acted as the main theoretical framework in the interviews. The research data was analyzed through thematic content analysis. Research Findings The main findings of this study were based on linking the CKM, organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes,</b> and capabilities. Organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> facilitated the understanding through which processes the client teams manage customer knowledge and the capabilities that influence both CKM and organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes.</b> It was explored that especially the market-sensing capability was strongly linked to organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes.</b> Additionally, organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> are strongly interrelated influencing each other in different phases of organizational learning. Thus, organizational learning should not be viewed as a straightforward process. Furthermore, of the organizational <b>learning</b> <b>processes,</b> organizational memory was the most significant process in facilitating information acquisition, distribution, and utilization. Also, organizational memory and information and storage and retrieval processes related to it were the key development points in the case company. Regarding the management of customer knowledge, assets including customer database, data quality, and human resources were crucial elements in facilitating organizational capabilities and <b>learning</b> <b>processes.</b> Overall, the relationships of CKM, <b>learning</b> <b>processes,</b> and capabilities should be comprehended in enhancing the management of customer knowledge...|$|R
5|$|The World was {{developed}} by a German programmer named Harald Hoerwick; its backstory {{is based on the}} Epitaph of Twilight, an epic poem by Emma Wielant. Her death inspired Hoerwick to create the game. Elements of the poem are coded into the game's programming. The hidden purpose of Hoerwick's game is to develop the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable of making decisions for itself. To this end, Hoerwick inserted functions into the system which monitor and extract behavioral data from millions of the game's players to aid in the AI's <b>learning</b> <b>process.</b> After Hoerwick's death, these pieces of code became black boxes to the current developers, who cannot fathom their purpose, yet are critical to the proper functioning of the game.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word <b>learning</b> <b>process.</b> According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aim of this}} thesis is to investigate the <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> in INTERREG projects based on the feedback from different project partners in the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007 - 2013. Beginning with the <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> {{at the individual level}} (between project partners) the author examines further the influence of transnational cooperation on <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> within partner’s home organizations. Additionally, the author identifies the main barriers hindering <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> at the both levels. The idea for this research arose from comprehensive literature analysis, which suggested that there is still a paucity of in-depth empirical studies on the <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> in the INTERREG programmes. From a more personal perspective, the inspiration for this thesis derives from the discussions with experts during author’s internship at the Joint Technical Secretariat for the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007 - 2013 in Rostock. Through empirical analysis, the author identifies several categories which refer to learning at the individual and organizational level. These categories are based on the extensive feedback from interviews with seventeen selected project partners from the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007 - 2013. As an outcome of this dissertation the author wishes to gain a practical understanding of the <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> at the transnational cooperation forum. Additionally, the conclusions for empirical analysis constitute an input to the ongoing discussion on the <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> in the INTERREG projects...|$|R
