5|$|In late December, the {{government}} began restoring services gradually. The websites for Xinhua and the People's Daily, two state-controlled media outlets, were made accessible on 28 December, the web portals Sina.com and Sohu.com on 10 January 2010, and 27 more websites on 6 February. But access to websites was only partial: for instance, users could browse forums and blogs but not post on them. China Daily reported that limited e-mail services were also restored in Ürümqi on 8 February, although a BBC reporter writing at approximately the same time said e-mail was not accessible yet. Text messaging on cell phones was restored on 17 January, {{although there was a}} <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many messages a user could send daily.

He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms {{at a time and}} may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period.

The farther away it is the larger the risers for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these risers take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.|$|E
25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have a <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages {{at the expense of}} less frequently updating pages, and (2) the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate {{that there has been a}} dysgenic decline in the world's genotypic IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E

5000|$|The second witness was Knut Bjarkeid, Chief Warden at Ila Prison. Storrvik confronted Bjarkeid with a {{document}} regarding prison Section G being turned part into a [...] "particularly high security department". He read: [...] "There are obvious <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> long {{he can be}} in Section G"; the document was written by Bjarkeid. Storrvik said that [...] "The words are here, obviously there are <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> long he shall be isolated. This was in 2012. He is still in total isolation". After Bjarkeid left the witness stand, Emberland read out loud from a letter that Breivik had written, dated 29 September 2013; in the letter Breivik reported several persons to the police; the Asker and Bærum Police District investigated and later dropped the investigation; Breivik's letter detailed the number of strip searches, [...] "grip manoeuvres", and handcuffings he had undergone.|$|R

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{is that the}} BRIC projections {{are based on the}} assumptions that resources are limitless and endlessly available when needed. In reality, many important resources currently necessary to sustain economic growth, such as oil, natural gas, coal, other fossil fuels, and uranium might soon experience a peak in production before enough renewable energy can be developed and commercialized, which might result in slower economic growth than anticipated, thus throwing off the projections and their dates. The economic emergence of the BRICs will have unpredictable consequences for the global environment. Indeed, proponents of a set carrying capacity for the Earth may argue that, given current technology, there is a finite <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much the BRICs can develop before exceeding the ability of the global economy to supply.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, there is a <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This {{is also the case}} with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E
25|$|At most {{international}} events, {{each country}} may send {{one to a}} maximum of three entries per discipline. Consequently, even if a skater has a high season's best, he or she may not be sent to major events if their country has many good skaters in their discipline. Some skaters have tried to circumvent this by switching to another country. In response, the ISU introduced rules barring skaters from international events for a certain period of time. In the 2010 regulations, it was 24 months or more from the date of the last ISU Championship. In the 2012 regulations, the minimum was 18 months for singles and 12 months for pairs/ice dancers from the date of their last ISU Championships (Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds) and 12 months if they competed in some other international competition. Competitors may sit out for much longer because they also have to obtain a release from their previous federation. The ISU has set no <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> long a country may hold skaters.|$|E

500|$|General {{inpatient}} care is an intensive {{level of care}} which may be provided in a nursing home, a specially contracted hospice bed or unit in a hospital, or in a free-standing hospice unit. General inpatient criteria is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms which require daily interventions from the hospice team to manage. Often, patients on this level of care have begun the [...] "active phase" [...] of dying, when their prognosis is measured in days as opposed to weeks or months. Although there is a <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> long Medicare will cover this level of care, it is usually provided for brief periods of time, with five to seven days being the average.|$|E
500|$|From this it {{is clear}} that smaller values of m will produce [...] closer to the cut-off {{frequency}} [...] and hence will have a sharper cut-off. Despite this cut-off, it also brings the unwanted stop band response of the m-type closer to the cut-off frequency, making it more difficult for this to be filtered with subsequent sections. The value of m chosen is usually a compromise between these conflicting requirements. There is also a practical <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> small m can be made due to the inherent resistance of the inductors. This has the effect of causing the pole of attenuation to be less deep (that is, it is no longer a genuinely infinite pole) and the slope of cut-off to be less steep. This effect becomes more marked as [...] is brought closer to , and there ceases to be any improvement in response with an m of about 0.2 or less.|$|E
