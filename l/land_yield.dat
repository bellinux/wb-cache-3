For government outlays, such tail dependence will increase the transactions and political costs of reallocations from the general fund. In this paper we propose a simple model of yield correlations according to interactions between a weather outcome and a land unit’s yield resilience to adverse shocks, as might be measured by the United States Soil Conservation Service’s land capability classification. Our model shows that yield-yield tail dependence is to be expected and, furthermore, should take a particular form. In better growing regions, yield correlations across units should be stronger in right tails than in left tails, whereas in marginal growing regions the reverse should apply. Using USDA Risk Management Agency unit level data and a variety of statistics, we find strong evidence in favor of this <b>land</b> <b>yield</b> resilience hypothesis. Our findings call into question the appropriateness of current USDA rate-setting methodologies, which posit constant state-conditional ordinal correlations by implicitly assuming that yields can be represented by a Gaussian copula.

40|$|The recent {{dramatic}} {{decline in}} farmland biodiversity is often attributed to agricultural intensification and structural {{changes in the}} agricultural landscape. One suggested farm practice seen to benefit biodiversity and reverse declines is organic farming. Because organic farming {{is viewed as a}} more sustainable form of agriculture it is currently subsidized by European agri-environment schemes. However, the efficiency of agri-environment schemes to preserve biodiversity has recently been questioned, partly because their uptake has been highest in extensively farmed more heterogeneous landscapes. We investigated the effect of farming practice on butterfly species richness and abundance along cereal field headlands and margins on 12 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape diversity). Both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance. There was also a significant interaction between farming practice and landscape heterogeneity, because organic farming only significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance in homogeneous rather than heterogeneous landscapes. An analysis of the distribution of organic farming in Sweden in relation to productivity of the arable <b>land</b> (<b>yield</b> of spring barley, kg ha(- 1)) indicated that the distribution of organic farms was skewed towards extensively farmed agricultural areas. Synthesis and applications. The species richness and abundance of butterflies can be enhanced by actions aimed at both promoting organic farming and increasing landscape heterogeneity. However, the beneficial effect of organic farming was only evident in intensively farmed homogeneous landscapes. Currently, the majority of organic arable land in Sweden is located in heterogeneous landscapes where changing the type of farming practice adds little to the existing biodiversity. We therefore propose that the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming practice must be considered when promoting farmland biodiversity, for example in Europe by developing context-based agri-environment schemes {{to increase the amount of}} organic farming in intensively farmed landscapes. We also propose that in homogeneous agricultural landscapes, organic farming could be used as a more efficient tool to restore landscape heterogeneity if the creation of semi-natural landscape elements was mandatory in the regulations associated with organic agri-environment schemes...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} effect of oil {{spillage}} on cassava farm <b>land,</b> <b>yield</b> and land productivity. Place and Duration of Study: Niger Delta region of Nigeria between January and October, 2012. Methodology: Delta State was purposively chosen from the Niger Delta region for the study. A random sampling technique was employed to select 17 cassava farmers each from three (3) oil spillage communities (Otor-Udu, Olomoro and Uzere) and three (3) nonoil spillage communities (Egini, Aradhe and Ellu), giving a total sample size of 102 respondents for the study. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics, Likert scale, t-statistic and regression analysis. Results: The results showed that the major significant effects of oil spillage on cassava production perceived by the farmers included crop failure, poor yield, rotting tubers, and stunted crop growth with mean scores of 4. 80, 4. 78, 4. 75 and 4. 75 respectively. Others included increased soil temperature and toxicity (mean: 4. 73), reduction of soil fertility (mean: 4. 70), degradation of farm land (mean: 4. 70) and low land productivity (mean: 4. 70). The results further indicated that the cassava farm size, yield and land productivity in oil spillage affected communities were significantly (p < 0. 01) lower than those of the nonoil spillage communities by 0. 61 ha, 6119 metric tonnes (MT) and 1447 MT/ha respectively. These represent significant reduction of 36, 48 and 20 % of these variables in the oil spillage affected communities respectively. About 45 % of the variation in land productivity in cassava production was influenced by oil spillage and the farmers’ farming experience. The productivity increased with increase in farming experience but decreased with increase in oil spills. Conclusion: Constant maintenance of the oil pipelines and tankers to prevent corrosion and checking of the activities of saboteurs which often destroy oil pipelines will reduce the incidence of oil spillage, hence increasing cassava production in the Niger Delta region. There is need for further study to know the adaptation measures the farmers employed to minimize the adverse effects of oil spillage on their production; and the mitigating measures by government and the oil companies to deal with oil spillage...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic sea-ice thickness, {{concentration}} and extent all {{play a vital}} role in controlling the exchange processes between ocean and atmosphere in the polar regions. This study investigates how distributions of these characteristics are determined by sea-ice growth, drift and deformation. Drift and deformation of East Antarctic sea ice are investigated using in situ observations of sea-ice drift since the mid 1980 s, and results from numerical models. From the drift data a climatology of the East Antarctic sea-ice velocity distribution is derived, and recurrent features in the drift pattern are identified. The average daily drift speed in the westward flow near the Antarctic coast is 0. 22 m s - 1 (19. 0 km d- 1) with considerable spatial and temporal variability. In the eastward flow north of the Antarctic Divergence the average is 0. 17 m s - 1 (14. 7 km d- 1). The average ice motion over wide parts of the overall East Antarctic sea-ice zone has a net northward component (0. 04 m s - 1 or 3. 5 km (1 - 1) transporting pack ice equatorward. A new method is used to derive the mean winter position of the Antarctic Divergence from ice-movement data. It is found that during winter the Antarctic Divergence is further north than the mean annual position derived from hydrographic measurements. Thermodynamic ice growth near the coast of East Antarctica is modelled using field data obtained since the late 1950 s. The availability of atmospheric and some hydrographic observations makes it possible to estimate the heat flux from the oceanic mixed-layer to the underside of the sea ice. The magnitude of this oceanic-heat flux is highest in early spring, and lowest in autumn. Annual mean values of the oceanicheat flux vary between 5 and 12 W M- 2, with an average of 7. 9 W M- 2. On decadal time-scales a decrease in oceanic-heat flux is found from the 1950 s to 1980 s for the area studied. At sites close to the coast the annual maximum ice thicknesses are linked to the extent of the cooling of the oceanic mixed-layer occuring in upstream polynyas. Data from a regional experiment in the coastal current off Adelie <b>Land</b> <b>yield</b> new insight into sea-ice deformation and the variability of forcing processes. Although ice drift is dominated by long-term changes, sea-ice deformation exhibits significant short-term variability. Numerical simulations show that in the absence of tidal forcing, inertial motion can account for the formation of substantial open water within the pack. Regional modelling shows that such a motion has a considerable impact on the ice growth, and can roughly double the rate of ice production by allowing rapid growth in recurrent open-water patches. This also significantly increases the amount of salt rejected to the ocean...|$|E

40|$|The {{world is}} under {{significant}} pressure. The human population {{is projected to}} increase by 30 % over the next {{quarter of a century}} to reach 8. 3 billion by 2030 (UNPP, 2008). During this period, in developing countries, there {{is likely to be a}} rapid increase in demand for livestock products, driven by increasing urbanisation and rising incomes (Delgado et al., 1999). At the same time, the impacts of a range of driving forces such as water availability, climate change, and technological innovations on smallholder crop and livestock production may be substantial. The result of these drivers is that the farming systems responsible for global food security will inevitably change. The challenge is to ensure that the resource-poor, mixed crop-livestock, smallholder sector, which currently provides the majority of milk and meat in the tropics, is able to take advantage of the opportunity to meet the increased demand for these products. To do so the sector will need to intensify, but at the same time it is vital that this does not compromise household food security, sustainable natural resource management or rural livelihoods. Mixed systems: trends and potential future impacts Mixed crop-livestock systems, where crops and livestock are integrated in the same farm, have been the backbone of sustainable pro-poor agricultural growth in the developing World. Their significance cannot be ignored in the global development agenda. Two thirds of the global population live in or in the proximity of these systems. They produce 50 % of the world’s cereals and more importantly, produce most of the staples consumed by poor people: 41 % of maize, 86 % of rice, 66 % of sorghum and 74 % of millet production. They also produce the bulk of livestock products in the developing world – 75 % of the milk and 60 % of the meat—and employ many millions of people in long value chains. Rates of growth in production and consumption of agricultural products are significantly higher in these systems than in others, with livestock production and consumption rates doubling those of crops (Herrero et al., 2009). Recent work (Herrero et al., 2009, 2010) suggests that, first, mixed intensive systems in the developing world are under significant pressures, caused by the rising demands of the human population, income shifts, and high rates of urbanisation. Some are reaching a point where production is being constrained by resources, as land per capita decreases. Significant trade-offs in the use of resources (land, water, nutrients) exist in mixed systems, especially as the demands for biomass for food, feed and energy increase. In the intensive mixed systems, crop residues and food-feed crops are vital livestock feed resources. The prices of food-feed crops are likely to increase at faster rates than the prices of livestock products, and stover production will vary widely from region to region to 2030. Large increases in stover production are projected for Africa as a result of (mostly) productivity increases in maize, sorghum, and millet. On the other hand, stover production may stagnate in some areas, notably in the mixed systems of South Asia, which have the largest numbers of ruminants in any system globally. In such systems, as ruminant numbers continue to increase, this may place a considerable squeeze on the availability of stover per animal. In such situations, stover will need to be substituted by other feeds in the diet, to avoid significant feed deficits, although the production of alternative feeds for ruminants in the more intensive mixed systems may be constrained by land and water availability. Second, important productivity gains could be made in the more extensive mixed rainfed areas. In these systems, with less pressure on the <b>land,</b> <b>yield</b> gaps of crops and livestock are still large. Pro-poor policies and public investments in infrastructure will be required to create a system of incentives, reduce transactions costs, and improve risk management in these systems. Integration of production in these systems to supply agro- ecosystems services (feeds, food, etc) to the more intensive systems will need to be investigated and promoted, where possible. Third, the livestock revolution, at least from a ruminant perspective, could potentially exclude the poor in terms of the benefits of consumption of meat. If green fodders become scarce due to land and water shortages and more grains are fed to ruminants to match production, this may increase the prices of animal products further, thus bypassing the ability of the poor to consume more milk and meat. This would present significant challenges in mixed systems, particularly in Asia. Fourth, while the costs of mitigating and adapting to climate change may not represent an enormous constraint to the growth of the global livestock sector as a whole, different livestock systems exhibit markedly a different capacity to adapt to climate change, or to take on board the policy and regulatory changes that may be required in the future. The vulnerability of households dependent on livestock, particularly in the drier areas, will increase substantially. A key research area is the development and implementation of comprehensive frameworks that can be used for impact assessment and trade-off analyses, in identifying and targeting production, adaptation and mitigation options in the mixed systems that are appropriate for specific contexts, and that can contribute to environmental sustainability as well as to poverty alleviation and economic development. Such work is also needed to inform the sustained public policy action that will be necessary to ensure that livestock system development can play its role as a tool for growth and poverty reduction, even as global and domestic trends and economic processes create substantial opportunities for sector growth...|$|E
