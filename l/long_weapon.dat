6000|$|Instantly a {{hand was}} laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this happy thought; as {{instantly}} the stranger's long sword was {{out and the}} meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump {{with the flat of}} it. The next moment a score of voices shouted, [...] "Kill the dog! Kill him! Kill him!" [...] and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself against a wall and began to lay about him with his <b>long</b> <b>weapon</b> like a madman. His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with undiminished fury. His moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, [...] "Way for the King's messenger!" [...] and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of harm's reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger caught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and the multitude.|$|E
60|$|Well {{it was for}} {{him that}} he raised the iron club, for, just as he lifted it, there flew out from the thicket {{something}} long, and slim, and black, that fluttered above his head for a moment, and then a loop {{at the end of}} it fell round the head of Theseus, and was drawn tight with a sudden jerk. But the loop fell also above and round the club, which Theseus held firm, pushing away the loop, and so pushed it off that it did not grip his neck. Drawing with his left hand his bronze dagger, he cut through the leather lasso with one stroke, and bounded into the bushes from which it had flown. Here he found a huge man, clad in the skin of a lion, with its head fitting to his own like a mask. The man lifted a club made of the trunk of a young pine tree, with a sharp-edged stone fastened into the head of it like an axe-head. But, as the monster raised his <b>long</b> <b>weapon</b> it struck on a strong branch of a tree above him, and was entangled in the boughs, so that Theseus had time to thrust the head of the iron club full in his face, with all his force, and the savage fell with a crash like a falling oak among the bracken. He was one of the last of an ancient race of savage men, who dwelt in Greece before the Greeks, and he fought as they had fought, with weapons of wood and stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "For a {{few moments}} he stood still, glaring at me out {{of a pair of}} eyes that shone like burning coals; then, mad with rage, he flung me off my feet and whirled me round and round like a ball in a sling, and finally cast me from him to a {{distance}} of a hundred yards, so great was his strength. I was launched with tremendous force into the middle of some thorny bushes, but had no sooner recovered from the shock than out I burst with a yell of rage and charged him again. For, you will hardly believe it, sirs, by some strange chance I had carried away his weapon, firmly grasped in my hands. It was a heavy two-edged dagger, sharp as a needle, and while I grasped the hilt I felt the strength and fury of a thousand fighting-men in me. As I advanced he retreated before me, until, seizing the topmost boughs of a great thorny bush, he swung his body to one side and wrenched it out of the earth by the roots. Swinging the bush with the rapidity of a whirlwind round his head, he advanced against me and dealt a blow that would have crushed me had it descended on me; but it fell too far, for I had dodged under it to close with him, and delivered a stab with such power that the <b>long</b> <b>weapon</b> was buried to its hilt in his bosom. He uttered a deafening yell, and at the same moment a torrent of blood spouted forth, scalding my face like boiling water, and drenching my clothes through to the skin. For a moment I was blinded; but when I had dashed the blood from my eyes and looked round he had vanished, horse and all.|$|E

50|$|Another {{distinction}} is {{their approach to}} the relative value of cut versus thrust. The general lengthening of rapiers in Europe showed a clear preference for the thrust, relegating the cut to a distant second place. Destreza, on the other hand, refused {{to make such a}} distinction, maintaining that the cut could be as useful as the thrust depending on the situation, adapting their weapons accordingly. Although fencers from the Iberian Peninsula developed a reputation for using very <b>long</b> <b>weapons,</b> the weapons used in Destreza were generally shorter than the rapiers used elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Vanguard: Vanguards use <b>long</b> <b>weapons,</b> like polearms and greatswords, and {{prefer to}} stay a bit farther from the enemy.

6000|$|The {{first that}} came up with me was he that had no weapons, so I thought I might parley with him, and {{speaking}} as country-like as I could, I {{asked him what he}} wanted? [...] "Thou'st knaw that soon," [...] says Yorkshire, [...] "and ise but come at thee." [...] "Then keep awa', man," [...] said I, [...] "or ise brain thee." [...] By this time the third man came up, and the parley ended; for he gave me no words, but laid at me with his long pole, and that with such fury, that I began to be doubtful of him. I was loth to shoot the fellow, though I had pistols under my grey frock, as well for that the noise of a pistol might bring more people in, the village being on our rear, and also because I could not imagine what the fellow meant, or would have. But at last, finding he would be too many for me with that <b>long</b> <b>weapon,</b> and a hardy strong fellow, I threw myself off my horse, and running in with him, stabbed my fork into his horse. The horse being wounded, staggered awhile, and then fell down, and the booby had not the sense to get down in time, but fell with him. Upon which, giving him a knock or two with my fork, I secured him. The other, by this time, had furnished himself with a great stick out of a hedge, and before I was disengaged from the last fellow, gave me two such blows, that if the last had not missed my head and hit me on the shoulder, I had ended the fight and my life together. 'Twas time to look about me now, for this was a madman. I defended myself with my fork, but 'twould not do. At last, in short, I was forced to pistol him and get on horseback again, and with all the speed I could make, get away to the wood to our men.|$|E
60|$|Next morning {{my friend}} Kua-ko, taking his zabatana, {{invited me to}} go out with him, and I consented with some misgivings, {{thinking}} he had overcome his superstitious fears and, inflamed by my account of the abundance of game in the forest, intended going there with me. The previous day's experience had made me {{think that it would be}} better in the future to go there alone. But I was giving the poor youth more credit than he deserved: it was far from his intention to face the terrible unknown again. We went in a different direction, and tramped for hours through woods where birds were scarce and only of the smaller kinds. Then my guide surprised me a second time by offering to teach me to use the zabatana. This, then, was to be my reward for giving him the box! I readily consented, and with the <b>long</b> <b>weapon,</b> awkward to carry, in my hand, and imitating the noiseless movements and cautious, watchful manner of my companion, I tried to imagine myself a simple Guayana savage, with no knowledge of that artificial social state to which I had been born, dependent on my skill and little roll of poison-darts for a livelihood. By an effort of the will I emptied myself of my life experience and knowledge--or as much of it as possible--and thought only of the generations of my dead imaginary progenitors, who had ranged these woods back to the dim forgotten years before Columbus; and if the pleasure I had in the fancy was childish, it made the day pass quickly enough. Kua-ko was constantly at my elbow to assist and give advice; and many an arrow I blew from the long tube, and hit no bird. Heaven knows what I hit, for the arrows flew away on their wide and wild career to be seen no more, except a few which my keen-eyed comrade marked to their destination and managed to recover. The result of our day's hunting was a couple of birds, which Kua-ko, not I, shot, and a small opossum his sharp eyes detected high up a tree lying coiled up on an old nest, over the side of which the animal had incautiously allowed his snaky tail to dangle. The number of darts I wasted must have been a rather serious loss to him, but he did not seem troubled at it, and made no remark.|$|E

50|$|For a <b>long</b> <b>weapon,</b> {{such as a}} pike, {{the hands}} are placed well apart, with the right this time {{at or near the}} butt end of the weapon, and is placed well back of the hip, and the left hand {{stretched}} out toward the opponent. The switched places of the hands from the previous weapon are because the right hand (the dominant and more dextrous hand) has more control of the movements of the <b>long</b> <b>weapon</b> when at the back than at the front, due to the added length and weight of the weapon and also because there is more leverage to be applied from behind than from in front now. In this case the pivot point is the left hand. In the case of the previous, medium, weapon, the pivot point in the manipulation of the spear or sword is really somewhere between the two hands, but closer to the forward, right, hand. The stance with the <b>long</b> <b>weapon</b> is with the left foot now in front, with the right foot behind. So, to thrust the <b>long</b> <b>weapon</b> forward, both hands are used initially, as in the last weapon, and the left hand is then released to allow the point to pass as far forwards as possible. The right leg is brought up to step far in front of the left, and the left brought into alignment with the right foot and the point. Then, the right pulls back on the weapon, allowing the left to re-grip. The feet can be put through a reverse of what they have just done to return to the on guard position.|$|E

50|$|A recurve bow is a bow with limbs that curve {{away from}} the archer when unstrung.

A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where <b>long</b> <b>weapons</b> could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.|$|R
