5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> blue whales were driven north by {{expanding}} ice, {{and some have}} stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{was born}} on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which {{probably}} corresponds to 20July 356 BC, although the exact date is disputed, in Pella, {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Macedon. He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 1835, Texas {{declared}} {{itself an}} independent state, and a provisional government was formed with Henry Smith of Brazoria elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his {{command of the}} army, and Sam Houston was named army chief. Edward Burleson was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> of lingering animosity over his land dealings.|$|E

50|$|Its {{popularity}} <b>likely</b> increased <b>because</b> of {{the prominence}} of several Roman Catholic saints, including Teresa of Ávila, Thérèse of Lisieux and, most recently, Mother Teresa.|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June 1, 1989. It was an above average {{season in which}} 15 tropical depressions formed. Eleven depressions attained tropical storm status, and seven of these attained hurricane status. Two hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> of relatively small amounts of dust within the Saharan Air Layer. Four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season and caused 124deaths and at least $10.54billion in damage.|$|E
5|$|The German {{cartographer}} Johann Bayer {{used the}} Greek letters alpha to theta to label {{the most prominent}} stars in the constellation, while his countryman Johann Elert Bode subsequently added iota to phi. Only lambda and pi remain in use, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> of their proximity to the north celestial pole. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39stars brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story {{was certainly the}} church proper and the place of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E
50|$|The bridge(s) {{forms the}} {{continuation}} of Kungsgatan ("The King Street"), which was given its name in 1881, most <b>likely</b> chosen <b>because</b> it crosses Drottninggatan ("The Queen Street").|$|R
50|$|Before Churyumov-Gerasimenko's {{perihelion}} passage in 2009, its rotational period was 12.76 hours. During this {{perihelion passage}}, it decreased to 12.4 hours, which <b>likely</b> happened <b>because</b> of sublimation-induced torque.|$|R
50|$|This snail is {{only known}} {{from a single}} site on the wet seaside cliffs of the islet. The population, though small, is <b>likely</b> stable <b>because</b> the island is {{isolated}} from most threats.|$|R
5|$|The diet of the {{bramble shark}} {{includes}} smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, {{it is an}} occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers, and {{may be used for}} fishmeal and liver oil. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> of overfishing.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden {{developed}} {{the conventions of}} northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E
50|$|The {{land that}} is now Sol' was the {{location}} of intermittent human settlements ranging from the Stone Age to the foundation of Sol' itself. It was <b>likely</b> settled <b>because</b> of its advantageous position.|$|R
50|$|Tongue Wash was <b>likely</b> {{so named}} <b>because</b> it is {{shaped like a}} tongue.|$|R
50|$|Topeka was <b>likely</b> {{so named}} <b>because</b> the {{landscape}} reminded settlers of Topeka, Kansas.|$|R
5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E
5|$|Porting Final Fantasy XI to the Xbox proved {{difficult}} due to compatibility issues {{greater than}} was hoped for between Xbox Live and PlayOnline, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> {{the latter was}} designed first. After negotiation, Xbox 360 players were able {{to play the game}} through PlayOnline's servers exclusively, despite Microsoft's initial wish that Square Enix would use its own platform. Downloadable content was also not available on the platform since the game played through PlayOnline. It was hoped that content would eventually be offered through the Xbox Live Marketplace. Final Fantasy XII started out as a game designed for the PlayOnline game platform.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. <b>Likely</b> <b>because</b> of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor {{in defiance of the}} detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
50|$|Strict {{liability}} reduces litigation costs, {{because a}} plaintiff need only prove causation, not imprudence. Where causation {{is easy to}} establish, parties to a strict liability suit will most <b>likely</b> settle, <b>because</b> only damages are in dispute.|$|R
50|$|Castilleja kaibabensis {{is one of}} {{fourteen}} Castilleja {{that occur in the}} state of Arizona. While the population is apparently stable, the population counts are <b>likely</b> inaccurate <b>because</b> another, similar Castilleja species, Castilleja integra, grows in the same area.|$|R
50|$|The EEOC uses punitive {{monetary}} fines {{as their}} primary form of deterrence; it is <b>likely</b> that <b>because</b> the EEOC has not adjusted {{a great many of}} their fines for inflation, the backlog of EEOC cases illustrates eroding deterrence.|$|R
5|$|Remains {{attributed}} to Hypogeomys australis are known from Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar and Antsirabe in central Madagascar, suggesting a broad former distribution. Its range {{is not known}} to overlap that of H.antimena, which has undergone a dramatic reduction during the Holocene. A bone from Andrahomana has been radiocarbon dated to about 4440 BP and another to 1536 BP. Although almost nothing is known of the ecology of H.australis, Goodman and Rakotondravony presumed that it was similar to its living relative in living in burrows in areas with loose soils. H.australis shows relatively high content of carbon-13 isotope, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> it ate some plants which were enriched in carbon-13 through C4 carbon fixation and crassulacean acid metabolism; both of these photosynthesis-related processes occur most frequently in plants adapted to dry environments.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, 2000. It was an above average {{season in which}} 19tropical cyclones formed. Fifteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these attained hurricane status. Three hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> of an ongoing La Niña in the Pacific Ocean. Three hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 77deaths and $1.2billion in damage (2000USD). Hurricane Florence and Isaac and Tropical Storm Leslie also caused damage and fatalities, though {{none of the three}} made landfall. The last storm of the season, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on October 29, over a month before the official end of {{hurricane season}} on November30.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Scale Song" [...] was {{the last}} song {{recorded}} on the band's original demo, and was <b>likely</b> included <b>because</b> it was an instrumental, {{and did not have}} a vocal track by the groups first singer, Steve Anderson.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{discrepancy}} {{over the}} death toll depending upon the source, as this number is claimed to be 35, or 31. The discrepancy <b>likely</b> arose <b>because</b> four bodies could not be recovered. All of the fatalities were among the passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Boca Grande" [...] in Spanish {{literally}} means [...] "Big Mouth". This {{name was}} most <b>likely</b> chosen <b>because</b> the restaurant offers {{large portions of}} food, implying that the diner will need a big mouth to handle the portions.|$|R
5|$|Wolves kill dogs on occasion, {{with some}} wolf populations relying on dogs as an {{important}} food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered {{a major problem in}} Scandinavia and Wisconsin. The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers, with older animals being most at risk, <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed {{the value of his}} collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E
5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most <b>likely</b> <b>because</b> it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
50|$|It was {{probably}} first entered and charted by Captain Nathaniel Palmer in November 1820, and was <b>likely</b> named <b>because</b> {{of the possibility}} in thick weather of confusion between this feature and nearby South Bay, where Johnsons Dock was frequented by the early sealers.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the booklet}} in the Repertoire Records CD reissue {{of the album}} in 2001, Frampton and Dee Anthony {{recommended}} Armageddon to A&M Records, and it is <b>likely</b> that <b>because</b> he was their top selling artist at the time, they agreed to sign the band.|$|R
