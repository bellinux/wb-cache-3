40|$|One {{hundred and}} one {{patients}} with through-knee amputations attending the Manchester <b>limb-fitting</b> <b>centre</b> are reviewed. Most amputations were performed for trauma or vascular disease. The interval from amputation to measurement {{for the first}} prosthesis averaged 12 weeks in cases of primary healing, and 21 weeks when healing was delayed. Artificial limbs were successfully fitted to 83 %, and only 10 % failed to use either a limb or a pylon. Three-quarters of those with outdoor mobility returned to work...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a new device should embrace {{the needs of the}} target population. A survey of {{prosthetic}} limb users was performed at the Oxford <b>Limb-Fitting</b> <b>Centre,</b> Headington, Oxford, as part of the specification for an intelligent hand prosthesis. Users of prosthetic limbs were questioned about the positive and negative attributes of their limb and were asked about their wishes for the design of prostheses. A questionnaire was devised to address this and sent to 80 subjects; 69 % responded. It was found that light weight, durability, ease of cleaning, longevity of operation (up to 12 hours), and suitability for driving were highlighted as priorities. This information was incorporated into the {{design of a}} new powered hand prosthesis. This article reviews the results of the survey and makes comparisons with similar studies. Finally, recommendations are made for the designs of any new prosthesis system...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To examine psychosocial {{adjustment}} in persons with lower limb amputations related to diabetes. Methods: Thirty-eight participants with diabetes-related lower limb amputations, recruited from two <b>limb-fitting</b> <b>centres,</b> completed three psychological self-report assessments: the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales (TAPES); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and the Amputation Body Image Scaleâ€”Revised (ABIS-R). Results Over 18...|$|R
