A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and <b>longer</b> for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much <b>longer</b> half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be <b>longer</b> than for alcohol.|$|E
