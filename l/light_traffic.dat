25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of <b>light</b> <b>traffic,</b> but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E

The actual average speed of the rakes on the slow lines is about 35km/h, while rakes on fast lines average about 45–50km/h on a typical run.|$|E
25|$|When the {{earthquake}} hit, the third {{game of the}} 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually <b>light</b> <b>traffic.</b> If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed {{to take into account}} the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after {{the earthquake}}.|$|E

25|$|Heavy or <b>light</b> <b>traffic</b> {{within the}} ride system can cause speed {{variations}} as the vehicles {{try not to}} enter the specified safety distance between one another. On busy days, each vehicle may slow to a crawl at intervals within the ride path {{in order to allow}} the vehicle ahead to gain distance, then suddenly jerk back into higher speed. Because of these unexpected variations in speed, the soundtrack to the ride is not of a specific length, in fact, each scene of the attraction has a pre-selected score to play which is already of a certain length. If the vehicle finds itself remaining in one scene {{for an extended period of}} time, the score will play in full or until the vehicle leaves the scene. If the vehicle remains in a scene longer than the length of the score, then an exaggerated soundtrack of the vehicle's engine will fade-in and play to keep riders from experiencing awkward silence. Due to safety reasons, vehicles on the ride path cannot reverse. Contrary to the finale scene when the vehicle reverses away from the boulder, the vehicle is actually stationary while the motion base tilts backwards and the cave walls accelerate past the riders to give the illusion of reversing.|$|E

2500|$|This {{issue has}} led to a {{conflict}} in the United States between the vision-impaired and civil engineering communities. [...] One solution is to provide manually-operated pedestrian crossing signals at each entry. This increases construction and operation costs, and requires some way to disrupt traffic long enough for the pedestrian to cross (such as a HAWK beacon) that defeats the purpose of the roundabout. Signalisation also increases delays for most pedestrians during periods of <b>light</b> <b>traffic,</b> since pedestrians need to wait for a signal to change before (legally) crossing.|$|E
2500|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, streets were {{designed}} by engineers who were charged only with ensuring smooth motor vehicular traffic flow and not with fostering the other functions of streets. Traffic calming initiatives have grown to consider other design functions as well. For example, {{it has been shown}} that car traffic severely impairs the social and recreational functions of public streets. The Livable Streets study by Donald Appleyard (1981) [...] found that residents of streets with <b>light</b> <b>traffic</b> had, on average, three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets with heavy traffic which were otherwise similar in dimensions, income, etc.|$|E

Typical initial construction standards were [...] width for <b>light</b> <b>traffic</b> trails and [...] for heavier traffic trails, usually just graded through the countryside. In permafrost areas corduroy road construction techniques were used. Small streams were bridged with culverts. Initially larger streams were forded or had ferries provided (such as the ferry across the Tanana at Rika's Landing), but as time and funds permitted, larger bridging projects were carried out, such as the [...] bridge across the Tazlina River, and the [...] bridge across the Tonsina River.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the morning}} of 26 August, 553rd and 204th Fd Companies {{completed}} [...] the rear trestle and approach to the bridge, but when {{attempts were made to}} bring in the rafts to form the first bridge, they were raked by fire in mid-stream and about two-thirds of the crews became casualties. By mid-day half the rafts were in position, but casualties were so heavy that the CRE of 43rd Division, Lt-Col Tom Evill, temporarily withdrew his men. In the afternoon the enemy fire slackened, and the Class 9 bridge (named 'David') was complete by 17.20. <b>Light</b> <b>traffic</b> began to flow, but with little hope of the Bailey bridge ('Goliath') being ready quickly, the Corps Chief Engineer, Brig B.C. Davey, ordered a Bailey pontoon raft to be built as a ferry. With all of the available bridging engineers fully employed, Davey set 207th Fd Park Co to start unloading equipment and reconnoitring approaches while specialist sappers were called up from the rear. The first vehicle rafted across was an RE bulldozer to prepare a ramp; however, it became bogged down and a new ramp had to be built. By 06.00 on 27 August the first tanks were being ferried across to drive off German counter-attacks.|$|E
