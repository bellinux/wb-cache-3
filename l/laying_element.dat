40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of England's first women justices of the peace (JPs) {{on the work of}} lay magistrates in the period 1920 – 50. It argues that the early women JPs (many of whom had been active in the women's suffrage campaign), and the organizations that they belonged to, helped to transform the institution of the lay magistracy by adopting a more ‘professional’ approach, evidenced in their willingness to educate and train themselves for their new role. In consequence, this article challenges conventional definitions of ‘professionalism’, arguing that, where the work of JPs was concerned, the boundary between ‘voluntary’ and ‘professional’ activities was less clear than might be supposed. Furthermore, the willingness of many women magistrates in particular (later followed by some of their male colleagues) to undergo training helped to ensure the survival of the <b>lay</b> <b>element</b> {{in the criminal justice system}} to the present day. ...|$|R

For two reasons, the SPD expected considerable opportunities for influencing a legislative solution at the national level, even if such a law needed a two-thirds majority. First, they interpreted the referendum as strong support for social democratic positions. Second, Wilhelm Marx's (third) government was flirting {{with the idea of}} including the SPD in the government, in other words with the formation of a grand coalition, which would necessitate first entertaining social democratic demands. However, after lengthy negotiations, the changes to the government bill for compensation of the princes were finally rejected: there was to be no strengthening of the <b>lay</b> <b>element</b> in the Reich special courts; the SPD suggestion that the judges of that court should be elected by the Reichstag was also rejected; there was also no provision for resumption of property disputes that had already been settled but on unfavourable terms for the states.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the {{conversation}} at Mr. Torkingham's dinner-table {{was not of}} a highly exhilarating quality. The parson, in long self-communing during the afternoon, had decided that the Diocesan Synod, whose annual session at Melchester had occurred in the month previous, would afford a solid and unimpeachable subject to launch during the meal, whenever conversation flagged; {{and that it would}} be one likely to win the respect of his spiritual chieftain for himself as the introducer. Accordingly, in the further belief that you could not have too much of a good thing, Mr. Torkingham not only acted upon his idea, but at every pause rallied to the synod point with unbroken firmness. Everything which had been discussed at that last session--such as the introduction of the <b>lay</b> <b>element</b> into the councils of the church, the reconstitution of the ecclesiastical courts, church patronage, the tithe question--was revived by Mr. Torkingham, and the excellent remarks which the Bishop had made in his addresses on those subjects were quoted back to him.|$|R
5000|$|In England in 1980 lawyer Larry Gostin {{called for}} psychosurgery {{to be subject}} to [...] "the strictest legal and ethical scrutiny". He {{identified}} a number of problems with the newer forms of psychosurgery: the lack of any reliable theoretical position relating to psychosurgery, with different forms of surgery used in similar cases, and similar surgery used {{for a wide range of}} psychiatric conditions; the absence of controlled trials; the difficulty in assessing changes in character caused by the surgery; and the irreversible nature of surgery on brain tissue that appeared to be structurally normal. In spite of these ethical concerns, he noted, there had never been in the UK any [...] "guidelines, controls, regulations or monitoring arrangements relating to its use". Gostin argued that psychosurgery should only be given with the consent of the patient and approval of an independent body comprising a multi-disciplinary legal and <b>lay</b> <b>element.</b> His proposals were largely incorporated into the Mental Health Act 1983, and led to a significant fall in the use of psychosurgery in England and Wales.|$|R

This exotic presbyterianism, organised in Lancashire, was never introduced into Cheshire.

It claimed no jurisdiction, but met for ordination of ministers, approval of elders (where congregations chose to have them), spiritual exercises and advice. Martindale was a warm advocate of this union. In his own congregation six elders were chosen, but only three agreed to act; the presbyterian system of examination, as a necessary preliminary to communion, he discarded. He kept his people together, though 'the chiefe for parts and pietie leaned much towards the congregationall way.' ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} public {{attitude towards}} police services and, more particularly, police misconduct. It contextualises and explains the current complaints system, especially whether it satisfies the complainant and endears public confidence. It shows how aberrant police behaviour exposes {{some of the}} sociological issues such as black over- representation in complaints statistics, alleged black provocation in situational street incidents, substantiation rates and the likely outcome of black and Asian complaints. Analysis of the main sociological texts on the police suggest a continuing problem with the vexed issue of constabulary independence. The autonomous nature of this principle has helped to create partiality in terms of complaints that favour the police against the citizen. In {{the eyes of some}} citizens this has tended to reduce the legitimacy of the complaints process. The main analysis suggests that certain policing practices have a greater impact on diverse sections of the public which, when coupled with under-use of the complaints process tends to put a stopper in the bottle of fermenting discontent. To restore confidence and involve those who are socially excluded, the dysfunctional effects of inaccessibility, complication and inequality should give way to easy access, simplification and informality. The thesis addresses these problems by suggesting a move to more utilitarian ideals designed to be more customer focused. The model of 'good practice' is prescriptive and ensures an independent <b>lay</b> <b>element</b> to complaints investigation and resolution. The principle of civil libertarian ideals prevails in the proposed model and this seeks to redress the balance where justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done...|$|R

40|$|In this essay, I relate {{material}} in the original published work – John Stuart Mill – Victorian Firebrand (Atlantic Books, 2007) to {{the claim that the}} central features of Mill’s thought can be seen more clearly through a biographical lens. The original contribution of the main work lies in the excavation and application of biographical material to the development of Mill’s philosophy. The poor development of Mill’s utilitarianism results in part from a lack of personal investment and aspiration. Mill’s motivation was to atone for earlier, premature assaults on Jeremy Bentham’s philosophy - rather than to develop it further. As a consequence, his mature utilitarianism is hard to integrate with his liberalism, which was where his primary interest <b>lay.</b> <b>Elements</b> of Mill’s liberalism also bear a biographical imprint. The central emphasis on self-creation in Mill’s liberal ethic results, in part, from his own ‘crisis’ and subsequent departure from the rationalist utilitarianism of his father and Bentham. Similarly, Mill’s focus on individuality stemmed in part from a concern to demonstrate he was not, himself, a ‘made man’. Openmindedness became a central liberal virtue, for Mill, following his criticism of Bentham’s (and his father’s) narrowness of thought. Character was also essential to liberty, since only those of strong character could create themselves and express their individuality, rather than succumbing to custom. Mill’s partner and later wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, had an influence on Mill’s thought. The experience of gossip and ostracism, in the years before their marriage, strengthened Mill’s opposition to the ‘despotism of custom’. More substantively, Harriet’s views on socialism, the ballot and feminism clearly influenced Mill’s own treatment. Without Harriet, {{he would have been a}} less committed socialist and feminist – and would have remained a supporter of the right to vote in secret...|$|R

About 1795, persecution led the Methodists {{to take the first}} step towards separation from the Church of England. Heavy fines made it impossible for preachers in poor circumstances to continue without claiming the protection of the Toleration Act, and the meeting-houses had to be registered as dissenting chapels. In a large number of cases this had only been delayed by so constructing the houses that they were used both as dwellings and as chapels at one and the same time. Until 1811 the Calvinistic Methodists had no ministers ordained by themselves; their enormous growth in numbers and the scarcity of ministers to administer the Sacrament — only three in North Wales, two of whom had joined only {{at the dawn of the}} century made the question of ordination a matter of urgency.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 Caches {{are used}} in almost every modem {{processor}} design to reduce the long memory access latency, which is increasingly a bottleneck to program performance. For caches to be effective, programs must exhibit good data locality. Thus, an optimizing compiler may have to restructure programs to enhance their locality. We focus on the class of restructuring techniques that target array accesses in loops. There are two approaches to enhancing the locality of such accesses: loop restructuring and array restructuring. Under loop restructuring, a compiler adopts a canonical array layout but transforms {{the order in which}} loop iterations are performed and thereby reorders the execution of array accesses. Under array restructuring, in contrast, a compiler <b>lays</b> out array <b>elements</b> in an order that matches the access pattern, while preserving the flow of control. While loop restructuring has been studied extensively, array restructuring has received much less attention despite advantages such as its applicability to complicated loop structures that may hamper loop restructuring. To fill the void, this dissertation investigates how to perform array restructuring effectively [...] efficiently, automatically, and generally. We present a formal framework for array transformations that meet these objectives. Such transformations are represented by linear transformations of array index vectors. Within this framework, we develop algorithms to solve various problems in array restructuring: selecting transformations based on the access pattern, <b>laying</b> out <b>elements</b> of restructured arrays, and determining which elements are accessed by a loop and thus restructuring only that part of an array. To evaluate our array restructuring technique, we implemented a prototype compiler and performed a series of experiments with loops commonly used in related loop restructuring studies. Experimental measurements showed that array restructuring improved performance substantially in many cases, despite a modest runtime overhead in some. Moreover, the results also indicated that array restructuring complemented loop restructuring in applicability and performance: it applied where loop restructuring did not; when both applied, it offered comparable, sometimes even better, performance; in cases where it did not perform as well, loop restructuring improved performance considerably anyway. This observation points to the potential benefit of integrating the two complementary approaches...|$|R
