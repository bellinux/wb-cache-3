5|$|Rudolf Ernst {{joined the}} Bank in Winterthur in 1895. He was also {{financial}} {{director of the}} City of Winterthur for 16 years. At the young age of 36, he was elected in 1901 to the Board of Directors of the Bank in Winterthur and as its chairman at the same time. During his chairmanship, the bank changed its focus from its original <b>lending</b> <b>business</b> and began to expand its issuing and asset management franchise. With the acquisition of the Bank in Baden in 1906, the bank gained a branch in Zurich and {{a seat on the}} stock exchange, one of the cornerstones for the successful merger in 1912 with the Toggenburger Bank to form Union Bank of Switzerland. Rudolf Ernst also held directorships on the boards of various industrial and insurance companies. Between 1912 and his retirement in 1941, he was chairman of the Board of Union Bank of Switzerland, in an alternating capacity with Carl Emil Grob-Halter, who held the chairmanship in 1916 and 1918 as the representative of the merger partner Toggenburger Bank.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these complex economic conditions, thrift managers resorted to several innovations, such as alternative mortgage instruments and interest-bearing checking accounts, {{as a way to}} retain funds and generate <b>lending</b> <b>business.</b> Such actions allowed the industry to continue to record steady asset growth and profitability during the 1970s even though the actual number of thrifts was falling. Despite such growth, there were still clear signs that the industry was chafing under the constraints of regulation. This was especially true with the large S in the western United States that yearned for additional lending powers to ensure continued growth. Despite several efforts to modernize these laws in the 1970s, few substantive changes were enacted.|$|E
500|$|Zayat {{filed for}} Chapter 11 Bankruptcy {{protection}} in February 2010. He {{stated that the}} problem was that the Lexington branch of the bank worked with the Thoroughbred industry and was willing to restructure his loans, while the bank's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati {{wanted to get out of}} the equine <b>lending</b> <b>business</b> altogether. Stating that Fifth Third was [...] "reneging on its promises," [...] Zayat filed a countersuit in April 2010, alleging the bank engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices. When he thought the bank was willing to restructure its loans, Zayat withdrew 67 horses he intended to sell at Keeneland's 2009 September and November sales and instead purchased 24 more yearlings. [...] He had also paid Fifth Third $4.3 million from the proceeds of the sale of breeding rights to Zensational, all of which left him low on cash when the bank called in its loans. Zayat said the bank was using [...] "scorched earth" [...] tactics and accused it of trying to put him out of business, explaining that had he known the bank would not extend his loans, he would have sold enough horses to make his payments.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of mergers among German savings banks {{on the extent to which}} these savings banks engage in small <b>business</b> <b>lending.</b> The ongoing {{consolidation}} in the banking industry has sparked concerns about the continuous availability of credit to small businesses which has been further fueled by empirical studies that partly confirm a reduction in small <b>business</b> <b>lending</b> in the aftermath of mergers. However, using a proprietary data set of German savings banks we find strong evidence that in Germany merging savings banks do not significantly change the extent to which they <b>lend</b> to small <b>businesses</b> compared to prior to the merger or compared to the contemporaneous lending by non-merging banks. We investigate the merger related effects on small <b>business</b> <b>lending</b> in Germany from a bank-level perspective.
