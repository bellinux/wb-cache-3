5|$|After one {{additional}} lap had been run, IndyCar officials red-flagged the race as the track was {{not suitable for}} racing. In addition to the debris <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fifteen cars involved in the wreck, the asphalt surface was damaged and the catch fencing needed repair. As the teams waited {{to see if they}} would resume racing, they also were waiting for word on Wheldon's condition as word had not been relayed to the track.|$|E
5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, {{primarily}} in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois.

5|$|At this time, one of De Morgan's 1902 tablets was removed. Commemorating four {{workers who}} had died in an {{accident}} at the East Ham Sewage Works in 1895, Watts had mistakenly listed the incident as having taken place at the West Ham Sewage Works in 1885. The DeMorgan tablet was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton tablet giving the correct location and date. As the Doulton tablets were in such a different style to DeMorgan's, the replacement tablet was installed in the second row next to the three new tablets to police officers, rather than in the space <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> original.|$|E

5|$|Clay {{and fine}} silt, {{dominated}} by lutite, were {{deposited in the}} lake. Closer to the shore, sand was also emplaced. Deltaic deposits have been found as well. Minerals identified include biotite, chlorite, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and muscovite, with varying colors depending {{on the origin of}} the sediments. The material deposited by Lake Cahuilla is also known as the Cahuilla formation. The Borrego and Pleistocene Brawley formations may also be linked to Lake Cahuilla. These lacustrine materials bury {{the northern part of the}} Colorado River Delta, and they give the ground a grayish color. The clays <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lake were used for the production of ceramic by the inhabitants of the region; likewise Lake Cahuilla is responsible for the fertile soils of the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley, an important agricultural province of the United States. Halite deposits <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lake were mined in the 19-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Despite widely varying {{treatment}} (some {{groups were}} actively targeted for genocide, {{while others were}} not), some died in concentration camps such as Dachau and others from various forms of Nazi brutality.

5|$|In the typhoon's early stages, {{news reports}} {{stated that the}} outer bands of the storm {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the Philippines, resulting in 16 fatalities. However, a meteorological analysis of the storm showed that Kirogi was {{not responsible for the}} rain; instead, a monsoon depression that later became Typhoon Kai-tak caused the flooding rains. Typhoon Kirogi was never closer than 835km (520mi) from the Philippines. However, large swells produced by the storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of the Philippines, forcing workers in Manila to clear debris <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> damaging waves.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were present}} in lower Florida 10,000years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was {{comparatively}} empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe that any traces <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just {{to the west of}} the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000years before the present. The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells <b>left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Tiga Dara {{has been}} {{considered}} a classic of Indonesian cinema, with themes which remain relevant for modern Indonesian society. It was remade as Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta (Three Maidens Seek Love) in 1980 by Djun Saptohadi and influenced Teguh Karya's Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta (Lover <b>Left</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Train, 1989). A second remake, Ini Kisah Tiga Dara (This is the Story of Three Maidens), was produced by Nia Dinata and released in September 2016. In 2015 Tiga Dara was restored and converted to 4K digital by L'immagine Ritrovata Laboratory.|$|E
