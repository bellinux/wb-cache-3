50|$|A typical {{sample and}} hold circuit stores {{electric}} charge in a capacitor and contains at least one switching device such as a FET (field effect transistor) switch and normally one operational amplifier. To sample the input signal the switch connects the capacitor to the output of a buffer amplifier. The buffer amplifier charges or discharges the capacitor so that the voltage across the capacitor is practically equal, or proportional to, input voltage. In hold mode the switch disconnects the capacitor from the buffer. The capacitor is invariably discharged by its own leakage currents and useful load currents, which makes the circuit inherently volatile, but the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> (voltage drop) within a specified hold time remains within an acceptable error margin.|$|E

50|$|The ions {{pass through}} the {{accelerating}} electrode and strike the target. When ions strike the target, 2-3 electrons per ion are produced by secondary emission. In order to prevent these secondary electrons from being accelerated back into the ion source, the accelerator electrode is biased negative {{with respect to the}} target. This voltage, called the suppressor voltage, must be at least 500 volts and may be as high as a few kilovolts. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> suppressor <b>voltage</b> will result in damage, possibly catastrophic, to the neutron tube.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of this circuit arrangement stems from {{the placement of the}} upper field-effect transistor (FET) as the load of the input (lower) FET's output terminal (drain). Because at operating frequencies the upper FET's gate is effectively grounded, the upper FET's source voltage (and therefore the input transistor's drain) is held at nearly constant voltage during operation. In other words, the upper FET exhibits a low input resistance to the lower FET, making the voltage gain of the lower FET very small, which dramatically reduces the Miller feedback capacitance from the lower FET's drain to gate. This <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> gain is recovered by the upper FET. Thus, the upper transistor permits the lower FET to operate with minimal negative (Miller) feedback, improving its bandwidth.|$|E

50|$|Procainamide {{works as}} an {{anti-arrhythmic}} agent and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmia. It induces rapid block of the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels of the heart muscle and acts as antagonist to long-gating closures. The block is voltage-dependent and can occur from both sides; either from the intracellular or the extracellular side. Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. Procainamide is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result from the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, procainamide has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of procainamide, the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking {{is determined by the}} membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels. Procainamide slows the conduction velocity and increases the refractory period, such that the maximal rate of depolarization is reduced.|$|E
50|$|Starters using {{magnetic}} contactors usually derive {{the power}} supply for the contactor coil {{from the same}} source as the motor supply. An auxiliary contact from the contactor is used to maintain the contactor coil energized after the start command for the motor has been released. If a momentary <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> supply <b>voltage</b> occurs, the contactor will open and not close again until a new start command is given. this prevents restarting of the motor after a power failure. This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply <b>voltage</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a phase. However since contactor coils will hold the circuit closed with as little as 80% <b>of</b> normal <b>voltage</b> applied to the coil, {{this is not a}} primary means of protecting motors from low voltage operation.|$|R

Sodium and potassium conductances were distributed so that the surface and cleft membranes had similar channel density.

40|$|Evolving {{controllers}} for multilegged robots in simulation {{is convenient}} and flexible, {{making it possible}} to prototype ideas rapidly. However, transferring the resulting controllers to physical robots is challenging because it is difficult to simulate realworld complexities with sufficient accuracy. This paper bridges this gap by utilizing the Evolution of Network Symmetry and mOdularity (ENSO) approach to evolve modular neural network controllers that are robust to discrepancies between simulation and reality. This approach was evaluated by building a physical quadruped robot and by evolving controllers for it in simulation. An approximate model of the robot and its environment was built in a physical simulation and uncertainties in the real world were modeled as noise. The resulting controllers produced well-synchronized trot gaits when they were transferred to the physical robot, even on different walking surfaces. In contrast to a hand-designed PID controller, the evolved controllers also generalized well to changes in experimental conditions such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> and were more robust against faults such as loss of a leg, making them strong candidates for real-world applications. ...|$|E

Under control conditions, the ACh-induced channels had three conductance states, 10, 20, and 33 p 5, at {{a temperature of}} 100. The intermediate conductance state (20 PS) was the most prevalent. Moreover, an excessive number of very short events was observed which contributed to a deviation of the channel open-time distribution from a single-exponential function. At 20 #{ 176 },the amplitude of these currents was increased (Q = 1. 4), and the mean channel open time was decreased (Q 3). Bupivacaine and its quaternary derivative (5 - 50 tiM), when inside the patch micropipette with ACh, caused shortening of the channel open time, but the single-channel conductance remained unchanged at all concentrations studied.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{security}} assessment of electricity Distribution Networks (DNs) with vulnerable Distributed Energy Resource (DER) nodes. The adversary model is simultaneous compromise of DER nodes by strategic manipulation of generation set-points. The loss to the defender (DN operator) includes <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> regulation and cost of induced load control under supply-demand mismatch caused by the attack. A 3 -stage Defender-Attacker-Defender (DAD) game is formulated: in Stage 1, the defender chooses a security strategy to secure a subset of DER nodes; in Stage 2, the attacker compromises a set of vulnerable DERs and injects false generation set-points; in Stage 3, the defender responds by controlling loads and uncompromised DERs. Solving this trilevel optimization problem is hard due to nonlinear power flows and mixed-integer decision variables. To address this challenge, the problem is approximated by a tractable formulation based on linear power flows. The set of critical DER nodes and the set-point manipulations characterizing the optimal attack strategy are computed. An iterative greedy approach to compute attacker-defender strategies for the original nonlinear problem is proposed. These results provide guidelines for optimal security investment and defender response in pre- and post-attack conditions, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Polarization change curves, {{defined as}} a {{difference}} between the polarization curve at the beginning of life and the actual polarization curve after the cell has been operational for some time, were used to analyze degradation of a PEM fuel cell stacks. Such an analysis identified and quantified different losses due to degradation, i. e., it assessed the fuel cell state of health. In order to verify that this state of health assessment method indeed identifies the real causes of fuel cell degradation, it was applied to a controlled experiment involving a single cell with known or previously independently determined degradation mechanism(s) by being exposed to an accelerated stress test for electrocatalyst degradation. Degradation, i. e., <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> was due to increase of activation losses and increase of resistance in the catalyst layer, both most likely due to the loss of catalyst electrochemically active area. The results of the polarization change curves analysis correspond to the findings of the periodic individual tests performed during the accelerated stress test, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry.
