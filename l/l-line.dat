40|$|Transuranic nuclides {{have been}} {{released}} into the environment {{since the beginning of}} the nuclear age. In many of the areas so contaminated, a significant fraction of the plutonium appears under the form of radioactive particles (also called ‘hot’ particles). In previous works, García López et al. (2007) [1] and Jiménez-Ramos et al. (2010) [2], radioactive particles from aircraft accidents in Palomares and Thule have been characterized. Using micro-Proton Induced X-ray Emission (μ-PIXE) and confocal X-ray fluorescence microprobe (μ-XRF), the <b>L-lines</b> of the main components in these particles, U and Pu, were analyzed. In this work, the key goal is the possibility to determine elemental ratios and concentration of transuranic elements in hot particles from the same areas but using their K-lines, because of their advantages in comparison with the study of <b>L-lines.</b> Indeed, the U and Pu K-lines present not overlapping between the main peaks in the spectra and the X-ray absorption in the sample is much lower than for <b>L-lines.</b> We acknowledge the Junta of Andalucía for the financial support through the Project 2009 /RNM- 138.

30|$|Portable XRF, {{while being}} widely {{used for the}} {{investigation}} of paintings [21 – 24], should be interpreted with care as physical processes such as attenuation, absorption and matrix effects can influence the outcome. Furthermore, so-called escape peaks, scatter peaks, peaks originating from the instrument as well as overlapping peaks can complicate interpretation, which is especially challenging when investigating non-homogeneous multilayer materials such as paintings. Given these limitations, while peak areas are used to facilitate interpretation, {{the results of this}} study should be considered as qualitative, showing merely trends. A notorious difficulty, applicable to white paint, is the overlap between Ti K-lines and Ba <b>L-lines</b> [21]. This overlap can challenge the identification of titanium when barium is also present [7]. Hence, in this study, the applicability of PyMCA (Python MultiChannel Analyzer) [25] for deconvolution of these overlapping peaks is evaluated with self-made reference paints. As comparison of XRF spectra can be challenging, more and more accounts of additional multivariate data analysis are reported, mostly on processed data extracted from spectra (such as elemental concentrations) [26 – 31]. It is in this scope that, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used in this paper to enhance the interpretability of the pXRF dataset.|$|R

40|$|Livestock meat {{production}} capacity {{is related to}} muscle fiber numbers and growth. Muscle fibers develop during early embryonic development from proliferating and differentiating myoblasts. Postnatal muscle growth requires satellite cell proliferation and differentiation. Myoblast and satellite cell proliferation and differentiation is regulated by the genes of the MyoD gene family (myogenin, myf- 5, myf- 6, and MyoD 1). Our aim was to study the mRNA expression of these genes in postnatal muscle tissue in relation to porcine selection for growth rate or leanness. Five boars from a line selected for fast growth (F-line) and five boars from a line selected against backfat thickness (<b>L-line)</b> were slaughtered, and biopsies were taken from 12 muscles. Between-line effects, within-line effects {{in relation to the}} performance of the pigs, and muscle-specific effects were studied. Comparing the F-line with the <b>L-line</b> revealed significantly greater myogenin, myf- 5, and MyoD 1 mRNA expression in some muscles of the F-line. The expression of myf- 6 showed a tendency for the opposite effect in some muscles. Muscles were ordered by their muscle-specific growth rate (b-value). Within-line evaluation of the data revealed a systematic muscle effect for the myf- 6 expression level in the F-line because higher b-values correlated with increased myf- 6 expression level. Backfat thickness was negatively related to myogenin expression in the F-line. A relationship was found between myogenin:MyoD 1 mRNA expression ratio and meat color/muscle fiber type composition in the <b>L-line.</b> Furthermore, the myogenin:MyoDl ratio was greater in muscles from F-line boars than in muscles from <b>L-line</b> boars, which relates to the difference between the lines in muscle fiber type. We conclude that the mRNA levels of the MyoD genes in porcine muscle tissue at slaughter showed different relationships to selection for growth rate when evaluated between selection lines and within selection lines...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{to adapt to}} stress {{is not only an}} animal health and welfare concern, but also {{influences}} reproduction potential and robustness. An important pathway involved in the stress response is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) that results in the release of cortisol from the adrenal gland. In this study the cortisol responses of South African Merinos were measured to assess HPAA responsiveness to stress and relate it to behavioural stress responses to flock-isolation. The experiment was structured according to a 2 × 2 statistical design, with CYP 17 genotype (WT 1 /WT 1 vs. WT 1 /WT 2) and selection line (H-line vs. <b>L-line)</b> as factors. Selection line criteria was based on divergent selection for (H-line) or against (<b>L-line)</b> maternal multiple rearing ability, where the H-line generally outperformed the <b>L-line</b> in terms of reproduction, animal welfare and resistance to certain pathogens. The CYP 17 genotype is involved in the biosynthesis pathway of cortisol. In the present study the CYP 17 genotype showed a significant influence on behavioural stress responses, where three parameters of the flock-isolation test were affected (P&# 60; 0. 05), namely the number of bleats uttered, the urinating frequency and the average distance from a human operator. It is suggested that the CYP 17 genotype affects behavioural responses via its effects on cortisol production, and that the SNPs located within the CYP 17 genotype may have application in marker-assisted selection of sheep...|$|E

From the correlation of the X-ray intensity with solar-wind flux on time scales of about half a day, and from the short-term (~ 10 minutes) variations of the X-ray intensity, these lines most likely arise from solar-wind heavy ions interacting with neutral material in the Earth's magnetosheath.

30|$|Macroscopic X-ray {{fluorescence}} maps {{were collected}} using a Bruker M 6 Jetstream instrument [14]. The instrument {{consists of a}} measuring head with a Rhodium-target microfocus X-ray tube (30  W, maximum voltage 50  kV, maximum current 0.6  mA), and a 30  mm 2 XFlash silicon drift detector (SDD) with beryllium window (energy resolution < 145  eV at Mn–Ka). By slowly moving the measuring head on the XY-motorized stage, the painting was scanned pixel by pixel, line by line. By recording the emitted X-ray fluorescence radiation, the chemical elements present in the paint, which are associated with specific pigments, could be identified. The beam size is defined {{by means of a}} polycapillary optic with a focal spot of c. 40  µm. The measuring spot can be varied by changing the distance between the paint surface and the measuring head. A typical distance of c. 1  cm results in a spot of c. 350  µm. An area of maximum 80  ×  60  cm is scanned in one session that typically lasts several hours. Paintings of larger dimensions need to be scanned in sections that are then assembled. The Jewish Bride was scanned in a total of four scans. X-ray tube settings were 50  kV and 600  mA; a step size of 900 – 950  µm, and a dwell time of 70  ms/step were used.

30|$|EDX {{data have}} been {{collected}} on an FEI-Osiris microscope operated at 200  kV and equipped with a Brücker EDX system consisting of four silicon drift detectors which ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio even at a probe size < 1  nm. The sample has been prepared as wedge-shaped by focused ion beam (FIB) to study {{the influence of the}} thickness on the composition measurements. The quantitative EDX analysis has been carried out by two methods, namely the Cliff-Lorimer method (or k-factor method) [15] implemented in commercial EDX software and the ζ-factor method, first proposed by Watanabe et al. [16]. The Cliff-Lorimer method relates the concentration ratio of two elements to the ratio of the intensity peaks in the spectrum through the so-called k-factors. Its most serious limitation is the difficulty to correct the X-ray absorption, since it requires prior knowledge of the specimen thickness and density at the point of analysis, which are usually unknown. Such a correction is crucial for precisely quantifying light atoms like N and Al in AlGaN. On the other hand, the ζ-factor method takes into account X-ray absorption, thanks to the simultaneous determination of the mass thickness and composition of the sample at each point of analysis. Basically, the method uses an iterative procedure to compute the mass thickness, composition, and absorption correction terms. More details for thin lamella analysis {{can be found in the}} original paper of Watanabe et al. [16]. Although this new quantification procedure is still unavailable on commercial systems, our group is developing this new method using reference samples of known thickness and composition [17]. In the present case, the ζ-factors for N, Al, and Ga K-lines as well as Ga <b>L-lines</b> have been directly measured on the same equipment, at the same operating conditions, using the following as reference samples: GaN, Si 3 N 4, and AlN for N; Al 2 O 3, MgAl 2 O 4, albite, orthoclase, and AlN for Al; and GaP, GaN, and GaAs for Ga.|$|R
40|$|Until now, the {{determination}} of Cd at trace levels in aqueous samples by TXRF has been restricted. When Mo-target X-ray tubes are used, low sensitivity and interferences with Cd <b>L-lines</b> used for quantification prevent trace analysis. Alternatively, when W-target X-ray tubes are used Cd excitation is limited. For this reason, a sample pretreatment is usually necessary to extract, isolate and concentrate Cd prior to TXRF analysis. In the present contribution, the feasibility of a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction approach (DLLME) combined with TXRF for ultratrace Cd determination in different types of environmental waters is shown. Parameters affecting the extraction procedure and TXRF measurement conditions have been carefully evaluated to ensure the highest sensitivity for Cd determination. Using the best analytical conditions, {{it was found that}} the minimum cadmium content that could be detected in an aqueous solution was 0. 04 μg L- 1. This value is more than two orders of magnitude lower compared with the direct TXRF analysis of Cd in aqueous samples. The precision of the methodology was evaluated in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD) of six replicate analyses of a standard solution containing 3 μg L- 1. The precision of the method was determined to be approximately 5 % RSD. In order to test the suitability of the method when dealing with complex matrices as well as the influence of interfering ions, {{the determination}} of Cd in spiked water samples (sea water, estuarine water and river water) at the levels of 1 μg L- 1 and 5 μg L- 1 was undertaken and Cd added to the samples was quantitatively determined. Our results give insight into the possibilities of the combination of DLLME and TXRF for ultratrace Cd determination in different types of environmental waters. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
