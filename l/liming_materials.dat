40|$|The {{application}} of agricultural limestone to acid soils {{has often been}} found to be beneficial for crop production, especially when legumes are included in the cropping system. The extent to which these benefits are realized depends to a great extent on the chemical and physical properties of the <b>liming</b> <b>material,</b> rate of its application, degree of incorporation, and a variety of soil and climatic factors. Numerous {{attempts have been made to}} evaluate the speed with which <b>liming</b> <b>material</b> will react with the soil but very little of this research has been conducted in Nebraska using procedures and management practices commonly used by the Nebraska farmer. A study was established, therefore, to evaluate the time required for different sized lime particles to react with the soil at several application rates. The liming treatments were evaluated using laboratory procedures commonly available to the farmer of Nebraska. It was believed that evaluating the <b>liming</b> <b>material</b> in this manner would be of practical value both for the farmer and for the laboratory making the lime recommendation.

40|$|Although some {{methods for}} {{determining}} lime requirement of pond soils {{are available and}} commonly used, {{there is still no}} consensus on whether it is more effective to apply <b>liming</b> <b>materials</b> to the bottoms of empty ponds or to wait and apply them over the water surface after ponds are filled. There is also little information on how deep lime reacts in pond sediment over time, and whether the depth of reaction is different when <b>liming</b> <b>materials</b> are applied to the water or to the soil. Therefore, three techniques for treating fish ponds with agricultural limestone were evaluated in ponds with clayey soils at a commercial fish farm. Amounts of agricultural limestone equal to the lime requirement of bottom soils were applied to each of three ponds by: direct application over the pond water surface; spread uniformly over the bottom of the empty pond; spread uniformly over the bottom of the empty pond followed by tilling of the bottom. Effectiveness of agricultural limestone applications did not differ among treatment methods. Agricultural limestone also reacted quickly to increase total alkalinity and total hardness of pond water to acceptable concentrations within 2 weeks after application. The reaction of lime to increase soil pH was essentially complete after one to two months, and lime had no effect below a soil depth of 8 cm.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility of utilizing sluiced fly ash as a <b>liming</b> <b>material</b> on acidic soils. A greenhouse experiment was established to examine the influence of the ash on soil pH values and the yield and chemical composition of corn, soybeans, wheat and alfalfa grown on amended soil. The sluiced ash had an initial pH value of 9. 1 (1 : 1 H 2 O) and contained an equivalent CACO 3 content of 11. 5 % (+ 0. 2 %) based on total content of Ca and Mg in the ash. Fly ash was applied at rates of up to 167 tonnes ha- 1 to samples of the surface horizon (0 - 15 cm) of an acidic clay textured soil found local to the power plant. Application of fly ash increased soil pH values but a high concentration of boron in the added ash limited plant growth.
