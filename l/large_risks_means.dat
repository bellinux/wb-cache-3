40|$|Much of the {{justification}} for environmental rulemaking rests on estimates of the benefits to society of reduced mortality rates. This research aims to fill gaps in the literature that estimates {{the value of a}} statistical life (VSL) by designing and implementing a contingent valuation study for persons 40 to 75 years of age, and eliciting WTP for reductions in current and future risks of death. Targeting this age range also allows us to examine the impact of age on WTP and, by asking respondents to complete a detailed health questionnaire, to examine the impact of health status on WTP. This survey was self-administered by computer to 930 persons in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1999. The survey uses audio and visual aids to communicate baseline risks of death and risk changes and are tested for comprehension of probabilities before being asked WTP questions. We credit these efforts at risk communication with the fact that mean WTP of respondents faced with <b>larger</b> <b>risk</b> reductions exceeds <b>mean</b> WTP of respondents faced with smaller risk reductions; that is, our respondents pass the external scope test. Our mean WTP estimates for a contemporaneous risk reduction imply a VSL ranging approximately from $ 1. 2 to $ 3. 8 million (1999 C$), {{depending on the size of}} the risk change valued, which is at or below estimates commonly used in environmental cost-benefit analyses by the Canadian and the U. S. governments. Interestingly, we find that age has no effect on WTP until roughly age 70 and above (the VSL is about $ 0. 6 million for this age group) and that physical health status, with the possible exception of having cancer, has no effect. We also find that being mentally healthy raises WTP substantially. In addition, compared with estimates of WTP for contemporaneous <b>risk</b> reductions, <b>mean</b> WTP estimates for risk reductions of the same magnitude but beginning at age 70 are more than 50 % smaller. ...|$|R

30|$|Results During 3  years, 82 {{patients}} (51 female, {{median age}} 69, 5, ranging from 24 to 89, 48 {{with more than}} 65  years) were admitted due to PE, more frequently from the Emergency Service (86, 6  %).The most common symptoms were dyspnea (61  %), chest pain (50  %) and syncope (24, 4  %) and 54 patients were classified as low probability PE using Wells Criteria. Computed Tomography was positive in 97, 6  % of patients. Using Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) Score, 9 patients had very low <b>risk</b> score (<b>mean</b> age 40, 4 [*]±[*] 7, 1  years), 13 low <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 50 [*]±[*] 16, 9  years), 26 moderate <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 70, 4 [*]±[*] 10, 3  years), 14 high <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 71, 4 [*]±[*] 12, 6  years)and 18 very high <b>risk</b> score (<b>mean</b> age 72, 6 [*]±[*] 14, 2  years). Age was different between PESI Score classes (p[*]<[*] 0, 001). The most common DVT risk factors were age, peripheral venous insufficiency (24, 4  %), obesity (23, 2  %), previous immobilization (17, 1  %). In the ICU, 10 patients were admitted due to massive PE, 23 submassive PE, 11 due to hypoxemia and 23 for other reasons, more frequently due to the need constant monitoring. DVT was confirmed in 17 patients. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 29 patients (13 submassive PE; 13 massive PE), 3 with registered complications (haemoptysis, haematuria and multiple hematomas and skin haemorrhage). Ventilation and vasopressor support were needed in 7, 3  %. One patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit; 1 died in ICU, 2 after discharge of ICU and 2 in the next 6  months.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how passengers on long-distance trains value unexpected delays relative to scheduled travel time and travel cost. For scheduled services with high reliability and long headways, {{the value of}} delays is most commonly assumed to be proportional to the average delay. By exploring how the valuation of train delays depends on delay risk and delay length, using three different stated choice data sets, {{we find that the}} "average delay" approach does not hold: the disutility increases slower than linearly in the delay <b>risk.</b> This <b>means</b> that using the average delay as a performance indicator, a guide for operations planning or for investment appraisal will underestimate the value of small risks of long delays relative to <b>large</b> <b>risks</b> for short delays. It also means that estimated valuations of "average delay" will depend on the delay risk level: valuations will be higher the lower the risk levels in the study are.
