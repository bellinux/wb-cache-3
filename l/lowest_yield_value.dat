'Tempranillo' during two consecutive years in a commercial vineyard with a deep, light-clay soil located in Requena, Valencia, Spain. Partial rootzone drying applied at two amounts (100 % and 50 % of the estimated crop evapotranspiration), was compared to conventional drip irrigation, and also to rainfed vines. Results showed that {{the effects of}} irrigation amount on yield and wine quality were different between years. In 2003 with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> <b>values</b> (around 6. 3  t ha- 1) irrigation did neither affect grape production nor wine quality. However, in the following year, with much higher general yield (17  t ha- 1), the high irrigation dose increased yield by 30 % compared to rainfed vines and it also increased must total soluble solids and wine alcohol content. In both seasons, PRD did not significantly affect physiological parameters, nor growth, yield or fruit and wine quality, when compared to the same amount of water applied by conventional drip irrigation. Overall these results suggest that, under our experimental conditions, it was the irrigation amount rather than the system of application what affected vine performance, indicating the difficulties of successfully employing the PRD type of irrigation with a drip system in heavy and deep soils.

The roots were fixed and their microtome sections were stained using three different methods for each section. The sections were photographed and measurement data of 30 different parameters were obtained using computer-aided methods. All data were grouped in quantitative tables and evaluated. The results of the evaluations showed that xylem diameter, stellar diameter, root diameter and medullary cell wall thickness were the most important parameters in selection. The cultivars characterized {{with a high level of}} change in saline conditions compared to normal conditions were found to be the cultivars with the <b>lowest</b> <b>yield</b> <b>values.</b> The cultivars for which the number of variable parameters increased or decreased (including apoplastic barrier lignification) were found to be of the groups denoted as low-, moderate- and high-yield groups.

Moreover, extreme apoplastic barrier lignifications were found to not to lead to an increase in yield, but to become and disadvantageous case for the plants.

Nineteen different types of corn-weather seasons (May–August) occurred during 1901 – 1997, of which nine types accounted for most of the high corn yields (highest 20 of the 97 values) and eight types produced most <b>low</b> <b>yields</b> (<b>lowest</b> 20 <b>values).</b> An assessment of the years with either high or <b>low</b> <b>yields</b> revealed three findings about the distributions of the corn-weather seasons creating these extremes: 1) some types were uniformly distributed throughout the century; 2) others were unevenly distributed over time, some occurring only in the century’s early decades and others only in the last few decades; and 3) certain types varied greatly regionally. Yield responses to certain seasonal types varied over time. The findings helped establish that changes in farming practices, corn varieties, and agricultural technology all affect how a given type of growing season affects corn yields. Sizable regional differences in yield outcomes from a given set of weather conditions, a result of varying soil and climate differences across Illinois, further revealed how impacts of similar seasonal weather conditions can vary spatially.

Among the natural materials analyzed, the <b>lowest</b> <b>yield</b> stress <b>value</b> occurs in the carbonate sand, and the highest in the silica sand.

The northern portion, in fact, is likely to form the recharge zone with relatively higher topographic elevations ranging from 575 to 700  m MSL (Fig.  1). A gradient of the specific yield, similar to transmissivity, can be discerned showing {{a decrease in the}} specific yield from the north toward south direction (Fig.  12) following more or less the topography of the area. The possible causes of the high value of the specific yield in northern portion and the low value in the southern portion are most likely linked with the geometry of the fractures, i.e., density, length and openings. It is also {{important to note that the}} specific yield exhibits significant spatial variations from one location to another in most hydrogeological settings (Machiwal and Jha 2015). The wide variation in the specific <b>yield</b> <b>values</b> suggests heterogeneity, which is a common feature of the hard-rock subsurface formations (NABARD 2006).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 73 - 75). A total of 62 cohesiveness sands were tested to rographics. investigate the importance of the water content, grain size distribution, grading of the soil, particle shape, grain crushing during testing and laboratory compaction test method on the maximum dry unit weight during compaction. Three different laboratory compaction methods were used: 1) Standard Proctor', 2) Modified Proctor; and 3) Vibrating hammer. The effects of the grain size distribution, particle shape and laboratory compaction method were found to be the most important. The grain size distribution is represented by the coefficient of uniformity, whereas the particle shape is represented by the degree of roundness of the sand grains. The various laboratory compaction methods used in this study indicated the importance of vibration on the compaction of cohesiveness sands. The vibrating hammer compaction test method <b>yielded</b> consistently high <b>values</b> of the maximum dry unit weight over the complete range of tests.

The buckling-restrained braces(BRBs) with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength(LYS) steel {{make good}} use of {{ductility}} and hysteretic energy dissipation of the <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel and are gradually applied in structural vibration. To foster BRBs with <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel in China mainland, the domestic LYS 160 was used in BRB. The cross section was a simple shape. A static cyclic test was carried out, and the finite element analysis was conducted. The results show that the BRB with domestic <b>low</b> <b>yield</b> strength steel has good ductility, hysteretic energy dissipation and resistance to fatigue. A shaped cross section is simple and easy to promote application in China mainland...|$|R

Four buffaloes, two of which showing high cheese yield and two with <b>low</b> cheese <b>yield</b> selected {{from a group of}} 135 subjects were chosen for the proteomic analyses. Six main spots in 2 D gels were recognized as alpha s 1 -, alpha s 2 -, beta- and k-casein, alpha-lactoalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin. The main visible differences in the 2 D gels between buffaloes with high vs. <b>low</b> cheese <b>yield</b> were found in the appearance of the four k-casein spots (spots numbers: 20, 19, 16, 18) which differ in the number of phosphorilation and glycosilation. The area and the intensity of the four spots were calculated by using Melanie II (Bio-Rad) software. Samples with high cheese <b>yield</b> showed higher <b>value</b> of the by-products: area x intensity of spot 16, correspondent to k-casein with one phosphorilation site, and lower values of spots 19 and 20, of k-casein with more than one phosphorilation site and glycosilated...|$|R
40|$|Chocolate {{fluidity}} is {{of great}} importance for the exact moulding since only masses with low viscosity can be pumped and spilled without any problems. The rheological properties of precrystallized chocolate masses were studied. The content of crystallized fat dsitinctly influences the <b>yield</b> <b>value</b> and the viscosity. The measurement of the <b>yield</b> <b>value</b> {{may be used to}} control the temper degree. Two methods for the estimation of the <b>yield</b> <b>value</b> were tested...|$|R
