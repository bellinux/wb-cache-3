50|$|The pottery of the Maya Early Classic dated from AD 250 to 550. The Maya {{soon began}} using polychrome slip paint, meaning they used many {{different}} colors {{to decorate the}} pots. This method of decoration became almost homogeneous for Mayan potters, thus signaling {{the beginning of the}} Classic Period. Polychrome pottery was a luxury item not commonly available to the general population. Most Early Classic Ceramics were monochrome types. Figural Polychromes were an elite prerogative, probably produced by and for other elites. The Classic Period of the Maya provided beautiful ceramics in many forms. The <b>lidded</b> basal <b>flange</b> bowl was a new style of potter to add to the already growing repertoire. This type vessel usually had a knob on top {{in the form of an}} animal or human head, while the painted body of the animal or human spreads across the pot. Many of these pots also had mammiform supports, or legs. These unique vessels are usually found in great condition signaling a ritual function. The reason many are in good condition is their frequent use as burial goods. As such, they are often the target of looters who cut deep trenches through many Maya buildings in search of a marketable vessel.|$|R
40|$|Incense burners are {{ceremonial}} vessels {{considered to}} be part of the archaeological study of artifacts. Through them and their contexts, possible interpretations may be posited associated with the religious practices of the ancient inhabitants. Furthermore, they are valuable because they reflect iconographic issues linked to the symbology and cosmovision of the prehispanic world. In archaeology, incense burners are defined like containers that were used to burn natural aromatic resins, without disregarding the possibility that they may have also been used to deposit other types of offerings. Actually, the majority of the incense burners found by archaeologists were made of mud and stone, but there is also evidence of others manufactured with wood, jade, and even rubber (Rice 1999 : 25). Incense burners vary greatly in terms of shape. The most important part is the receptacle, which may present a variety of forms such as that of a bowl, a dish, a vase, or a flat surface. This basic form may include handles, bases, pedestals, <b>lids,</b> and/or <b>flanges.</b> Also, designs of human figures, animals, or a blend of both aimed at forming effigies and faces can be included (Rice 1999 : 25). This study was mainly focused on the rim-heads incense burners from Escuintla. We had the opportunity to excavate a small site called Quebrada La Culebra located at Nueva Concepción, in the banks of an affluent of the Coyolate known as Cardoza River. There, a substantial sample of fragments and incense burners was gathered. With these data and the available ceramic collections from Escuintla, an analysis of the incense burners was undertaken to find out about their function and meaning in the prehispanic world.

40|$|SUMMARY. -A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} study the invasion of cells into mouse kidney cortex {{in the presence of}} crude rat liver histone at a medium concentration of 100 iLg. /ml. A marked increase in the invasiveness of normal cells occurred in the presence of histone. Possible explanations of this phenomenon are discussed. The invasiveness was compared with that of cells previously transformed with polyoma virus. HiSTONES, those basic proteins associated with the DNA of eukaryotic cells, have been shown to induce morphological transformation of BHK 21 cells in monolayer culture (Latner and Longstaff, 1971). This transformation involved the acqaisition by ti-le histone treated cultures of some characteristics associated With malignancy, such as the appearance of giant multinucleate cells, a breakdown in contact iiihibition and a tendency for the cells to form aggregates and multilayers. A further characteristic of malignant cells is their ability to invade normal tissue in vitro (Yarnell and Ambrose, 1969 a) and we report here the effect of histones on the invasiveness of four cell lines in culture. Histone preparation MATERIALS AND METHODS Chromatin was isolated from the livers of adult rats (Scott-Russ strain) according to the method of Bonner et al. (1968), omitting centrifugation through dense sucrose solution. Histone was extracted from the isolated chromatin by blending with 0 - 25 N HCI. The insoluble material was centrifuged off and the extraction procedure repeated. The supernatants were pooled and histone was precipitated from the acid extract by adding 9 volumes of acetone. The precipitate was washed with acetone, air dried and finally vacuum dried. Tissue culture method 8 The technique adopted to study invasion in vitro involved the use of modified Trowell organ culture flasks. The apparatus (Fig. 1) consisted of an open-necked reaction vessel witb. a ground-glass Range and contained a filter-well. The vessel was fitted with a 9 'lass <b>lid</b> with ground-glass <b>flange</b> and two glass taps. In assembling the unit, a thin layer of high vacuum silicone grease was applied to the ground-glass flange joint which was then secured by means of a bull-dog "...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was done in order to design a pressurized test facility for droplet analysis with a laser measurement technique, Phase Doppler Anemometry. The test facility was a development work within Chemrec's pressurized black liquor gasification (BLG) project. BLG is a complex process where black liquor is atomized and sprayed into a reactor and gasified using pure oxygen. In the process {{it is crucial that}} all organic material is consumed to produce combustible gases using three stages of conversion: drying, pyrolysis and char gasification. In the end of the conversion, only an inorganic smelt is supposed to remain (ideally). For the gasification process, {{it is important to be}} fully aware of the spray characteristics created by the nozzle that yields an ideal conversion. Therefore a pressurized spray test facility with optical access windows for measurements was developed. Parameters that are important and interesting to study are droplet size and their velocity. The purpose of the facility is to gain quantitative information to optimize the black liquor gasification (BLG) process. For measuring droplets, a non-intrusive laser measurements system is used called Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). PDA is the most advantageous technique for measuring droplet velocity and size distribution. The first stage in the work of developing this spray test facility was a brief feasibility study of other pressurized spray testing facilities using PDA, to get information of different concepts. Concepts and configurations of the different parts for the pressurized test facility have been analyzed and investigated with a variety of engineering tools. Because measurements with PDA are very depending on certain receiving angles a deep review of PDA was performed, all to achieve correct placement of the transmitting and receiving optical access windows. The final design resulted in a standing pressure vessel with height 5600 mm and a diameter of 500 mm. The test facility was tested and is approved for a working pressure of 15 bar. To prevent corrosion due to the future application of black liquor atomization, it was made of stainless steel (SS 2343). Four optical access side ports were placed approximately 500 mm from the top of the vessel. The side port for the transmitter probe is located at 0 degrees and the three receiving side ports at 106. 3, 120 and 270 degrees. These angles were chosen to fulfill the requirements and demands essential for PDA. Simulations using CFD have contributed with useful information for the flow behavior inside the vessel and how droplets are affected by it. These simulations gave information about the flow near the optical access side ports and the necessity of optical clearance. The simulations show that recirculated flow carries droplets from the spray that reaches the glass windows, which is not preferable as it may interfere during laser measurements. Initial test runs and experiments confirm the results obtained from the simulations. The outcome of this study became a development of a purging air wall to prevent droplets reaching the glass windows. Fine polished fused quartz glass, especially suitable for laser measurements is used for the glass windows. These glasses are free from inclusions and are distinguished from other glasses by good transmission in UV- and the visible spectral range. A solid mechanic calculation of the glass specimen was performed to determine the thickness of the glass in order to withstand a maximum pressure of 15 bar. An evacuation port was placed in the middle of the vessel to perform evacuation of gas. The evacuation is used for both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. During pressurized runs, a <b>flange</b> <b>lid</b> with a pressure control valve can be attached to this side port to regulate the pressure. Connections for adding a fluid level gauge were placed on the vessel side. On the top of the vessel a unique designed spray lance traversing system were attached on a <b>flange</b> <b>lid.</b> With this arrangement the spray can be rotated and traversed up and down through the top lid. This device enables measurements in a large part of the spray. The test facility has been installed and initial test runs performed. Measuring and optimization of the facility will continue. When optimized, the results of the measurements from this facility will be applied in the BLG project. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The pH {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} {{that determine}} heavy metal mobility and fate in soils and sediments. It is well known that the resistance of soil to a change in pH strongly affects the mobilization of heavy metals in the soil. Different single and sequential extraction tests and pHstat leaching tests (at constant pH) have been developed for the study of the influence of a pH-decrease on the heavy metal release from the soil. Nevertheless, the acid-base reactions in a soil-water mixture are not as fast as those that take place in the aqueous phase. This kinetic control makes that the determination of the buffer capacity of the soil (usually the acid neutralization capacity, ANC) cannot be obtained as straightforward as an acid-base titration. The buffer capacity of a soil is usually determined by the addition of different amounts of acid to several aliquots of a soil-water mixture. The slurries pHs and heavy metal concentration in the aqueous phase are determined after a nominal time at which the equilibrium is assumed to be reached (from 24 to 72 hours). As for the pHstat leaching test, the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) corresponds to the amount of acid added to a soil-water suspension to keep the pH at a predefined constant value, so an ANC is obtained for each reference pH. The main inconvenience of the latter approach is that the acid neutralization can be slow at certain pH values and therefore, the acid addition rate should be adequately modified, leading to longer tests (from 24 to 96 hours) This work aims the study of the influence of the pH on the retention of lead in a soil from the mining district of Linares (Spain) contaminated by heavy metals. The methodology used here is similar to the aforementioned ones, but in this case, the acid addition rate is predefined to a value more than 3 times higher than a threshold value above which the pH versus time curve is independent of the rate of acid addition. The feasibility of the electrokinetic technique for the remediation of this soil is assessed from the results obtained with three different acid solutions (nitric, acetic or EDTA) and the lead fractionation in the soil, according to the BCR method, at the end of each experiment. The experimental system used basically consists of a 2 L reaction vessel with flat flange and mechanical agitator that contains the initial water/soil mixture (1. 2 L/ 0. 4 kg). The reactor is closed with a glass <b>lid</b> with flat <b>flange</b> and 5 ground-glass necks. Two of these necks allow the assembling of a pH electrode and of a sampling system for the withdrawal of aqueous samples. Through a third neck of the reactor lid, the desired reagent solution is added at the predefined rate, while the evolution over time of pH values in the water-soil mixture is registered. At selected times; samples of 10 mL were withdrawn for the determination of Pb concentrations in the aqueous phase. The results indicate that the solubilization of the 40 % of the lead present in the soil is achieved at pH values of about 6. 5, 5 and 2. 5 for Na 2 EDTA, acetic- and nitric- acid respectively. 12 th International Symposium on Electrokinetic Remediation, EREM 2013 by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and the FEDER fund of the EU through the Research Project ERHMES, CTM 2012 - 16824 and the UE project Electroacross IRSES-GA- 2010 269289...|$|R
