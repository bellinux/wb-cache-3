5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} prevailing wind that lasts {{for several months}} within tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and neighboring countries {{to refer to the}} big seasonal winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Asian, African, and North American continents during May through July, and over Australia in December.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ilona caused {{moderate}} damage across the Pilbara region of Western Australia in mid-December1988. The system originated from a monsoon trough that coalesced into a tropical <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Timor Sea on 12December. The system initially moved southwest, {{before moving on}} a more westerly course. Steady intensification occurred and Ilona reached its peak strength on 17December as a low-end severe tropical cyclone. A southward turn directed the cyclone toward Western Australia, and it made landfall near Mardie Station. The system subsequently degraded over land and dissipated on 19December.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the complex {{interaction}} between an upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and {{the tail end}} of a cold front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Julio quickly {{weakened}} over land, {{although it}} initially maintained strong convection near its center. By early on August 26, however, the low-level and upper-level circulations separated, with the upper-circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low-level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, {{after having been}} separated from its deep convection. Later in the day, the NHC discontinued advisories after the storm failed to maintain enough organized convection {{to be considered a}} tropical cyclone.The remnants of Julio were absorbed by a thermal <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Mojave Desert on August 27.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

40|$|Polar lows are intense meso- a -scale {{cyclones}} {{that develop}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> oceans poleward {{of the main}} baroclinic zone. A number of previous studies have reported polar <b>low</b> formation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan within the East Asian winter monsoon. To understand the climatology of polar <b>lows</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan, a tracking al- gorithm for polar lows {{is applied to the}} recent JRA- 55 reanalysis. The polar low tracking is applied to 36 cold seasons (October–March) from October 1979 to March 2015. <b>The</b> polar <b>lows</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan reach their maximum intensity on the southeastern side of the midline between the Japanese islands and the Asian continent. Consistent with previous case studies, composite analysis demonstrates that the polar low devel- opment is associated with the enhanced northerly flow on the western side of a synoptic-scale extratropical cyclone, with the cold trough in the midtroposphere and with increased heat fluxes from the sea surface. Furthermore, the present climatological study has revealed two dominant directions of motion of the polar lows: southward and eastward. Southward-moving polar lows are steered by a strong northerly flow in the lower troposphere, which is enhanced on the western side of synoptic-scale extratropical cyclones, while the eastward-moving polar lows occur within a planetary-scale westerly flow in the midlatitudes. Thus, the di- rection of polar low motion reflects the difference in planetary- and synoptic-scale conditions...|$|R
5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> monastery, and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up attacks that day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E
5|$|At Valencia {{and other}} regions of eastern Spain, the storm {{generated}} heavy precipitation, while six tornadoes touched down over the Balearic Islands. While approaching {{the coast of the}} Balearic Islands, the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar (0.32inHg) at Palma, Majorca in advance of the tropical cyclone's landfall. Medicanes as small as the one that formed in September1996 are atypical, and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation. Warm low-level advection–transfer of heat through air or sea–caused by a large-scale <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western Mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection. The presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off cold-core low, a method of formation typical to medicanes, was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone. In addition, interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough, the medicane, and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall.|$|E
5|$|By August18, the NHC {{noted that}} the {{hurricane}} was asymmetrical, having uneven distribution of the wind radii. Later that day, deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery. Early the next day, the eye became increasingly defined {{as the center of}} Bob passed roughly 35mi (55km) from the North Carolina coastline. By 0600UTC, Hurricane Hunters recorded flight level winds of 140mph (225km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 115mph (185km/h). At this time, the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), the lowest pressure recorded during the storm. After attaining this intensity, the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25mph (35km/h), steered by the trough over the southeast United States, an upper-level cutoff <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Great Lakes Region and the subtropical ridge over the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong southerly shear {{exposing the}} LLCC, Bonnie {{intensified}} slightly {{to reach its}} initial peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h) as it turned towards the north. However, the continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclone's appearance to significantly degrade early on May29, as deep convection dissipated due to more than 46mph (74km/h) of southerly shear. Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength {{about half an hour}} prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. Caught in weak steering currents, the depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before degenerating to a remnant <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> northeastern portion of the state at 12:00UTC on May30.|$|E

Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away {{in the middle of}} the night with a small crew following a disagreement with <b>Low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet.

5|$|Hurricane Juan {{remained}} at peak intensity for over 24hours. After moving northwestward {{for an extended}} period of time, it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its fast forward motion, Juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September29 with winds of 100mph (160km/h). It weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September29. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical <b>low</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|Later on August6, the {{weakening}} trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on {{the weakening}} cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August12.
