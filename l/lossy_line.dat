40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} simulation of lossy, multi-conductor transmission lines that are terminated by nonlinear circuits {{is necessary to}} design high-performance electronic circuits and packages. In this work, theoretical and practical considerations of <b>lossy</b> <b>line</b> simulation are presented. Using delay differential equations, the class of systems with "bidirectional delay" is introduced. These systems can be partitioned such that the resulting subsystems are only linked via delayed variables. It is stated in the "decoupling theorem" that the subsystems can be solved independently for a time interval, which is not longer than the shortest time delay. Circuits that contain transmission lines are shown to form systems with bidirectional delay and, consequently, can be decoupled. Using concepts derived from waveform relaxation, the decoupling is exploited to reduce the computational effort required for transmission line simulation. Moreover, an efficient method for the approximation of <b>lossy</b> <b>line</b> characteristics by rational transfer functions is presented. The method employs nonlinear minimization techniques and yields function coefficients suitable for time-domain modeling. Furthermore, the exponential wave propagation function is represented in the time domain, and discrete-time convolution is employed to calculate the transmission line response. Also described is a filtering method which considerably improves {{the stability of the}} simulation, while the deviation in the simulation results is smaller than the local truncation error. In addition, implementation of the <b>lossy</b> <b>line</b> simulator "UAFLICS" is outlined, and practical applications demonstrate the significance of coupling and loss effects...|$|E

Two refinements {{are made to}} the existing convolution approach for {{the case of a}} sin-gle <b>lossy</b> <b>line</b> analytical formulae are derived for the line’s impulse-responses, and an accurate numerical convolution technique that utilises these formulae are devised. It is shown that a special case of lossy multiconductor lines can be de-composed into uncoupled lossy lines and linear memoryless networks, leading to a simple simulation algorithm. Simu-lation results on industrial circuits with single and mtdticon-ductor lossy lines are presented and compared with results obtained using lumped and pseudo-lumped approximations of lossy lines.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{electromagnetic}} transient analysis technique {{by means of}} the orthogonal projection method for lossy transmission line is proposed.

First of all, the differential function to variable time can be approximated to be the convolution with a fixed vector relates to a certain set of orthogonal basis, e. g., Daubechies ’ basis. The partial differential telegraph equations related to both variable time t and distance x are then transformed to be differential equations only related to x.

40|$|Accurate {{computer}} simulation of high speed digital computer circuits and communication circuits requires a multimode approach to simulate both the devices and the interconnects between devices. Classical circuit analysis algorithms (lumped parameter) {{are needed for}} circuit devices and the network formed by the interconnected devices. The interconnects, however, have to be modeled as transmission lines which incorporate electromagnetic field analysis. An approach to writing a multimode simulator is to take an existing software package which performs either lumped parameter analysis or field analysis and add the missing type of analysis routines to the package. In this work a traditionally lumped parameter simulator, SPICE, is modified {{so that it will}} perform lossy transmission line analysis using a different model approach.
