5000|$|The {{original}} high-threshold model {{held that}} recognition is a probabilistic process. [...] It {{is assumed that}} there is some probability that previously studied items will exceed a memory threshold. If an item exceeds the threshold then it is in a discrete memory state. If an item does not exceed the threshold then it is not remembered, but it may still be endorsed as old {{on the basis of a}} random guess. According to this model, a test item is either recognized (i.e., it falls above a threshold) or it is not (i.e., it falls below a threshold), with no degrees of recognition occurring between these extremes. [...] Only target items can generate an above-threshold recognition response because only they appeared on the list. [...] The lures, along with any targets that are forgotten, fall below threshold, which means that they generate no memory signal whatsoever. For these items, the participant has the option of declaring them to be new (as a conservative participant might do) or guessing that some of them are old (as a more liberal participant might do). [...] False alarms in this model reflect memory-free guesses that are made to some of the lures. This simple and intuitively appealing model yields the once widely used correction for guessing formula, and it predicts a <b>linear</b> <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC). An ROC is simply a plot of the hit rate versus the false alarm rate for different levels of bias. A typical ROC is obtained by asking participants to supply confidence ratings for their recognition memory decisions. [...] Several pairs of hit and false alarm rates can then be computed by accumulating ratings from different points on the confidence scale (beginning with the most confident responses). The high-threshold model of recognition memory predicts that a plot of the hit rate versus the false alarm rate (i.e., the ROC) will be linear it also predicts that the z-ROC will be curvilinear.|$|E

In densely deployed radio networks, User Equipments (UE) will experience high levels of interference which limits the achievable spectral efficiency. In this case, a way to improve the achievable performance is by mitigating interference at the UE side. Advanced <b>linear</b> interference aware <b>receivers</b> are <b>linear</b> <b>receivers</b> able to mitigate external co-channel interference. Optimum linear interference rejection is obtained with the Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) receiver which relies on the ideal knowledge of the interference covariance matrix. The IRC interference covariance matrix is the sum of all interference channel covariance matrices. In practical radio networks, like LTE-Advanced, the knowledge of interference channel covariance matrices might not always be available. However, the IRC interference covariance matrix estimation can be done with a data-based or reference-symbol-based interference covariance matrix estimation algorithm. In this thesis, the modeling and evaluation of advanced <b>linear</b> interference aware <b>receivers</b> for LTE-Advanced downlink are studied. In particular, the data-based and reference-symbol-based covariance matrix estimation algorithms are modeled by using the Wishart distribution.

40|$|Linear {{receivers}} {{are often}} used to reduce the implementation complexity of multiple-antenna systems. In a traditional <b>linear</b> <b>receiver</b> architecture, the receive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit antenna, which can then be decoded individually. Although easy to implement, this approach can be highly suboptimal when the channel matrix is near singular. This paper develops a new <b>linear</b> <b>receiver</b> architecture that uses the receive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer-valued entries. Rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords directly, the decoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries of the effective channel matrix. The codewords are all generated using the same linear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves codewords. Provided that the effective channel is full rank, these integer combinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords. This paper focuses on the special case {{where there is no}} coding across transmit antennas and no channel state information at the transmitter(s), which corresponds either to a multi-user uplink scenario or to single-user V-BLAST encoding. In this setting, the proposed integer-forcing <b>linear</b> <b>receiver</b> significantly outperforms conventional linear architectures such as the zero-forcing and linear MMSE receiver. In the high SNR regime, the proposed receiver attains the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the standard MIMO channel with no coding across transmit antennas.
