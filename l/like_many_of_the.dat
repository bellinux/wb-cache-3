5|$|Cory Edwards {{chose to}} {{approach}} the film predominantly as an action/comedy, instead of as a typical animated film, and wrote the script to appeal to audiences of any age <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> films produced by Pixar or Disney.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Valois, Isabeau was an appreciative art collector. She loved {{jewels and}} was {{responsible}} for the commissions of particularly lavish pieces of ronde-bosse—a newly developed technique of making enamel-covered gold pieces. Documentation suggests she commissioned several fine pieces of tableaux d'or from Parisian goldsmiths.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E

5|$|Formed on 13 November 1939 at Redbank Camp, Brisbane, the 2/9th Battalion was {{the first}} of four {{infantry}} battalions raised in Queensland for the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Initially assigned to the 6th Division, the battalion formed part of the 18th Brigade, along with the 2/10th, 2/11th and 2/12th Battalions. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel James Eric Gifford Martin, formerly of the 42nd Battalion, a Militia battalion based in Rockhampton. The majority of the battalion's officers were drawn from the Militia; although, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd AIF units, it was initially supplied with a Regular officer to serve in the role as adjutant.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun. The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox origin', <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other weapons produced {{for use by the}} Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5000|$|Dee Snider {{has stated}} that he <b>likes</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs on the album, vocally.

In 2012, the band introduced [...] "Wake Up (The Sleeping Giant)" [...] into their set, following demands from fans for material to be included from all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's studio albums.|$|R
5000|$|Palmer {{concluded}} {{that while he}} <b>liked</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachings <b>of</b> Joseph Smith, [...] "the foundational events in church history are too problematic to ignore". He found {{that much of what}} Latter Day Saints take for granted as literal history has, over the years, been modified to emphasize certain aspects over others. This, he believes, has resulted in an inaccurate picture of LDS Church history.|$|R

5|$|On 10 July, the U.S. Army {{ordered the}} {{deactivation}} {{of all of}} its Ranger companies. The Army noted that the Ranger companies were only an exercise directed by The Pentagon which was complete. The 3rd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 in Korea. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Ranger units, most of the Ranger veterans were folded into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, where their airborne skills could be used. Still, Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kellogg's Grove, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{battles and}} skirmishes during the Black Hawk War, {{had no real}} order or strategy. Early sources {{indicated}} that the battle was a complete victory for the state militia, declaring the battle a rout and noting that the Sauk lost 15 while the militia only suffered 5 men killed. Conversely, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the result, essentially, was that the band of approximately 50 Sauk warriors routed the 300 or so ill-disciplined white troops.|$|E
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged {{to make it look}} <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E

5|$|Upon the school's {{relocation}} suggestions were solicited {{for a new}} name, {{and social}} studies teacher Ted Johnson submitted the winning entry. The school was named after photographer, film director and local icon Gordon Parks. Parks grew up in Saint Paul, attending local high schools such as Mechanic Arts High School and Saint Paul Central. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students the school targets, Parks struggled with events outside of school and eventually dropped out.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Su {{continued}} {{his career as}} military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought {{in a wave of}} Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor.|$|E

5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, {{although there was no}} official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of blue and gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers. The fleet {{proved to be an}} embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed them, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Negotiations dragged on into the early 1900s, but Hamidiye {{was not included in the}} program. Instead, Hamidiye was decommissioned in 1903; the Ottoman Navy considered rebuilding the ship that year, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other ironclads, but the ship was in too poor a condition to merit reconstruction. On 11 November 1909, she was placed for sale, and she was finally purchased by ship breakers in 1913 and thereafter dismantled.|$|E
5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E
