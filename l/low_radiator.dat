40|$|As part of {{a larger}} task, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) was tasked to perform a trade study {{comparing}} liquid-metal cooled reactors having Rankine power conversion systems with gas-cooled reactors having Brayton power conversion systems. This report summarizes the approach, the methodology, and the results of that trade study. Findings suggest that either approach has the possibility to approach the target specific mass of 3 - 5 kg/kWe for the power system, though it appears either will require improvements to achieve that. Higher reactor temperatures have the most potential for reducing the specific mass of gas-cooled reactors but do not necessarily have a similar effect for liquid-cooled Rankine systems. Fuels development will be the key to higher reactor operating temperatures. Higher temperature turbines will be important for Brayton systems. Both replacing lithium coolant in the primary circuit with gallium and replacing potassium with sodium in the power loop for liquid systems increase system specific mass. Changing the feed pump turbine to an electric motor in Rankine systems has little effect. Key technologies in reducing specific mass are high reactor and radiator operating temperatures, <b>low</b> <b>radiator</b> areal density, and low turbine/generator system masses. Turbine/generator mass tends to dominate overall power system mass for Rankine systems. Radiator mass was dominant for Brayton systems...|$|E

40|$|The thesis Local {{district}} heating systems {{deals with a}} new concept for {{district heating}}. The district heating system is arranged as one main system {{and a number of}} local systems. The production plants and the main distribution lines belong to the main system. The local systems distribute heat power from the main lines through the local networks to the buildings and via substations further to individual rooms. The main network and the local networks operate with different pressures and if suitable with different temperatures. The design of the local systems from the main lines to the room radiator, is the main topic of the thesis. The new concept is based on a comfortable room temperature in every room. Pleasant room temperatures are reached with a thermostatic valve on each radiator. Good working conditions for the thermostatic valves are created by a controllable jet pump in the substation and a <b>low</b> <b>radiator</b> flow. The jet pump replaces one heat exchanger, the centrifugal pump and the control valve of a conventional substation of today. The jet pump and the pressure separator, which connects the local network to the main network, allow the low return temperatures from the radiator circuits to enter the main network unaffected. The directly connected radiator circuits are made possible by limiting the maximum pressure and temperature to 6 bars and 95 °C respectively. Simulations show that the system is robust and comparatively insensitive to deviations from estimated design data. The thermostatic valves and their interaction with the jet pump will automatically adjust the operation to the new conditions. Measurements at Trollhättan Energi AB confirm this behaviour. Altogether the study shows that the new concept will give lower return temperatures, reduced heat losses and increased comfort (closer to preferred values of room temperature). Costs are illustrated with quantities which can be related to investment costs (design values), and to operational costs (quantities of long duration) ...|$|E

40|$|A severe {{technical}} drawback of {{geothermal heat}} pumps (GHPs) {{is the fact}} that the nominal operating temperature available for domestic space heating is typically in the region of 50 ?C. This is 25 ?C to 40 ?C less than conventional boiler settings used in hydronic central heating applications. As a result, GHPs are not generally ideal for direct replacement of conventional hydronic central heating systems because of the low relative distribution temperatures unless extreme measures are taken to improve the thermal insulation of the buildings. A preferable option for GHPs is underfloor heating. In terms of retrofitting existing buildings neither the re-insulating nor the underfloor heating options are attractive due to the large added cost and disruptive nature of the installation. As such, very high performance <b>low</b> temperature <b>radiators</b> that are pluggable into existing hydronic central heating systems are a major enabling technology for this sustainable energy source.

40|$|Abstract — A control {{oriented}} {{model for}} an HVAC system is derived in this paper. The HVAC system {{consists of a}} room and a hydronic radiator with a temperature regulating valve (TRV) which has a step motor to adjust the valve opening. The heating system and the room are simulated as a unit entity for thermal analysis and controller design. A discrete-element model with interconnected small scaled elements is proposed for the radiator. This models the radiator more precisely {{than that of a}} lumped model in terms of transfer delay and radiator gain. This precise modeling gives us an intuition into a regular unwanted phenomenon which occurs in low demand situations. When flow is very <b>low</b> in <b>radiator</b> and the supply water temperature and the pressure drop across the valve is constant, oscillations in room temperature frequently occur. The model derived in this paper demonstrates that the oscillations are in part due to the large gain of the <b>radiator</b> in <b>low</b> demand conditions compared to the high demand situations. The simulation model of radiator is optimized in terms of approximating the small signal gain of radiator in all operating points accurately. The controller designed for high demand weather conditions is applied to the opposite conditions to illustrate the oscillatory condition more apparently. Suggestions to alleviate this situation are proposed. I...|$|R
40|$|Cerenkov {{technology}} {{is often the}} optimal choice for particle identification in high energy particle collision applications. Typically, the most challenging regime is at high pseudorapidity (forward) where particle identification must perform well at high high laboratory momenta. For the upcoming Electron Ion Collider (EIC), the physics goals require hadron (π, K, p) identification up to ∼ 50 GeV/c. In this region Cerenkov Ring-Imaging is the most viable solution. The speed of light in a radiator medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index. Hence, for PID reaching out to high momenta a small index of refraction is required. Unfortunately, the lowest indices of refraction also result in the lowest light yield (dN_γ/dx∝sin^ 2 (θ_C)) driving up the radiator length and thereby the overall detector cost.

40|$|SINDA/FLUINT {{has been}} found to be a {{versatile}} code for modeling aerospace systems involving single or two-phase fluid flow and all modes of heat transfer. Several applications of SINDA/FLUINT are described in this paper. SINDA/FLUINT is being used extensively to model the single phase water loops and the two-phase ammonia loops of the Space Station Freedom active thermal control system (ATCS). These models range from large integrated system models with multiple submodels to very detailed subsystem models. An integrated Space Station ATCS model has been created with ten submodels representing five water loops, three ammonia loops, a Freon loop and a thermal submodel representing the air loop. The model, which has approximately 800 FLUINT lumps and 300 thermal nodes, is used to determine the interaction between the multiple fluid loops which comprise the Space Station ATCS. Several detailed models of the flow-through radiator subsystem of the Space Station ATCS have been developed. One model, which has approximately 70 FLUINT lumps and 340 thermal nodes, provides a representation of the ATCS <b>low</b> temperature <b>radiator</b> array with two fluid loops connected only by conduction through the radiator face sheet.

Panel radyatörün ısıl reaksiyonu;As {{the individual}} heating becomes a more preferred application within {{the beginning of}} natural gas usage at the heating systems in our country, there also have been increases in radiator using. Radiators of different materials and with different types are being used in individual and central heating. The most important creations in radiator selection is cost, thermal output per unit, life time, appropriateness to heating system and time constant. Time constant, appropriateness to the heating system chosen and thermal output per unit are very important {{in the case of}} saving energy. With this work, the thermal attitudes of heating equipment have been examined and the time constants of transfer functions found for the radiators of different types have been calculated. When hot water enters a panel radiator some mixing will occur between it and water already cooling in radiator's channels. The symptom of perfect mixing would be that the water temperature throughout the radiator. The equation for the thermal response of the panel radiator; CR =mwater cwater + mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In some designs of <b>low</b> water content <b>radiator,</b> the radiator channels consist in fact of a small number of pipes bonded to the convector surface. Very little mixing would be expected to take place in such an arrangement. The equation for the thermal response of the aluminum radiator; Cm: Thermal capacity of metal = mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In the much older column radiator the thermal mass of iron columns may not be correctly modeled by simply aggregating it with the water content as was inferred earlier for the steel panel radiator. In effect this gives two equations describing the radiator dynamics; Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; The risk of instability and system gain had been examined by comparing radiator output at different flow temperatures. The risk of instability therefore occurs at low load condition. The risk can be reduced by separately reducing the flow temperatures in accordance with external load. In addition to this it was given transfer function at fluctuations in water flow rate and fluctuations flow temperature by examining behavior of coils, embedded heating panels. For fluctuations in water flow rate: For fluctuations in water flow temperature: (? = ?c 0 / v) The BSRIA model estimates these time constants on the basis of length of tubes per circuit actively transferring heat, the number of tubes per header, the water velocity in the tube and the air velocity through the heat exchanger. It has been seen that the time constants of aluminum radiators are shorter than the other radiator types. Panel, iron and steel radiators are following aluminum radiators. Radiators, which have shorter time constant, will be adept to any changes in the systems. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
