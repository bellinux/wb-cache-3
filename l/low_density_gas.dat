In the pressure-temperature phase diagram (Fig. 1) the boiling separates {{the gas and}} liquid region and ends in the critical point, where the liquid and gas phases disappear to become a single supercritical phase. This {{can be observed in}} the density-pressure phase diagram for carbon dioxide, as shown in Figure 2. At well below the critical temperature, e.g., 280K, as the pressure increases, the gas compresses and eventually (at just over 40 bar) condenses into a much denser liquid, resulting in the discontinuity in the line (vertical dotted line). The system consists of 2 phases in equilibrium, a dense liquid and a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>gas.</b> As the critical temperature is approached (300K), the density of the gas at equilibrium becomes higher, and that of the liquid lower. [...] At the critical point, (304.1 K and 7.38 MPa (73.8 bar)), there is no difference in density, and the 2 phases become one fluid phase. Thus, above the critical temperature a gas cannot be liquefied by pressure. At slightly above the critical temperature (310K), {{in the vicinity of the}} critical pressure, the line is almost vertical. A small increase in pressure causes a large increase in the density of the supercritical phase. [...] Many other physical properties also show large gradients with pressure near the critical point, e.g. viscosity, the relative permittivity and the solvent strength, which are all closely related to the density. At higher temperatures, the fluid starts to behave like a gas, as can be seen in Figure 2. For carbon dioxide at 400 K, the density increases almost linearly with pressure.|$|E

The diffuse continuum emission from the <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>gas</b> is also included as an important secondary source of ionization. We show that this multi-component gas model can successfully reproduce the observed line fluxes and line ratios in the ENLR of Mkn 79 assuming a central source luminosity of 6. 6 × 10 52 photons s − 1, consistent with the dereddened nuclear luminosity.

As the pulse duration is increased, we observe that sub-cycle ionization is masked by collisional processes.

50|$|The HiPEP {{thruster}} {{differs from}} earlier ion thrusters because the xenon ions are produced {{using a combination}} of microwave and magnetic fields. The ionization is achieved through a process called Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR). In ECR, the small number of free electrons present in the neutral gas gyrate around the static magnetic field lines. The injected microwaves' frequency is set to match this gyrofrequency and a resonance is established. Energy is transferred from the right-hand polarized portion of the microwave to the electrons. This energy is then transferred to the bulk gas/plasma via the rare - yet important - collisions between electrons and neutrals. During these collisions, electrons can be knocked free from the neutrals, forming ion-electron pairs. The process is a highly efficient means of creating a plasma in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>gases.</b> Previously the electrons required were provided by a hollow cathode.|$|R
