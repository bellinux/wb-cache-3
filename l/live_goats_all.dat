25|$|Classified as a meat goat {{as opposed}} to a dairy goat, it can be raised for chevon (goat meat). This breed is listed as {{threatened}} by The Livestock Conservancy, so the fainting goat is not used as often for chevon as other meat goat breeds; its rarity makes the <b>live</b> <b>goat</b> more valuable. The fainting goat is specialized for smaller production operations as they are unable to challenge fences as vigorously as larger meat goat breeds. This {{is due in part to}} their smaller size and also because of the myotonia. Their size makes them easier to care for during chores such as foot trimming and administering medication. Smaller specimens of fainting goats are frequently kept as pets.|$|R
