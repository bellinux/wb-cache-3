40|$|As {{it is well}} known, {{classical}} {{special relativity}} allows the existence of three different kinds of particles: bradyons, <b>luxons</b> and tachyons. Bradyons have non-zero mass and hence always travel slower than light. <b>Luxons</b> are particles with zero mass, like the photon, and they always travel with invariant velocity. Tachyons are hypothetical superluminal particles that always move faster than light. The existence of bradyons and <b>luxons</b> is firmly established, while the tachyons were never reliably observed. In quantum field theory, the appearance of tachyonic degrees of freedom indicates vacuum instability rather than a real existence of the faster-than-light particles. However, recent controversial claims of the OPERA experiment about superluminal neutrinos triggered {{a renewed interest in}} superluminal particles. Driven by a striking analogy of the old Frenkel-Kontorova model of a dislocation dynamics to the theory of relativity, we conjecture in this note a remarkable possibility of existence of the forth type of particles, elvisebrions, which can be superluminal. The characteristic feature of elvisebrions, distinguishing them from tachyons, is that they are outside the realm of special relativity and their energy remains finite (or may even turn to zero) when the elvisebrion velocity approaches the light velocity...|$|R
5000|$|The term {{comes from}} the ταχύ, tachy, meaning [...] "rapid". The {{complementary}} particle types are called <b>luxons</b> (which always move {{at the speed of}} light) and bradyons (which always move slower than light); both of these particle types are known to exist.|$|R
40|$|The phrase "negative squared rest mass" can {{sometimes}} be found in papers on neutrinos and frequently occurs in the tachyonic literature. Consequently, some authors say that "the rest mass of tachyons is imaginary". Besides, the statement "photons have zero rest mass" is almost common. In terms of relativity, however, the state of rest cannot be reasonably defined for <b>luxons</b> and tachyons, and, therefore, today {{it does not make}} sense to speak of rest mass of such objects. It is shown here that the phrases "negative squared mass", "imaginary mass", and "photon's zero mass" result from applying bradyonic dynamical relativistic relations to determine properties of <b>luxons</b> and tachyons; and that this erroneous procedure results from an unfortunate interpretation of kinematical relativistic relations. It is also shown that the use of proper relativistic relations, i. e. luxonic or tachyonic ones, gives a positive quantity having the squared mass dimension. Thus we obtain a nonzero real quantity having the mass dimension (called masslike quantity), which is positive for the photon and may (by intuition - should) be positive for other <b>luxons</b> and for tachyons.

40|$|This study reconsiders {{the decay}} of an {{ordinary}} particle in bradyons, tachyons and <b>luxons</b> {{in the field of}} the relativistic quantum mechanics. Lemke already investigated this from the perspective of covariant kinematics. Since the decay involves both spacelike and timelike particles, the study uses the Majorana equation for particles with an arbitrary spin. The equation describes the tachyonic and bradyonic realms of massive particles, and approaches the problem of how spacelike particles might develop. This method confirms the kinematic constraints that Lemke theory provided and proves that some possible decays are more favourable than others are. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{constitutes}} a fundamental rederivation of special relativity {{based on the}} c-invariance postulate but independent of the assumption ds′ 2 =±ds 2 (Einstein [1], Kittel et al [2], Recami [3]), the equivalence principle, homogeneity of space-time, isotropy of space, group properties and linearity of space-time transformations or the coincidence {{of the origins of}} inertial space-time frames. The mathematical formalism is simpler than Einstein's [4] and Recami's [3]. Whilst Einstein's subluminal and Recami's superluminal theories are rederived in this paper by further assuming the equivalence principle and mathematical inverses [4, 3], this paper derives (independent of these assumptions) with physico-mathematical motivation an alternate singularity-free special-relativistic theory which replaces Einstein's factor [1 /(1 −V 2 /c 2) ] 12 and Recami's extended-relativistic factor [1 /(V 2 /c 2 − 1) ] 12 by [(1 −(V 2 /c 2) n) /(1 −V 2 /c 2) ] 12, where n equals the value of (m(V) /m 0) 2 as |V|→c. In this theory both Newton's and Einstein's subluminal theories are experimentally valid on account of negligible terms. This theory implies that non-zero rest mass <b>luxons</b> will not be detected as ordinary non-zero rest mass bradyons because of spatial collapse, and non-zero rest mass tachyons are undetectable because they exist in another cosmos, resulting in a supercosmos of matter, with the possibility of infinitely many such supercosmoses, all moving forward in time. Furthermore this theory is not based on any assumption giving rise to the twin paradox controversy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this theory for general relativity...|$|R
