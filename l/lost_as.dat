5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of other life forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass and energy are <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.|$|E

5|$|A visibly {{pregnant}} McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and {{claiming to have}} abdominal pains. When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her brassiere and poured it into his bottle of water. This substance caused him to become groggy during his match against Shane later in the night, which he <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> a result. McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006 and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.|$|E

5|$|According to one source, JG 4′s {{losses were}} 25 fighters of the 55 that took part. With 17 pilots killed or missing and seven captured, JG 4 {{suffered}} a 42% loss rate. A more recent source claims {{a total of}} 75 aircraft of JG 4 took part, with only 12 attacking ground targets. Two Ju 88 pathfinders were <b>lost,</b> <b>as</b> well as 26 fighters with six more damaged.|$|E
5|$|All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, {{the only}} {{case of the}} five {{originating}} from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School. The Gebhart case {{was the only one}} where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not <b>lost,</b> <b>as</b> the oscillations die out.|$|E

5|$|An armed {{reconnaissance}} by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the low cloud base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters, however, and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation was odd considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E

In 2003, Hong Kong was gravely {{affected by the}} outbreak of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS). The World Health Organization reported 1,755 infected and 299 deaths in Hong Kong. Economic activities slowed down and schools were closed for weeks at the height of SARS epidemic. An estimated 380 million Hong Kong dollars (US$48.9 million) in contracts were <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> a result of the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon <b>lost</b> <b>as</b> the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E

5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be <b>lost,</b> <b>as</b> well. In Río Bravo, 50families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, San Fernando, San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, Méndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing potable water and electricity.|$|E
