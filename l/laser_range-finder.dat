The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, <b>laser</b> <b>range-finder</b> and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization. Our approachuses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize {{themselves in the}} same environment, probabilistic methods areemployed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiplerobot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and <b>laser</b> <b>range-finders</b> for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robotsand in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization.

After using only anonymous sensors until id estimates are certain enough, id assignments are sampled as well resulting in a fully Rao-Blackwellised particle filter over both object tracks and id assignments.

The wavelength used for lidar sensors in the near infrared presents no real problems because the object to be sensed is fog appearing white which means that scattering from fog is wavelength independent. There are however differences in backscatter-to-extinction ratio for different fog and weather situations. The two solutions to these problems are polarization and multiple scattering.
