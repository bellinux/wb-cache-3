40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 The lack of {{research}} on the common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) in Interior Alaska prompted this study. My objectives were to estimate duckling survival relative to several explanatory variables and to characterize incubation behaviors in a subset of females nesting in the Chena River State Recreation Area. My estimates of duckling survival were higher than previously reported for this species: 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 49 to 0. 82) and 0. 68 (95 % CI 0. 58 to 0. 79) for 2002 and 2003 respectively. Seasonally, duckling survival increased linearly throughout 2002, remained nearly constant in 2003, and was negatively related to daily precipitation in both years. Nest attendance patterns and incubation behaviors were not related to weather, female experience, clutch size, or day of incubation. Average number <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> per day (2. 9 ± 0. 05), <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> (100. 7 ± 1. 5 min), and incubation constancy (79. 8 ± 0. 3 %) were similar to values previously reported for this species (mean ± SE). I observed nocturnal recesses in this population. Although not previously reported for this species, these recesses may occur due to extended daylight hours during the incubation period...|$|R

A total of seven nests was observed. We measured the following factors for daylight hours: percentage of time the female was on the nest (attendance), <b>length</b> <b>of</b> attendance bouts by the female, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> nest <b>recesses,</b> and adult provisioning rates. Comparisons were made between three stages of the 40 -day nesting cycle: incubation (day I-day 16), early nestling stage (day 17 -day 30 [i. e., nestlings 14 days old]). Of seven nests observed, four fledged at least one nestling and three failed. One of these failed nests was filmed being depredated by a feral cat (Felis catus). Female nest attendance was near 82 % during the incubation stage and decreased to 21 % as nestlings aged. We did not detect a difference in attendance bout <b>length</b> between stages <b>of</b> the nesting cycle. Mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> nest <b>recesses</b> increased from 4. 5 min during the incubation stage to over 45 min during the late nestling stage. Mean number <b>of</b> nest <b>recesses</b> per hour ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 0. Food was delivered to nestlings by adults an average of 1. 8 times per hour for the early nestling stage and 1. 5 times per hour during the late nestling stage and did not change over time. Characterization of parental behavior by video had similarities to but also key differences from findings taken from blind observations. Results from this study will facilitate greater understanding of Palila reproductive strategies...|$|R

The Monte Carlo model includes some important effects that are indis-pensable when trying to reproduce the real behaviour of the devices, such as degeneracy, presence of surface charges, T-shape of the gate, presence of dielectrics and contact resistances. Among the large quantity of design parameters that enter into the fabrication of the devices, we have studied the influence on their per-formance of two factors: the doping level of the δ -doped layer and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recess.</b> We will show that the first one has a very important effect on the cutoff frequency and other important figures of merit of the transistor, and its value has to be carefully chosen.

50|$|The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recess</b> {{preceding}} a {{lame duck}} session has also varied. On the 12 occasions since 1935 when Congress recessed for the election, the recess typically lasted between one month and two.

The only election recess shorter than 30 days occurred in 2000, when the 106th Congress recessed for only nine days around the election. The longest election recess occurred in 1948 (80th Congress), when 145 days elapsed {{between the end of}} the special session called by President Truman and the largely pro forma reconvening and adjournment on December 31.

While the Solicitor General argued that the Senate was not actually in session despite these sessions, the Court found that pro forma sessions count as sessions, not recesses, consistent with the Constitution's delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how it conducts its own business. However, the deference is not absolute: if the Senate is without the capacity to act (if all senators effectively gave up the business of legislating), it remains in recess even if it says it is not.|$|R

40|$|For many {{bird species}} in captivity best {{practice}} for incubation procedures {{have yet to}} be developed. This is hampered by a lack of cooperation between bird breeders or by a reluctance to experiment on valuable eggs. The last two problems may be solved by observation of natural incubation, which technology has made a lot easier. Many studies document incubation behavior: daily time spend in the nest, preferred hours of making absences, egg turning rate, incubation temperature. Such data is scientifically interesting but also allows for better protection of endangered species through development of captive breeding programmes. The Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is a threatened species over much of its European range and various conservation actions are being taken to save populations from global or local extinction. Our study took place in Capercaillie Breeding Centre in Wisła Forestry District and describes nesting and incubation behaviour of Capercaillie females kept in captivity. Our aim was to better document the nesting behaviour by recording egg turning rate, and the time and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> incubation <b>recesses.</b> Time <b>of</b> day and day of incubation had no significant influence on <b>recess</b> <b>length,</b> but number <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> was related with time of day with two peaks at 06 : 00 h and 18 : 00 h. Egg turning activity was the greatest during the first and last two days of incubation but generally consistent throughout the rest of incubation. Captive hens spent less time outside of the nest than wild ones, their absences were shorter, rarer and took place mostly at the evening. However, differences in preferred absence hours were not as clearly marked as in case of wild birds. It is hoped that this information will help improve management practises to maximise the reproductive output of captive Capercaillie...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of {{incubation}} and nesting {{behavior for}} {{many species of}} birds, especially those with cryptic nests, {{have been difficult to}} obtain due to logistical and technological limitations. As a result, {{little is known about the}} daily attendance rhythms and behavioral patterns of many species, including the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), despite this species being one of the most studied birds in the world. Incubation represents parental investment in offspring, and a multitude of factors may affect investment behaviors, including reproductive ecology, sex and age of parent, habitat quality, clutch age, and timing in the nesting season. Most Northern Bobwhite nests are incubated by a single adult, most often by females, but also by some males. We assessed the nest attendance patterns and parental investment in bob-white clutches (n 118) using continuous near-infrared video of nests being incubated by male or female bobwhites. We found that incubating parents took 0 – 3 recesses per day. A single recess was most common for 87 % of nest-days, and most of these were during mid-day to late afternoon (12 : 00 19 : 00). Mean total daily recess time was 182 min (95 % CI: 98 – 264) for nests that hatched and 224 min (95 % CI: 140 – 308) for nests that failed. We observed no difference between sexes in the number or <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>recesses</b> taken, but females initiated recess later in the day (median start time 15 : 00) than males (median start time 14 : 00). We found that nest recess length decreased as the clutch got older and increased as the nesting season progressed. Video surveillance systems proved to be a use-ful tool for observing and quantifying patterns of incubation behavior in a ground-nesting species with cryptic nests...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the performance <b>of</b> <b>recessed</b> single-lap joints with dissimilar adherends through the finite element method. The influence of material and geometric nonlinearity of the adhesive as well as the impact <b>of</b> the <b>recess</b> <b>length</b> was examined in terms of maximum principal stresses. The strength of the joint was obtained as the load to initiate the crack propagation. Results suggested that either adding a spew fillet or considering the adhesive plasticity led to reduced peak stresses {{at the edge of the}} adhesive layer. The presence of a spew fillet in the single-lap joint with a <b>recess</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 50 % <b>of</b> the overlap <b>length</b> reduced the peak stress concentrations in the adhesive layer by 45. 2 % and subsequently improved the strength of the joint by 36. 3 %. Mitigation of stress concentration was observed in cases of an adhesive layer with a smaller <b>recess</b> <b>length.</b> The strength <b>of</b> <b>recessed</b> joints with a gap less than 50 % <b>of</b> the overlap <b>length</b> decreased slightly. For the recess length as 70 % and 90 % of the total overlap <b>length,</b> the strength <b>of</b> the joints reduced 36. 4 % and 66. 3 %, respectively. This study suggested a <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> less than 50 % <b>of</b> the overlap <b>length</b> may be beneficial for the performance of the joints...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cisternal {{segments}} of the lower cranial nerves (CNs) adjacent to the jugular foramen (JF) are difficult to identify reliably by routine MR imaging. We performed a 3 D balanced fast-field echo imaging technique (3 D-bFFE) to obtain detailed anatomy of the cisternal {{segments of}} CNs IX, X, and XI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3 D-bFFE was used to image the cisternal {{segments of the}} lower CNs in 20 healthy volunteers. As an anatomic landmark, CSF recesses adjacent to the JF were divided into 3 parts: the recess for the cochlear aqueduct, the recess for CN IX, and the recess for the CN X/XI complex. MR images were evaluated to identify the cisternal segment of each cranial nerve in relation to these anatomic landmarks. RESULTS: The mean angles <b>of</b> the <b>recess</b> for the cochlear aqueduct for CN IX and CN X/XI to the posterior petrous bone were 41. 6 2. 5 °, 69. 7 3. 1 °, and 76. 0 3. 4 °, respectively (P. 01). The mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recess</b> for the cochlear aqueduct for CN IX and the CN X/XI complex was 5. 91 0. 19, 5. 08 0. 11, and 4. 76 0. 13 cm, respectively (P. 01). 3 D-bFFE adequately depicted the cisternal segments of CN IX on 38 sides (95 %) and the CN X/XI complex on 39 sides (97. 5 %).

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of metallic microstructures by electroforming is {{an important}} step within the LIGA process. In the electroforming step, small gaps as well as large structures on one substrate have to be filled with metal up to the same height. These gaps, electrochemically characterized as recessed microelectrodes, may have structural heights of up to several hundred micrometers and lateral dimensions down to only a few micrometers. Microstructured LIGA substrates consist <b>of</b> arrays <b>of</b> <b>recessed</b> microelectrodes with different lateral dimensions. Mass transport is of critical importance during electroforming of microstructured substrates, since different concentration profiles result in gaps of different lateral sizes. Consequently, the convective diffusion during the electroforming <b>of</b> <b>recessed</b> microelectrodes influences metal distribution and deposit properties. Therefore it is necessary to determine the influence of convective diffusion on electroforming <b>of</b> <b>recessed</b> microelectrodes, especially LIGA microstructures. Investigations were performed by electrochemical means with newly developed microelectrodes. The convective diffusive mass transport situation during the electroforming <b>of</b> <b>recessed</b> microelectrodes could be described satisfactorily.
