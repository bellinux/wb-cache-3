40|$|In the Confucian {{model of}} the Chinese family, the {{property}} of family was tie up {{with the concept of}} the part <b>lineal</b> <b>line</b> from father to son to grandson. But fatally, there were in twenty to thirty percent of couples the wife reached the end of her child-bearing years without there being a living natal male heir. How a Hujue (戶絕) family, the parents had no sons or their sons died before having sons, selected the heir at law and property rights of women at such situation is the main concern of the article. In recent years, the scholars made researches into the inheritance of property of daughters. This article discussed the topic as well. 中國是重視家庭倫理的民族，對於絕後的問題一向特別重視。本篇文章以宋代戶絕之家立繼嗣的討為經，兼談婦女?產權問題為緯。戶絕之家因無子可以繼承香火與產，須由家長或族長來決定繼嗣的人選，而繼嗣子也有管理材產、祭祀、撫養家中老幼者的義務。至於女兒是否有繼承權？本文也針對近來學者的相關論著作了綜合性的探討...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare three {{different}} compositions of Yttria-Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystal (Y-TZP) ceramic and a lithium disilicate ceramic {{in terms of}} flexural strength and translucency. Methods: Three zirconia materials of different composition and translucency, Aadva ST [ST], Aadva EI [EI] and Aadva NT [NT](GC Tech, Leuven, Belgium) were cut with a slow speed diamond saw into beams and tabs in order to obtain, after sintering, dimensions of 1. 2 × 4. 0 × 15. 0 mm and 15. 0 × 15. 0 × 1. 0 mm respectively. Blocks of IPS e. max CAD LT were cut and crystallized in the same shapes and dimensions and used as a reference group [LD]. Beams (n = 15) were tested in a universal testing machine for three-point bending strength. Critical fracture load was recorded in N, flexural strength (σ in MPa), Weibull modulus (m) and Weibull characteristic strength (σ 0 in MPa) were then calculated. Tabs (n = 10) were measured with a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Contrast Ratios were calculated as CR = Yb/Yw. SEM of thermally etched samples coupled with <b>lineal</b> <b>line</b> analysis (n = 6) {{was used to measure}} the tested zirconia grain size. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: Differences in translucency, flexural strength and grain size were found to be statistically significant. CR increased and flexural strength decreased in the following order ST(σ 1215 ± 190 MPa, CR 0. 74 ± 0. 01) > EI(σ 983 ± 182 MPa, CR 0. 69 ± 0. 01) > NT(σ 539 ± 66 MPa, CR 0. 65 ± 0. 01) > LD (σ 377 ± 39 Mpa, CR 0. 56 ± 0. 02). The average grain size was different for the three zirconia samples with NT(558 ± 38 nm) > ST(445 ± 34 nm) > EI(284 ± 11 nm). Conclusions: The zirconia composition heavily influenced both the flexural strength and the translucency. Different percentages of Yittria and Alumina result in new materials with intermediate properties in between the conventional zirconia and lithium disilicate. Clinical indications for Zirconia Aadva NT should be limited up to three-unit span bridges...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} hereditary {{position of}} descendants, a surviving spouse and cohabitation partner, as heirs {{of the first}} class in intestate succession, in the law of Serbia and other modern laws of Europe. Through comparative legal analysis we point out both the similarities and differences, {{as well as the}} tendencies, that can be discerned in laws of Europe, regarding {{the manner in which the}} relationship between kinship, in the <b>lineal</b> descending <b>line</b> on one side and marriage, that is concubinage, on the other side, as legally relevant facts in creating the rules of intestacy, is established. In this way we aim to answer the question, to what extent is the relationship between the kinship in the <b>lineal</b> descending <b>line</b> and marriage in the law of Serbia synchronized with legal standards present in legal systems of the most European countries; and whether there is possibly a need for certain inheritance law reforms in the law of Serbia. Besides that, taking into account the fact that Serbian law belongs to the circle of legislations which give no merit to the fact of cohabitation when it comes to intestacy, this paper considers the justification of the need to legally regulate the inheritance of cohabitation partners in our law...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a machine learning method, called Regression by Selecthtg Best P~’ttllll’es (RSBF). RSBF {{consists of two}} phases: The first phase aims to find the predictive power of each feature by constructing simple linear regression lines, one per each continuous feature and number of categories pen each categorical feature. Although the predictive power of a continuous feature is constant, it varies for each distinct value of categorical features. The second phase constructs multiple linear regression lines among continuous features, each time excluding the worst feature among the current set, and constructs multiple linear regression lines. Finally, these muhiple linear regression lines and the categorical features" simple linear regression lines are sorted according to their predictive power. In the querying phase of learning, the best <b>lineal</b> " regression <b>line</b> and the features constructing that line are selected to make predictions...|$|R
