5|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 29 December, the naked body {{of a young woman}} was found dumped at a <b>lay-by</b> on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a {{motorist}} who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper. Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a <b>lay-by.</b> Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lay-bys</b> (rest stops) are {{permitted}} on HQDCs and the N6/M6 Kinnegad - Kilbeggan scheme originally featured <b>lay-bys,</b> {{which would not}} be legal at present on roads with full motorway status, prior to its redesignation as a motorway. The M9 Carlow bypass was built with <b>lay-bys</b> as it was originally to be built as an HQDC section of the N9 route. The <b>lay-bys</b> were removed after the road was reclassified as a motorway. <b>Lay-bys</b> on other HQDCs which were reclassified as motorways were restricted to authorised vehicles only {{and are likely to}} be used mainly by Garda Síochána (police) patrol vehicles.|$|R

5|$|A {{memorial}} garden {{dedicated to}} Figard was planted at St Andrew's Church {{in the village}} of Ombersley, Worcestershire, close to where her body was found, and opened at a ceremony in June 1997. Local residents raised more than £1,000 to help with its construction. The garden also remembers other victims of violent crime, including Joanna Parrish and Caroline Dickinson, two English students who were murdered in France. On 29 December 2000, the fifth anniversary of the date Figard's body was recovered, the local newspaper, the Worcester News reported that an annual service of remembrance was held for her at the church during the autumn, attended by her parents. Flowers were also regularly placed at the <b>lay-by</b> at Hawford where she was found, and the location named Le Jardin de Céline (Celine's Garden) in her memory.|$|E
5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a <b>lay-by</b> on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a <b>lay-by</b> berth was provided on its north side.|$|E

25|$|Retailers {{must also}} plan for {{customer}} preferred payment modes– e.g., cash, credit, <b>lay-by,</b> Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require {{some type of}} handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms {{will need to be}} determined. If <b>lay-by</b> is offered, then the retailer will need {{to take into account the}} storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin. For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lay-bys</b> do {{not appear}} on {{motorways}} in the UK, where until recently only full MSAs were permitted. On other roads, they are marked by a rectangular blue sign bearing a white letter P, and there should also be advance warning of <b>lay-bys</b> to give drivers time to slow down safely. In practice, many local authorities neglect to maintain these signs to an adequate degree, and sometimes they are missing entirely.|$|R
40|$|Accidents {{which have}} {{occurred}} in tunnels have brought to light the danger that the perpendicular end-wall of <b>lay-bys</b> can present to road users in tunnels. Various European representatives of the PIARC Road Tunnel Operations Committee engaged in discussions {{on the topic of}} <b>lay-bys</b> and lateral obstacles in tunnels. A workshop was organized on this issue in 2013. This document is a follow-up to the discussions of the workshop. Chapters 1 to 7 present the individual position of each participating country in the form of: a brief overview of the number and layout of <b>lay-bys,</b> feedback on accidents involving <b>lay-bys</b> or other lateral obstacles, reference to any studies conducted on this issue and other relevant information. Only Chapter 8 (Conclusions) reflects a PIARC consensus on this complex topic. The document also summarizes the main discussions during the European Commission’s Tunnel Safety Committee in October 2014 and the main lessons learnt by the countries involved in this initiative. In addition, it refers to PIARC’s recommendation {{to take into account the}} “Road safety” Directive 2008 / 96 /EC in the context of road tunnels...|$|R

25|$|Jackson {{was also}} alleged by Kevin Dowling, Joe Tiernan, and the Pat Finucane Centre to {{have led the}} UVF gang that carried out the Miami Showband {{massacre}} at Buskhill, outside Newry on 31 July 1975, which left band members Brian McCoy, Fran O'Toole and Tony Geraghty dead. Two others, Stephen Travers and Des McAlea, were wounded. Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, both suspects in the Dublin bombings, and members of both the UDR and Mid-Ulster UVF, were accidentally blown up after they had loaded a bomb {{into the back of}} the band's minibus which had been parked in a <b>lay-by.</b> The minibus, driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy (a Protestant from Caledon, County Tyrone), had been flagged-down by UVF men wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus roadside military checkpoint on the main A1 road as the band was returning home to Dublin after a performance in Banbridge. Following the premature detonation, which ripped the vehicle in half, the band members were then gunned down by the surviving UVF men.|$|E

She {{accepted}} a lift from a lorry driver at the Chieveley services on the M4 in Chieveley, Berkshire, on 19 December, but never arrived at her destination. Following an appeal for information on her whereabouts and police enquiries, her body was discovered on 29 December, at a <b>lay-by</b> on the A449 in Hawford, Worcestershire. A post-mortem examination determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Crozier recounted that on {{the night}} of the killings, he had driven to the grounds of a school in Lurgan where he had picked up two men. He then drove to a <b>lay-by</b> on the Newry-Banbridge dual {{carriageway}} and met up with another five men, who were all wearing British Army uniforms. They subsequently set up a roadblock with [...] "all the trappings of a regular military checkpoint". Crozier told police, and later a court, that he had not played a large part in the attack. He refused to name his accomplices, as he felt that to do so would put the lives of his family in danger.|$|E

Can you step out of the van {{for a few minutes and}} we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E

He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a <b>lay-by</b> where he made her a cup of tea and asked her for what he described as a [...] "Christmas kiss". He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was [...] "smiling and happy". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck, and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.|$|E
