5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E

Since these different <b>load</b> <b>paths</b> arise due to some changes in conditions, they are {{also referred to as}} “alternate paths”. The damage tolerance of a structure is a function of its ability to develop alternate <b>load</b> <b>paths</b> that effectively transfer loads to support points.

40|$|Abstract. Tube {{hydroforming}} {{process is}} a well-established manufacturing process widely employed to form tubular parts that are lighter and stronger compared to those from stampings. Nevertheless, determination of process loading paths, i. e. axial feed distance versus hydraulic pressure, still typically relies on trial-and-error FEM approach. In this paper, a semi-forward adaptive simulation concept is proposed as an effective FEM approach, able to select a feasible THF <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> within a single FEM simulation run. The semi-forward adaptive simulation technique {{is based on the}} ability to “adapt ” or adjust the <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> as to keep the forming strains within a preferred stain trajectory {{over the course of a}} simulation run. Forming strains at the current simulation time step are used as inputs to the fuzzy logic control; the output sets are then used to readjust the <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> for the current and next time steps. This semi-forward adaptive simulation scheme allows one to “correct ” the <b>loading</b> <b>path</b> at the current time step as well as to better predict the forming strains in the next time step.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of compatibility in frontal impacts has to address the importance of different vehicle structures. A critical component in the assessment is to identify, quantitatively, what constitutes good performing structures. In particular, the concepts of structural alignment and structural interaction need to be investigated. Structural alignment is incorporated in the FIMCAR candidate compatibility assessments to achieve geometric alignment of identifiable crashworthiness structures. Structural interaction is also a global {{assessment of}} how structures interact with a collision partner during the crash. The performance of lower vehicle structures in a crash {{has been identified as}} important as they may not be evaluated in a structural alignment assessment, but can contribute to structural interaction and thereby improve collision outcome. There has been, however, no clear definition of the characteristics for lower <b>load</b> <b>paths</b> that improve vehicle safety and how these structures manifest themselves in proposed test procedures. FIMCAR has developed a vehicle crash test program that investigates the performance of vehicle structures using three different test series. The first test series used Super mini vehicles with different front end architectures. These tests with, and without, geometric alignment allowed the effectiveness of a lower <b>load</b> <b>path</b> to be compared to a case without a lower <b>load</b> <b>path.</b> A second set of tests investigated the importance of lower <b>load</b> <b>paths</b> for SUV type vehicles where the main front structures may not align with the main structures in a collision partner, but a lower <b>load</b> <b>path</b> may offset the consequences of this initial misalignment.
