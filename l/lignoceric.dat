40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that in}} childhood adrenoleukodystrophy (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system for very long chain (greater than C 22) fatty acids is defective. To further define the defect in these two forms of X chromosome-linked ALD, we examined the oxidation of [1 - 14 C]lignoceric acid (n-tetracosanoic acid, C 24 : 0) and [1 - 14 C]lignoceroyl-CoA (substrates {{for the first and}} second steps of beta-oxidation, respectively). The oxidation rates of <b>lignoceric</b> acid in C-ALD and AMN were 43 % and 36 % of control values, respectively, whereas the oxidation rate of lignoceroyl-CoA was 109 % (C-ALD) and 106 % (AMN) of control values, respectively. On the other hand, the oxidation rates of palmitic acid (n-hexadecanoic acid) and palmitoyl-CoA in C-ALD and AMN were similar to the control values. These results suggest that lignoceroyl-CoA ligase activity may be impaired in C-ALD and AMN. To identify the specific enzymatic deficiency and its subcellular localization in C-ALD and AMN, we established a modified procedure for the subcellular fractionation of cultured skin fibroblasts. Determination of acyl-CoA ligase activities provided direct evidence that lignoceroyl-CoA ligase is deficient in peroxisomes while it is normal in mitochondrial and microsomes. Moreover, the normal oxidation of lignoceroyl-CoA as compared with the deficient oxidation of <b>lignoceric</b> acid in isolated peroxisomes also supports the conclusion that peroxisomal lignoceroyl-CoA ligase is impaired in both C-ALD and AMN. Palmitoyl-Coa ligase activity was found to be normal in peroxisomes as well as in mitochondria and microsomes. This normal peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA ligase activity as compared with the deficient activity of lignoceroyl-CoA ligase in C-ALD and AMN suggests the presence of two separate acyl-CoA ligases for palmitic and <b>lignoceric</b> acids in peroxisomes. These data clearly demonstrate that the pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in C-ALD and AMN is due to a deficiency of peroxisomal very long chain (<b>lignoceric</b> acid) acyl-CoA ligase...|$|E
40|$|The {{deficient}} oxidation and {{accumulation of}} very-long-chain fatty acids in the Zellweger cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome (CHRS) and X chromosome-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), {{coupled with the}} observation that peroxisomes are lacking in CHRS, prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of the catabolism of <b>lignoceric</b> acid (C 24 : 0). Peroxisomal and mitochondrial-rich fractions were separated from rat liver crude mitochondria by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Enzyme activity for the oxidation of [1 - 14 C]palmitic acid to water-soluble acetate was 2 - to 3 -fold higher in the mitochondrial than in the peroxisomal-rich fraction whereas [1 - 14 C]lignoceric acid was oxidized at a 2 - to 3 -fold higher rate in the peroxisomal than in the mitochondrial fraction. Moreover, unlike palmitic acid oxidation, <b>lignoceric</b> acid oxidation was not inhibited by potassium cyanide in either rat liver fractions or human skin cultured fibroblasts, showing that <b>lignoceric</b> acid is mainly and possibly exclusively oxidized in peroxisomes. We also conducted studies to clarify the striking phenotypic differences between CHRS and the childhood form of ALD. In contrast to CHRS, we found normal hepatocellular peroxisomes in the liver biopsy of a childhood ALD patient. In addition, {{in the presence of}} potassium cyanide, the oxidation of palmitic acid in cultured skin fibroblasts was inhibited by 62 % in control and X chromosome-linked ALD patients compared with 88 % in CHRS and neonatal ALD.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{fenoprofen}} on the activation of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), <b>lignoceric</b> acid (C 24 : 0) and cerotic acid (C 26 : 0) in microsomal and peroxisomal fractions from rat liver. Fenoprofen was found to inhibit the formation of palmitoyl-CoA in both microsomal and peroxisomal fractions whereas the formation of lignoceroyl-CoA and cerotoyl-CoA was not inhibited at all. In freshly isolated rat hepatocytes palmitic acid beta-oxidation was progressively inhibited at increasing concentrations of fenoprofen, most probably due to its inhibitory effect on palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity. On the other hand, fenoprofen was also found to inhibit the beta-oxidation of <b>lignoceric</b> acid and cerotic acid in rat hepatocytes. It is shown that the acyl-CoA oxidase activity with lignoceroyl-CoA as substrate was inhibited by fenoprofen whereas the palmitoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase activities were not inhibited by fenoprofen.

However, β-oxidation enzyme proteins were detected by immunoblot analyses, and large peroxisomes were identified by immunofluorescence staining. In order to identify the underlying defect in these patients, complementation analysis was introduced using fibroblasts from these patients and patients with an established deficiency of either acyl-CoA oxidase or bifunctional enzyme, as identified by immunoblotting. In the complementing combinations, fused cells showed increased <b>lignoceric</b> acid oxidation, resistance against 1 -pyrene dodecanoic acid/UV selection, and normalization of the size and the distribution of peroxisomes.

40|$|Late Breaking Poster Abstract: no. LB-P- 07 BACKGROUND: Stroke is {{prevalent}} in hypertensive population. It {{has been suggested}} that monospecific unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) have potential effect on protection against stroke. However, the effect of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) on stroke is controversial. Therefore, we studied the relationship between recent stroke and serum levels of fatty acids including both USFAs and SFAs in hypertensive patients. METHODS: 89 pairs including 100 men and 78 women matched by sex and age were recruited. Each pair included a hypertensive patient experiencing a stroke within 48 hours before examination and a hypertensive patient without stroke. 6 categories of serum fatty acids were methylated before concentration determination which was repeated twice with percent recovery estimated. Data were analyzed using R version 3. 0. 1. RESULTS: There were differences in educational level (P¼ 0. 002) and occupation (P< 0. 001) between stroke and non-stroke participants. Non-stroke participants had higher levels of total cholesterol (P< 0. 001), triglyceride (P¼ 0. 041), LDL (P¼ 0. 048) and HDL (P¼ 0. 001). All the 6 fatty acid levels were higher in non-stroke participants (P¼ 0. 017 for palmitoleic acid, 0. 001 for palmitic acid, < 0. 001 for linoleic acid, < 0. 001 for behenic acid, < 0. 001 for nervonic acid and 0. 002 for <b>lignoceric</b> acid). Before adjustment, recent stroke was inversely associated with fatty acid levels except <b>lignoceric</b> acid’s. After adjustment for education and occupation, the palmitoleic acid and palmitic acid levels were no longer inversely associated with recent stroke. After further adjustment for systolic blood pressure, smoking, drinking, total cholesterol and triglyceride, the inverse associations of linoleic acid (OR¼ 0. 965, 95 %CI¼ 0. 942 - 0. 990, P¼ 0. 005), behenic acid (OR¼ 0. 778, 95 %CI¼ 0. 664 - 0. 939, P¼ 0. 009), nervonic acid (OR¼ 0. 323, 95 %CI¼ 0. 121 - 0. 860, P¼ 0. 024) with recent stroke were still highly significant. CONCLUSION: The levels of the fatty acids except <b>lignoceric</b> acid were inversely associated with recent stroke.

40|$|For {{polymorphonuclear}} neutrophils (PMNs) {{to orient}} migration to chemotactic gradients, weak external asymmetries must be amplified into larger internal signaling gradients. Lipid mediators, {{associated with the}} plasma membrane and within the cell, participate in generating these gradients. This study examined the role in PMN chemotaxis of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), a plasma membrane–associated enzyme that converts sphingomyelin to ceramide.

This defect could be completely reversed by treatment with <b>lignoceric</b> ceramide (5 μg/ml, 15 minutes). Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that N-SMase (1) distributes preferentially toward the leading edge of some elongated cells, (2) is associated with the plasma membrane, (3) is more than 99. 5 % localized to the cytofacial aspect of the plasma membrane, (4) is excluded from pseudopodial extensions, and (5) increases rapidly in response to FMLP. Morphologically, the inhibition of N-SMase limited cellular spreading and the extension of sheet-like pseudopods. Elongated PMNs demonstrated a polarized distribution of GTPases, with Rac 1 / 2 accumulated at, and RhoA excluded from, the front of the cell. This polarity was negated by N-SMase inhibition and restored by <b>lignoceric</b> ceramide. We conclude that N-SMase at the cytofacial plasma membrane is an essential element for the proper orientation of PMNs in FMLP gradients, at least in part by polarizing the distribution of Rac 1 / 2 and RhoA GTPases...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the detailed clinical, pathologic, and biochemical features of {{brother and sister}} with the neonatal onset form of adrenoleukodystrophy, together with evidence of the biochemical defect. When compared with reports of previous cases, {{it becomes clear that}} this is a newly described clinical entity with remarkable uniformity of signs and very different from the usual childhood form. Some pathologic features are shared, including the morphologic abnormality of the adrenal in both neonatal and childhood forms, but deposition of abnormally metabolized lipids is more systemic and widespread in the neonatal form. The biochemistry of the disease is presented in both children and parents. Plasma values of long-chain fatty acid C 26 : 0 are 0. 328 +/- 0. 18 micrograms/ml in a control population and 0. 381 +/- 0. 312 micrograms/ml in the father and mother. Values for C 26 : 0 in the plasma of childhood adrenoleukodystrophy are 1. 62 +/- 0. 87 micrograms/ml and in our two cases, 2. 79 micrograms/ml in the male, 1. 83 micrograms/ml in the female. The basic biochemical defect appears to be a diminished capacity to oxidize these fatty acids leading to accumulation in cholesterol esters. Fatty acid oxidation to CO 2 by cultured skin fibroblasts was 51 % of control value for stearic acid, 5 % for <b>lignoceric</b> acid in the male, and 39 % of control value for stearic acid, 5 % for <b>lignoceric</b> acid in the female. The genetics of this disease is different; whereas childhood adrenoleukodystrophy is X-linked, the neonatal onset form affects males and females equally and is most probably autosomally recessive in inheritance...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of 1 - 11 C-labelled derivatives of palmitic (C 16 : 0), arachidonic (C 20 : 4,n- 6) <b>lignoceric</b> (C 21 : 0) and tetracosatetraenoic (C 24 : 4,n- 6) acids was {{studied in}} normal skin fibroblast cultures and in cultures of fibroblasts from peroxisome-deficient (Zellweger's syndrome) patients. Radiolabelled {{products of the}} fatty acids included carbon dioxide. C 14 - 24 saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids formed from released acetate either by synthesis de novo or by elongation of endogenous fatty acids, fatty acids formed by 2 - 6 -carbon elongation of added substrates, {{and a number of}} water-soluble compounds, some of which were tentatively identified as the amino acids glutamine, glutamic acid and asparagine. The labelled amino acids were found predominantly in the culture medium. Zellweger's syndrome fibroblasts showed a marked decrease in radiolabelled carbon dioxide and water-soluble-product formation from (I- 14 C) -labelled arachidonic, tetracosatetraenoic and <b>lignoceric</b> acids but not from [I- 14 C]palmitic acid, and the production of radiolabelled C 14 - 18 fatty acids was also diminished. However, the elongation of individual fatty acids was either normal or above normal. Our data support the view that the oxidation of 20 : 4, 24 : 4 and 24 : 0 fatty acids in cultured skin fibroblasts takes place largely in peroxisomes, and further that the acetyl-CoA released by the beta-oxidation process is available for the synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids. We speculate that the generation of C 2 units used for synthesis is a major peroxisomal function and that this function is absent or greatly impaired in Zellweger's syndrome cells...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} a (PPARa) is {{a member}} of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily and mediates the biological and toxicological effects of peroxi-some proliferators. To determine the physiological role of PPARa in fatty acid metabolism, levels of peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolizing enzymes were deter-mined in the PPARa null mouse. Constitutive liver b-oxida-tion of the long chain fatty acid, palmitic acid, was lower in the PPARa null mice as compared with wild type mice, indicating defective mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism. In contrast, constitutive oxidation of the very long chain fatty acid, <b>lignoceric</b> acid, was not different between wild type and PPARa null mice, suggesting that constitutive expres-sion of enzymes involved in peroxisomal b-oxidation is in-dependent of PPARa. Indeed, the PPARa null mice ha...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} glycolipids (ceramide-trihexosides and ceramide-dihexosides) {{extracted}} from urines {{of a case}} of Fabry's disease in a child. Ceramide-trihexosides {{are similar to those}} accumulated in liver and kidney. Ceramide-dihexosides contain sulfur and seem similar to the glycolipids isolated by Sweeley and Klionsky from the kidney of a patient suffering from Fabry's disease. However, in our urinary glycolipid, the sulfur is not in the sulfate form; it is not combined with the hexose but is located in the ceramide. About one atom corresponds to two molecules of sphingolipid. Our study of Fabry's disease has been extended to the fatty acid composition of urinary and hepatic glycolipids. None of the glycolipids studied contained hydroxylated fatty acids. The dihexoside contains more palmitic and less <b>lignoceric</b> acid than the trihexoside. © 1971.

40|$|AbstractStructural analogs of {{adenosine}} 5 ′-acylphosphates, {{which are}} intermediates {{of the reaction}} catalysed by acyl-CoA synthetases, were synthesized by condensing primary alcohols with AMP to examine the inhibitory effects on the lignoceroyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activities. Hexadecyl, octadecyl, eicosyl, docosyl and tetracosyl esters of AMP were remarkably potent inhibitors of the lignoceroyl-CoA formation. On the other hand, the eicosyl, docosyl or tetracosyl esters of AMP did not behave as significant inhibitors of the palmitoyl-CoA formation at the concentration at which the two other shorter chain analogs were effective. Namely, these longer alkyl esters of AMP have selective inhibitory effects on the lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activity. The Ki value of adenosine 5 ′-tetracosylphosphate, the most potent inhibitor, was about one tenth lower than the Km value for the substrate <b>lignoceric</b> acid. Furthermore, the results {{support the notion that}} lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase is distinct from palmitoyl-CoA synthetase...|$|E
