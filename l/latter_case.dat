5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or more likely that the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} large eddy {{simulations of}} the control of separated flow over an airfoil using body forces and discuss {{the role of a}} three-dimensional vortex structure in separation control. Two types of cases are examined: (1) the body force is distributed in a spanwise uniform layout and (2) the body force is distributed in a spanwise intermittent layout, with three-dimensional vortices being expected to be generated in the <b>latter</b> <b>cases.</b> The flow fields in the <b>latter</b> <b>cases</b> have a shorter separation bubble than those in the former cases although the total momentum of the body force in the <b>latter</b> <b>cases</b> is the same as or half of the former cases. In the flow fields of the latter type, the three-dimensional vortices, which are not observed in the former cases, are generated by the body force downstream of the body force distributed. Thus, three-dimensional vortices are considered to be effective in controlling the separated flow...|$|R

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a bill is {{presented}} for royal assent {{after it has}} passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the <b>latter</b> <b>case.</b> The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E

5|$|The kings {{exempted}} {{some communities}} from {{the jurisdiction of}} the voivodes. The Diploma Andreanum, a royal charter of 1224, placed the territory of the Saxons between Broos (Szászváros, Orăștie) and Barót (Baraolt) under the authority of the Count of Hermannstadt (Nagyszeben, Sibiu), who was appointed by and directly subordinate to the monarchs. Likewise, a special royal official, the Count of the Székelys, administered the Székely community from around 1228. In the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> the two offices were united by custom in 1462: from then on each voivode was also appointed Count of the Székelys.|$|E
5|$|The slave's freedom {{could be}} either total or partial, at the master's whim.

In the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the paramone, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} less action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the next section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the <b>latter</b> <b>case</b> they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} regarding the exact import of the inscription, scholars seem to agree that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) {{from the fact that the}} Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within a few generations after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of the converted Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) at the hands of the indigenously pagan Goths (in the <b>latter</b> <b>case</b> Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the <b>latter</b> <b>case).</b>|$|E

Contestants were required to use all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin {{was added to the}} earned total.

On average, the female of the western Altai Mountains produces two litters, while in the northwestern Altai and the western Sayan Mountains she produces 2.7 litters—with 10% producing up to three litters in the <b>latter</b> <b>case.</b> In 1984, G.I. Makushin and G.I. Orlov determined the average annual mortality rate of the alpine pika to be 53% for populations living in forests and 41% for those living in the alpine zones—most of them aged between one and three years. The annual population density fluctuations of most populations were insignificant.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the <b>latter</b> <b>case,</b> the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E
