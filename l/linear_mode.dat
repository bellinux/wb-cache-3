Based on its perturbative treatment one may regard plasma turbulence as a superposition of <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> (or normal modes) and sideband waves (or nonlinear modes). In this study, we use magnetic field and plasma measurements of nine solar wind events obtained by the Cluster spacecraft and make extensive use of a high-resolution wave vector analysis method, the Multi-point Signal Resonator technique, to find frequencies and wave vectors of discrete modes on ion kinetic scales in the plasma rest frame. The primarily unstructured wave observations in the frequency–wave number diagram are classified into three distinct <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> (proton Bernstein modes, helium-alpha Bernstein modes, and kinetic Alfvén waves) and the sideband waves by comparing with the dispersion relations derived theoretically from linear Vlasov theory using observational values of the plasma parameter beta and the propagation angle from the mean magnetic field. About 60 % of the observed discrete modes {{can be explained by the}} <b>linear</b> <b>modes,</b> primarily as the proton Bernstein and the kinetic Alfvén waves, within the frequency uncertainties, while the rest of the population (about 40 %) cannot be classified as <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> due to the large deviation from dispersion relations. We conclude that both the <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> and sideband wave components are needed to construct the wave picture of solar wind turbulence on ion-kinetic scales...|$|R

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the <b>linear</b> <b>mode</b> of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing “them as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a <b>linear</b> <b>mode</b> of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that this is where it rightfully belongs.|$|E
40|$|Considering a local {{nonlinear}} oscillator {{interacting with}} a chain of coupled Linear oscillators, we demonstrate that {{the dynamics of the}} local oscillator is characterized by a frequency-dependent damping constant, related to the frequency-dependent density of states of the <b>linear</b> <b>modes.</b> Further, we demonstrate how this intrinsic damping provides possibilities for multiple steady states of the nonlinear oscillator, and how these steady states may create local potentials for electrons that are adiabatically coupled with the <b>linear</b> <b>modes.</b> Finally, the implications on coarse-grained mode-ling of hard, softy and biological matter are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{picture of}} <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> {{does not hold}} even if the {{amplitude}} appears to be sufficiently small, δ B / B_ 0 ≃ 1 / 16. Rather, turbulent fluctuations in magnetohydrodynamics {{should be regarded as}} a set sideband waves that have frequencies off from the <b>linear</b> <b>modes.</b> For incoherent waves, the energy spectrum is anisotropic and exhibits an extension in the quasi-perpendicular direction to the large-scale magnetic field. The axial symmetry of the energy spectrum around the large-scale field is broken, and the spectrum is extended in the direction from the southern lobe to the plasma sheet center (Fig.  9). The fluctuation energy is large at very low frequencies and decays monotonously toward higher frequencies irrespective of the wavevector directions. The spectrum in the wavenumber–frequency domain shows no clear organization of dispersion relation. Perhaps the distinct <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> may exist near the source and they have decayed into turbulence before observed by Cluster. However, this statement remains only speculative.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{significant}} {{design challenges}} for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and <b>linear</b> <b>mode</b> operation {{as short as}} possible. [...] "Dead time" [...] is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into Cut-Off Mode and both are [...] "off". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the output power supply through themselves in a condition known as [...] "shoot-through". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between switching states {{as fast as possible}} to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in Linear Mode—the state between Cut-Off Mode and Saturation Mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow shoot-through and/or too much <b>linear</b> <b>mode</b> operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, MRI-driven {{turbulent}} transport {{has been found}} to depend in a significant way on fluid viscosity ν and resistivity η through the magnetic Prandtl number Pm=ν/η. In particular, the transport decreases with decreasing Pm; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers, this trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose Prandtl number is usually very small. In this context, the principle objective of the present investigation is to characterize in a refined way the role of dissipation. Another objective is to characterize the effect of <b>linear</b> (channel <b>modes)</b> and quasi-linear (parasitic modes) physics in the behavior of the transport. These objectives are addressed {{with the help of a}} number of incompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has been increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and secondary parasitic unstable modes. The major results are the following: i- The increased accuracy in the computation of transport averages shows that the dependence of transport on physical dissipation exhibits two different regimes: for Pm ≲ 1, the transport has a power-law dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number rather than on the Prandtl number; for Pm > 1, the data are consistent with a primary dependence on Pm for large enough (∼ 10 ^ 3) Reynolds numbers. ii- The transport-dissipation correlation is not clearly or simply related to variations of the <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> growth rates. iii- The existence of the transport-dissipation correlation depends neither on the number of <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> captured in the simulations, nor on the effect of the parasitic modes on the saturation of the <b>linear</b> <b>modes</b> growth. iv- The transport is usually not dominated by axisymmetric (channel) modesComment: 11 pages, 9 figures.
