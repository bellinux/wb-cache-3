50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{person in the}} Scheidt/Scheyde gt. Weschpfennig family line is Johann vame Scheyde geheissen von Burchenauwe (Bülgenauel), who is officially recorded in 1378, 1407, 1408 and 1441. Bülgenauel is a place in what is nowadays called Hennef near Stadt Blankenberg. Johann was Married to Agnes von Hondenberg. also known as von Hunnenberg, and was stepfather to her son and daughter Johann and Christine (styna) von Hunnenberg. <b>Lacquer</b> <b>seals</b> on historic documents show Johann vame Scheyde to be the earliest in the von Scheidt gen.

5000|$|Many early LDs {{were not}} {{manufactured}} properly; sometimes a substandard adhesive {{was used to}} sandwich together {{the two sides of}} the disc. The adhesive contained impurities that were able to penetrate the <b>lacquer</b> <b>seal</b> layer and chemically attack the metalized reflective aluminium layer, causing it to oxidize and lose its reflective characteristics. This was a problem that was termed [...] "laser rot" [...] among LD enthusiasts, also called [...] "color flash" [...] internally by LaserDisc-pressing plants. Some forms of laser rot could appear as black spots that looked like mold or burned plastic which cause the disc to skip and the movie to exhibit excessive speckling noise. But, for the most part, rotted discs could actually appear perfectly fine to the naked eye.|$|E
5000|$|Łabiszyn - {{situated}} is over Notecią, on {{the border}} Kujaw and Pałuk. In early Middle Ages existed here the castle mentioned into 1247 years as the knightly property.Into XIV the age Łabiszyn was in possession of Prawdziwc. Thanks to their efforts it received municipal rights {laws} into 1369 the year. Seven years later Andrew with Łabiszyna of the coat of arms Prawdziwc, the voivode Brzesko - kujawski, built the lock {the castle} on the island in the bifurcation Noteci.The name Łabiszyn originates probably from the prince Łabiszy. Into 1407 the year the city possessed the already own <b>lacquer</b> <b>seal</b> with the representative coat of arms the upraised right hand with the inscription „Łabiszyn”. Into 1410 the year the king Ladislaus Jagiełło crossed the city, to go with Inowrocławia to Szubina after the victorious battle under Koronowem. Here dwelt on the nights lodging from the day2 on 3 November. According to the tradition Jagiełło planted on the Hill Łabiszyńskim two oaks, from which one remained {behaved} to today. The circuit {the district} of the oak carries out {amounts} 5 metres and 35 centimetres.Into 1594 the year the heir Łabiszyna Stanislaus Latalski built in town wooden Protestant community for confessors of Calvinism which into 1627 year exchanged became on the Catholic churchunder the invocation St. of Thomas. Into 1660 the year one transferred to him the order of reformers. The church many times destroyed fires.In years 1655 and 1657 the occupied {the busy} city was by {through} Swedes and desolate. Into 1678 the year the castellan Paul Gembicki confirmed municipal rights {laws} for Łabiszyna. Into XVII and XVIII the age the city destroyed fires. Into 1772 the year Francis Boguslav Skórzewski, after inheriting of the most of goods and to the repurchase of several villages, placed {put up} on the fore-edge Noteci the new city, to settle in him clothiers, largely Protestants. During the Napoleonic campaign of {{the army of the}} general of Henry Dąbrowskiego liberated Łabiszyn. Into the depot {the composition} of the trunk {the corps} entered also generals Madaliński, Leipzigs and Rymkiewicz which beat the Prussian infantryunder the command of the colonel Szekely.

2500|$|Finishing {{the work}} is often {{necessary}} when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called [...] "burrs" [...] that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before <b>lacquering</b> or <b>sealing,</b> {{which may or may}} not be desired by the artist.|$|R
5000|$|PDO {{acknowledged}} that the problem was due to a manufacturing error on its part, but it gave different explanations for the problem. The most widely acknowledged {{explanation is that the}} lacquer used to coat the discs was not resistant to the sulfur content of the paper in the booklets, which led to the corrosion of the aluminium layer of the disc, even though PDO later said it was because [...] "a silver coating had been used on its discs instead of the standard gold." [...] Peter Copeland of the British Library Sound Archive confirmed that silver instead of aluminium in the reflective layer of the CD would react with sulfur compounds in the sleeves, forming silver sulfate, which has a bronze colour. A combination of the two factors seems likely because, as Barbara Hirsch of the University of California points out, the oxidation could only have occurred if the protective <b>lacquer</b> did not <b>seal</b> the metal film and substrate well enough.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently {{the laser}} beam {{treatment}} {{is more and}} more in common practice. The fields of use are very diverse. One of these fields of activity is removing of pollutions from a surface and preparation of it before the next stage of treatment. In the paper are presented the results of experimental research which were conducted in the aim of assessment of effects after cleaning of AISI 4130 steel by laser beam. The indicator of process quality was surface free energy (SFE) which is well known indicator in the operation where adhesion is very important. To its assess the measurement of contact angle is required. After the experiment the results show {{that it is possible to}} improve the energetic state of the surface, thus the better preparing of surface before activity when the good adhesion properties are needed than in the case of traditional manner of treatment. The surface free energy and its meaning In the manufacturing processes there are some operations consist in covering the earlier prepared surfaces with different kinds of coatings. It may be painting, <b>lacquering,</b> adhesive bonding, <b>sealing,</b> protecting against corrosion, lubrication, etc. During the covering with the coating the surface is wetted by the liquid, between wetted surface and tangent line to the meniscus of wetted liqui...|$|R
