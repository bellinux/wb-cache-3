40|$|Abstract — In {{the case}} of vehicles, the term chassis means the frame plus the running gear like engine, transmission, driveshaft, differential, and suspension. An {{all-terrain}} vehicle (ATV), {{also known as a}} quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, or four-wheeler, is defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a vehicle that travels on <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tires,</b> with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. This paper deals with design of chassis frame for an All Terrain Vehicle and its Optimization. Various loading tests like Front Impact, Rear Impact, Side Impact, Roll over test etc have been conducted on the chassis and the design has been optimized by reducing the weight of the chassis...|$|R

2500|$|Behind {{the engine}} the cabin, under the wing, is {{accessed}} via top hinged doors on both sides. [...] There is a separate, port side door for baggage. The flat {{sides of the}} fuselage taper to the tail. [...] Several undercarriage configurations are available; for land based operations the Tundra builder can choose between tricycle and tailwheel gear. Both use spring cantilever main legs, with large, <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tires</b> for work off soft ground; these legs are positioned at the attachment point of the wing struts for the conventional arrangement and further aft for the tricycle gear.

5000|$|Although many differing {{variants}} {{have been}} developed over the years, and new ones are still being devised, most amphibious ATVs share most of the following characteristics. In contrast to today's ANSI definition of an ATV: [...] "a vehicle that travels on <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tires,</b> with a seat that is straddled by the (single) operator, and with handlebars for steering control", an AATV is intended for multiple riders, sitting inside, and will usually have two control sticks (and in some cases a steering wheel or joystick) rather than motorcycle-type handle bars as stipulated in the current definition. Typically constructed with a hard plastic or fiberglass watertight body"tub", AATVs usually have six or eight wheels - all driven - with <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> (around 3 PSI) balloon tires, no suspension (other than what the tires offer) and no steering wheels. Directional control is accomplished through skid-steering - just as on a tracked vehicle - either by braking the wheels on the side {{where you want to}} turn, or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side. Most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines, that will provide roughly 25 mph (40 km/h) top speed. AATVs typically do not meet vehicle regulations in most countries, and are therefore strictly Off Highway Vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars {{now come}} with {{built-in}} <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors that allow all four <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> {{to be read}} simultaneously from inside the car. In 2005, most on-board <b>Tire</b> <b>Pressure</b> Monitoring Systems (TPMS) used indirect pressure monitoring. The anti-lock brake sensors detect one tire rotating faster than the rest and indicate a <b>low</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> to the driver. The problem with this method was that if tires all lost the same pressure then none would show up against the others to indicate a problem.|$|R

50|$|A wheel can {{be formed}} {{in one piece}} from a {{material}} such as thermoplastic (glass-filled nylon in this case), carbon fiber or aluminium alloy. Thermoplastic is commonly used for inexpensive BMX wheels. They have a <b>low</b> maximum <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> of 45 psi (3bars or atmospheres).

5000|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>pressure</b> differential: As {{with the}} Renault Dauphine and pre-1968 Volkswagen Beetle, Corvair {{engineers}} {{relied on a}} cost-free <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> differential to eliminate oversteer characteristics [...] - [...] low front and high rear <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> - a strategy which induced understeer (increasing front slip angles faster than the rear). Nonetheless, the strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tires (e.g., to typical pressures for other cars with other, more prevalent suspension systems). The recommended <b>low</b> front <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> also compromised the tire load capacity.|$|R

5000|$|Air <b>pressure</b> {{within a}} <b>tire</b> forces its beads against the wheel rim and {{normally}} {{ensures that the}} tire and rim rotate as a single unit. In general automotive situations, a <b>tire's</b> air <b>pressure</b> is sufficient to withstand dislodging and rim-slip forces experienced during, respectively, hard cornering and acceleration (including negative acceleration or [...] "braking"). <b>Low</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> therefore poses the hazard of enabling sudden loss of air, and loss of control, during hard braking or an evasive maneuver (in addition to generally promoting excessive tire heat and future failure). Modern automotive tires have a soft rubber formulation at the beads to help maintain good rim contact, so special bead-lock means are not required.|$|R

50|$|Trials riding is {{an extreme}} test of bicycle {{handling}} skills, over all kinds of obstacles, both natural and man-made. It now has a strong - though small - following worldwide, though it is still primarily a European sport. Skills taken from trials riding can be used practically on any bicycle for balance, for example controlled braking and track standing, or balancing on the bike without putting a foot down. Competition trial bikes are characterized by powerful brakes, wide handlebars, lightweight parts, single-speed <b>low</b> gearing, <b>low</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> with a thick rear tire, distinctive frame geometry, and usually no seat.|$|R
50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> involves retrofitting a <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 {{are required to}} have <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring systems built-in, although many older vehicles might not have it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to <b>low</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressure.</b> These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's valve stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't tightened down enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> yourself of by having someone else do it, as most <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor systems will not alert the driver until the <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
40|$|An {{indirect}} <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> {{monitoring system}} uses the wheel rolling radius {{as an indicator}} of <b>low</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressure.</b> When extra load is put in the trunk of a car, the load distribution in the car will change. This will affect the rolling radius which in its turn will be confused with a change in the <b>tire</b> <b>pressure.</b> To avoid this phenomenon, the load distribution has to be estimated. In this thesis methods for estimating the pitch angle of a car and an offset in the pitch angle caused by changed load distribution are presented and when an estimate is derived, a load distribution can be derived. Alot of available signals are used but the most important are the longitudinal accelerometer signal and the acceleration at the wheels derived from the velocity of the car. A few ways to detect or compensate for a non-zero road grade are also presented. Based on the estimated offset, a difference between the front and rear axle heights in the vehicle can be estimated and compensating for the changed load distribution in an indirect <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring system will be possible...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} plowing and minimum tillage, the sod seeding technique {{has been tested}} in order to evaluate the differences in energy consumption, labor and machinery requirement and CO 2 emission reduction. The experiments were conducted on winter cereal seeding in a Po valley farm in October 2011. The tests were carried out as follows: wheat variety seeding, over corn and alfalfa crops, in large plots with three repetitions for each thesis. They included: sod seeding anticipated by round up weeding {{in the case of}} the plots over alfalfa; traditional plowing at 35 cm followed by rotary tillage and combined seeding (seeder plus rotary tiller); minimum tillage based on ripping at the same depth (35 cm) and combined seeder (seeder plus rotary tiller). The following farm operations - fertilizer, and other agrochemical distributionshave been the same in all the considered theses. The results, statistically significant (P< 0. 001) in terms of yields, highlighted slight differences: the best data {{in the case of the}} traditional plowing both in the case of wheat crop over corn and alfalfa (84. 43 and 6. 75 t/ha); slightly lower yields for the sod seeding (6. 23 and 79. 9 t/ha for corn and alfalfa respectively); lower in the case of minimum tillage (5. 87; 79. 77 t/ha in the two situations). Huge differences in energy and oil consumption have been recorded: in the case of succession to corn 61. 47; 35. 31; 4. 27 kg oil/ha respectively for, traditional plowing, minimum tillage and sod seeding; in the case of alfalfa 61. 2; 50. 96; 5. 14 kg oil/ha respectively for traditional plowing, minimum tillage and sod seeding. The innovative technique, highlighted huge energy saving with an oil consumption equal to 92 % and 89 % (P< 0. 001) of what happens in traditional plowing and minimum tillage. Large differences concern labor and machine productivity. These parameters together with oil consumption and machine size [power (kW) and weight (t) ] lead to even greater differences in terms of energy consumption, efficiency and CO 2 emission savings.
