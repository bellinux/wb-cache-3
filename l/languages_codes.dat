Diante disso, este trabalho se propôs a {{investigar}} como professores das referidas disciplinas interpretam a inserção da Educação Física nessa área. Participaram deste estudo de caso qualitativo 16 professores de três escolas públicas estaduais, com mais de 1. 500 alunos. Os resultados, obtidos por meio de questionário, evidenciam a dificuldade dos professores de trabalhar interdisciplinarmente, de identificar as relações possíveis entre as disciplinas e, inclusive, de reconhecer a Educação Física como integrante da área de Linguagens, Códigos e suas Tecnologias. Essas constatações configuram, portanto, aspectos relevantes a serem considerados no desafio de implementação das proposições legais nas escolas da Educação Básica.

For achieving this, a qualitative case study was done, in which 16 teachers from three public state schools with over 1. 500 students.

On {{contrary}} to word processors, text editors focuses on editing functions for plain text instead of adding formatting to text. Text editors serve wide variety of people with wide variety of purposes. Text Editors are generally used by software programmers and web developers use text editors to write and edit in programming and markup languages. However, text editors are ideal tools for anyone who needs to write quickly and simply, read source code, or create text files. One of the most useful tools in a text editor's repertoire is Syntax Highlighting. Programming/markup <b>languages</b> <b>codes</b> are written in color.

The framework provides the optimized common algorithms, as well as various skeleton (template) main programs. The user provides specialized subroutines that are specific to his or her problem.

40|$|In this {{remarkable}} and often dazzling book, Paul Carter explores {{the conditions for}} sociability in a globalized future. He argues that we make many assumptions about communication but overlook barriers to understanding between strangers {{as well as the}} importance of improvisation in overcoming these obstacles to meeting. While disciplines such as sociology, legal studies, psychology, political theory, and even urban planning treat meeting as a good in its own right, they fail to provide a model of what makes meeting possible and worth pursuing: a yearning for encounter. The volume&# 039;s central narrative-between Northern cultural philosophers and Australian societies-traverses the troubled history of misinterpretation that is characteristic of colonial cross-cultural encounter. As he brings the literature of Indigenous and non-Indigenous anthropological research into dialogue with Western approaches of conceptualizing sociability, Carter makes a startling discovery: that meeting may not be desirable and, if it is, its primary objective may be to negotiate a future of non-meeting. To explain the phenomenon of encounter, Carter performs it in differing scales, spaces, languages, tropes, and forms of knowledge, staging in the very language of the book what he calls "passages. " In widely varying contexts, these passages posit the disjunction of Greco-Roman and Indigenous <b>languages,</b> <b>codes,</b> theatrics of power, social systems, and visions of community. In an era of new forms of technosocialization, Carter offers novel ways of presenting the philosophical dimensions of waiting, meeting, and non-meeting...|$|E
40|$|The Wire {{has been}} praised for its {{particular}} realist aesthetic style {{that is a}} radical departure from the traditional television police procedural and that takes many of its cues from the film noir. The Wire’s unique use, and functioning, of sound extends beyond the limits of visual representation which privileges audio detail. It relies on listening as its central thematic to propel the story while obscuring the gaze. The series explores the specificities of Baltimore’s West Side vernacular and how its use complicates power, knowledge, and meaning while simultaneously remapping its urban spaces. It expertly demonstrates how complex vernacular, along with foreign <b>languages,</b> <b>codes,</b> dialects and accents, can complicate listening and understanding. The Wire’s representation of urban spaces and experiences allows for meaningful consideration of Edward Dimendberg’s seminal work on the representation of the city in the film noir, as well as Michel Chion’s work on film sound studies. Employing Dimendberg’s framework, and considering Henri Lefebvre’s concept of modern spatial practices, I analyze representations of The Wire’s urban spaces and experiences, taking into account the crucial role that sound and surveillance play in constituting its urban spaces and lived experiences. Employing Chion’s work, I explore how The Wire’s use of sound demands the active perception of its complex acousmatic imaginary, in order to achieve a rich understanding about different spaces within the same city. The Wire invites active engagement in order to promote complex understanding about modern American urban...|$|E

30|$|What brings {{these three}} female cases of Nevin Aladağ, Anny and Sibel Öztürk, and Nilbar Güreş {{together}} {{is the fact}} that first of all, these artists are not rejecting or erasing the contexts, and instead, they are taking and using their background, feelings, experiences, and encounters as the source with which to create both an individual as well as artistic means to first engage the viewer and to challenge the doxa on a transnational level. Artists have become observers, and willingly or unwillingly, postulants for a redefinition of the dynamics that drive the society at large. Displacement or migration, conditions that provide a niche from which to address issues of identity as well as belonging, challenge inherited notions of home, territory, and ethnicity {{in a world that is}} constantly shifting. 2 Hence, the trajectories of this select group of female artists involve not just a rethinking of the Turkish artscape, but also that of Europe, invoking a whole new transnational and transitional space within which the artist is both an author and an observer. These artists re-examine, reflect, and narrate multiple identities, geographical imaginations and experiences as their work carries traces of diverse cultures, <b>languages,</b> <b>codes,</b> traditions, and challenges. Their gaze into the new patterns of European identity not only creates a distinct constellation of art, but presents a new possibility through art. These ‘new migrants’ thus present ‘snap shots’ of how mobility, memory, and art can potentially enact different forms of new European identity with a Turkish ‘fold’. Through their work, these artists present to us once again the multiple ways in which Turkey is culturally and ideationally entangled with Europe, reflecting in creative fashion on how nationhood—and Europeanness—today are a continuously re-woven tapestry of different identities.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A regular event W {{is a star}} event {{if there}} exists another event V such that W = V*. In that case, V is called a root of W. It is shown that every star event has a unique minimum root, which is {{contained}} in every other root. An algorithm for finding the minimum root of a regular event is presented, and the root is shown to be regular. The results have applications to <b>languages,</b> <b>codes,</b> canonical forms for regular expressions, implification of expressions, de-composition of sequential machines, and semigroup theory. 1. Algebraic Background We begin by reviewing some properties of semigroups [1, 2], and by proving some results about general semigroups to be used later in more specific applications. A semigroup is a nonempty set S together with a binary associative opemtior~ called multiplication and denoted by juxtaposition. Thus z = xy denotes the prod-uct of x and y. We are particularly interested in certain subsets of a semigroup [1]. Let G and H be subsets of semigroup S; then so are G U H, G f'l H, and G- H (union, intersection, and relative complement, respectively). Furthermore, for G, H ~ S, define the product GH = {k lk = gh, g C G,h E H}. (1) It is clear that (GH) ~ S, and that the product of subsets of a semigroup is as-sociative. Also the following distributive laws hold: For G, H, K ~ S, G(H U K) = GH U GK, (2) (G U H) K = GK U HK. If G ~ S, then the set of all products of elements of G (products consisting of single terms included) is a subsemigroup of S. This set of products is defined by: G ÷ = GUG~UG~U [...] 5 G ". (3) In case S = G +, S {{is said to be}} generated by G, and G is a generating set of S [1]. Every semigroup has at least one generating set (S generates itself). Note that the following properties hold: (G+) + = V +, (4) if G 2 H, then G +~H +, (5...|$|E
