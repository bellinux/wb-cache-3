25|$|The midsole is {{the layer}} {{in between the}} outsole and the insole, {{typically}} there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, <b>like</b> <b>running</b> shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down. Some shoes {{may not have a}} midsole at all.|$|E
25|$|Playing back {{a signal}} from {{recording}} studio equipment directly into a guitar amplifier can cause unwanted side-effects such as input-stage distortion, treble loss or overemphasis, and ground-loop hum; thus there is sometimes a need for impedance conversion, level-matching, and ground alteration. <b>Like</b> <b>running</b> a guitar signal through a guitar effects pedal that is set to Bypass, re-amping introduces some degree of sonic degradation compared to playing a guitar live directly into a guitar amp rig.|$|E

25|$|In Brazil, {{the minimum}} working age has been {{identified}} as fourteen due to continuous constitutional amendments that occurred in 1934, 1937, and 1946. Yet due to a change in the dictatorship by the military in the 80’s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous <b>like</b> <b>running</b> construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work. Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in Brazil. It was not until recently in the 80’s that it was discovered that almost nine million children in Brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure {{is a risk}} factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m3 increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes --- increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions. Another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities <b>like</b> <b>running</b> in outdoor space at polluted areas.|$|E

500|$|... "Come Dancing" [...] has {{generally}} received positive reviews from music critics. In {{his review of}} State of Confusion, Rolling Stone critic Parke Puterbaugh said that the song [...] "sums up the bittersweet mood that wafts through [...] in calming counterpoint to its more turbulent moments." [...] George Kalogerakis, also of Rolling Stone, [...] said in his review of the album [...] that the song was an [...] "undeniable winner," [...] claiming that [...] "hearing [...] in th crackling live version is <b>like</b> <b>running</b> into [...] old friend." [...] AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the song {{as one of the}} [...] "quieter moments" [...] on State of Confusion where the album [...] "came to life," [...] praising its [...] "buoyant nostalgia." [...] On the band's Rolling Stone biography, the song was called [...] "delightfully nostalgic." [...] Author Rob Jovanovic called the song [...] "incredibly catchy" [...] and said that, as the song's title suggested, it [...] "made [...] want to move his feet." [...] Andrew Hickey said in his book, Preservation: The Kinks' Music 1964–1974, that the track was a [...] "great pop song." [...] Thomas M. Kitts praised its [...] "big band sound" [...] in his book, Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else.|$|E
500|$|The song's title phrase {{originated}} from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going, and the brother responding, [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>running</b> to stand still." [...] Bono {{had not heard}} the phrase before, and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction {{and the effects of}} the drug on the body were like; a writer later described the title as a [...] "perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction." [...] Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts, a man and a woman, who lived in the Ballymun towers. [...] Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit, the man became a heroin smuggler, operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday. Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions, as well as poor choices, and Bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives. [...] The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly, but instead [...] the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in. [...] In doing so, the song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for the woman. [...] A character monologue from Wim Wenders' 1984 film Paris, Texas, was also a significant influence on Bono's writing of the song.|$|E
500|$|Katsuya Eguchi, {{who managed}} Software Development Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, {{produced}} Wii Sports. With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach {{people who had}} not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way. Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended Wii Sports to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this. Wii Sports {{was designed as a}} simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers. Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. Gameplay <b>like</b> <b>running</b> towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity. At one point in development, Mario characters were used, but were removed because of feedback from players who preferred Miis. The game supports a [...] and progressive scan, runs at 60 frames per second, and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion. Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible. Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play Wii Sports, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players {{would be more likely to}} play Wii Sports through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its popularity by word of mouth.|$|E

The prosecutor allowed conviction of Bonie was possible if other aspects of the case were strong.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of the elevator was a precondition for the {{invention of}} skyscrapers, given {{that most people would}} not (or could not) climb more than a few flights of stairs at a time. [...] The elevators in a skyscraper are not simply a necessary utility, <b>like</b> <b>running</b> water and electricity, but are in fact closely related to the design of the whole structure: a taller building requires more elevators to service the additional floors, but the elevator shafts consume valuable floor space. [...] If the service core, which contains the elevator shafts, becomes too big, it can reduce the profitability of the building. [...] Architects must therefore balance the value gained by adding height against the value lost to the expanding service core.|$|E

2500|$|Jay-Z {{has also}} {{established}} himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning across a variety of industries ranging from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels. In an interview, he stated that [...] "my brands are an extension of me. They're close to me. It's not <b>like</b> <b>running</b> GM, where there's no emotional attachment." [...] Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear. Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group, for $204million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development. He also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined. Future plans will see 40/40 Clubs in Tokyo and Singapore. In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol's Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands. In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5million.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimated}} 25,000 {{people lived}} in Brownsville by 1900, most of whom lived in two-story wooden frame accommodations built for two families each. Many of these buildings were grossly overcrowded, with up to eight families living {{in some of these}} two-family houses. They were utilitarian, and according to one New York Herald article, [...] "grossly unattractive". Many of these houses lacked amenities <b>like</b> <b>running</b> water, and their wood construction made these houses susceptible to fires. New brick-and-stone houses erected in the early 1900s were built with indoor plumbing and less prone to fire. The quality of life was further decreased by {{the fact that there was}} scant infrastructure to be found in the area, and as a result, the unpaved roads were used as open sewers. Compounding the problem, land prices were high in Brownsville (with lots available for $50 in 1907, then sold for $3,000 two years later), so in order to make their land purchases worthwhile, developers were frequently inspired to build as many apartments on a single lot as they possibly could. Within twenty years of the factories' development, the area acquired a reputation as a vicious slum and breeding ground for crime. By 1904, out of 25 housing units in Brownsville, twenty-two were tenement housing; three years later, only one of these 25 housing units was not a tenement. It became as dense as the very densely packed Lower East Side, according to one account. This also led to dangerous conditions; a 1935 collapse of a tenement stairway killed two people and injured 43 others. This overcrowding was despite the availability of empty space in the fringes of Brownsville. There were also no playgrounds in the area, and the only park in the vicinity was Betsy Head Park.|$|E
