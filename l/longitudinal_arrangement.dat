30|$|Arrangement of {{reinforcement}} is another parameter affecting {{the distribution of}} confinement pressure. If the lateral force applied by transverse reinforcement on concrete is well distributed {{around the perimeter of}} the core concrete, the distribution of lateral pressure becomes almost uniform, improving the effectiveness of confinement reinforcement. Some researches such as Mander et al. (1988), and Saatcioglu and Razvi (1992) have shown that the arrangement of transverse reinforcement has major effects on strength and ductility of normal strength concrete columns. In addition, other researchers like Yong et al. (1988), Sakai (1990), and Saatcioglu and Razvi (1993) observed the same effect. The results indicate that HSC columns, reinforced with well-distributed and laterally supported longitudinal reinforcement, exhibit improved ductility. Nagashima et al. (1992) observed, however, that columns with six, eight, and 12 <b>longitudinal</b> bar <b>arrangements</b> (Steel Confinement Configuration type 2, 3 and 6 —see Fig.  3) did not exhibit a significant difference in strength and ductility. Cusson and Paultre (1994) concluded that columns with 12 <b>longitudinal</b> bar <b>arrangements</b> (Type 6 in Fig.  3) did not necessarily show improved behavior over those with an 8 -bar arrangement (Type 3 in Fig.  3).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the skin, the stratum corneum (SC), is composed of corneocytes and an intercellular lipid matrix.

In the mammalian SC, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the lipid molecules, consisting of long and short lamellar structures with repeat distances of about 13  nm and 6  nm, respectively, has been observed by small-angle X-ray diffraction. In the lateral arrangement of the lipid molecules, hexagonal and orthorhombic hydrocarbon-chain packing has been observed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. From the systematic study of the temperature dependence of simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns, we demonstrate that the intercellular lipid matrix forms two domains, which consist at room temperature of a long lamellar structure with hexagonal hydrocarbon-chain packing and a short lamellar structure with orthorhombic hydrocarbon-chain packing...|$|E

40|$|The {{main results}} of the review of {{existing}} methods, methods, equipment for grinding, distribution of coarse forages, including rolled feed, on cattle–breeding farms are given in the article. This allows us to identify the main factors affecting the productivity of grinders — distributors {{and the quality of}} supply of finished material to feeders. On the basis of research works and analysis of existing technical means for the preparation and distribution of coarse forages, we propose a constructive technological scheme for a mobile shredder–distributor with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of a knife–type working organ. Analysis of mobile shredders and distributors revealed that they should provide loading in the places of storage of coarse forages, transportation, grinding and dispensing in the feeding zone. The technical tool that performs the totality of the above operations is a dynamic system that operates under conditions of changing external influences. The model of the shredder–distributor functioning is proposed, which can be calculated with incoming variables that determine the conditions of its operation: feeding feed roll, which can be changed if necessary, as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the material, mainly density and humidity, which are uncontrollable factors and are monitored in advance experiments...|$|E

In the proposed method <b>longitudinal</b> rebars <b>arrangement</b> is replaced with a thin steel ring equivalent to the steel total area; moreover, according to modern codes, simplified stress–strain relationships for concrete and reinforcing steel are used. The performed analyses demonstrate that the value of flexural capacity determined by the proposed approach, is very close to the results obtained by applying rigorous methods based on analytical and numerical algorithms. The study also proves that in members subjected to bending moment without axial load, the flexural strength depends on the geometry of the section (i. e. radius and concrete cover) and on mechanical ratio of steel reinforcement by a very simple formula...|$|R
40|$|The zero-stress {{state of}} the mucosa-submucosa and two muscle esophageal layers has been delineated, but their multi-axial {{response}} has not, because muscle dissection may not leave tubular specimens intact for inflation/extension testing. The histomechanical behavior of the three-layered porcine esophagus was investigated in this study, through light microscopic examination and uniaxial tension, with two-dimensional strain measurement in pairs of orthogonally oriented specimens. The two-dimensional Fung-type strain-energy function described suitably the pseudo-elastic tissue response, affording faithful simulations to our data. Differences in the scleroprotein content and configuration were identified {{as a function of}} layer, topography, and orientation, substantiating the macromechanical differences found. In view of the failure and optimized material parameters, the mucosa-submucosa was stronger and stiffer than muscle, associating it with a higher collagen content. A notable topographical distribution was apparent, with data for the abdominal region differentiated from that for the cervical region, owing to the existence of inner muscle with a circumferential arrangement and of outer muscle with a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the former region, and of both muscle layers with oblique arrangement in the latter region, with thoracic esophagus being a transition zone.

The {{presence of a}} sufficient quantity of myocardial fibers showing this change {{is considered to be}} a specific histological feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, small zones of myofiber disarray are found in both cardiac hypertrophy and other pathological conditions. Recently, we demonstrated an altered pattern of desmin intermediate filaments in disarrayed myofibers from specimens of HCM. To test the hypothesis that desmin alterations might be specific for cardiomyopathy, we performed an immunohistochemical study on myocardial surgical samples from 11 patients with HCM and from 12 patients with tetralogy of Fallot (toF) on 14 endomyocardial biopsy specimens (EMBs) from transplant recipients with myofiber disarray surrounding areas of scarring (previous biopsy site) and on speciments of four autoptic hearts with severe acquired left ventricular hypertrophy. Disarrayed myofibers from all specimens of HCM showed the following abnormalities in the pattern of desmin intermediate filament distribution: (1) decrease or loss of labeling of intercalated discs and Z bands, (2) <b>longitudinal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of desmin intermediate filaments, and (3) intense, granular staining of several myocytes. This spectrum of desmin alterations was never observed in disarrayed myofibers in specimens of toF or acquired myocardial hypertrophy or in EMBs. Altered distribution of desmin intermediate filaments seems to be specific to myofiber disarray in HCM and it may play a role in the altered myocyte arrangement in HCM. Copyright (C) 1995 by W. B.

40|$|The {{segregation}} of bacterial chromosomes follows a precise choreography of spatial organisation. It is {{initiated by the}} bipolar migration of the sister copies of the replication origin (ori). Most bacterial chromosomes contain a partition system (Par) with parS sites {{in close proximity to}} ori that contribute to the active mobilisation of the ori region towards the old pole. This is thought to result in a longitudinal chromosomal arrangement within the cell. In this study, we followed the duplication frequency and the cellular position of 19 Vibrio cholerae genome loci as a function of cell length. The genome of V. cholerae is divided between two chromosomes, chromosome I and II, which both contain a Par system. The ori region of chromosome I (oriI) is tethered to the old pole, whereas the ori region of chromosome II is found at midcell. Nevertheless, we found that both chromosomes adopted a longitudinal organisation. Chromosome I extended over the entire cell while chromosome II extended over the younger cell half. We further demonstrate that displacing parS sites away from the oriI region rotates the bulk of chromosome I. The only exception was the region where replication terminates, which still localised to the septum. However, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of chromosome I persisted in Par mutants and, as was reported earlier, the ori region still localised towards the old pole. Finally, we show that the Par-independent longitudinal organisation and oriI polarity were perturbed by the introduction of a second origin. Taken together, these results suggest that the Par system is the major contributor to the longitudinal organisation of chromosome I but that the replicatio...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the possibility of regional variation of ventricular structure, 25 normal postmortem human hearts were studied by inspection of cavity shape and subepicardial fibre orientation, by dissection, and by the histology of sections in two orthogonal planes. Ventricular architecture was complex. Inlet and outlet long axes were separated by 30 degrees in the left ventricle. In the right the corresponding figure was 90 degrees. The thickest part of the left ventricular wall was at the base. At the apex there was potential endo- and epicardial continuity. Left ventricular cavity shape departed significantly from any simple geometric figure, there being, consistently, regions of {{both positive and negative}} curvature on the diaphragmatic aspect. The presence of trabeculae caused considerable variation in wall thickness. Striking variation was found in the arrangement of subepicardial muscle fibres. Most pronounced was the contrast between the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of fibres observed on the oblique margin and the circumferential arrangement of those on the acute. On the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle, fibres near the crux and apex ran circumferentially while those between ran obliquely; those on the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle also ran circumferentially. Deeper in the myocardium the arrangement was simpler. In the mid-wall of the left ventricle fibres were circumferential, best developed towards the base and in {{the upper part of the}} septum. Near the apex of the left ventricle and in the mid-wall of the right ventricle such fibres were sparse. The subendocardial region consisted of longitudinally directed fibres forming the trabeculae and papillary muscles, while fibres deep to and between the trabeculae coursed more obliquely. These findings were confirmed by histology. Models based on uniform myocardial fibre structure cannot explain wall movement in normal subjects, and are likely to have significant limitations if used to investigated left ventricular function in disease...|$|E

30|$|The second design {{scenario}} {{presented a}} very versatile {{design in the}} form of a configurable carriage concept, allowing the internal design to be used for freight and passenger service with quick changes. Three designs were proposed for this scenario, in which Design 2.1 was selected as the highest performing design. This was due to the space that was made available by using the foldable, longitudinal seating. This design acts as the final recommendation due to its advantages in many areas with only minor changes to the carriage interior. Design 2.2 provided an alternative folding seat design, allowing transverse seating arrangements to be folded away to the side of the carriage. Both these designs created large amounts of space in the centre of the carriage. This addition of space would benefit the passenger service by allowing the seats to be folded away during extremely busy times such as after a concert or football game. Design 2.1 proved to be the best solution for this scenario as the <b>longitudinal</b> seating <b>arrangement</b> was more desirable for an interior layout due to the reduction in dwell time in peak hours and increase in standing passenger capacity.|$|R

The method of relative share of species approximation according to T i m m e r m a n s (1957) was used. 3019 fish specimen of 24 species, of which 19 autochthonous, collected on 12 profiles showed slight changes compared to the state two decades ago. However, the changes are quite significant if compared to the state seven decades ago. The human factor effect on the autochthonous ichthyofauna in the last five decades is significant.

40|$|When the {{electromagnetic}} fields that are {{excited by the}} passage of a bundle of charged particles persist to act upon bunches that follow, then the motions of the bunches are coupled. This action between bunches circulating on a closed orbit can generate growing patterns of bunch excursions. Such growth can often be suppressed by feedback systems that detect the excursion and apply corrective forces to the bunches. To be addressed herein is feedback that acts on motions of the bunch body centers. In addition to being useful for suppressing the spontaneous growth of coupled-bunch motions, such feedback can be used to damp transients in bunches injected into an accelerator or storage ring; for hadrons which lack strong radiation damping, feedback is needed to avoid emittance growth through decoherence. Motions excited by noise in magnetic fields or accelerating rf can also be reduced by using this feedback. Whether the action is on motions that are transverse to the closed orbit or <b>longitudinal,</b> the <b>arrangement</b> is the same. Bunch position is detected by a pickup and that signal is processed and directed to a kicker that may act upon the same bunch or some other portion of the collective beam pattern. Transverse motion is an oscillation with angular frequency {nu}{perpendicular}{omega}{sub o} where {omega}{sub o} is the orbital frequency 2 {pi}{line_integral}o. Longitudinal synchrotron oscillation occurs at frequency {omega} {sub s} = {nu}{sub s}{omega}{sub o}.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a summary of}} {{research}} on the use of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars and stirrups as internal reinforcement for concrete beams. Fibre reinforced polymer bars are geometrically similar to conventional steel reinforcement. They are made of a bundle of long glass fibres bound together by a polymer matrix. The bars are strong when loaded in tension parallel to the fibres, and weak when loaded in any other direction. Fibre reinforced polymers are linear-elastic-to-brittle-rupture materials. Unlike steel reinforcement, bent FRP shapes must be made at the time of manufacture, before the polymer cures. Fibre reinforced polymer stirrups, and other bent shapes, are known to prematurely rupture at the bends. Initially, this was a concern for the shear design of FRP reinforced concrete beams; however, the phenomenon is generally accepted by those who work with the material and aspects of the phenomenon are considered in the provisions of modern FRP reinforced concrete design codes and standards. On occasion other researchers observed full utilization of the straight portion strength of FRP stirrups, and one study suggested that the <b>longitudinal</b> bar <b>arrangement</b> may impact stirrup utilization. Therefore, the experimental program described in this thesis was devised to investigate the influence of <b>longitudinal</b> bar <b>arrangements</b> on GFRP stirrup utilization for beams failing in diagonal shear-tension. However, the experimental beams all failed in a form of shear-compression & strut-crushing and not by diagonal shear tension, so no stirrups ruptured and the original objective could not be tested. The failure modes were concrete controlled and the experimental results indicated deep beam behaviour. The original analysis method was precluded by the unintended failure modes, so an element of novelty was incorporated into the research by applying an analysis method for strut-and-tie modelling of steel reinforced concrete that did not require the assumption of steel yielding to find a lower bound solution. That method was developed by Kim and Yun (2011 a). A generalized form of the method was modified for this research to account for FRP, which necessitated modifications to other aspects such as the failure conditions and element geometry. The modified method {{is referred to as the}} Indeterminate Strut-and-Tie (IST) method throughout this thesis. Current literature on the strut-and-tie modelling of FRP reinforced concrete focuses exclusively on deep beams without stirrups, which are modelled by determinate strut-and-tie trusses. Without the yielding assumption it is not possible to solve an indeterminate strut-and-tie truss without resorting to traditional structural analysis methods. The novelty of the IST method is not simply the application of Yun’s work to FRP reinforced concrete, but that it is also the only method capable of finding a lower bound solution to FRP reinforced deep beams with indeterminate strut-and-tie trusses. The IST method uses traditional structural analysis methods to solve for the forces in a strut-and-tie truss. The concrete struts are modelled using one-dimensional, non-linear material behaviour that is modified with softening coefficients as described in Yun’s research. The method applies load in increasing increments and at each increment the stiffness matrix updates by accounting for changes in concrete strut elasticity. The IST method is also capable of modelling other beam behaviours such as strains and deflections. The research found that the IST method was the best at predicting the strength of the experimental beams when compared to both the best available academic model and the most modern design standard...|$|R

Stepwise combination of CPCys and CPLys with RNA allowed fabrication of TMV-like nanorods with a controlled total length of 300 or 330 nm, respectively, consisting of adjacent longitudinal 100 -to- 200 nm domains of differently addressable CP species. This technology paves the way towards rod-shaped scaffolds with pre-defined, selectively reactive barcode patterns on the nanometer scale...|$|R
50|$|While {{the purpose}} of {{automobile}} suspension is to let the wheels move vertically {{with respect to the}} body, it is undesirable to allow them to move forward and backwards (longitudinally), or side to side (laterally). The Panhard rod restricts lateral movement. This is different from a traction bar, which controls axle wrap and suspension loading. The track bar or Panhard bar is a simple device, consisting of a rigid bar running sideways in the same plane as the axle, connecting one end of the axle to the car body or chassis {{on the opposite side of}} the vehicle. The bar attaches on either end with pivots that let it swivel upwards and downwards only, so that the axle can move in the vertical plane only. This does not effectively locate the axle longitudinally, therefore it is usually used in conjunction with trailing arms that stabilize the axle in the <b>longitudinal</b> direction. This <b>arrangement</b> is not usually used with a leaf spring suspension, where the springs themselves supply enough lateral rigidity, but only with coil spring suspensions (Ford did use a similar rear axle damper (5th shock) on some Explorers and light trucks with rear leaf springs).|$|R
