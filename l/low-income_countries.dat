40|$|We {{consider}} a policy game between a high-income country hosting a drug innovator and a <b>low-income</b> <b>country</b> hosting a drug imitator. The <b>low-income</b> <b>country</b> chooses whether to enforce an International Patent Regime (strict IPR) or not (weak IPR) and the high-income country chooses whether to allow parallel imports (PI) of on-patent drugs or market based discrimination (MBD). We show that, for a moderately high imitation cost, both (Strict IPR, Parallel Imports) and (Weak IPR, MBD) {{emerge as the}} Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) policy choices. For relatively smaller imitation costs, (Weak IPR, MBD) is the unique SPNE policy choice. The welfare properties reveal that although innovation may be higher at the (Strict IPR, PI), the market coverage and national welfare of the <b>low-income</b> <b>country,</b> and the total welfare are all lower. This opens up the efficiency issue of implementing TRIPS {{and at the same}} time allowing international exhaustion of patent rights.

40|$|Can a {{transfer}} of wealth from the US to developing countries be Pareto improving? We analyze this question in an open-economy innovation-driven growth model, in which the highincome (<b>low-income)</b> <b>country</b> produces innovative (homogenous) goods. We find that wealth redistribution to the <b>low-income</b> <b>country</b> simultaneously reduces global inequality and stimulates innovation through an increase in labor supply in the high-income country. Given that the market equilibrium is usually inefficient due to R&D externalities, the wealth redistribution {{may lead to a}} Pareto improvement, which occurs if the discount rate is sufficiently low or R&D productivity is sufficiently high...|$|R

25|$|Since TRIPS {{came into}} force, {{it has been}} subject to {{criticism}} from developing countries, academics, and non-governmental organizations. Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of artificial scarcity on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism {{has focused on the}} failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to <b>low-income</b> <b>countries,</b> a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to <b>low-income</b> <b>countries,</b> though it may have done so for middle-income countries. Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market. In particular, the illegality of pre-clinical trials or submission of samples for approval until a patent expires have been blamed for driving the growth of a few multinationals, rather than developing country producers.|$|E
