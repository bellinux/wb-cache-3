The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the factors influencing the distribution of a lipid-soluble antioxidant, δ-tocopherol, between the membranes and triacylglycerol fractions of a cod muscle-canola oil system. The membrane and triacylglycerol fractions were separated physically by centrifugation and analyzed for their δ-tocopherol content using HPLC. Chemical and sensory studies were used to follow oxidative stability. ^ Addition of ethanolic-δ-tocopherol to the muscle before the triacylglycerol incorporated more tocopherol into the membranes and increased the oxidative stability than the reverse order of addition. When triacylglycerol was solid, the amount of tocopherol incorporated into the membranes was higher than if the triacylglycerol was liquid, and the amount of tocopherol incorporated into the membranes was less dependent on the order of tocopherol and triacylglycerol addition. Some of the tocopherol did not enter either the membrane lipid or triacylglycerol phases. ^ The dielectric constant of the antioxidant carrier solvent for the optimum incorporation of δ-tocopherol into muscle membranes when the tocopherol was added before the oil was approximately 21 – 24. This value shifted to 27 when oil was present in the system before antioxidant addition. Tocopherol concentration in the oil fraction decreased continuously with an increase of dielectric constant of the carrier solvent from 17 to 32 when the antioxidant was added before the oil. When oil was added first, no change in tocopherol concentration of the oil fraction was observed except at a dielectric constant of 32 (propylene glycol). The uptake of tocopherol was low in both the oil and membrane fractions when the carrier was propylene glycol. ^ In herring muscle and a <b>lean</b> muscle-canola <b>oil</b> model system, hydrophilic antioxidants such as propyl gallate and TBHQ were more effective than lipophilic antioxidants such as δ-tocopherol and BHT, in increasing the oxidative stability.

The literature study includes historic background of Lean, Lean principles, Lean tools, and a presentation of Lean implementation with some potential challenges. This can be found in section 2. 1. Lean has traditionally been applied to typical, repetitive production systems, while this thesis focus on how Lean can be used in other contexts. How Lean has been used in projects and project management is the example which is presented in this thesis in section 2. 2. The presentation of Lean in projects is done through comparison of traditional project management and Lean project management, where a few examples have been included to illustrate the effects of Lean.

40|$|Our civilization, {{dependent}} on fossil fuels, has a peculiarity, namely a centralized and deterministic {{character of the}} energy system. The highly centralized nature means the overall energy control in {{a small number of}} institutions, of which depends the welfare of much of humankind. The commitment of many scientists and engineers and many other people and institutions in the world, is by the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier (Raimund Bleischwitz, 2009), resulting in what has been termed as The Hydrogen Economy. Hydrogen is a fuel that does not pollute and can be found potentially everywhere. However, it is rarely found in nature Free State, so it must be produced. The various forms of producing, which although may involve the use of energy from <b>oil,</b> <b>lean</b> towards the use of renewable energies, such as photovoltaic, wind, hydro and geothermal. These energies can generate the electricity consumed to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in the electrolysis process. But the most interesting aspect of hydrogen is a new economy less centralized, more self-sufficient, and linked to the consumer (Suzanne Shaw, 2009). Distributed generation refers to a set of small power plants, located close to the end user, or just in the same location, and it may well be integrated into a network or operate autonomously. Users can be factories, commercial enterprises, public buildings or private residences neighbourhoods. These small power plants have been called "Microgrids". Microgrids have gained great reputation recently, nations are making decisions towards a new electrical system while the old centralized system is being abandoned in favour of a new one, more sophisticated, efficient and environmentally friendly. Therefore, the energy system is facing a major transformation. This document reflects the initiative of contribution to the development of hydrogen technology in the field of hydrogen-based microgrid control systems. The implementation of such complex systems such as microgrids, drove to find out improved control systems for efficiently and safely handle these microgrids. This thesis is about microgrid control system, covering both theoretical and experimental study from simple strategies to the more complex. In addition, this thesis presents a new approach in microgrid control applying the Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology. In order to reach the mentioned objectives, in this thesis we have started from a detailed study of these systems. The first section, Chapters 1 to 3, review {{the state of the art}} of energy storage systems, integrated system types, configurations and existing control strategies. One chapter was devoted to the description of the experimental test bench, including tests performed for the component characterization. For the control system study and design it was necessary to obtain suitable models. Modelling and validation tasks are framed in a second block (Chapter 4 and 7) which develops a complete control oriented model. In this model, most relevant dynamics were implemented, covering the gap in the literature. The models were validated experimentally with good results. Additionally, chapter 7 attends to apply the proposed modelling methodology to a real operational plant: "The Hydrogen Office" located in UK. A plant model was obtained using the same methodology applied to laboratory scale. The models were experimentally validated with data gathered from real operating conditions. The validation results show a very good fit with model predictions. This chapter demonstrated that the modelling methodology, which is the basis of the theoretical and experimental study of the MPC and operation modes, is a valid approach. The last block of the thesis is dedicated to the theoretical and experimental study of operation modes (Chapter 5) and MPC strategies (Chapter 6). The design, simulation and implementation is showed along with experimental results. The plant operation obtained in the laboratory showed a good system performance, depending on the control strategy used, in concordance with the theoretical results obtained formerly. MPC control achieved smooth operation along high efficiency. In contrast, operation modes got different results in terms of efficiency and cost depending on the operation mode used. Finally a benchmark between classical control (heuristic hysteresis band) and MPC is presented. The MPC achieved outstanding results, especially in economic cost, in comparison with non-optimization strategies despite slightly neglecting the system efficiency. This contrast is discussed extensively in the thesis and finally some future work is proposed...|$|R

In view of this, based on an analysis of the problems in the coal chemical industry and the present coal utilization ways such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), this paper proposes that underground coal gasification (UCG) technology is a realistic choice. By virtue of its advantages in many aspects such as safety & environment, integrated use of superior resources, economic feasibility, etc. this technology can serve as the front-end support and guarantee for coal chemical industry and IGCC.

Yellow perch were also sampled from three lakes: Mildred Lake that receives water from the Athabasca River, Sucker Lake, at the edge of oil sands extraction activity, and Kimowin Lake, a distant reference site. Naphthenic acids were measured in perch muscle tissue using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Bile metabolites were measured by GC-MS techniques and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection at phenanthrene wavelengths. A method was developed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to evaluate naphthenic acids in bile. Tissue analysis did not show a pattern of naphthenic acids accumulation in muscle tissue consistent with known concentrations in exposed waters. Bile fluorescence and LC-HRMS methods were capable of statistically distinguishing samples originating from oil sands-influenced waters versus reference lakes. Although the GC-MS and HPLC fluorescence methods were correlated, there were no significant correlations of these methods and the LC-HRMS method. In yellow perch, naphthenic acids from oil sands sources do not concentrate in tissue at a measurable amount and are excreted through a biliary route.

40|$|Large above-grade {{overburden}} landforms {{comprised of}} low-grade <b>lean</b> <b>oil</b> sands (LOS) are amassed during the surface mining of oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada. Reclamation soil covers consisting of locally-salvaged soils are subsequently placed above the LOS landforms in single and multi-layered configurations. The soil covers {{are intended to}} 1) provide sufficient pore-gas O 2 to facilitate the growth of native boreal forest vegetation and to 2) oxidize methane (CH 4) produced in the anaerobic zones of the LOS before being exhausted to the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Prior to covering the LOS with soil covers, rates of CO 2 efflux {{from the surface of}} the LOS to the atmosphere ranged from 0. 1 - 7. 1 kg/m 2 /a. Pore-gas concentrations within the uncovered LOS ranged from 0 - 18 % for oxygen (O 2), 3 - 21 % for carbon dioxide (CO 2), and 0 - 12 % for CH 4. Following placement of soil covers, peak rates of CO 2 efflux were 2. 3 kg/m 2 /a {{from the surface of the}} soil covers to the atmosphere and 1. 8 kg/m 2 /a from the LOS into the soil covers. Peak rates of O 2 influx from the atmosphere through the soil covers was 18 kg/m 2 /a. Pore-gasses within the overlying soil covers and uppermost LOS were typically below the threshold that poses a risk to the survivability of reclamation vegetation, > 10 % O 2 and 16 %. Rates of CH 4 oxidation were quantified in batch soil column experiments for the soil cover materials and LOS in single and multi-layered configurations. Oxidation rates were sensitive to variations in temperature, moisture content, and bulk density. The results of the column experiments indicate that CH 4 generated deeper than 2 m within the LOS landform will be partially oxidized in both the soil covers and uppermost LOS horizon. Statistical analyses and finite difference numerical modelling were conducted to guide mine operators regarding practical issues involving the construction of LOS landforms, design of soil cover systems, and management of reclamation sites. Based on these exercises, it appears that the characteristics of the LOS landform are more important to pore-gas dynamics than the design of the soil cover systems...|$|E
40|$|The Aurora Soil Capping study, {{located in}} {{northern}} Alberta, was constructed to evaluate reclamation practices on <b>lean</b> <b>oil</b> sands dumps. The challenges relating to its success includes determining the appropriate soil cover design(s) for the coarse textured reclamation soil, while utilizing available salvaged natural soils, {{some of which}} contain residual bitumen {{in the form of}} aggregate oil sand material (AOSM). Limited research on this material raises key questions as to the impact it will play on transport and retention processes, along with potential contamination from hydrocarbon leaching. The research conducted sought to answer these questions. This thesis describes laboratory studies conducted on four soils; the upper organic LFH layer, Bm, BC and subsoil material while varying the amount of AOSM and implementing layering schemes. Material characterization through organic carbon and particle size analysis as well as hydrophobicity studies on AOSM through contact angle analysis were performed. A tension table and pressure plates, along with columns equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry probes, were used for water retention studies. Hydraulic conductivity was measured through constant head methods. To address hydrocarbon leaching concerns, chloride tracer studies were performed and the column outflow was analyzed using Gas Chromatography to detect the hydrocarbon type and concentration. Results from water retention and hydraulic conductivity studies indicated that although the AOSM was hydrophobic, its placement at varying concentrations and forms did not create consistent significant differences in the amount of moisture retained or transported. Results from the column studies showed that under steady state and transient conditions AOSM could result in decreasing infiltration rates and increasing chloride retention. The integration of soil layers further slowed the infiltration rate and delayed chloride transport. Under saturated conditions the presence of higher concentrations of AOSM appeared to increase the rate of water movement. Although these differences were minimal, further studies are required to explore this behavior. Overall, it can be concluded that with appropriate material placement, the addition of layering schemes and hydrocarbon material, the potential exists to increase soil water content in the upper layers of the soil, thereby increasing soil water storage for plant use...|$|E
