5000|$|Similarly, the two {{witnesses}} {{have been identified}} as Israel and the Christian Church. The number two has been associated with the witness of Israel to the Gentile nations during the 70th Week of Daniel's prophecy. The olive tree in the Scripture signifies Israel. The [...] "witness of the Church" [...] is signified by the two <b>lampstands,</b> whose identity was disclosed by the seven golden <b>lampstands</b> (i.e., candlesticks) revealed in Revelation 2-3 as the [...] "churches."

25|$|In the Orthodox Church {{the use of}} the menorah {{has been}} preserved, always {{standing}} on or behind the altar in the sanctuary. Though candles may be used, the traditional practice is to use olive oil in the seven-lamp <b>lampstand.</b> There are varying liturgical practices, and usually all seven lamps are lit for the services, though sometimes only the three centermost are lit for the lesser services. If the church does not have a sanctuary lamp the centermost lamp of the seven lamps may remain lit as an eternal flame.|$|E
25|$|At the {{breaking}} of camp, Aaron and his sons were to take down the Ark, the table of display, the <b>lampstand,</b> and the service vessels, and cover them all with cloths and skins. Only when Aaron and his sons had finished covering the sacred objects would the Kohathites come and lift them. Aaron's son Eleazar had responsibility for the lighting oil, the aromatic incense, the regular meal offering, the anointing oil, and all the consecrated things in the Tabernacle. God charged Moses and Aaron to {{take care not to}} let the Kohathites die because they went inside and witnessed the dismantling of the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|In Taoism, the Seven-Star Lamp qi xing deng 七星燈 is a seven-lamp {{oil lamp}} lit to {{represent}} the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. This <b>lampstand</b> is a requirement for all Taoist temples, never to be extinguished. In the first 9 days of the lunar 9th month festival, an oil lamp of nine connected lamps may also be lit to honour both the Northern Dipper and two other assistant stars (collectively known as the Nine Emperor Stars), sons of Dou Mu appointed by the Taoist Trinity (the Three Pure Ones) to hold the Books of Life and Death of humanity. The lamps represent the illumination of the 7 stars, and lighting them are believed to absolve sins while prolonging one's lifespan.|$|E
