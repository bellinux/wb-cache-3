25|$|Model tests {{conducted}} by MARC in 1994 {{showed that a}} double acting ship equipped with an Azipod propulsion unit could break through ice ridges in continuous motion instead of ramming like conventional icebreakers. It also required less power for running in <b>level</b> <b>ice</b> than traditional designs, resulting in 40–50% reduction in ice resistance due to lubricating effect of propeller-induced water flow, more open stern design and the propellers being allowed to mill (crush) the ice. The icebreaking capability of an Azipod-equipped icebreaker operating astern in <b>level</b> <b>ice</b> was also found out to be superior to traditional icebreakers regardless of propulsion arrangement.|$|E

25|$|Glaciers move, or flow, {{downhill}} due {{to gravity}} and the internal deformation of ice. Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50m (160ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50m causes plastic flow. At the molecular <b>level,</b> <b>ice</b> consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} is classified by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1, Pusher/Barge Unit, Ice IA+. It {{has the highest}} Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, which means that {{it is designed to}} operate in difficult ice conditions mainly without icebreaker assistance. Thanks to the icebreaker bow and sloping sides, the combination could operate independently in <b>level</b> <b>ice.</b> When the Finnpusku system entered service in the mid-1980s, its icegoing capability was superior to most conventional bulk carriers.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve these}} {{problems}} Kværner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre developed a new 100,000 DWT Aframax tanker concept together with Fortum Shipping, which ordered two vessels from Sumitomo Heavy Industries in 2001. The new ships were designed to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, and {{to be capable of}} operating in all ice conditions encountered in the Baltic Sea. The possibility to operate in the Pechora Sea was also taken into account in the design process.

Even though the ships were originally designed with icebreaking capability in mind, after the conversion ice resistance in <b>level</b> <b>ice</b> when running astern was only 40% of that when breaking ice ahead despite the ships being equipped with an icebreaking bow and not designed to break ice astern.|$|E
