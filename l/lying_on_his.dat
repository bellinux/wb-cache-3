5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued {{after the birth of}} his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2â€“0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service {{and return to}} Winchester in 1779, White studied jurisprudence under his uncle, Alexander White, {{one of the most}} preeminent lawyers practicing in the Shenandoah Valley. During the course of his four years of law studies, White read the legal treatises of William Blackstone and Edward Coke among others while <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back or propped up on a couch recovering from his injuries. White was admitted to practice law at Winchester in December 1782, after which he engaged in the practice of law for eleven years.|$|E

5|$|The next match {{featured}} Chris Benoit {{defending the}} United States Championship against Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero). Before {{the bell rang}} to start the match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by delivering a clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot {{on top of the}} bottom rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach, Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found {{the doors to the}} state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sick bed, Goebel took the oath of office.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies {{spent the better part}} of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November with a plan to sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hotel bed recuperating.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play). The scene then shifts to Key in another dimension, ending {{up next to the}} wife of another man. The man notices Key, and he runs away from the man. Hiding in the bathroom, Key escapes through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|Drilling of {{the rescue}} tunnel {{commenced}} on Thursday 4 May at about 8 p.m. guided by the completed pilot hole. It was gouged out to one metre and was planned to come up underneath the men's cage after passing through 16 metres of rock. The last phase was to involve a miner using hand tools to create an opening whilst <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back.|$|E

25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who {{was also one of the}} finest fielders of his generation.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the latest}} Swango {{incident}} {{took place at}} a Veterans Affairs facility, federal authorities got involved. Swango dropped out of sight until mid-1994, when the FBI {{found out he was}} living in Atlanta and working as a chemist at a computer equipment company's wastewater facility. Soon after the FBI alerted the company, Swango was fired for <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> job application. The FBI obtained a warrant charging Swango with using fraudulent credentials to gain entry to a Veterans Affairs hospital.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery Meigs later had his son's body {{moved to}} Arlington National Cemetery, where it rests in a tomb {{next to his}} own and many others of the Meigs family.

25|$|During the film's production, Argento became {{stricken}} {{with a severe}} case of hepatitis---and had to direct some sequences while <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back. At one point, the illness became so painful that he was bedridden for a few days; filming was then restricted to second unit work, some of which was done by Mario Bava. Argento has called Inferno one of his least favorite of all his films...as his memories of the movie are tainted by his recollection of the painful illness he suffered.|$|E
25|$|When {{a patient}} in Somerset died of low blood sugar in October 2003, the medical center alerted state authorities. That patient was Cullen's final victim. State {{officials}} castigated the hospital for failing to report a nonfatal insulin overdose, administered by Cullen, in August. An investigation into Cullen's employment history revealed past suspicions about his involvement with prior deaths. Somerset Medical Center fired Cullen on October 31, 2003, ostensibly for <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> job application. Fellow nurse Amy Loughren alerted the police after becoming alarmed about Cullen's records of accessing drugs and links to patient deaths. Police kept him under surveillance for several weeks, until they had finished their investigation.|$|E
25|$|During their meeting, {{the deputy}} {{leader of the}} expedition, Xu Jing, spontaneously blurted out that on his descent from the First Step, he {{recalled}} having spotted a dead climber <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, feet facing uphill, in a hollow or slot in the rock. Since no one other than Mallory and Irvine had ever been lost {{on the north side}} of Everest before 1960, and Mallory had been found much lower down, it was almost a certainty that Xu had discovered Irvine. However, the sighting was brief, and Xu was in desperate straits during the descent, and while he clearly remembered seeing the body, he was unclear about where it was.|$|E
