25|$|Before the war Paraguay had {{experienced}} rapid {{economic and military}} growth {{as a result of}} its protectionist policies which had boosted the local industry (much to the detriment of British imports). A strong military was developed because Paraguay's larger neighbors Argentina and Brazil had territorial claims against it and wanted to dominate it politically much <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in Uruguay. Paraguay had recurring boundary disputes and tariff issues with Argentina and Brazil for many years during the rule of Carlos Antonio López.|$|E

Until 1990 they practised pottery in small scale, producing a small kind of pot to take with them on their travels and a second, bigger kind, to leave as supplies in their key camping sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. When {{they do not have}} matches or lighters, they use special wood (Pausandra trianae) to produce fire. At present time they do not make mirrors with the resin of Trattinickia glaziovii nor stone axes <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in past times.|$|E
25|$|In any case, the {{translation}} of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the cuneiform script, the language, and the procedures, so {{it seems likely that}} it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the Metonic cycle <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> later), but started a new month based on observations of the New Moon. This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events.|$|E
25|$|Gray Davis critics often {{charge that}} he did not respond {{properly}} to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis' energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis {{is considered one of the}} major factors that led to Davis' recall.|$|E

25|$|The rivalry {{began with}} the teams' first meeting in 1991, with annual {{meetings}} beginning in 2005 when the Knights entered C-USA. Playing in the same division East Carolina and UCF were permanent opponents under the conference's scheduling structure. In recent years, the match between UCF and East Carolina has determined {{the winner of the}} Eastern Division. In 2007, UCF's only conference loss came {{at the hands of the}} Pirates. UCF won the division anyway, and ultimately took the conference title. In 2008, UCF was looking like they were going to ruin East Carolina's dreams of the Eastern Division title <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> to Marshall, but with a late rally, the Pirates won in overtime making the Pirates the first C-USA team to beat UCF in Spectrum Stadium. A loss at East Carolina also determined them as the Eastern Division champions in 2009, while a UCF win at home was the difference in 2010. In the final scheduled meeting of the two schools in 2012, it would be UCF that would win 40–20, despite falling behind 14–0 early on. As of now, the final count in the series in 9–4 in favor of East Carolina. The rivalry resumed when the Pirates joined UCF in the American Athletic Conference in 2014. UCF won as time expired on a 51-yard Hail Mary pass from Justin Holman to Breshad Perriman, 32–30. This allowed for them to win back to back conference championships. ECU would blow out a winless UCF team the next year, 44-7. One year later, UCF would beat ECU 47-29 under first-year head coach, Scott Frost, against ECU's first-year head coach, Scottie Montgomery.|$|E
500|$|Intending {{to release}} an album in late 1986, U2 {{set up a}} studio in January of that year in Danesmoate House, a Georgian house in Rathfarnham, Ireland, {{in the foothills of}} the Wicklow Mountains. The Edge had viewed the {{residence}} months prior while househunting with his wife, and convinced the owner to rent it to the band. Their plan was to find inspiration from the converted recording space and use it to musically create atmosphere, much <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with Slane Castle for The Unforgettable Fire sessions in 1984.|$|E

Dixon wanted the guitars to sound more <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in concert, but at first met resistance from both the band and the label.

Instead, the 2010 film is more of a reimagining. The pair also explained that A Nightmare on Elm Street would have a different tone than the Friday the 13th remake. Form states, [...] "I think a Friday the 13th movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and I think a Nightmare movie is not that." ...|$|E

These three tracks were originally intended for Weaver's next album Smoke Some Kill. Weaver was upset after finding these new tracks added to the album, stating that [...] "it was a total scam to reissue Saturday Night <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> with those tracks, because it had already sold {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies." [...] and that if these tracks were released on Smoke Some Kill, his follow-up album would have [...] "been an even better record".|$|E

During development of Mass Effect 2, Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy.

BioWare executive producer Casey Hudson stated that [...] "Overlord" [...] was the [...] "biggest downloadable content pack yet" [...] and confirmed {{that they would not}} introduce more squad members to the game <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with previous packs. For the pack, the developers wanted to focus on exploration and vehicle platforming, similar to that found in Mass Effect 2s earlier downloadable content pack Firewalker. Since vehicle exploration was a feature of the original Mass Effect, Hudson called [...] "Overlord" [...] "a throwback to how some of the exploration worked in [...]" [...] The pack was released on June 15, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360.

500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> at Stax and Motown".|$|E
500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E

500|$|Final Symphony II {{features}} long arrangements {{like the}} Final Symphony concerts, from different games: {{while the first}} concert was based on Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X, the second uses pieces from Final Fantasy V, VIII, IX, and XIII. Like the first concert, all of the arrangements are new, and not based on any previous work. The majority of the music was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, while the Final Fantasy XIII suite was originally composed by Masashi Hamauzu. The arrangers from the first concert reprised their roles for the second: Valtonen created the arrangements for the Final Fantasy V section, Wanamo worked on the VIII and IX portions, and Hamauzu, with assistance from Valtonen, arranged Hamauzu's own compositions from XIII with orchestration by Valtonen. <b>Like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> for the previous concert, when Merregnon Studios first began the project, Böcker, Valtonen, and Wanamo took {{a few months to}} play through the games, watch playthrough videos, and read reviews and analyses of the games, {{in order to understand the}} structure and progression of the main themes of the music in each game. An introductory fanfare, [...] "In a Roundabout Way", was composed by Valtonen for the concert. Unlike Final Symphony, which featured three styles of orchestral performances—a piano concerto, a symphonic poem, and a three-movement symphony—all four arrangements are single-section arrangements, with the IX portion as a piano concerto.|$|E
500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have to second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they {{wanted to make sure that}} clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have." ...|$|E

Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) reassure her that they’ll want her to move on, just <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with their first spouses’ death. They both indeed support her to find love again with Sam. He officiates the wedding, which much to his surprise, his son is also getting married. He is in the flashback episode [...] "2009", which is set during the same time period as the show's pilot episode. Burt is contacted by McKinley High counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) to tell him that Kurt seemed to be isolated and had shown interest in a pamphlet on suicide. Burt tells Kurt that he must join a school team within a week, or face punishment. Although Burt had meant a sports team, when Kurt enthusiastically tells Burt that he has join the glee club, he accepts this as an adequate substitute in part due to its competitive aspect. In the show's final episode, [...] "Dreams Come True", Burt and Carole attend the rededication ceremony of the McKinley High auditorium in the year 2020, when it is renamed the [...] "Finn Hudson Memorial Auditorium".
