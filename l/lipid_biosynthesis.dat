5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in <b>lipid</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> such as phosphatidylserine synthase on the ER face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But mitochondria {{are not only}} a destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle also {{plays a role in}} inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether <b>lipid</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lipid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> also {{occurs in}} the intraradical mycelium. Lipids are then stored or {{exported}} to extraradical hyphae where they may be stored or metabolized.

Approximately 25% of the carbon translocated from the plant to the fungi is stored in the extraradical hyphae. Up to 20% of the host plant's carbon may {{be transferred to the}} AM fungi.

25|$|Biological {{deuterium}} fractionation through metabolism is very organism and pathway dependent, {{resulting in}} a wide variability in fractionations. Despite this, some trends still hold. Hydrogen isotopes tend to fractionate very strongly in autotrophs relative to heterotrophs during <b>lipid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> - chemoautotrophs produce extremely depleted lipids, with the fractionation ranging from roughly -200 to -400‰. This has been observed both in laboratory-grown cultures fed a known quantity of deuterated water and in the environment. Proteins, however, do not follow as significant a trend, with both heterotrophs and autotrophs capable of generating large and variable fractionations. In part, kinetic fractionation of the lighter isotope during formation of reducing equivalents NADH and NADPH result in lipids and proteins that are isotopically lighter.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} isotope {{composition of}} leaf waxes {{can be summarized}} as the δD of rain water, with three main fractionation steps- evaporation from soil water, transpiration from leaf water, and <b>lipid</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> which can be combined and measured as the net fractionation, or εl/w. With the application of ever-improving measurement techniques for single molecules, and correlation with other independent proxies in the geological record that can help constrain some variables, investigating the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes can be extremely productive. Leaf wax δD data has been successfully applied to improving our understanding of climate driven changes in terrestrial hydrology, by demonstrating that ocean circulation and surface temperature {{have a significant effect}} on continental precipitation. Leaf wax δD values have also been used as records of paleoaltimetry to reconstruct the elevation gradients in ancient mountain ranges based on the effect of altitude on rain water δD.|$|E
25|$|The main {{water source}} for {{terrestrial}} plants is soil water, which largely resembles the hydrogen isotope composition of rain water, but varies between environments and with enrichment by precipitation, depletion by evaporation, and exchange with atmospheric water vapor. There {{can be a}} significant offset between the δD value of source water and the δD value of leaf water {{at the site of}} <b>lipid</b> <b>biosynthesis.</b> No fractionation is associated with water uptake by roots, a process usually driven by capillary tension, with the one exception of xerophytes that burn ATP to pump water in extremely arid environments (with a roughly 10‰ depletion). However, leaf water can be substantially enriched relative to soil water due to transpiration, an evaporative process which is influenced by temperature, humidity, and the composition of surrounding water vapor. The leaf water hydrogen isotope composition can be described with a modified Craig-Gordon model, where ΔDe is the steady state enrichment of leaf water, εeq is the temperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation between liquid water and vapor, εk is the kinetic isotope effect from diffusion between leaf internal air space and the atmosphere, ΔDv is the leaf/air disequilibrium, ea is atmospheric vapor pressure, and ei is internal leaf vapor pressure.|$|E
