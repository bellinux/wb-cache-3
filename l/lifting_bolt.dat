50|$|The Weatherby Mark V {{action has}} {{remained}} virtually unchanged {{from the original}} design of Fred Jennie and Roy Weatherby which {{is a testament to}} the longevity of the design. Nevertheless, some refinement to the design has occurred over time. The Mark V action is a front locking, push feed, bolt action repeater. The lug arrangement allows for 54° <b>bolt</b> <b>lift.</b> This shorter <b>bolt</b> <b>lift</b> allows for increased clearance between the bolt handle and any accessories such as scopes that may be mounted on the rifle and arguably provides for faster cycling of the action. This compares favorably with the Mauser style rifles which have a 90° <b>bolt</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
25|$|A bolt hold-open device {{locks the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by <b>lifting</b> the <b>bolt</b> catch lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated charging handle to rear a short distance.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{separately}} available accessory is {{the distinctive}} left-hand wood grip with accessory shoe. Many manufacturers offer accessory grip or [...] "action grips" [...] such as Kowa, Bronica, Mamiya and Hasselblad the Pentax grip is arguably an iconic accessory for the camera. It {{attaches to the}} two lugs/posts {{at the front of}} the camera and is secured by tightening a finger-operated bolt onto a stud found at center. The grip is removed by untightening and <b>lifting</b> the <b>bolt</b> to slide off in a downward direction to allow the lugs to clear the keyhole slots.|$|R
5000|$|A {{safe working}} load (SWL) should, {{according}} to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on {{the configuration of the}} equipment, accessories for lifting such as eye <b>bolts,</b> <b>lifting</b> magnets and lifting beams should also be marked. [...] The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely. Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.|$|R
40|$|The Disposable Solid Waste Cask (DSWC) is a {{shielded}} cask {{capable of}} transporting, storing, and disposing of six non-fuel core components or approximately 27 {{cubic feet of}} radioactive solid waste. Five existing DSWCs are candidates for use in storing and disposing of non-fuel core components and radioactive solid waste from the Interim Examination and Maintenance Cell, ultimately shipping them to the 200 West Area disposal site for burial. A series of inspections, studies, analyses, and modifications were performed to ensure that these casks {{can be used to}} safely ship solid waste. These inspections, studies, analyses, and modifications are summarized and attached in this report. Visual inspection of the casks interiors provided information with respect to condition of the casks inner liners. Because water was allowed to enter the casks for varying lengths of time, condition of the cask liner pipe to bottom plate weld was of concern. Based on the visual inspection and a corrosion study, it was concluded that four of the five casks can be used from a corrosion standpoint. Only DSWC S/N- 004 would need additional inspection and analysis to determine its usefulness. The five remaining DSWCs underwent some modification to prepare them for use. The existing cask lifting inserts were found to be corroded and deemed unusable. New <b>lifting</b> anchor <b>bolts</b> were installed to replace the existing anchors. Alternate lift lugs were fabricated for use with the new <b>lifting</b> anchor <b>bolts.</b> The cask tiedown frame was modified to facilitate adjustment of the cask tiedowns. As a result of the above mentioned inspections, studies, analysis, and modifications, four of the five existing casks can be used to store and transport waste from the Interim Examination and Maintenance Cell to the disposal site for burial. The fifth cask, DSWC S/N- 004, would require further inspections before it could be used...|$|R
50|$|MJTs are a {{relatively}} safe bolting method because only small hand or air tools {{are required for}} tightening. Other methods, including thermal tightening, crane wrenching, hydraulic wrenches and sledgehammers, can cause serious worker injuries due to heat, electricity, highly pressurized hydraulic fluid and brute force. Back and other injuries can also be avoided because no heavy tightening equipment needs to be <b>lifted</b> onto the <b>bolt.</b> Safety is also increased because MJTs prevent parts from becoming loose.|$|R
50|$|Weatherby's first {{break with}} Mauser actions came in 1956 when he {{commissioned}} the Danish firm of Schultz & Larsen to build 378 Weatherby Magnums utilizing their Model 54 bolt action. This action was very stout and featured four rear locking lugs. Many of its features (such as the low <b>bolt</b> <b>lift</b> and triple gas escape ports in the bolt) would {{find their way}} into Weatherby's proprietary bolt action, which would make its debut two years later.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Mauser, the <b>bolt</b> <b>lift</b> arc on the Mosin-Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the Lee-Enfield. The Mauser {{bolt handle}} {{is at the}} rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid rear {{receiver}} ring. The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the Mannlicher: It is attached to a protrusion on the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the ejection/loading port in front of a split rear receiver ring, also serving a similar function to Mauser's [...] "third" [...] or [...] "safety" [...] lug.|$|R
50|$|The SKS has a {{conventional}} layout, {{with a wooden}} stock and rifle grip. It is a gas-operated rifle that has a spring-loaded bolt carrier and a gas piston rod that work to unlock and cycle the action via gas pressure exerting pressure against them. The bolt is locked to contain the pressure of ignition {{at the moment of}} firing by tilting downwards at its rear and being held by a lug pressed into the receiver. At the moment of firing, the bolt carrier is pushed rearwards, which causes it to <b>lift</b> the <b>bolt,</b> unlocking it, and allowing it to be carried rearwards against a spring. This allows the fired case to be ejected and a new round from the magazine to be carried into the chamber. The SKS represents an intermediate step in the process towards the development of true assault rifles, being shorter and less powerful than the semi-automatic rifles that preceded it, such as the Soviet SVT-40, but being longer (10 cm or 4in) than AK-series rifles which replaced it. As a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity than those arms that replaced it.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1889 was {{the first}} in the series of Schmidt-Rubin rifles which served Switzerland from 1889 to 1953. The rifle takes its name from the {{designer}} of its action, Colonel Rudolf Schmidt, and the designer of its ammunition, Colonel Eduard Rubin. Production of the rifle began in 1891. The straight-pull bolt action allows the user to pull the bolt straight back to unlock the action and eject the spent cartridge in one motion, and push the bolt forward to chamber a round, cock the striker, and lock the action. This is as opposed to a traditional bolt action, wherein the user must <b>lift</b> the <b>bolt</b> handle to unlock the action before pulling the bolt back. The rifle is roughly musket length with a free-floating barrel, 12-round magazine and wood stock that extends almost to the tip of the barrel. The Schmidt-Rubin 1889 was an advanced weapon for its time.The Schmidt-Rubin 1889 {{was one of the first}} rifles to use copper-jacketed ammunition as its standard ammunition. The GP90 7.5×53.5mm round designed by Col. Rubin in 1882 was revolutionary in that most of the bullets used in Europe at the time, except for the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle metal-jacketed 8mm bullet, were around [...]45 inches as opposed to the [...]308 inches of the Schmidt-Rubin ammunition. Strangely enough the round was [...] "paper patched" [...] meaning that the bullet was surrounded by a piece of paper, much like the cotton patches placed around a musket ball. Paper patching the round was supposed to aid in the lubrication of the bullet. In 1923, long after the discontinuation of the Model 1889, the GP90/23 7.5×53.5mm round was produced without the paper patching. The Model 1889 was eventually replaced by its successor models including the Model 1896, Model 96/11, Model 1911, Model 1911 carbine and the famous K-31.|$|R
