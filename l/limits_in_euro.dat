40|$|CO, NOx, HC and Particle mass {{have been}} {{monitored}} in different vehicle emission standards and Particle number (PN) {{has been added}} to standards recently. The EU has proposed a solid particle PN <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> <b>Euro</b> 5 b and Euro 6. The PN limit for low duty vehicles (LDVs) is set to be 6. 0 × 1011 (#/km).  Within the recent decades of the European Union, there has been an overall reduction in emissions of air pollutants. It can however be reported that emissions of diesel engines that are measured within laboratory conditions are different from what is happening in real world driving condition. To combat this issue, a more realistic measurement method called Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) is recommended. There are very low amounts of real world emission data from PEMS for passenger cars [1]. Also, the available reports mostly concentrated on gaseous emissions such as NOx [2] and particle emissions from diesel passenger cars in real world is rarely studied. The aim of this research is to study particle numbers from diesel vehicles during the real world driving and compare it with recently introduced Euro 6 particle number limit. SAS regression tool was utilised to present trends within the vehicle speed and the particle number, while presenting interesting data on vehicle operation habits for speed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} euro preparations by U. K. SMEs with trading {{links with}} the euro currency area. It suggests, notwithstanding the U. K. 's decision not to join the <b>euro</b> <b>in</b> the first wave, that SMEs with euro area trade links are particularly likely to have had to make some adjustments for {{the introduction of the}} euro. The paper assesses this level of preparation and seeks to understand if it is contingent upon the characteristics of the business, its geographic location, its business orientation and the type of trade link (e. g. importer/exporter). The paper finds, contrary to previous research, that business characteristics, geographic location and business orientation are, on the whole, of <b>limited</b> value <b>in</b> explaining <b>euro</b> preparation. What, instead, seems more significant is the type of link with the euro area: importers, exporters and those with subsidiary businesses <b>in</b> the <b>euro</b> area appear more likely to have made preparations for the euro than U.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} recent key {{developments in}} euro-area government bond markets and their main implications for central banks and for market functioning. The {{introduction of the}} euro is found to have significantly affected the relative pricing of securities. The spreads over German bonds of previously high-yield debt have narrowed significantly whereas the spreads of all other euro-area sovereign debt have widened following the {{introduction of the euro}}. Market microstructure factors, such as relative market liquidity and the cheapest-to-deliver status of bonds, are also found to play a part in determining relative prices in addition to differences in credit risk. Finally, the evidence suggests that the reduction in the relative supply of government bonds has hitherto had a <b>limited</b> effect <b>in</b> the <b>euro</b> area, <b>in</b> contrast to the evidence in the US market. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the gaseous exhaust emissions along with {{an analysis of the}} size and mass distribution of particulate matter from a Euro V compliant road tractor. The vehicle was fitted with an engine of the displacement of 15, 6 dm 3, maximum power output 412 kW generating a maximum torque of 2700 Nm (1991 lb/ft). For the tests the authors used portable exhaust emission analyzers (PEMS: SEMTECH DS and AVL Micro Soot Sensor. The measurements were conducted under actual operating conditions in traffic typical of long distance European haulage. The analysis of the obtained results was divided into two parts. The first part was related to the assessment of the influence of the traffic conditions on the exhaust emissions and gas mileage. The second part was related to the assessment of the influence of the engine operating conditions on the said exhaust emissions. The obtained exhaust emission results were compared to the emission <b>limits</b> specified <b>in</b> the <b>Euro</b> 5 standard...|$|R

Frank de Boer had both a penalty kick and shootout kick saved by Toldo, who also saved from Paul Bosvelt to give Italy a 3-1 shootout victory.
