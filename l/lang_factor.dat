A simplified procedure for rapid ball-park cost estimate that {{can be used as a}} research tool by energy policy makers for targeting area of cost reduction in a project, for comparing alternative design and for reviewing achieved costs on completed projects is described. In this study, an operating, commercial scale fuel-ethanol plant annexed to a sugar industry and based on molasses in a poorly accessible rural and landlocked African country was used to determine the cost structure. Analysis of the breakdown of the fixed capital investment (FCI) cost, based on the principle of factorial method of capital cost estimation and using <b>Lang</b> <b>factor</b> (fL) analysis was used to create an econometric model for calculating FCI cost.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{greenhouse}} gas emissions (GHG) contribute to global warming, and must be mitigated. With GHG mitigation as an overarching goal, this research aims to study the potential for newfound and abundant sources of natural gas {{to play a role}} as part of a GHG mitigation strategy. However, recent work suggests that methane leakage in the current natural gas system may inhibit end-use natural gas as a robust mitigation strategy, but that natural gas as a feedstock for other forms of energy, such as electricity generation or liquid fuels, may support natural-gas based mitigation efforts. Flaring of uneconomic natural gas, or outright loss of natural gas to the atmosphere results in {{greenhouse gas}} emissions that could be avoided and which today are very large in aggregate. A central part {{of this study is to}} look at a new technology for converting natural gas into methanol at a unit scale that is matched to the size of individual natural gas wells. The goal is to convert stranded or otherwise flared natural gas into a commercially valuable product and thereby avoid any unnecessary emission to the atmosphere. A major part of this study is to contribute to the development of a novel approach for converting natural gas into methanol and to assess the environmental impact (for better or for worse) of this new technology. This Ph. D. research contributes to the development of such a system and provides a comprehensive techno-economic and environmental assessment of this technology. Recognizing the distributed nature of methane leakage associated with the natural gas system, this work is also intended to advance previous research at the Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy that aims to show that small, modular energy systems can be made economic. This thesis contributes to and analyzes the development of a small-scale gas-to-liquids (GTL) system aimed at addressing flared natural gas from gas and oil wells. This thesis includes system engineering around a design that converts natural gas to synthesis gas (syngas) in a reciprocating internal combustion engine and then converts the syngas into methanol in a small-scale reactor. With methanol as the product, this research aims to show that such a system can not only address current and future natural gas flaring regulation, but eventually can compete economically with historically large-scale, centralized methanol production infrastructure. If successful, such systems could contribute to a shift away from large, multi-billion dollar capital cost chemical plants towards smaller systems with shorter lifetimes that may decrease the time to transition to more sustainable forms of energy and chemical conversion technologies. This research also quantifies the potential for such a system to contribute to mitigating GHG emissions, not only by addressing flared gas in the near-term, but also supporting future natural gas infrastructure ideas that may help to redefine the way the current natural gas pipeline system is used. The introduction of new, small-scale, distributed energy and chemical conversion systems located closer to the point of extraction may contribute to reducing methane leakage throughout the natural gas distribution system by reducing the reliance and risks associated with the aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. The outcome of this thesis will result in several areas for future work. From an economic perspective, factors that contribute to overall system cost, such as operation and maintenance (O&M) and capital cost multiplier (referred to as the <b>Lang</b> <b>Factor</b> for large-scale petro-chemical plants), are not yet known for novel systems such as the technology presented here. From a technical perspective, commercialization of small-scale, distributed chemical conversion systems may create a demand for economical compression and air-separation technologies at this scale that do not currently exist. Further, new business cases may arise aimed at utilizing small, remote sources of methane, such as biogas from agricultural and municipal waste. Finally, while methanol was selected as the end-product for this thesis, future applications of this technology may consider methane conversion to hydrogen, ammonia, and ethylene for example, challenging the orthodoxy in the chemical industry that “bigger is better. ...|$|E

The aim {{of this research was}} to determine trends and changes of climate elements in the region of Mediterranean Croatia. Meteorological stations with the longest monitoring period in the region of the Mediterranean Croatia were chosen in order to determine trends of the climate elements. Decreasing or increasing trends of individual climate elements and indices were analysed using linear trend of regression analysis. Climate elements and indices of the referent line were compared with period between 1991 and 2010.

Results were used to design the equipment of a demonstration-sized plant (200 kg of fly ash/h). The process is based on hydrometallurgical operations: firstly a germanium extraction from fly ash by leaching and a consequent Ge separation from the other elements present in the solution by solvent extraction procedures. Based on the experimental results, mass balances and McCabe-Thiele diagrams were applied {{to determine the number}} of steps of the solvent extraction stage. Different arrangements have been studied and a countercurrent process with three steps in extraction and six steps in elution was defined. A residence time of 5 min was fixed in both the extraction and elution stages. Volumetric ratios in extraction and stripping were: aqueous phase/organic phase = 5 and organic phase/stripping phase = 5, so a concentration factor of 25 is achieved. Mixers and decanters were completely defined. The maximum extracted and eluted germanium was estimated and a global efficiency of 94 % was achieved.

Water resources and its quality are declining, {{and this is a}} severely limiting factor for both Danube Delta and the world, particularly with increasing aridity due to global warming predicted by some climate scenarios. Knowledge of aridity is also necessary to explain the characteristics of the geographical landscape for the rational use of water resources. Definition and characterization of aridity as intensity were done by several methods and indicators, starting with <b>Lang's</b> rain <b>factor</b> (1920), continuing with De Martonne’s aridity index (1926), Thornthwaite’s aridity index (1948), moisture deficit and ending with the UNESCO aridity index (1979).

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of using a waste heat stream from DSM for a District Heating System. A conceptual design was carried out with emphasis on the unit for upgrading the residual waste heat. Having reviewed heat pump technology, mechanical heat pump {{was found to be}} the best option for recovering the heat from the residual waste water. This heat pump (ammonia loop) combined with a natural gas fired heater will provide the districts with the required heat. The energy that can be extracted from the waste heat from DSM (100 TJ/annum) with a mechanical heat pump represents approximately 8 % of the required energy input of the total Upgrading Unit. Therefore, additional energy input will be provided by a gas fired heater as combustion, which will also serve as a back up system. Heat pump technology is a sustainable method of heating and district heating system using heat pumps is a proven and well-known technology. It is widely used in Europe, Canada and the USA. Currently there is a district heating system in Norway using ammonia in a mechanical heat pump, which includes one airport and adjacent residential buildings and the design of another facility in the future has been considered. Moreover, nowadays environmental concerns require that the flue-gas emissions resulting from the supply of energy to processes should be minimized. By using the mechanical heat pump for upgrading the heat in this specific design, 4 % emissions reduction will be achieved. The outputs of the design were established based on the required plant capacity and the results of the evaluation of the demand fluctuations and heat losses in the distribution system. Thus, the Upgrading Unit was designed for 923 Tera Joules per annum in order to compensate the heat losses in the pipeline network and supply the districts with a maximum annual demand of 780 Tera Joules. This capacity corresponds to approximately 11, 000 houses being supplied with heat. The Upgrading Unit will be located {{as close as possible to}} DSM site in Delft, The Netherlands. The configuration of the distribution system and pipeline lengths were estimated based on the districts listed in a previous feasibility study. The economical plant life was assumed to be at least 15 years, considering continuous operation 24 h/day, 365 days/year. The total investment is MUS$ 29. 3 and the production costs are MUS$ 20. 3. They were calculated with <b>Lang’s</b> <b>factored</b> estimation method aiming to achieve ± 25 % accuracy. As a result of the economic evaluation of this design, a negative cash flow of MU$ 6. 1 was found. The Upgrading Unit might be profitable if one considers the possibility of using it as a power station in addition to the normal function as a heat producing plant. Decreasing the number of connected districts or collecting more waste water or waste water with a higher energetic value would be another option. DelftChemTechApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{circumference}} increment of Norway spruce {{focused on the}} effect of inter-tree competition in the mature spruce stand was made at the study site of Rájec (Drahanská vrchovina Highland) over a  5 -year period. Data were collected from 49 trees, which were monitored continuously with mechanical band dendrometers from 2010 to 2014. The dependency of {{the circumference}} increment on competition index, diameter at breast height, <b>Lang's</b> rain <b>factor,</b> mean temperature of various periods and sum of precipitation of various periods was evaluated. Climatic conditions of the study site are characterised with warm and wet summers and cold-dry winters. In 5 years average around 61 % of the annual precipitation falls during growing season. There was highly significant correlation between relative increment and temperature (p= 2. 324 e- 13) and significant correlation between relative increment and precipitation (p= 0. 0439). The performed results confirmed that inter-tree competition and diameter at breast height are sufficient variables for circumference increment estimation of unmeasured trees in the particular year. Coefficient of determination reached 0. 25 - 0. 63 for competition and 0. 40 - 0. 84 for tree diameter at breast height. The present investigation brings important results about tree growth and seasonal growth dynamics and its relation with competition and microclimatic conditions in mature spruce stand. It is obvious that unsuitable climatic conditions for spruce can lead to stem shrinkage during growing season. Here we assume that these responses are caused mostly by water storage deficit in stem and this leads to decreasing of the tree vitality. Such phenomenon will have significantly negative ecological and economic consequences in expected climatic changes in the future...|$|R
30|$|Fungal mtDNA introns {{tend to be}} self-splicing {{elements}} that can catalyze their own excision from transcripts and depending on the excision mechanism, they have been divided into group I and group II introns (Saldanha et al. 1993; Lambowitz et al. 1999). Splicing of groups I (GI) and II (GII) introns tend to be facilitated {{by a combination of}} intron-encoded (maturases) or host genome-encoded <b>factors</b> (<b>Lang</b> et al. 2007; Hausner 2012). Some of these introns have the potential to be mobile due to the presence of intron-encoded proteins (IEPs) that promote the movement of their host introns from intron-containing alleles to cognate alleles that lack the intron (Dujon 1989). Homing endonucleases (HEs) are DNA-cutting enzymes encoded by homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) and these are frequently encountered as ORFs within GI introns and in some instances within GII introns (Toor and Zimmerly 2002; reviewed in Hafez and Hausner 2012). HEGs can also be freestanding, encoded within archaeal introns, and comprise the DNA-cutting component of inteins (Gimble 2000; Belfort et al. 2002; Stoddard 2005; Barzel et al. 2011). Currently, at least six families of HEs are recognized. Their naming is based on conserved amino acid motifs: the LAGLIDADG, H–N–H, His-Cys box, PD-(D/E)xK, EDxHD, and GIY-YIG families of HEs (Stoddard 2011, 2014).|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{outlines}} {{a framework}} for rapid capital and operating cost estimation of evolving biorefineries. The cost models are addressed to the biorefinery community and aim to assist chemists in selecting economically viable biorefinery routes and engineers in avoiding laborious flowsheeting with uncertain economic analyses at process conception. The models assist in early-stage decision making for budget allocation in a portfolio of different projects and estimation of budget overrun risks. Biorefineries are society’s alternative to fossil-based production and aim to produce bio-fuels and chemicals {{from a wide variety}} of biomass sources by optimising production and resources use. The emerging field of integrated biorefineries offers an abundance of possible products, technologies and production routes. The systematic screening of capital expenditure of each biorefinery pathway still relies on cost heuristics regressed from petrochemical processes under the assumption they could be applied to biorefineries. The thesis studies several established cost methods on biorefinery processes and concludes that most require a high level of process detail not suitable at the early R&D stage and at times, they produce questionable results. A cost estimating methodological framework is proposed to develop short-cut cost models and cost estimates for biorefineries. The framework sets the basis for the systematic cost modelling and estimating of biorefineries and is reproducible and extendable to other process groups. To address the uncertainty around the term “early-stage estimation”, technology development levels are benchmarked against cost estimation standards: Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 1 to 4 correspond to Class 5 cost estimates and Technology Readiness Level 5 corresponds to Class 4 cost estimates, each level requiring dedicated cost models within - 50 to + 100 % accuracy. Heuristic and reproducible cost models are developed for TRL 1 - 5 by mapping cost drivers from cost data inventories. The cost models produce probabilistic base estimates, i. e. point estimates that take into account the cost model’s uncertainty within 95 % certainty. The cost estimate is completed with uncertainty models that takes into account both statistical and technical challenges to produce a joint distribution of possible cost outcomes. The analysis is assisted by cost inventories that include commercial biorefinery costs gathered to that end. Three major biorefinery classes emerge from the data to classify biorefineries by type of employed technology: biochemical, chemical and thermochemical. Historical trends show that for the period 2000 – 2020, the US has been a pioneer in biorefineries construction (43 % of biorefineries), followed by France (9 %), Spain and Brazil (7 %), whereas bioethanol in the US and biodiesel in Europe dominate bio-production supported by favourable economic policies. At TRL 1, cost-capacity curves are developed for 11 biorefineries that allow estimation by power law relationships and statistical metrics to evaluate uncertainties within 95 % certainty range. New jobs vs capital cost curves are presented to estimate the social impact of future biorefineries in respect to job growth. The analysis shows that 1 st gen ethanol remains more cost-efficient than advanced biofuels, whereas synergies among existing plants can largely reduce capital costs. 2 nd gen ethanol biorefineries make the most positive impact by creating 1 new job per million euro invested. At TRL 2 - 3, biorefinery development is at a phase that allows application of the “Process Blocks Build-Up” estimating method; it is a modular approach which proposes probabilistic cost exponents and reference costs for segments found in 11 biorefinery types. The method addresses estimation of biorefineries beyond the state-of-the-art under the assumption that a new biorefinery is composed of blocks that resemble those found in state-of-the-art biorefineries. Differences in performance are accounted for with an efficiency factor for each block. Validation of the method shows it has an absolute average error of 27 %. At TRL 4, process development justifies a conceptual flow diagram and thus, the capital cost can be estimated from “Functional Unit” relationships, which postulate the capital cost as a function of the number of functional units and basic process parameters. The concept of the functional unit - established on petrochemical processes – is re-defined through examples to include unit operations commonly found in biorefineries. The percentage standard error of the estimate is used to model the 95 % certainty around the base estimate. Despite the advanced phase of development, the new correlations report an absolute average error of 50 %. The discrepancies are due to the uncertain and limited amount of data used in regression analysis. At TRL 5, installation <b>factors</b> (<b>Lang</b> <b>factors)</b> under uncertainty are proposed assuming the delivered equipment cost can be estimated. Factorial estimating is at the verge of early-estimating and reports an average absolute error of 12 %. The proposed installation factors (solid-fluid: 5. 9, fluid: 9. 5) are higher than the ones reported in common engineering handbooks, thus, confirming the research hypothesis that the offsites in biorefineries are capital intensive. The thesis introduces “Production cost estimating with uncertainty”, which assumes that the production cost elements can be expressed as a function of the raw materials, the utilities, the operating labour and the fixed capital investment and proposes modelling factors under uncertainty for each element. The cost models are validated across TRLs on two case studies; PHB from methane fermentation and FAME from in planta transesterification of castor seeds. The modular approach assists in estimating processes at low TRL based on little information and provides reasonable results. The short-cuts show good agreement with detailed techno-economic results from common engineering software (Aspen Process Economic Analyser). The cost models can be used interchangeably for rapid cost estimations and modelling work for various purposes...|$|R
