40|$|Nuclei and chromatins were {{isolated}} from the livers of egg-laying hens, roosters, and chicken embryos. The chromatin proteins were analyzed by urea-SDS gel electrophoresis. Major nonhistone proteins, NHP- 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, - 5, were rich in the liver chromatin of <b>laying</b> <b>hen.</b> Higher histone content {{was found in the}} rooster liver chromatin. The loss of H 1 histones during the preparation of <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> chromatin suggests the loosely binding of H 1 histone in the chromatin. A nonhistone protein, NHP- 1, was found only in the mature female and male chicken liver chromatins. This component was not detected in the embryonic liver chromatins and chicken erythrocyte chromatins. Occurrence of an another nonhistone protein, NHP- 2, was specific for <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> liver chromatin. NHP- 1 and NHP- 4 (HMG protein) were preferentially released from the chromatin by DNase I digestion. Cytoplasmic estrogen receptors were found in both <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> and rooster livers.

25|$|In organic {{egg-laying}} systems, chickens {{are also}} free-range. Organic systems {{are based upon}} restrictions on the routine use of synthetic yolk colourants, in-feed or in-water medications, other food additives and synthetic amino acids, and a lower stocking density and smaller group sizes. The Soil Association standards used to certify organic flocks in the UK, indicate a maximum outdoors stocking density of 1,000 birds per hectare and a maximum of 2,000 hens in each poultry house. In the UK, organic <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> are not routinely beak-trimmed.|$|E
25|$|Battery cages are the {{predominant}} form of housing for <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> worldwide; these cages reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, and increase rates of osteoporosis. In these systems and in free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled and killed at birth {{during the process}} of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens. It is estimated that an average consumer of eggs who eats 200 eggs per year for 70 years of his or her life is {{responsible for the deaths of}} 140 birds, and that an average consumer of milk who drinks 190kg per year for 70 years is responsible for the deaths of 2.5 cows.|$|E

2500|$|Free-range {{poultry farming}} allows {{chickens}} to roam freely {{for a period}} of the day, although they are usually confined in sheds at night to protect them from predators or kept indoors if the weather is particularly bad. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that a free-range chicken must have day-time access to open-air runs during at least half of its life. Unlike in the United States, this definition also applies to free-range egg <b>laying</b> <b>hens.</b> The European Union regulates marketing standards for egg farming which specifies a minimum condition for free-range eggs that [...] "hens have continuous daytime access to open-air runs, except in the case of temporary restrictions imposed by veterinary authorities". The RSPCA [...] "Welfare standards for <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> and pullets" [...] indicates that the stocking rate must not exceed 1,000 birds per hectare (10 m2 per hen) of range available and a minimum area of overhead shade/shelter of 8 m2 per 1,000 hens must be provided.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned {{conventional}} battery cages for <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> {{throughout the}} European Union from January 1, 2012; they were banned previously {{in other countries}} including Switzerland. In response to these bans, development of prototype commercial furnished cage systems began in the 1980s. [...] Furnished cages, sometimes called 'enriched' or 'modified' cages, are cages for egg <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> which {{have been designed to}} overcome some of the welfare concerns of battery cages whilst retaining their economic and husbandry advantages, and also provide some of the welfare advantages of non-cage systems. Many design features of furnished cages have been incorporated because research in animal welfare science has shown them to be of benefit to the hens. In the UK, the Defra [...] "Code for the Welfare of Laying Hens" [...] states furnished cages should provide at least 750cm2 of cage area per hen, 600cm2 of which should be usable; the height of the cage other than that above the usable area should be at least 20cm at every point and no cage should have a total area that is less than 2000cm2. In addition, furnished cages should provide a nest, litter such that pecking and scratching are possible, appropriate perches allowing at least 15cm per hen, a claw-shortening device, and a feed trough which may be used without restriction providing 12cm per hen.|$|E

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the year round emissions of ammonia (NH(3)), nitrous oxide (N(2) O), and methane (CH(4)) from three commercial aviary systems with organic <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> husbandry. The second was to determine the effect on NH(3), N(2) O and CH(4) emissions of varying removal interval when using manure belts. Emissions were computed from the ventilation rate, calculated with the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) mass balance method, and gas concentrations of NH(3), N(2) O, and CH(4) inside and outside the hen house. Mean emission per hen for NH(3) was 410 mg d(- 1), for N(2) O was 3. 12 mg d(- 1), and for CH(4) was 81. 7 mg d(- 1). Mean predicted emission per hen for NH(3) on the first day after manure removal was 298 mg d(- 1), and increased by 5. 47 % d(- 1). The presence of manure on the belt did not affect emissions of N(2) O and CH(4). Emission of NH(3) from aviary systems with organic <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> husbandry was in the same range as emission of NH(3) from aviary systems with non-organic <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> husbandry. Using organic <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> husbandry in aviary systems instead of single-tiered systems has the potential to reduce emissions of NH(3), N(2) O, and CH 4; further reductions might be realised by changes in litter management.

It is assumed that interactions between these different actors are important to articulate common ideas of which aspects are important for a sustainable husbandry system.

We study interaction with a focus on interactive framing of sustainability issues. We limit our study by analysing how framing of three themes related to sustainability change in interaction, namely the outdoor run for hens, the “better life” label and positioning of the Roundel egg in the market for table eggs. Our analysis showed that framing is changing. Via interaction the various actors got acquainted with each others’ frames. This confrontation with other actors’ frames did lead to pruning, compromising and re-framing of sustainability issues.
