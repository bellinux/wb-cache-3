5000|$|In modern machines, {{the time}} to fetch a {{variable}} from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations. A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable. Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and [...] "out-of-order execution" [...] that examines and runs many instructions at once. Register machines can even do this with much simpler [...] "in-order" [...] hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The <b>load</b> <b>step</b> becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence. The compiler puts independent steps in between.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a fiber bundle {{model with a}} equal load sharing and uniformly distributed breakdown thresholds. A unified probability-theoretic approach was used to describe bundle under continuous and discrete load increase. It was shown that the ratio of distribution D(d) of avalanches of sizes d {{to the number of}} bundle <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> exactly corresponds to burst probability of size d. Evolution of s - power law distribution exponent of D(d) was studied as a function of <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> and bundle size. It was shown that s does not depend on bundle size. In the numerical experiment, dependence s on <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> was obtained with fiber bundle size up to N= 10 ^ 10. The regions of s values constancy and the transition region were found. A distribution of fiber bursts on each <b>loading</b> <b>step</b> was recovered in the numerical simulations.

An {{extended}} kinematic minimum {{principle in}} classical plasticity {{is used as}} the basis for the finite element formulation of the rate problem for elastic-plastic plates. A simple algorithm is used to solve the resulting quadratic programming problem. The numerical solution of the problem is carried out in two ways: one method involves <b>load</b> <b>step</b> sizes which are scaled so that one or more gauss points just become plastic, and the other method involves <b>load</b> <b>step</b> sizes which are fixed once and for all at the outset.

40|$|The displacement-like {{finite element}} {{formulation}} for finite-step J 2 elastoplasticity is revisited in this paper. The classical computational strategy, according to which, plastic loading is tested at the Gauss points of each element {{and an independent}} return mapping algorithm is performed for given incremental displacements, is consistently derived from a suitably discretized version of a min-max variational principle. The sequence of solution phases to be performed within each <b>load</b> <b>step</b> adopting a full Newton's method is illustrated in detail {{and the importance of}} a correct update of the plastic strains is emphasized. It is further shown that, in order to increase the rate of convergence and the stability properties of the Newton's method, the consistent elastoplastic tangent operator must be exploited even at the first iteration of each <b>load</b> <b>step</b> subsequent to the first yielding of the structural model. This is in contrast with the traditional implementation according to which the elastic operator is used at the first iteration of each <b>load</b> <b>step.</b> The effectiveness of the present approach is shown by a set of numerical examples referred to plane strain problems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{deformation}} is {{an important}} parameter in structural health monitoring, and a conjugate beam method based on long-gauge fiber Bragg grating distributed strain sensing techniques is proposed to obtain the deformation of a structure.

The deformation obtained with the proposed method agrees well with those obtained with the conventional dial gauge in low <b>loading</b> <b>steps.</b> In addition, some measure is put forward to calibrate the proposed method and improve its accuracy at high <b>loading</b> <b>steps,</b> especially after the initiation of concrete cracks...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the use of}} {{incremental}} displacement collocation method (IDCM) {{for the evaluation of}} the tension softening curve of quasi-brittle materials is presented. By varying the residual tensile stress on the tension softening curve (TSC) for each <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> the measured displacements are matched with the computed displacements at selected locations. By gradually increasing the <b>loading</b> <b>step,</b> the complete TSC can be determined in a step-by-step manner. As distinct global and local deformation responses are employed in the IDCM, the ill-posed problem commonly encountered in other inverse analyses is avoided.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical formulation for frictional contact {{problems associated with}} pile penetration. The frictional contact at the soil–pile interface is formulated using the theory of hardening/softening plasticity, so that advanced models for the interface can be dealt with. A smooth discretisation of the pile surface is proposed using BéZIER polynomials. An automatic <b>load</b> <b>stepping</b> scheme is proposed,which features an error control algorithm and automatic subincrementation of the load increments. The numerical algorithms are then used to analyse the installation process of pushed-in axial piles. It is shown that the smooth discretisation of the pile surface is effective in reducing the oscillation in the predicted pile resistances and the automatic <b>load</b> <b>stepping</b> scheme outperforms the classical Newton–Raphson scheme {{for this type of}} problem...|$|R

30|$|The FE {{analysis}} program, ANSYS {{was used}} to determine the structural performances up to the failure of the specimens. Solid 185 elements were selected to simulate the studied beams (refer to Eltaly 2016; ANSYS 2009; Narmashiri and Jumaat 2011). Each element is defined by 8 nodes. There are three degrees of freedom (translations in x, y, and z directions) at each node. Solid 185 element has swelling, plasticity, creep, large strain, large deflection and stress stiffening capabilities. In the current model, geometric and material nonlinearities were both considered into account. Multi-linear Kinematic Hardening Constants approach was selected to simulate the material nonlinearity. This approach was selected for materials that obey von Mises yield criteria. The stress–strain curve of the steel material was defined. ANSYS program depends on Newton–Raphson method for updating the model stiffness. Load–control technique was selected in the current model. In this technique, the total load is applied. During the analysis, the load is divided into small load increments using the automatic time stepping option. This option was selected to decrease <b>load</b> <b>step</b> size when the convergence occurs for the given <b>load</b> <b>step.</b> The size of <b>load</b> <b>step</b> in the case of linear range should not be defined small and it was gradually decreased as the behavior of the beam changes from linear to non-linear stage. The load increases gradually until the beam failure occurs.|$|E

40|$|A {{ground loads}} {{test of a}} {{full-scale}} wing (175 -ft span) was conducted using a fiber optic strain-sensing system to obtain distributed surface strain data. These data were input into previously developed deformed shape equations to calculate the wing s bending and twist deformation. A photogrammetry system measured actual shape deformation. The wing deflections reached 100 percent of the positive design limit load (equivalent to 3 g) and 97 percent of the negative design limit load (equivalent to - 1 g). The calculated wing bending results were in excellent agreement with the actual bending; tip deflections were within +/- 2. 7 in. (out of 155 -in. max deflection) for 91 percent of the <b>load</b> <b>steps.</b> Experimental testing revealed valuable opportunities for improving the deformed shape equations robustness to real world (not perfect) strain data, which previous analytical testing did not detect. These improvements, which include filtering methods developed in this work, minimize errors due to numerical anomalies discovered in the remaining 9 percent of the <b>load</b> <b>steps.</b> As a result, all <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> attained +/- 2. 7 in. accuracy.
