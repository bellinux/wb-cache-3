5|$|Wipeout 2048 {{preserves}} {{some technical}} aspects of its predecessor Wipeout HD, including downloadable content, online multiplayer mode, and cross-platform play with PlayStation 3 owners of Wipeout HD. The game received mainly positive reviews. Critics agreed that its graphics and visuals showcased {{the power of the}} then-new PlayStation Vita, but criticised its long <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> and other technical issues.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick <b>loading</b> <b>time,</b> the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E

The process contains the following steps: - calculation of resulting <b>load</b> <b>time</b> functions of single-axis component loads from measured, multi-axial <b>load</b> <b>time</b> functions; - measurement of the reversal points in the time functions of single-axis component loads which belong to non-damaging vibration actions and marking of all other (damage-related) reversal points in the time functions of the component loads; marking of all reversal points and transients of the <b>load</b> <b>time</b> functions which occur simultaneously with the reversal points marked (damage-related) {{in all the time}} functions of the components loads; - reduction of the <b>load</b> <b>time</b> functions to only those reversal points and transients which form the support points; - calcul ation of the compressed <b>load</b> <b>time</b> functions by calculation of transfer functions between the support points and taking account of the maximum values of velocity, acceleration and frequency of the test machine...|$|R

500|$|The console {{versions}} of the game were noted for their robust feature set which {{put them on the}} same level as the PC release. Phil Kollar of Polygon lauded its implementation of controller play, calling it [...] "Final Fantasy XIVs single biggest gift to the [...] genre". While the PlayStation 3 version suffered from minor framerate and <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> issues as well as reduced graphical fidelity, reviewers observed that all of these problems were eliminated in the PlayStation 4 version, creating parity with the PC release. Kollar and Leif Johnson of IGN also found that the game played admirably on PlayStation Vita via Remote Play with only minor lag.|$|E
500|$|Although its {{gameplay}} {{was mainly}} well received, the game's long <b>loading</b> <b>times</b> were criticised. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb noted Wipeout 2048 technical issues, particularly its <b>loading</b> <b>times.</b> IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second <b>loading</b> <b>times</b> frustrating [...] "when {{all you want}} to do is race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall also described the long <b>loading</b> <b>times</b> as awful, though he felt they were not enough to make the game a failure and assured the overall gameplay experience [...] "deeply satisfying". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the game's online mode was well-executed, highly accessible and a [...] "credit to Wipeout." [...] She said that its user interface appeared clean and shiny, and called the touchscreen-based menu system [...] "a pleasure to behold". The Guardian Simon Parkin criticised the game's protracted loading times; a pause at least twenty seconds too long had a negative effect in the era of [...] "insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms". Willington found the lengthy <b>load</b> <b>times</b> an issue which plagues the game, [...] "totally at odds" [...] with the normal pace of gameplay. Gaston said that the <b>loading</b> <b>times</b> were [...] "simply unforgivable"; he routinely waited over 50 seconds after selecting a race to start it, which minimised the ability to comfortably play the game [...] "on the go". Walton also found the long <b>loading</b> <b>times</b> infuriating in a handheld game, and said that having to wait more than 40 seconds to start a race was far longer than it should have been. Although Furfari found that the game had one of the longest <b>loading</b> <b>times</b> on the PlayStation Vita, it was not a [...] "deal breaker" [...] and Wipeout 2048 was one of the few racing titles for the console that he recommended. Although Haley noted the game's substantial <b>loading</b> <b>times,</b> he said that was a common feature in PlayStation Vita launch titles.|$|R

500|$|Other {{features}} praised include its short <b>loading</b> <b>time,</b> {{the variety}} of game modes and characters, the balance between characters' abilities, {{the response of the}} controls, its replay value, and variety of features. Dunham even declared it [...] "reads like the bible of fighting game options. Taking a page from every other title out there, there doesn't seem to be a single feature on the horizon that's been left out of GGX2 for fear of the Completists." [...] In spite of the praise, other criticisms vary from its general difficulty to the lack of an online play mode, position of move list in training mode, and the difficulty to perform moves in Dual Shock.|$|E
500|$|The disk <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> was {{the most}} criticised aspect from reviewers. Houghton found the loading times [...] "hefty" [...] and {{recommended}} that the player use two disk drives instead of one, as constant disk swapping was required in the game. Ricketts similarly found the swapping of [...] "half a dozen" [...] floppy disks a [...] "nightmare" [...] on the Atari ST. Keating found the [...] "huge" [...] amount of disk swapping to be the game's largest drawback, {{as well as the}} long loading times that accompanied it. Davies stated that scrolling times were [...] "painfully slow" [...] due to the excessive disk accessing. White stated that the game had a disk access routine [...] "so bad" [...] that it was almost impossible to access icons during gameplay, as the cursor movement was always a second behind actual mouse movements.|$|E
500|$|Tales of Graces sold 113,000 copies on {{its initial}} launch date, and sales reached 216,000 within its first year. The game was re-released under the Nintendo Selects label on March 24, 2011. Famitsu praised {{the depth of}} the {{gameplay}} but criticized the <b>loading</b> <b>time.</b> The game was listed on Famitsu's [...] "Greatest Games of All-Time" [...] in 2010. Tales of Graces f sold over 200,000 copies in Japan during its first week and reached over 300,000 a year later. Tales of Graces f was later re-released under PlayStation 3 The Best label on August 2, 2012. Famitsu repeated their praise of the gameplay and lauded the graphical upgrades. A survey by ASCII Media Works's Dengeki Online in 2011 revealed Tales of Graces is ranked seventh on games readers would want to be adapted into an anime.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve {{reliability}} of automobile transmission system and its running stability, this paper raises a reliability assessment calculation method. This method considers dependent failure of the parts, material strength degradation with increasing <b>load</b> <b>times</b> and uncertainty of <b>load</b> <b>times</b> in micro and macro scopes to explore main factors affecting the system reliability. The feasibility of this method has been validated by the example analysis. As a result, material properties of each gear parts, torques and <b>load</b> <b>times</b> play key parts in reliability of the system. ...|$|R

500|$|Some reviewers {{said that}} the second act of the game, {{taking place in the}} less-structured portion of the old Aperture facilities, may be {{confusing}} to some players. Young wrote that in the second act, the game [...] "cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers", and said that particularly when traveling between chambers, he had [...] "absolutely no idea where I was supposed to head next". [...] Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the abandoned areas of Aperture, [...] "none of it ever does anythingit's just a lot of sterile, duplicated, non-interactive environments". Watters wrote that the <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> between the game's levels, in contrast to earlier Valve games, are [...] "long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter". Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks [...] "stand-alone test chambers and leaderboards...but even so, Portal 2 is not light on content" [...] without these. Welsh {{said that the}} attempt to recapture the spirit of the song [...] "Still Alive" [...] at the end credits of Portal 2 [...] "was a mistake". Video game critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation. However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that, while Portal 2 was a [...] "very good game", it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game's story, and did not really further the game's concept. However, this criticism was directed solely at the campaign, and he stated that he found the game's co-op to be [...] "much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original".|$|E

Seven of these weapons, six 28cm K5 pieces and a single [...] K12 gun {{with a range of}} , could only be used against land targets. The remainder, thirteen 28cm and five [...] pieces, plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24cm guns and ten 21cm weapons, could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed, long <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> and ammunition types.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{presentation}} received generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Visually, {{it was considered}} as a disappointment, with critics calling its graphics [...] "bland", [...] "artistically uninspired", and [...] "dated". Tan noticed the game's technical shortcomings, criticizing its textures and animation. Onyett shared similar concerns, adding that the game's scenery and models are unremarkable and dull. He {{also noted that the}} number of glitches and frame rate issues in the game. VanOrd criticized the texture pop-ins and the long loading times for the textures to load. McElroy and Juba added that the game's <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> was very long. Sterling also deeply disliked the game's graphics, saying that it match [...] "the atrocious quality of the gameplay" [...] and the game feels like a [...] "bad budget game that isn't even worth $20".|$|E

2500|$|The {{designers}} {{say they}} were guided by works such as The Lion King and The Iron Giant {{and that it is}} a [...] "coming-of-age story". The designers were also heavily influenced by the work of Hayao Miyazaki, particularly with one of the levels [...] "Valley of the Wind", being a nod to Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. The art style is meant to appear hand-drawn, similar to the more recent Rayman titles that utilize Ubisoft's [...] "UbiArt" [...] graphics engine; the game instead uses the Unity engine. The game takes place in one large map, rendered at 1080p and 60 frames per second with no visible <b>loading</b> <b>time</b> as the player explores. According to Mahler, the game's backgrounds are all individual components, with none duplicated as in other similar titles.
