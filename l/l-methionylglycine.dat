40|$|The Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids of the European Food Safety Authority was {{requested}} to evaluate one flavouring substance, the dipeptide <b>L-methionylglycine</b> [FL-no: 17. 037], in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 305, using the Procedure in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565 / 2000. The substance was considered {{not to have}} genotoxic potential. The substance was evaluated through a stepwise approach (the Procedure) that integrates information on the structure-activity relationships, intake from current uses, toxicological threshold of concern, and available data on metabolism and toxicity. The Panel concluded that for the flavouring substance, evaluated through the Procedure, no appropriate NOAEL was available and additional data are required. The present evaluation of the candidate substance <b>L-methionylglycine</b> [FL-no: 17. 037] is only applicable for its use in foods that are not heated or intended to be heated. Besides the safety assessment of the flavouring substance, the specifications for the material of commerce have also been considered. Adequate specifications including complete purity criteria and identity for the material of commerce have been provided for the candidate substance...|$|E
