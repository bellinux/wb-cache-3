The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance of elements according to whether they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Within this trend is a peak at abundances of iron and nickel, which is especially visible on a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>graph</b> spanning fewer powers of ten, say between logA=2 (A=100) and logA=6 (A=1,000,000).|$|E

50|$|Magnitude and {{frequency}} method. For large basins, where unit hydrograph {{might not be}} useful and reliable, the magnitude {{and frequency}} method {{is used to calculate}} the probability of recurrence of large flows based on records of past years’ flows. In United States, these records are maintained by the Hydrological Division of the U.S. Geological Survey for most rivers and large streams. For a basin with an area of 5000 square miles or more, the river system is typically gauged at five to ten places. The data from each gauging station apply to the part of the basin upstream that location. Given several decades of peak annual discharges for a river, limited projections can be made to estimate the size of some large flow that has not been experienced during the period of record. The technique involves projecting the curve (graph line) formed when peak annual discharges are plotted against their respective recurrence intervals. However, in most cases the curve bends strongly, making it difficult to plot a projection accurately. This problem can be overcome by plotting the discharge and/or recurrence interval data on <b>logarithmic</b> <b>graph</b> paper. Once the plot is straightened, a line can be ruled drawn through the points. A projection can then be made by extending the line beyond the points and then reading the appropriate discharge for the recurrence interval in question.|$|E

Students will use the slopes of various curves plotted on log-log graph paper to classify stellar objects as binary stars, supernovae, or active galaxies. The data used in this lesson were obtained from X-ray astronomy satellites. It provides an opportunity for students to apply the knowledge of plotting data and obtaining a slope using a log-log coordinate system, determine the line of best fit from a set of data obtained from X-ray astronomy satellites, and discover the relationship between slope and the classification of stellar objects. By displaying the data in a graphic, the relationship of the dependent variable on the independent variable can be seen. The most powerful form of display is when the result is a straight line - which can always be converted quickly into a mathematical equation.

40|$|Abstract only availableMolecular rotors, {{a special}} class of {{compounds}} which form twisted intramolecular charge transfer complexes (TICT), have dual deexcitation processes - intramolecular rotation and fluorescence emission. Molecular rotors exhibit a quantum yield that {{is sensitive to}} changes in solution viscosity; this property makes molecular rotors highly suitable for optical measurements of viscosity. The goal {{of this study was}} to test the idea that increasing the chain length of the molecular rotor increases its viscosity sensitivity. Molecular rotors of varying chain length were selected for experimentation; DCVJ, a thoroughly studied molecular rotor, was chosen as the control. Mixtures of differing ratios of ethylene glycol and glycerol were created to vary viscosity. Fluorescence emission intensity data for the six molecular rotors was measured with a Jobin Yvon Fluoromax- 3 spectrofluorometer. <b>Logarithmic</b> <b>graphs</b> of fluorescence intensity versus viscosity were created and displayed a linear relationship with regression values exceeding 0. 99. However, the slopes for the various molecular rotors were not significantly different.

40|$|Series of Mogi's {{single source}} model display {{characteristic}} family curves on the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>graph</b> of vertical displacement versus horizontal distance. The family curves on log-log plots are simply {{characterized by the}} flat part at short distances and constant decay at farther distances. The specific corner distances, which are defined by the bending corner of the curves, are mainly controlled by the source depth. The edifice scale deformation associated with the 2000 eruption of Mt. Usu is far from that predicted by Mogi's single source. The vertical displacement shows much more sharp decay with distance around 5 - 6 Km and uplift-to-subsidence reversal at much farther distances on the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>graph.</b> This steep decay and a farther reversal can be well explained by a simplified twin spherical source model, with shallow inflation and deep deflation. It provides better fitness to the data, when the deflation volume at 10 Km {{is assumed to be}} nearly equivalent to the inflation volume at 2 Km. Similar result is also evident for the horizontal model. The combined twin source model of shallow inflation and deep deflationi is also applied to the available leveling data for the histolical 3 eruptions of Mt. Usu in 1910, 1943 - 45 and 1977 - 82.
