5|$|In 2003 the Ipswich MP Chris Mole {{introduced}} a Private Member's Bill {{which became the}} <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Libraries Act 2003. The Act extends United Kingdom <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> requirements to electronic documents, such as CD-ROMs and selected websites.|$|E
5|$|In England, <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> can {{be traced}} back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 {{established}} the principle of the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit,</b> ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Libraries.|$|E
5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required every book for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, but said nothing about limiting the term of copyright. It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its second reading on 9 February. A Committee of the Whole met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E

50|$|The Norwegian ISBN Agency, {{responsible}} for assigning ISBNs with prefix 82- and 978-82-, {{is part of}} the National Library of Norway. The National Library is also {{responsible for}} <b>legal</b> <b>deposits</b> made from publishers in Norway. All material is to be submitted free of charge.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to having a law requiring publishers to deposit books, those countries with <b>legal</b> <b>deposits</b> usually have many other incentives for a proper and speedy deposit, such as a tie-in with laws affecting copyright of the same documents, and/or a cataloguing- in- publication service.|$|R
5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting the import of foreign books to also prohibit the import of books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E
5|$|The Library {{holds an}} almost {{complete}} collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This {{is partly because}} of the <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of microfilm containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the Thomason Tracts, comprising 7,200 17th-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the Copyright Act (now {{superseded}} by the <b>Legal</b> <b>Deposit</b> Libraries Act 2003) continued the Stationers' agreement {{by making the}} Bodleian {{one of the six}} (at that time) libraries covering <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> in the United Kingdom where a copy of each book copyrighted must be deposited.|$|E

25|$|Collection {{development}} {{is focused on}} materials relating {{to the people of}} Wales, those in the Welsh language and resources for Celtic studies, but other materials are collected for the purposes of education and literary and scientific research. As a <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> library, the National Library is entitled to request a copy of every work published in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This has allowed the Library to collect modern Welsh, Irish and Gaelic language books for its Celtic collection. The acquisition of material through <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> has been supplemented by purchases, international exchanges, donations and bequests.|$|E
25|$|Lund University {{library was}} {{established}} in 1668 {{at the same time}} as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest libraries. Since 1698 it has received <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> copies, but only Lund and the Royal Library in Stockholm are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.|$|E

On 18 October 2005, a seminar presenting and discussing different initiatives and issues in this area, was held at the Swedish Royal Library (KB). The seminar was arranged by BIBSAM, the Royal Library´s Department for National Co-ordination and Development. Entitled "Electronic publications – access now and in the future" the seminar was broad in scope, ranging from technical and organisational issues to political ones, taking in perspectives from both universities (and their libraries) and government authorities, as well as from KB.

50|$|Since 1780 the Załuski Library {{has been}} {{entitled}} to a copy of all works published in Poland. In modern times the issue is regulated by a Decree of the Minister of Culture and Arts of March 6, 1997. The National Library of Poland and the Jagiellonian Library receive two copies of all publications, {{one of which is}} to be stored indefinitely. In addition to that, there are 15 other libraries to receive <b>legal</b> <b>deposits</b> to be stored for no less than 50 years: Maria Curie-Skłodowska University Library, University of Łódź Library, Nicolaus Copernicus University Library, Adam Mickiewicz University Library, Warsaw University Library, University of Wrocław Library, Silesian Library, City of Warsaw Library, Pomeranian Library in Szczecin, University of Gdańsk Library, Catholic University of Lublin Library, University of Opole Library and Podlaskie Library in Białystok.

25|$|The {{university}} library {{was founded by}} King James VI in 1612, with the donation of 350 works from the royal collection, {{at the urging of}} George Gledstanes, the then chancellor of St Andrews, although the libraries of the colleges of St Leonard's College, St Salvator's College and St Mary's College had existed prior to this.

25|$|Cambridge {{is formed}} {{from a variety}} of {{institutions}} which include 31 constituent colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools. Cambridge University Press, a department of the university, is the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum, as well as a botanic garden. Cambridge's libraries hold a total of around 15 million books, eightmillion of which are in Cambridge University Library, a <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> library.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} has 114 libraries. The Cambridge University Library {{is the central}} research library, which holds over 8million volumes. It is a <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> library, therefore it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland. In addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library possesses more than 100,000 books. Furthermore, every college has a library as well, partially {{for the purposes of}} undergraduate teaching, and the older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library has more than 200,000 books printed before 1800, while Corpus Christi College's Parker Library possesses one of the greatest collections of medieval manuscripts in the world, with over 600 manuscripts.|$|E
40|$|Collecting, sharing, {{protection}} of collections and computerization {{are an integral}} part of the activities of the library. Currently, in order to meet the basic activities performed in library, the employee qualifications often must be beyond the typical skills gained in college and previously required in this profession. The paper describes the qualifications that must have a library employee involved in the project of institutional repository creation. In the Jagiellonian Library database of this type is not only an archive of documents produced at the university, but also virtual reading room of the <b>legal</b> <b>deposits</b> entering to the library according to the Act of 7 November 1996 on the compulsory library copies (OJ 1996, No. 152, item. 722) and the Regulation of the Minister of Culture and Art of 6 March 1997.

40|$|State {{libraries}} and archives with <b>legal</b> <b>deposits</b> {{have to draw}} up strategies for their preservation work. Today’s political situation with constant budget reductions {{when it comes to}} preserve the written heritage makes it important for institutions to formulate short term and long term plans and see to that they are anchored politically. Preventive as well as practical conservation calls for a strong ethic base as well as measurable results. This paper tells about preservation strategies at state {{libraries and}} the way conservators can create ethical foundations for their decisions. As boxing is a very prominent way of creating preventive care for library and archival collections, a practical experiment to uncover what actually happens inside a book box has been undertaken. In this paper, I present and discuss the results and place it in context with preservation strategies and ethic decisions. The final conclusion is {{that it is important to}} make thorough plans for preservation work at public institutions, and that conservators must have access to operational ethical tools to firmly establish their decisions before proceeding with any projected treatment whether preventive care or practical conservation.

25|$|The Celtic {{collection}} includes {{works in}} all six Celtic languages. A representative collection of Scottish Gaelic books has been assembled, primarily through purchase of earlier publications, {{guided by the}} standard bibliographies, and, for books published after 1911, by <b>legal</b> <b>deposit.</b> Irish literature, which is far more extensive, has been collected through a similar combination of purchase and deposit. However, many collections purchased by or donated to the Library have contained rare Irish books. The Library of Dr E. C. Quiggin, which was received in 1921, contained a large Irish collection and many early Breton books. Further Breton books have been purchased or were acquired in the libraries of Sir Edward Anwyl, Thomas Powel, Dr Thomas Gwynn Jones, Dr Paul Diverres and Llywarch Reynolds. The holdings of Cornish and Manx printed books include practically everything that has been published in those languages, with a few facsimiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} library {{was founded in}} 1818 and started with 6,000 volumes inherited from the library of the closed University of Duisburg. In 1824 the library became <b>legal</b> <b>deposit</b> for all books published in the Prussian Rhine province. The library contained about 200,000 volumes {{at the end of}} the 19th century, and about 600,000 volumes at the outbreak of World War II. An air raid on 10 October 1944 destroyed about 200,000 volumes and a large part of the library catalog. After the war the library was housed in several makeshift locations until the completion of the new central library in 1960. The new building was designed by Pierre Vago and Fritz Bornemann and is located close to the main building. In 1983 a new library building was opened in Poppelsdorf, west of the main building. The new library building houses the science, agriculture and medicine collections. Today, the {{university library}} system comprises the central library, the library for science, agriculture and medicine and about 160 smaller libraries. It holds 2.2 million volumes and subscribes to about 14,000 journals.|$|E
