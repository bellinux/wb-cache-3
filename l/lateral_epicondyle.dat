40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study of}} the brachial portion of the radial nerve with surgical implications is proposed. Thirty specimens of arm from 20 fresh cadavers (11 male, 9 female) were {{used to examine the}} topographical relations of the radial nerve with reference to the following anatomical landmarks: acromion angle, medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles,</b> point of division between the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii, lateral intermuscular septum, site of division of the radial nerve into its superficial and posterior interosseous branches and entry and exit point of the posterior interosseous branch into the supinator muscle. The mean distances between the acromion angle and the medial and lateral levels of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus were 109 (+/- 11) and 157 (+/- 11) mm, respectively. The mean length and calibre of the nerve in the groove were 59 (+/- 4) and 6 (+/- 1) mm, respectively. The division of the lateral and long heads of the triceps was found at a mean distance of 126 (+/- 13) mm from the acromion angle. The mean distances between the lateral point of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus and the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles</b> were 125 (+/- 13) and 121 (+/- 13) mm, respectively. The mean distance between the lateral point of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus and the entry point in the lateral intermuscular septum (LIS) was 29 (+/- 6) mm. The mean distances between the entry point of the nerve in the LIS and the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles</b> were 133 (+/- 14) and 110 (+/- 23) mm, respectively. Our study provides reliable and objective data of surgical anatomy of the radial nerve which should be always kept in mind by surgeons approaching to the surgery of the arm, in order to avoid iatrogenic injuries...|$|R
30|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} variations of recommended pinning techniques. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5], using two pins, inserted medially and laterally through the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles.</b> The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is always a concern during insertion of the medial pin with a reported incidence of 2 – 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Arino et al. [11] recommended inserting the two wires through the <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles</b> to avoid ulnar nerve injury. Biomechanically, fixation provided by the two lateral pins is less secure, as it may allow rotation of the fracture, with the medial column rotating posteriorly. It {{was found that the}} torque required to produce 10 ° of rotation is 37 % less with the use of two lateral parallel pins than with the use of medial and lateral pins [4, 12]. It has been argued that insertion of two lateral cross-pins will provide a biomechanically stable fixation with avoiding the risk of ulnar nerve injury [13]. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the results of percutaneous lateral cross-wiring technique in treatment of unstable or irreducible type II and III supracondylar humeral fractures in children.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Iliotibial tract {{friction}} syndrome (ITBFS) {{might be}} caused by repetitive friction and abrasion of the iliotibial (ITB) tract across the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle.</b> Thickening in the ITB adjacent to the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> has been reported. The values of ITB thickness at the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> in healthy adult volunteers were determined, and the association between {{the thickness of the}} ITB and the subjects' age, weight, height, dominant limb and the volume of training or sporting activity was assessed. METHODS: An Ultrasound Scan (high resolution 3 - 2 MHz transducer Voluson-i G E Medical Systems, UK) was used to measure the thickness of the ITB in 38 healthy volunteers (30 men and 8 women, mean age 22. 5 ± 1. 5 years, range 18 - 25 years). One measurement from each of the subjects' knees at the level of <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> was taken. Reliability was established by measuring 11 of the subjects on three separate occasions at least I week apart. RESULTS: The thickness of the ITB on the right and left knees was 1. 1 ± 0. 2 mm. There was no evidence of a significant association between the thickness of the ITB and the subjects' age, weight, height, dominant limb and the volume of training or sporting activity.

30|$|While closed {{manipulation}} and percutaneous Kirschner wire stabilization is the accepted treatment of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children, {{there is still}} argument on the optimal configuration of those Kirschner wires. Danielsson and Pettersson [20] used only one pin and noted a loss of reduction. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5] have, using two pins, introduced through the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles,</b> respectively. The two-wire cross-fixation is {{the most commonly used}} and good results have been reported, but injury of the ulnar nerve when inserting the medial wire has been documented ranging from 2 to 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].|$|R
25|$|Posteriorly {{below the}} knee joint, the popliteus {{stretches}} obliquely from the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> down to the posterior surface of the tibia. The subpopliteal bursa is located deep to the muscle. Popliteus flexes the knee joint and medially rotates the leg.|$|R
40|$|Open {{exposure}} of the posterolateral corner of the knee is challenged by limitations of posterolateral ligamentous tissues and posterior neurovascular structures. We have used a modification of a <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> osteotomy, described historically for surgical management of posterolateral rotatory instability, as an approach to the posterolateral intraarticular structures. The historic technique for ligamentous reconstruction has been abandoned because its nonanatomic fixation does not restore ligamentous isometry. In this report, osteotomy of a bone block from the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> is used to access the joint space. The lateral collateral ligament is reflected distally and posteriorly through traction on the block. Once the intraarticular disorder has been addressed, the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle</b> is secured in its native, anatomic position, thereby restoring isometry and normal joint mechanics after surgery. This technique has been used successfully to address posterolateral articular disorders on femoral and tibial sides. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging verified restoration of lateral collateral ligament anatomy. Physical examination at 0 ° and 30 ° knee flexion showed clinical stability at all postoperative evaluations through 6 and 10  months followup. Using this technique, intraarticular disorders at the posterolateral corner may be addressed in an open manner with anatomic reduction and preserved postoperative function of the lateral collateral ligament...|$|R

30|$|The KT- 2000 {{arthrometer}} {{was used}} with the Lachman test (Daniel et al. 1985) in which the assessor produces an anterior displacement of the tibia {{with respect to the}} femur. The participant remained relaxed in a supine position on the examination bed with the dominant knee supported at 30 ° of flexion. A goniometer was used to ensure the knee was placed in 30 ° flexion. The KT- 2000 was secured over the participant’s leg in the ideal position with reference to the knee joint line. Both knees were supported on a firm comfortable platform placed proximal to the popliteal space. In addition, a foot support, was used to position the leg symmetrically and avoid external rotation of the tibia. Next, a Lachman test was performed by pulling rapidly on the handle of the KT- 2000. Each participant underwent 3 trials, with 3 attempts in each trial to elicit hamstring stretch reflex. Furthermore, to determine the onset and magnitude of the tibial translation, a control experiment was performed with six participants using a high-speed 3 D motion analysis system (Vicon MX Nexus system, Vicon Motion Systems Limited, Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Retro-reflective markers were fixed to the skin using double-sided adhesive tape over the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle,</b> 3  cm above the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>epicondyle,</b> 3  cm below the <b>lateral</b> tibial <b>epicondyle</b> and on the apex of the patellae.

30|$|While {{ultrasound}} is, of course, not {{suited to}} assess bone marrow disease or spinal arthropathy, {{it is well}} suited to look for peripheral enthesitis and can be surprisingly useful in inflammatory spondyloarthropathies [60]. It has even been applied to the diagnosis of sacroiliitis as a low tech alternative to MRI [61]. Orientating ultrasound assessment of major entheses has been suggested in suspected or established cases of inflammatory spondylarthropathies, either to support or refute the diagnosis or to help establish the disease burden [62 – 64]. D’Agostino et al. [64] assessed about 200 patients with an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy or rheumatoid arthritis and more than 60 controls. They sonographically examined the major entheses of the limbs, the greater trochanters, pubis, patellae, Achilles tendon insertion, planta fascia origin, tibialis anterior insertions, medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles.</b> This took about 20  min and identified {{more than double the}} number of areas of enthesopathy as were apparent clinically in the inflammatory spondyloarthropathy group. The pattern of inflammation of entheses or joints can sometimes help to distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from inflammatory spondyloarthropathies and might be requested for this reason. The sonographic findings as such cannot differentiate the various inflammatory spondylarthropathies.|$|R
50|$|This {{syndrome}} is usually developed {{by people who}} suddenly increase their level of activity, such as runners who increase their mileage. Other risk factors for ITBS include gait abnormalities such as overpronation, leg length discrepancies, or bow-leggedness.

40|$|Intraoperative joint-line {{determination}} during revision TKA {{is difficult}} and no method exists to plan the position preoperatively. Two questions need to be answered: to which extent does the joint line differ from its anatomic position after revision TKA if it has only been determined intraoperatively, and can the joint line be calculated preoperatively based on the transepicondylar width. Of 22 consecutive patients with complete preoperative (before and after primary TKA) and postoperative (after revision TKA) radiograph documentation, the joint-line position was measured on plane radiographs using the medial epicondyle as a reference. On another set of 45 consecutive patients with no knee disorders other than meniscal lesions, the transepicondylar axis width (TEAW) and the perpendicular distance from the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles</b> to the joint line were measured twice by two independent observers on plane AP radiographs of the knee. Significant joint-line alterations were observed after primary and revision TKA, implicating that a method for preoperative planning is needed. Because a linear correlation between the TEAW and the perpendicular distance from the epicondyles to the joint-line tangent was found, the ratio is useful to calculate the true joint-line position from the TEAW before revision TKA.

40|$|Background The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess whether, and to what extent, incorrect acquisition of anatomical landmarks during navigated total knee arthroplasty affects the accuracy of implant positioning. Methods An artificial model of the lower limb was used to simulate a navigated total knee arthroplasty. The anatomical landmarks necessary for navigation were identified and the procedure performed as usual. Navigation was then repeated after having collected the anatomical landmarks with an error of 10 mm from the reference points. The spatial orientation of resulting bone cuts was registered with the navigation system and compared with that of bone cuts performed with correct anatomical landmarks. Results Compared with the reference cuts, the incorrect collection of anatomical landmarks led to changes in the coronal alignment of tibial and femoral cuts within 18 and 2. 28, respectively, and in sagittal alignment within 1. 58 and 2. 18, respectively. Incorrect landmarks of the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles</b> led to errors in the rotation of the epicondylar axis of 10 - 178. Conclusions When computer-navigation is used, the coronal and sagittal alignment of total knee arthroplasty may be improved by an accurate collection of anatomical landmarks. Axial rotation of the femoral component should be assessed using other techniques in addition to the palpation of femoral epicondyle...|$|R

40|$|The {{predominance}} of upper-limb elbow {{models have been}} based on earlier lower-limb motion analysis models. We developed and validated a functionally based 2 degree-of-freedom upper-limb model to measure rotations of the forearm using a marker-based approach. Data were collected from humans and a mechanical arm with known axes and ranges of angular motion in 3 planes. This upper-limb model was compared with an anatomically based model following the proposed ISB standardization. Location of the axes of rotation relative to each other was determined in vivo. Data indicated that the functional model was not influenced by cross-talk from adduction-abduction, accurately measuring flexion-extension and pronation-supination. The functional flexion-extension axis in vivo is angled at 6. 6 degrees to the anatomical line defined from the humeral medial to <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles.</b> The pronation-supination axis intersected the anatomically defined flexion-extension axis at 88. 1 degrees. Influence of cross-talk on flexion-extension kinematics in the anatomical model was indicated by strong correlation between flexion-extension and adduction-abduction angles for tasks performed by the subjects. The proposed functional model eliminated cross-talk by sharing a common flexion axis between the humerus and forearm. In doing so, errors due to misalignment of axes are minimized providing greater accuracy in kinematic data. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To compare {{scores for}} the Leeds {{enthesitis}} index in psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis using clinical assessment and ultrasonography (US). Design. Swelling and tenderness of the enthesis was assessed at six sites: <b>lateral</b> <b>epicondyles</b> of humerus (LE), medial condyles of femur (MC), and the insertion of the Achilles tendon (AT). US assessed “inflammatory activity” (power Doppler signal, oedema, tendon thickening, and bursal swelling) and “damage” (erosions and enthesophytes). Results. 94 patients were included, 71 with PsA and 23 with RA. The patients with RA were significantly older (PsA 47. 6 years; RA 62. 6 years; (mean difference in ages = 15. 0 years, 95 % CI 9. 3 – 20. 7 years)). US scores were higher in RA at the LE, significantly so for the “damage” scores. No differences between RA and PsA were seen at the other sites. As a result, the odds ratio for PsA, given an US score above the median, was 0. 41 (0. 13 – 1. 03). However, using the clinical score, the odds ratio for PsA was 2. 16 (0. 81 – 5. 70). Conclusions. Although clinical scores of enthesitis are greater in PsA compared to RA, US enthesitis scores did not distinguish between RA and PsA. This may in part be due to more frequent juxta-articular involvement in RA and {{in part due to}} the older age of the subjects with RA...|$|R
