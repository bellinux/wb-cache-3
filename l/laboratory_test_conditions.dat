30|$|In summary, {{once the}} {{intrinsic}} rock permeability k, working fluid, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> (T and p) are given, one can calculate the Knudsen coefficient Kn using Eqs. (2), (11) and (5), and then calculate f c from Eq. (6). The intrinsic permeability multiplied by f c {{will be the}} effective permeability value measured under the <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Accordingly, for the given laboratory measurement results, one can also estimate the intrinsic permeability value through inverse calculations. This will be further discussed in Sect.  4. Note that in this paper, we use terms “intrinsic permeability” and “corrected permeability” interchangeably.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the above two laboratory measurement approaches, the permeability correction may be made with a given relationship between intrinsic permeability, measured permeability, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> This approach has an obvious advantage over the two laboratory measurement approaches discussed above because it allows for estimating intrinsic permeability and the relationship (between measured permeability and pore pressure) from one permeability measurement for a given pore pressure. Note that for the laboratory approaches, the relationship of pore-pressure dependency requires permeability measurements at multiple pore pressures that are very time-consuming. Furthermore, a relationship between intrinsic permeability and <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> {{can also be used}} to relate laboratory permeability measurements to reservoir conditions in which pore pressure (and temperature) is generally different from those used in the laboratory and changes with time and location.|$|E
40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of GPS to interference {{has been a}} major concern for both military and civilian applications, including small UAVs. Various signal processing techniques have been developed to improve the reliability of GPS receivers against different types of interference. Among these techniques, null steering is recognized as an effective method to protect GPS against both narrowband and broadband interference. However, due to the requirement of multiple antenna channels, it has mainly been implemented for large platform applications. This thesis examines the suitability of null steering techniques for small UAV applications and determines the practically achievable anti-jamming ability by implementing a two-element miniaturized adaptive antenna array. The adaptive antenna array is tested against a 2 MHz broadband jamming signal under both <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> and a real jamming environment. Approximately 40 dB anti-jamming range was achieved in the <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> 38 dB and 42 dB were obtained in a real jamming environment with different antenna configuration.

The mechanical behavior of potash rock displays two stress-strain trends under the same load conditions. Based on the acoustic emission rate, it was possible to delineate an approximate yield point of potash rock. However, a more detailed study of the acoustic emission amplitude and energy distributions showed that high amplitude events with long event durations are initially observed to occur near the yield point of the stress strain curves.

After the field measurement program, the efficiency for converting nitric acid was found to be variable during smog chamber measurements. This was ascribed to degradation of the converter under field measurement conditions.

The variations of major principal stress of rock material with intermediate principal stress, minor principal stress and stress state are investigated. The artificial neural network simulations show that for the rock types examined, none were independent of intermediate principal stress effects. In addition, {{the results of the}} artificial neural network models, in general agreement with observations made by others, show (a) a general trend of strength increasing and reaching a peak at some intermediate stress state factor, followed by a decline in strength for most rock types; (b) a post-peak strength behavior dependent on the minor principal stress, with respect to rock type; (c) sensitivity to the stress state, and to the interaction between the stress state and uniaxial compressive strength of the test data by the artificial neural networks models (two-way analysis of variance; 95 % confidence interval).

40|$|AbstractDue to {{its roots}} in {{fundamental}} thermodynamic framework, continuum damage approach is popular for modeling asphalt concrete behavior. Currently used continuum damage models use mixture averaged values for model parameters and assume deterministic damage process. On the other hand, significant scatter is found in fatigue data generated even under extremely controlled <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Thus, currently used continuum damage models fail to account the scatter observed in fatigue data. This paper illustrates a novel approach for probabilistic fatigue life prediction based on viscoelastic continuum damage approach. Several specimens were tested for their viscoelastic properties and damage properties under uniaxial mode of loading. The data thus generated were analyzed using viscoelastic continuum damage mechanics principles to predict fatigue life. Weibull (2 parameter, 3 parameter) and lognormal distributions were fit to fatigue life predicted using viscoelastic continuum damage approach. It was observed that fatigue damage could be best-described using Weibull distribution when compared to lognormal distribution. Due to its flexibility, 3 -parameter Weibull distribution was found to fit better than 2 -parameter Weibull distribution. Further, {{significant differences were found}} between probabilistic fatigue curves developed in this research and traditional deterministic fatigue curve. The proposed methodology combines advantages of continuum damage mechanics as well as probabilistic approaches. These probabilistic fatigue curves can be conveniently used for reliability based pavement design...|$|R

Previous research has shown that cap lamp technology that used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has improved hazard detection. This study was an initial investigation to determine if cap lamp lighting significantly influences measures of static postural stability (displacement and velocity of center of pressure).
