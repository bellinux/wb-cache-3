25|$|An AMX {{version of}} the Spirit <b>liftback</b> was offered for 1979 and 1980.|$|E
25|$|For 1981, AMC {{introduced}} Eagle models (SX/4 <b>liftback</b> and Kammback sedan) {{based on}} both Spirit body styles.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the Spirit sedan {{replaced}} the Gremlin. A new fastback {{version of the}} car, the Spirit <b>Liftback,</b> proved successful.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the profile, such {{vehicles}} may be <b>liftbacks</b> but {{are unlikely}} to be hatchbacks.|$|R
25|$|Production was: 2,259 <b>Liftbacks,</b> 3,093 four-door sedans, and 12,378 station wagons for a {{total of}} 17,730 units in 1983.|$|R
25|$|Production was: 5,603 Kammbacks, 17,340 <b>Liftbacks,</b> 2,378 two-door sedans, 1,737 four-door sedans, and 10,371 station wagons for a {{total of}} 37,429 units.|$|R
25|$|The VAM-based Spirit <b>liftback</b> became VAM's top-of-the-line {{performance}} product, the Rally AMX being focused {{to replace}} the previous Concord AMX-based American Rally AMX models and the Rally GT as {{the replacement of the}} limited edition Concord two-door sedan-based American 06/S. Unlike under AMC, in Mexico the top performance Spirit <b>liftback</b> was the GT instead of the AMX. The AMC Spirit <b>liftback</b> was available in a wide array of market segments for almost any buyer; an economy Spirit base model, a luxury Spirit DL or Limited and a performance Spirit GT or AMX. This didn't happen under VAM, only the performance models were available and partially the luxury ones. Due to accessories and focus, the VAM Rally AMX is relatively similar to an AMC Spirit DL with GT package and most performance options.|$|E
25|$|A {{unique to}} Mexico was the vehicle called the VAM Lerma, {{which was based}} on the Concord's 4-door chassis with the Spirit's front and rear <b>liftback</b> body parts and unique rear quarter panels.|$|E
25|$|Until September 2012, The Prius <b>liftback</b> {{was the top}} selling new car in Japan for 16 {{months in}} a row, until it was surpassed by the Toyota Aqua in October, which kept the lead through December 2012. The Prius <b>liftback,</b> with 317,675 units sold in 2012 (including sales of the Prius α), was the best selling car in Japan during the 2012 {{calendar}} year for the fourth consecutive year. The Aqua ranked as the second best selling car with 266,567 units sold in 2012. Nevertheless, when sales of the two Prius models are broken down, the Toyota Aqua ranked as the top selling model in Japan in 2012, including kei cars, leading sales since February through December 2012. The Aqua was the top selling new car in Japan in 2013, and again in 2014. Global Prius sales peaked in 2010 with over 500 thousand units sold, and since 2011 sales of the <b>liftback</b> version have declined in most markets through December 2015, and in the US and Canada since 2013.|$|E
50|$|Notchback can be {{applicable}} to some hatchbacks and <b>liftbacks,</b> such as the Ford Escort and the Ford Sierra, with a discontinuous roofline from the windscreen to the rear bumper.|$|R
50|$|The SV-1 had a rear {{fuel filler}} {{similar to the}} early coupes. Toyota changed all Celicas to side fuel fillers in mid 1972, so all {{production}} <b>liftbacks</b> had fuel fillers on the left rear quarter panel with a cover flap.|$|R
50|$|Toyota Australia {{manufactured}} sedans and wagons using 1.9-liter Holden Starfire engines, badged in Toyota engine terminology as the 1X, {{coupled with}} a four-speed or optional five-speed Borg-Warner 505. Toyota Australia also imported four-door sedans and five-door <b>liftbacks</b> fitted with a 2.0-litre 18R engine for the upmarket range.|$|R
25|$|The Prius {{first went}} on sale in Japan in 1997, and was {{available}} at all four Toyota Japan dealerships, making it the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle. It was subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000. The Prius is sold in over 90 markets, with Japan and the United States being its largest markets. Global cumulative Prius <b>liftback</b> sales reached the milestone 1million vehicle mark in May 2008, 2million in September 2010, and passed the 3million mark in June 2013. Cumulative sales of one million were achieved in the U.S. by early April 2011, and Japan reached the 1million mark in August 2011. , the Prius <b>liftback</b> is the world's top selling hybrid car with almost 4million units sold.|$|E
25|$|Another 1974 Gremlin was {{modified}} with a front end from the Hornet. The concept car received a special grille, {{but the most}} radical design feature was its fastback roofline. This concept car {{turned out to be}} similar to the Gremlin's replacement, the <b>liftback</b> Spirit model introduced for the 1979 model year.|$|E
25|$|The GT package {{became its}} own model {{separate}} from the DL for the Spirit's last year. Advertisements stressed the higher level of standard equipment in both Spirit DL and Spirit GT, which sold for US$5,995 and US$6,495, respectively. The Spirit GT version was compared to the <b>liftback</b> version of Ford's Mustang.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} choice of two {{wheelbase}} versions and five body styles, the most popular model was the wagon with 20,899 built out of total Eagle production of 37,923 for the 1982 model year. Other production was: 520 Kammbacks, 10,445 <b>Liftbacks,</b> 1,968 two-door sedans, and 4,091 four-door sedans.|$|R
50|$|Rear Door: Hatchbacks {{typically}} {{feature a}} top-hinged liftgate for cargo access, with variations {{ranging from a}} two-part liftgate/tailgates (e.g., the 1958 A40 Countryman) to a complex tailgate that can function either as a full tailgate or as a trunk lid (e.g., the 2008 Škoda Superb's TwinDoor). Station wagons have also enjoyed numerous tailgate configurations. Hatchbacks may be called <b>Liftbacks</b> when the opening area is very sloped and the door is lifted up to open.|$|R
50|$|The SV-1 {{rear hatch}} glass {{was a bit}} larger than the {{production}} version.The key hole for the hatch was on the beaver panel (it was on the hatch on production liftbacks).The grill was an ST type - just like all 1973-1975 production <b>liftbacks</b> (even the GT models).Dual exhaust tips exited out the rear (production Celicas had a single exhaust tip).An electric aerial was put in the left rear quarter (the TA22 had this on the left front wheel guard).|$|R
25|$|Beginning in September 2011, Toyota USA {{began using}} the {{following}} names to differentiate the original Prius from some newer members of the Prius family: the standard Prius became the Prius <b>Liftback,</b> the Prius v (known as the Prius α in Japan, and Prius + in Europe), the Prius Plug-in Hybrid, and the Prius c (called Toyota Aqua in Japan).|$|E
25|$|Between 1979 and 1982, the Camry {{nameplate}} was {{delegated to}} a four-door sedan model in Japan, {{known as the}} Celica Camry. When Camry became an independent model line in 1982 with the V10 series, Toyota made it available as a five-door <b>liftback</b> {{in addition to the}} sedan. The subsequent Camry V20 series, debuted in 1986 with a station wagon substituting the <b>liftback</b> body variant and Japan-only hardtop sedans making their debut. The company replaced the V20 in 1990 with the V30 sedan and hardtop, but this model series was exclusive to Japan. Automotive tax regulations in that country dictated the retention of a narrower body as utilized in previous Camry generations. However, overseas demand for a larger Camry resulted {{in the development of a}} wide-body XV10 sedan and station wagon that arrived in 1991. Japan also received the wider XV10 as the Toyota Scepter (トヨタ・セプター). The company then issued an XV10-bodied coupé in 1993 that was spun off in 1998 as an independent model line, titled Camry Solara.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{expected}} the Prius Prime {{to achieve an}} EPA rating of , a 26% enhancement over the first generation model. Toyota targeted the fuel economy in hybrid mode to be equal or better than regular fourth generation Prius <b>liftback.</b> To reduce weight, Toyota used aluminum for the hood, and high-tensile strength steel. The Prius Prime features Toyota’s first carbon fiber rear hatch, which saves weight, while a dual-wave rear glass design helps cut drag.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} sold in New Zealand, but not Australia. Engines {{were the same}} as the Toyota Carina E, except there was no diesel variant. The station wagon variant was a badge-engineered Toyota Caldina. The sedans and <b>liftbacks</b> were {{assembled}} in Thames, New Zealand, while the wagon was imported fully built up from Japan. The locally assembled cars also received special spring and damper combinations (again developed by racer Chris Amon) as well as some other changes.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the demise}} of the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon in 1990, the Colt was the only subcompact in the Dodge and Plymouth lineups. The Colt sedan was not sold in the United States for the sixth {{generation}} (though it was sold in Canada), as it would be replaced by the Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance <b>liftbacks</b> in the Dodge/Plymouth lineup for 1989. In Canada only the Eagle Vista, a carryover model that replaced the Colt sedan continued when the Colt underwent a redesign. The sedan bodywork was available to American consumers as an Eagle Summit however, and the Dodge/Plymouth Colt sedans returned for 1993-94 as a variant of the next generation Eagle Summit. The Dodge/Plymouth Colt, Eagle Summit, and Mitsubishi Mirage of this generation used a 1.5 or 1.6-litre inline-four engine.|$|R
5000|$|The North American Celica had fixed door {{mirrors and}} amber front corner lights. All other models had folding mirrors and front clear corner lights. Driver's side SRS Airbag is {{standard}} on all US models. The base model ST has 1.6-liter 4A-FE, the GT and GT-S were {{powered by the}} 2.2-liter 5S-FE. The 1.6-liter {{was similar to the}} one used in the Corolla. The GT-S was rated [...] more than the GT at [...] The 2.2-liter was designed for more low-end torque, which appealed to US buyers' preferences as opposed to the high revving engines of the past. This engine was similar to the Camry's engine except for the balance shafts. The All-Trac Turbo was available with the improved 2.0-liter 3S-GTE engine. It was rated at [...] and 200 lbft Nm torque. The GT-S and all export market GT-Four/All-Trac are wide-body <b>liftbacks</b> with flared fenders. The Japanese market GT-Four was also offered as narrow-body for the pre-facelift model.|$|R
25|$|Global {{sales of}} the Toyota Prius <b>liftback</b> passed the 3 million {{milestone}} in June 2013. The Prius liftbak is available in almost 80 countries and regions, {{and it is the}} world's best-selling hybrid electric vehicle. Toyota released the hybrid versions of the Corolla Axio sedan and Corolla Fielder station wagon in Japan in August 2013. Both cars are equipped with a 1.5-liter hybrid system similar to the one used in the Prius c.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 (for the 2012 model year), the third-generation Prius <b>Liftback</b> {{receives}} modest {{style and}} equipment changes. The exterior changes include updated headlamps, revised tail lamps, plus a distinctive front fascia and bumper. The Prius can {{be equipped with}} an updated infotainment system featuring the optional Toyota Entune suite of connectivity features. Other updates include a 6.1-inch touch-screen, AM/FM CD player unit, a USB port for iPod connectivity, auxiliary input jack, Bluetooth hands-free phone capability and streaming audio.|$|E
25|$|An AMX Turbo Pace car {{was built}} {{to be one of}} four {{official}} safety cars in the PPG IndyCar World Series for the 1981 auto-racing season. There were two design proposals, both using the Spirit <b>liftback</b> body and designed by Richard A. Teague, AMC's Vice President of Automotive Design. One car was shown by PPG Industries featuring a white/red/blue/black painted production 1979 Spirit AMX with covered headlamps and integrated and smoothed front bumper and air dam unit.|$|E
2500|$|The Rally-based Spirit <b>liftbacks</b> were {{available}} in two sports versions, the standard [...] "Rally AMX" [...] and the high performance [...] "Rally GT" [...] in their first year. Both versions came standard with a Transmission Technologies Corporation (Tremec) 176-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, power brakes with front disks and rear drums, power steering, front and rear sway bars, heavy-duty shock absorbers and springs, seven-bladed flexible cooling fan, tinted windshield, leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, tachometer, center console with armrest and [...] "Rallye" [...] gauges plus rear ashtray, reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, split-back rear seat, three-point retractable seatbelts, woodgrain panels on dashboard, full light group (hood, courtesy, ashtray, glove box) except reading dome light, blacked-out dual remote-controlled mirrors and VAM-designed aluminum grille with a central [...] "Rally" [...] emblem. The Rally AMX had the standard [...] I6 using a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio, while the Rally GT came with the high-performance [...] version of this VAM engine and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The heavy duty cooling system consisting of fan shroud and coolant recovery tank was optional on the AMX and standard on the GT, some units of this version came with a clutch fan instead of the regular belt-type. The Rally AMX was the [...] "base model" [...] {{of the line and}} the Rally GT was closer to the European tradition of performance cars with its analog tachometer (instead of the AMX's digital tach), while convenience items such as air conditioning or automatic transmission were not available. The GT model also included a rear spoiler with electric liftgate lock release and eight-spoke steel wheels (which were optional on the AMX). The AMX came with VAM's own design five-spoke wheels with trim rings and blacked-out volcano hubcaps. The marketing effort by VAM's sales department had most GT units be equipped from the factory with all the options originally intended to be extra cost, such as rear defroster, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, and AM FM stereo radio aside from the already mentioned steel wheels and rear spoiler. These items were all optional on the AMX.|$|R
25|$|The AMC Spirit was a subcompact marketed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1979 to 1983 as a restyled {{replacement}} for the Gremlin. The Spirit shared the Gremlin's platform and was offered in two hatchback variations, each with two doors — marketed as sedan and <b>liftback.</b> Manufactured by AMC in Wisconsin and Ontario, as well as under license in Mexico, the Spirit was also marketed from 1981 to 1983 as the Eagle SX/4 with four-wheel drive.|$|E
25|$|The Prime's all-electric {{range was}} {{expected}} to reach , twice {{the range of the}} first generation model. Toyota expected the Prime to achieve an EPA rating of , a 26% enhancement over the first generation model, and the highest mpg-e rating in all-electric mode of any vehicle with an internal combustion engine. Toyota targeted the fuel economy in hybrid mode to be equal to or better than regular fourth generation Prius <b>liftback.</b> Unlike its predecessor, the Prime runs entirely on electricity in all-electric mode (EV mode).|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks {{as part of the}} convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets {{on the backs of the}} front seats, and a tonneau cover under the <b>liftback.</b> The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|After the {{development}} of the HQ series and the delays to the facelifted HJ which saw the revised HQ released in 1973, Holden intended to replace the second generations cars with a heavily revised WA series. Several design sketches in various forms have surfaced since the early-1990s, including a <b>liftback</b> body style. The 1973 fuel crisis along with a worsening financial situation, partly cause by the decision to build the HQ in right-hand drive only, thus limiting the previously highly profitable left-hand drive exports, meant that the project was eventually abandoned. GM instead utilised the then forthcoming 1977 Opel Rekord, which was significantly re-engineered and released as the Commodore in 1978 with Holden's own powertrains.|$|E
25|$|Japanese trims levels {{initially}} comprised LT, XT, SE, and ZX for Camry sedan. Lumiere and XE grades came to {{the market}} in June 1984, and the GLi TwinCam in May 1985. Vista sedan and <b>liftback</b> specification levels were at first VC (sedan only), VL, VE, and VX. The VF arrived in August 1982, and VR and VS models in June 1984 {{at the expense of}} the departing VE. Special edition models comprised: VE Extra (December 1982), VL Extra (January 1983), VL Super Extra (January 1985), VF-II (April 1985 and April 1986), and VL Grand Extra (December 1985 and April 1986). Wing mirrors became door-mounted as opposed to fender-mounted in May 1983. Facelifted models arrived in June 1984 featuring a new grille, redesigned bumpers, revised tail-lamps, updated dashboard, enlarged glovebox, and general trim alterations.|$|E
25|$|Toyota's hybrid {{sales in}} Japan since 1997, {{including}} both Toyota and Lexus models, passed the 1million mark in July 2010, 2million in October 2012, and topped the 3 million mark in March 2014. , TMC hybrid {{sales in the}} country totaled 4,853,000 vehicles, of which, only 4,900 units are commercial vehicles. Cumulative sales of the original Prius in Japan reached the 1million mark in August 2011. Sales of the Prius family vehicles totaled 3,435,800 units through January 2017. The Prius <b>liftback</b> is the top-selling model with 1,812,800 units, followed by the Aqua with 1,154,500 units, the Prius α with 446,400, and the Prius plug-in with 22,100. Cumulative sales of Honda's hybrid vehicles since November 1999 reached 25,239 units by January 2009, and in March 2010, Honda announced that the new 2010 Insight broke through 100,000 sales in Japan in just one year after its introduction.|$|E
25|$|Toyota started {{production}} {{of the first generation}} series Camry in March 1982 at the Tsutsumi plant. Designated the model code V10, when fitted with S-series gasoline engines it was known as the SV10, SV11, or SV12 depending on the exact version. Likewise, the C-series diesel versions are identified by the CV10 and CV11 codes. Released to the Japanese market on 24 March 1982, Toyota issued the V10 series as a four-door notchback sedan retailing at the Toyota Corolla Store dealerships. At the same time, a twinned model—the Toyota Vista—launched as a rebadged Camry sold at separate Toyota Vista Store locations. Five-door <b>liftback</b> versions of the Vista came to the market in August 1982, although outside of export markets the Camry remained exclusively a sedan. These cars served above the comparably sized Toyota Carina and Corona in the Toyota hierarchy. Unlike the preceding Celica Camry, exports were achieved with the first generation Camry to Australia, Europe, and North America.|$|E
25|$|The Toyota Aqua, {{released}} in December 2011, ranked {{as the second}} top-selling new car in Japan in 2012 after the conventional Prius. Totaling 262,367 units sold in 2013, the Aqua topped new car sales in Japan in 2013, including kei car sales. And with 233,209 units sold during 2014, down 11.1% from 2013, the Aqua was the top-selling new car in Japan {{for the second consecutive}} year. Again in 2015, with 215,525 units sold, down 7.6% from 2014, the Aqua ranked as the top-selling new car in Japan. The Toyota Aqua not only was the best-selling new car in Japan for three years running, from 2013 to 2015, but it is considered the most successful nameplate launch in the Japanese market of the last 20 years. In the first quarter of 2016, the Prius <b>liftback</b> surpassed the Aqua as the best-selling new car, the Prius ended 2016 as the best-selling standard car in the Japanese market with 248,258 units, followed by the Aqua with 168,208 units.|$|E
