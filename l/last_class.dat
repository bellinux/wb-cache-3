5|$|During {{the two-year}} {{life of the}} officer {{indoctrination}} program, about 930 women completed the training and were commissioned as SPAR officers. In late 1944, the USCG determined that this complement was sufficient for its needs and discontinued the program. However, to replace the officers who had gone overseas, and those separated from the SPARS, the officer candidate school was later reopened for one <b>last</b> <b>class.</b> The candidates were all former enlisted personnel, who received their indoctrination at the USCG training station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. The USCG strived to recruit officer candidates who already had some civilian training or work experience of the type {{that could be used}} without further training. As result, only about one third of the officers received any specialized training. However, the specialized training programs produced 203 communications officers, and 106 pay and supply officers, prior to its discontinuance in November and December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his <b>last</b> <b>class.</b> William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the Partenope class was {{prepared}} by Engineering Inspector Carlo Vigna, and {{was based on the}} earlier torpedo cruiser , the first modern vessel of the type built by Italy. The development of torpedo cruisers in Italy in the mid-1880s represented a shift away from the emphasis on large capital ships that had been built for the previous decade and toward the ideas of the Jeune École, which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships {{at a fraction of the}} cost. The Partenope class were followed by the , the <b>last</b> <b>class</b> of torpedo cruisers built by Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for its buildup in strength, {{the army had}} to train a large cadre of officers. On 10 June 1917 Middleton was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. as the adjutant of a reserve officer training camp. These camps were organized to take civilians {{and turn them into}} officers in ninety days, and as adjutant Middleton was responsible for directing the flow of paperwork for 2,700 officer candidates. By November 1917, his camp graduated its <b>last</b> <b>class</b> of officers, and Middleton requested to join a combat division. His request was granted and on 21 December 1917 he reported to the 4th Division at Camp Greene near Charlotte, North Carolina. Two days later, however, he received new orders to become the commander of a reserve officer training camp in Leon Springs, Texas. Here, he reported as ordered, and stayed until the mission was complete in April 1918.
