5|$|On September 10, Baldwin {{appeared}} on the <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight television program on CNN where he proclaimed that if elected president he would release U.S. Border agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos. The agents were sentenced to 11 and 12-year terms in prison, respectively, after shooting a drug smuggler on the US-Mexico border. Baldwin promised he would release the men during his {{first day on the}} job as president.|$|E
25|$|Moneyline premiered in 1980 and was CNN's main {{financial}} {{program for}} more than 20 years. As the show, hosted by <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> moved more towards general news and economic and political commentary, it was renamed Moneyline with <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Moneyline and then <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight. In 2010, Dobbs – the last remaining original host from the network's launch in 1980 – resigned amid controversy over his questioning of whether President Barack Obama was a native-born U.S. citizen – a qualification for the presidency required under the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Kaplan left CNN in August 2000, and Dobbs {{returned}} the following year, {{at the behest}} of his friend and CNN founder Ted Turner, becoming host and managing editor of the new and initially more general news program <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Reporting, which later became CNN News Sunday Morning. He also regained the helm of the newly renamed <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Moneyline (which became <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight in June 2003).|$|E
25|$|<b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> (born 1945), {{radio and}} {{television}} host.|$|E
25|$|Dobbs {{was born}} in Texas and lived there and in Idaho during his childhood. After graduating from Harvard University, he worked in {{government}} and banking before becoming a news reporter for several local media outlets. He had worked with CNN {{since its founding in}} 1980, serving as a reporter and vice president. He was the host and managing editor for CNN's Moneyline, which premiered in 1980 and was renamed <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight in 2003. Dobbs resigned from CNN in 1999, rejoined in 2001, and resigned again in November 2009. In 2011, he resumed anchoring <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight on Fox Business Network. He formerly hosted a syndicated USRN radio show, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Radio and has written several books since 2001.|$|E
25|$|From 2009 to 2012, Dobbs hosted <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Radio on United Stations Radio Networks. The three-hour {{daily show}} had {{affiliates}} in several major markets, including its flagship station (WOR) in New York City, Washington D.C. (WHFS), Miami (WZAB-AM) and the San Francisco Bay Area (KDOW), {{as well as}} stations such as WGNY-AM in Newburgh, New York. The show was guest-centered and featured political discussion and listener calls. It aired from 2 to 5 p.m. Eastern, directly competing with The Sean Hannity Show, The Tom Sullivan Show and The Dave Ramsey Show. Dobbs also hosts the financially themed <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Minute on the same network.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{expressed}} {{opposition to the}} deal included: The New York Times, Michael Savage, Lindsey Graham, The New Republic, The John Birch Society, Sean Hannity, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> Laura Ingraham; Bill Frist and Hillary Clinton, prominent politicians from two different parties; Bob Menendez, John Gibson, Jon Corzine, and Peter King. Senator Barack Obama stated {{his opposition to the}} deal. So did Senators Carl Levin and John Kerry.|$|E
25|$|On November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network {{announced}} that Dobbs would host {{a show on}} the channel. The network announced on March 3, 2011 the start date, show title, and time slot of Dobbs' new show. Titled <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight the program debuted on March 14, 2011, airing at 7 PM Eastern. That is the same title and time slot that Dobbs' old CNN show had.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 and 2001, CNN hired many {{key people}} such as Anderson Cooper, Aaron Brown, Paula Zahn and (rehired) <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs.</b> The {{leadership}} of the network also changed. Kaplan left CNN in 2000, and moreover Tom Johnson retired as head of CNN in 2001 after 10 years. Following his retirement, new management and increased competition from Fox News Channel led to the network's gradual decline during the decade.|$|E
25|$|Scheurer {{participated in}} only one debate with both Bean and McSweeney, {{although}} he and McSweeney participated together in several others. A poll released on October 29, 2006 showed Scheurer with 8% of the vote, compared with 42% for Bean and 39% for McSweeney. The poll showed Scheurer with 20% of the independent vote. On November 3, {{four days before the}} election, Scheurer received his first national media coverage, being featured on the CNN newsmagazine program <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight.|$|E
25|$|WFAN and Westwood One {{also brought}} in outside personalities into the slot. Among them were Boomer Esiason, Patrick McEnroe, Geraldo Rivera, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> and Chicago market sports radio host Mike North. As MSNBC also held its own {{claim to the}} slot, the cable network was able {{to have its own}} {{replacement}} shows simulcasted; these programs were hosted by in-house personalities David Gregory, Jim Cramer, and Joe Scarborough; eventually Scarborough would become the permanent replacement host on MSNBC with Morning Joe.|$|E
25|$|On November 3, 2008, WHFS flipped to {{a sports}} talk format, {{similar to that}} of sister station WFAN in New York City. Along with the format change came a new callsign: WJZ-FM. On November 10, 2008, the WHFS callsign was moved to 1580 AM which dropped its long-time call letters WPGC. The format was changed to talk, with {{programs}} hosted by Michael Smerconish (from sister station WPHT), Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> and Laura Schlessinger. The station dropped the calls on December 1, 2011, becoming WNEW.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Sirota {{became a}} {{contributor}} to The Huffington Post while writing his own blog. He was a regular guest on The Al Franken Show and makes guest appearances on The Colbert Report, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, NOW, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight, CNBC, and NPR. He {{is a senior editor}} at In These Times, a regular columnist for The Nation and the Intermountain Jewish News, and a past contributor to The American Prospect.

25|$|Coulter {{made her}} first {{national}} media appearance in 1996 {{after she was}} hired by the then-fledgling network MSNBC as a legal correspondent. She later appeared on CNN and Fox News. Coulter went on to make frequent guest appearances on many television and radio talk shows, including American Morning, The Fifth Estate, Glenn Beck Program, The Mike Gallagher Show, The O'Reilly Factor, Real Time with Bill Maher, Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Sean Hannity Show, The Today Show, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight, Fox and Friends, The Laura Ingraham Show, The View, The Michael Medved Show, and HARDtalk.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} academic models split {{the middle class}} into two sections. Yet, it remains common for the term middle class to be applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio-economic strata. The middle class is then often sub-divided into an upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle class. In colloquial descriptions of the class system the middle-middle class may be described as consisting {{of those in the}} middle of the social strata. Politicians and television personalities such as <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> can be seen using the term middle class in this manner, especially when discussing the middle-class squeeze. The wide discrepancy between the academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated professionals together in the same class with secretaries may lead to the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely ambiguous.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Colbert portrays in Report originated as an amplification of his self-important Daily Show correspondent. As {{they developed}} {{the character and}} the show Colbert and his staff began {{to look at some}} more specific models. Bill O'Reilly, whom the character affectionately nicknames [...] "Papa Bear", is the most commonly cited point of reference. In a 2006 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert remarked that, [...] "if it wasn't for , this show wouldn’t exist". In adapting the character for the Report, Colbert has also mentioned Aaron Brown, Anderson Cooper, Sean Hannity, <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> and Joe Scarborough as having an influence over his performance. References to the character's abuse of prescription drugs are believed to be an allusion to Rush Limbaugh's addiction to painkillers.|$|E

2500|$|On the November 11, 2009 {{edition of}} his nightly {{broadcast}} <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight, Dobbs announced his immediate departure from CNN, ending a nearly thirty-year career at the network, citing plans to [...] "pursue new opportunities".

2500|$|CNN's <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> {{criticized the}} boycott for its {{promotion}} by {{groups such as}} the radical protest organization ANSWER, (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism).

2500|$|<b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> was a {{registered}} Republican.

2500|$|On the May 23, 2006 {{edition of}} <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> Tonight, Dobbs' program {{displayed}} {{a map of}} Aztlán sourced to the controversial Council of Conservative Citizens. CNN spokeswoman Christa Robinson apologized for the graphic's use, saying: [...] "A freelance field producer in Los Angeles searched the web for Aztlan maps and grabbed the Council of Conservative Citizens map without knowing {{the nature of the}} organization.

2500|$|Others {{who opposed}} the {{proposal}} included Democratic Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand, Democratic County Executive Steve Levy of Suffolk County, and Long Island Democratic State Senator Craig Johnson. While the issue initially was significant only in New York, cable TV and talk radio made this a national controversy, as one of Spitzer's strongest critics was CNN host <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> who labeled Spitzer an [...] "idiot" [...] for this policy. While opposition to the driver's license proposal emerged from both political parties, Spitzer claimed his opponents were aligned with the [...] "rabid right." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Newark Star-Ledger {{political}} critic {{reviewing the}} book described Sirota as an [...] "enterprising" [...] reporter who used [...] "resourceful" [...] tactics to get entry into such venues as Capitol Hill, the Microsoft campus, an ExxonMobil stockholders' meeting, and the Mexican border.

2500|$|On September 17, 2009, Turner.com {{posted a}} list of all CNN {{transcripts}} covering the ACORN scandal, from the day the story was first released.

2500|$|In a scene {{shot at the}} Library of Congress in Washington,D.C., the {{production}} employed the presence of several real-world journalists amongst the extras in {{a scene in which}} Wright-Penn's character makes a statement to the press. The group included Bob Woodward, Margaret Carlson, Bob Schieffer, John Palmer, E. J. Dionne, Katty Kay, and Steven Clemons. Additionally featured are cameos by real-life news media commentators <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> of CNN and Chris Matthews of MSNBC. [...] Long-time Washington,DC area sportscaster Frank Herzog also has a non-speaking cameo as a congressman present at the PointCorp hearings.

2500|$|In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) {{identified}} Accenture {{as one of}} four {{publicly traded}} federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country. The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company. [...] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that [...] "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating {{as a series of}} related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{belief that}} a North American Union was being planned and {{implemented}} in secret became widespread, {{so much so that}} the NAU was a topic of debate during the 2008 American presidential campaigns and the subject of various U.S. Congressional resolutions designed to thwart its implementation. Prominent critics such as <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs,</b> then an employee of CNN [...] and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul denounced the concept, joined by left-wing nationalist groups in Canada, Internet blogs, and widely viewed videos and films such as [...] "Zeitgeist". Corsi’s 2007 book The Late Great USA: The Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada also helped bring the NAU discussion into the mainstream. These beliefs are the latest example of a long line of erroneous conspiracy theories which suggest that the United States’ sovereignty is being eroded by a cabal of foreign and domestic players.|$|E
2500|$|Never shy to {{draw upon}} right-wing sources, in April and March 2010, Cockburn wrote {{articles}} on Hispanic crime statistics, drawing {{on the work of}} Ron Unz, editor of The American Conservative, arguing that [...] "Hispanic crimes rates are at least the same as whites and--given the unknown number of illegal Hispanic immigrants in the country--could be considerably lower." [...] In CounterPunch Alexander went on to argue, {{on the basis of these}} statistics, and the US Census, that the estimates of 25 million Hispanic unreported illegal immigrants would mean that the true crime rates will be 35% lower than Unz estimates. He writes [...] "Almost beyond the shadow of a doubt, white crime rates nationwide are significantly higher than Hispanic ones." [...] He went on to criticise <b>Lou</b> <b>Dobbs</b> for [...] "scaremongering" [...] on the subject of illegal immigration.|$|E
