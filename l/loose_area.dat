30|$|The {{section of}} shield tunnel of the Chengdu Metro line passes {{primarily}} through sandy cobble strata. There are many buildings with spread foundations along the lines. Shield tunnel construction will disturb the ground, causing displacement or stress to adjacent spread foundations. Based on the similarity theory, a laboratory model test of shield tunnel driving {{was carried out}} to study the influence of shield tunnel excavation on the displacement of adjacent spread foundation. The results show that foundation closer to the tunnel has greater displacement or settlement than that further away. The horizontal displacement is small and is influenced greatly by the cutting face. The displacement along the machine driving direction is bigger and is significantly affected by the thrust force. Settlement occurs primarily when shield machine passes close to the foundation and is the greatest at that time. Uneven settlement {{at the bottom of}} the spread foundation reaches a maximum after the excavation ends. In a numerical simulation, a particle flow model was constructed to study the impact of shield tunnel excavation on the stresses in the ground. The model showed stress concentration {{at the bottom of the}} spread foundation. With the increasing ground loss ratio, a <b>loose</b> <b>area</b> appears in the tunnel dome where the contact force dropped. Above the <b>loose</b> <b>area,</b> the contact force increases, forming an arch-shaped soil area which prevents the <b>loose</b> <b>area</b> from expanding to the ground surface.

The important developmental distinction between axial (central) and lateral components obtains in the occipital {{as well as}} in the vertebral region. The lateral occipital components begin to show dense areas as the cervical region is approached. The lateral occipital and vertebral components arise in registration with the initial sclerotomes. In both the occipital and the vertebral region the related nerves and intersegmental arteries traverse the <b>loose</b> <b>areas</b> of the sclerotomes.

40|$|In recent years, the {{creation}} of a more economical bumping process has been the focus. One of the most promising technologies is the low-cost stencil printing based flip-chip technology. It consists of electroless Nickel/Gold (Ni / Au) Under Bump Metallurgy (UBM) plated on an Aluminum bond pad, followed by selective solder paste printing, using the stencil mask, on top of the UBM. It eliminates the expensive photolithography with thick photoresist and the usage of vacuum sputtering. Ni/Au UBM is not only important in stencil printed bumping technology, but also widely used in some of the anisotropic conductive flip chip technologies as conductive mini bump for the anisotropic conductive film (ACF). The redistribution (RDL) technology facilitates the adaptation of chips designed for wire bonding to flip chip bonding, and relaxes the otherwise tight wire bond pitch to a <b>loose</b> <b>area</b> array pitch. RDLs are formed by adding passivation and metal layers on the top of die, relocating the pads according to the design rules of the solder bumping process. The basic redistribution process includes both a reroute metal layer and additional dielectric layers. The redistribution metal can be aluminum, copper, or other metals. The choice of the conductive material is determined by the substrate and the electrical requirements of the IC. The most popular dielectrics for redistribution technology are Benzocyclobutene (BCB) and Polyimide (PI). BCB has a number of properties that makes it suitable for thick passivation including low moisture uptake, a low dielectric constant and a high degree of planarization over the topography in IC chips...|$|E
30|$|Experts {{opined that}} during key {{informant}} discussion Dhaka will lose its four major tributary rivers in near {{future as a}} result of the way land and housing development projects are encroaching the environmentally critical water bodies along with other development activities. Rapid urban expansion in ecologically critical areas of Dhaka has been an outcome of encroachment of almost all the major lakes of the city by public, private and individual developers altogether. These encroachments also have broken the interconnectivity of the lakes and canals to the surrounding rivers. Thus water logging and flooding have become a major problem.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF), a potent angiogenic and {{vascular}} permeability factor, {{is important in}} the angiogenesis of glioblastoma. A major difference between pilocytic astrocytoma, a grade I tumor, and the grade II fibrillary astrocytoma is the vascular proliferation, highly vascularized stroma, and great propensity for cyst formation in the former. In order to explore factors regulating such angiogenesis and cyst formation in pilocytic astrocytoma, we examined expression of VEGF and its receptors (KDR and Flt- 1) using in situ hybridization. In all 14 cases a high level of VEGF transcripts could be demonstrated. These were found in specific regions, namely, in the tumor cyst wall, in areas of hyaline cystic degeneration, in stellate reticulated astrocytes around microcysts in the biphasic compact and <b>loose</b> <b>areas,</b> and in tumor cells with degenerative pleomorphic multilobated nuclei. KDR and Flt- 1 were expressed in the tumor vasculature, with particularly high levels seen in coiled young proliferating vessels, especially those in the cyst wall. Given the known angiogenic and vascular permeability activities of VEGF, we propose that VEGF {{plays an important role in}} molding the characteristic morphologic features of this tumor, namely, the formation of cysts, microcystic pattern, hyaline cystic degeneration, hyaline vessels, and vascular proliferation. Mechanisms that block the VEGF pathway could constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this tumor. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|To {{characterize}} the cellular density and proliferative activity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -negative cells in pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), surgically excised tissues of PAs (n= 37) and diffuse astrocytomas (DAs) (n= 11) were examined morphologically and immunohistochemically using antibodies against GFAP, Olig 2, Iba 1 and Ki- 67 (MIB- 1). In PA, Olig 2 immunoreactivity was significantly expressed in protoplasmic astrocytes in microcystic, <b>loose</b> <b>areas</b> and cells in oligodendroglioma-like areas. Iba 1 -positive, activated microglia/macrophages were also commonly observed in microcystic areas. In compact areas, a prominent reaction for GFAP was observed, but for Olig 2 and Iba 1 {{to a lesser}} degree. On semiquantitative analysis, the number of Olig 2 -positive cells was significantly higher in PAs (mean labeling index (LI) ± standard deviation (SD) : 46. 8 ± 15. 4 %) than in DAs (13. 3 ± 7. 8 %) (P< 0. 001). Many Iba 1 -positive, microglia/macrophages were observed in PAs (19. 9 ± 6. 5 %), similarly to DAs (20. 9 ± 9. 9 %). Re-immunostaining of PA demonstrated that most Ki- 67 -positive, proliferating cells expressed Olig 2, whereas GFAP or Iba 1 expression in Ki- 67 -positive cells was less frequent (14. 7 ± 13. 7 %, and 8. 8 ± 13. 6 %) in a double immunostaining study. Conversely, the percentage of Olig 2 -positive, proliferating cells in total Olig 2 -positive cells (7. 2 ± 3. 9 %) was {{higher than that of}} Iba 1 -positive, proliferating cells in total Iba 1 -positive cells (0. 9 ± 0. 6 %). In conclusion, the present study found that PA consisted of numerous GFAP-negative cells, including Olig 2 -positive cells with high proliferation. Semiquantitative analysis of Olig 2 immunohistochemistry in microcystic areas might therefore be useful for the differential diagnosis of PA and DA学位記番号：医博甲 1088, 学位の種類：博士（医）, 学位授与年月日：平成 20 年 3 月 25...|$|R

The structure of a tannin-containing composition was found to affect the process of its diffusion throughout the structure of the topographic areas of the semifinished chrome-tanned product. In particular, we have determined that the depth of diffusion of the filling composition in <b>loose</b> <b>areas</b> was close to 100 % with a 5 % use of the mass of the intermediate product; in dense areas even with a bigger use of the mass, it was only 80 % of the thickness of the intermediate product. The structure of the filling and plasticizing composition was developed to form various leathers from hides of cattle and sheep. A protein hydrolysate and a highly dispersive modified aluminosilicate have proved to influence the process of forming and the physicochemical properties of semifinished leathers. If the filling and plasticizing composition contains optimal amounts of montmorillonite and protein hydrolysate at 4 - 2 % of the semifinished leather mass, the obtained leather materials have respective tensile strengths of sheepskin and bovine hides of 15 - 16 MPa and 20 - 22 MPa, and their stiffness is 15 - 16 and 21 - 22 SN. The use of montmorillonite in the filling and plasticizing compositions in processing semifinished chrome-tanned products proved to ensure stability of the dispersed structure in further processing and its mobility in the cyclic deformation of the products. The complex study of the process of filling and plasticizing semifinished chrome-tanned products was the basis for developing effective technologies to produce elastic materials for footwear leather uppers and apparel and haberdashery articles with the necessary physical and mechanical properties as well as bigger volume and area outputs by 270 - 310 сm 3 / 100 g of protein substance and by 5 - 6 %, respectively, in comparison with the outputs of the industrial technology.
