40|$|The paper {{reports on}} an {{empirical}} investigation {{in which the}} effect of lexicographic presentation and positioning <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> on encoding and retention was analysed.

The results show that the presentation and place <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> significantly affected their use.

40|$|AbstractThis {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the use <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> by Turkish {{learners}} of English and Asian learners of English. Two spoken learner corpora, namely the TC-SLE corpus (Turkish Corpus of Spoken Learner English) and ICNALE corpus (International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English) are used in order to make comparisons. The TC-SLE consists of Turkish learners’ spoken English in the form of classroom language, monologues and language used during group work and has been compiled by the researcher. The comparisons are based on the frequency counts <b>of</b> <b>collocations,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> commonly used by the two different groups of learners and the types of inaccuracies done by the two different groups of learners. Based on the comparisons, the study investigates whether first language background has an important effect on the use <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> and whether different groups of learners have similar problems in the use <b>of</b> English <b>collocations.</b> It was inferred that collocation use is among the most problematic aspects of spoken English for language learners and that factors not limited to but including first language significantly affect the use <b>of</b> <b>collocations...</b>|$|R

For example, in an investigation conducted by Marton (1977) on Polish learners’ collocational knowledge along with their capability to apply these collocations, multiple translation tests were taken by the participants as pre-test and post-test. In addition, the researcher made use of two comprehension tests consisting <b>of</b> the same <b>collocations</b> covered in the translation tests.

The scores from the collocation test were compared to those from the Test of Academic Literacy Levels (version administered in 2012). The {{results of this study}} indicate that, overall, knowledge <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> is significantly correlated with academic literacy, which is also observed at each of the frequency bands from which the items were selected. These results support Nizonkiza’s (2014) findings that a significant correlation between mastery <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> <b>of</b> words from the Academic Word List and academic literacy exists; which is extended here to words from other frequency bands. They also confirm previous findings that productive knowledge <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> increases alongside overall proficiency (cf.

This study therefore concludes that growth in productive knowledge <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> may entail growth in academic literacy; suggesting that productive use <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> is linked to academic literacy to a considerable extent. In light of these findings, teaching strategies aimed to assist first year students meet academic demands posed by higher education and avenues to explore for further research are discussed.

Moreover, it seems important to mention that most of the studies investigating the collocational knowledge of students learning English as their L 2, indicated students’ poor performance (Fayez-Hussein 1990; Aghbar 1990; Bahns and Eldaw 1993; Stubbs 2002; Wray 2002; Nasselhauf 2005; Ozaki 2011).

In Study 1, 810 adjective–noun collocations were extracted from 31 essays written by Russian learners of English. About half <b>of</b> these <b>collocations</b> appeared frequently in the British National Corpus (BNC); one-quarter failed to appear in the BNC at all, while another quarter had a very low BNC frequency. Based on frequency data and mutual information (MI) scores, it was discovered that around 45 % <b>of</b> all learner <b>collocations</b> were, in fact, appropriate collocations, that is, frequent and strongly associated English word combinations. When the study data were compared to data from native speakers, very little difference was found between native speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) in the use <b>of</b> appropriate <b>collocations.</b> Unfortunately, the high percentage <b>of</b> appropriate <b>collocations</b> does not mean that NNSs necessarily develop fully native-like knowledge <b>of</b> <b>collocation.</b> In Study 2, NNSs demonstrated poorer intuition than NS respondents regarding the frequency <b>of</b> <b>collocations.</b> Likewise, Study 3 showed that NNSs were slower than NSs in processing collocations.
