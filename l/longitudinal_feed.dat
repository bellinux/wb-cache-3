The grinding wheel rotates in the spindle head and is also adjustable for height, by any of the methods described previously.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{comprehensive}} framework for additive regression models for non-Gaussian functional responses, allowing for multiple (partially) nested or crossed functional random effects with flexible correlation structures for, e. g., spatial, temporal, or longitudinal functional data {{as well as}} linear and nonlinear effects of functional and scalar covariates that may vary smoothly over the index of the functional response. Our implementation handles functional responses from any exponential family distribution {{as well as many}} others like Beta- or scaled non-central $t$-distributions. Development is motivated by and evaluated on an application to large-scale <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feeding</b> records of pigs. Results in extensive simulation studies as well as replications of two previously published simulation studies for generalized functional mixed models demonstrate the good performance of our proposal.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the costs and}} benefits of long-distance horizontal migration by pelagic planktivores, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Norwegian and Barents seas using a numerical model and tested model predictions against field observations. Specifically, we considered (i) energetic costs as a function of body size, water currents, swimming speed, and distance, (ii) time costs as a function of speed and distance, and (iii) energetic gain in terms of differences in food intake between areas. The model demonstrates how body size restricts large-scale horizontal migration patterns. Model and field results suggest that the extent of migration will increase with increasing body length. The model predicts that long-distance migration costs may exceed energy intake for fish < 20 cm, due to increased hydrodynamical drag with decreasing fish size. Field results suggest that migration distance is a function of length, weight, and age. Food abundance and distribution, current speed and direction, and differences in day length at boreal latitudes are believed to be the major driving forces influencing large-scale migration distance, direction, and timing in pelagic planktivores. Northwards latitudinal rather than <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feeding</b> migrations are explained by the improved feeding opportunities with increased day lengths...|$|R
40|$|A novel <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feeding</b> {{design was}} used to {{investigate}} the controlling influence of dietary fatty acids on the dynamic incorporation of fatty-acyl chains into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin in inner membrane of cardiac mitochondria. Rats were fed a polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-rich oil (soya-bean oil) for 12 days, crossed-over to a monounsaturated-fatty-acid-rich oil (rapeseed oil) for the next 11 days, then returned to soya-bean oil for 11 more days. Additional rats were fed either soya-bean oil or rapeseed oil only throughout. Rats were killed serially. Regression analysis {{was used to}} represent longitudinal flux in membrane lipid fatty-acid composition occurring with change in dietary fat. The fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin was influenced by dietary oil in a reversible way. Maximal diet influence was achieved in the 11 -day cross-over period. Soya-bean oil to rapeseed oil cross-over caused the fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin to resemble that of rats fed rapeseed oil only. These changes were reversed by crossing back to soya-bean oil, indicating the dynamic state and short half-life of membrane phospholipid fatty-acyl chains. This report demonstrates {{for the first time in}} the whole animal fed diets adequate in all nutrients that subcellular membrane lipids rapidly respond to change in dietary fatty-acid balance.

The material of a strengthening tool is titanium alloy VT 6 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), which secured higher temperature in the friction contact zone and, therefore, more intensive alloying of the surface layer compared with a steel tool. The details of the MPT process are described in papers [6 – 8]. Special coolants were used for surface alloying: for carbonization—mineral oil with low molecular polyethylene additives [13], for nitriding— 10  % aqueous solution of aminil [14], for silicon saturation—polymethylsiloxane liquid PMS- 100, and for nickel and boron saturation—PMS- 100 with additives of their powders in a concentration of 15 and 18  % accordingly [15].|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{theoretical}} approach to the calculation of the temperature of the blade cutting tool, taking into account the distribution of heat released during the cutting process, formed between the chip and the surface layer of the workpiece. On the basis of the received analytical dependences for determining the temperature of cutting when turning the basic conditions for its reduction have been defined. They mainly consist in reducing the cutting adequate stress (machining energy consumption) by reducing the intensity of the cutter friction against the cutting material in the cutting zone by applying a high-speed processing, but also by reducing the main cutting edge angle. It has been shown that if the cutting speed and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feed</b> continuously increase the cutting temperature continuously increases as well, asymptotically approaching a constant value equal to the temperature of the produced chips. This indicates that with increasing speed of cutting and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feed</b> all the heat generated during cutting is spent on heating the chip, and just {{a small part of the}} heat goes into the workpiece. As a result, it is possible to improve the quality of the treated surface as the probability of forming burns, cracks, and other temperature microscopic defects occurring on the treated surface decreases. Calculations revealed that neglecting the heat going into the resulting chips in turning leads to a significant increase in cutting temperature up to the values physically unrealizable in cutting. Consequently, it is possible to calculate maximum cutting temperature close to the experimental values only taking into account the heat balance going into the chips and the surface layer of the workpiece. Practical recommendations for improving blade processing technology based on the reduction of thermal stress in cutting have been give...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{report on}} the {{proportion}} and characteristics of Australian infants who are fed, and mothers who feed, {{in accordance with the}} national and international breastfeeding duration targets of six, 12 and 24 months. Furthermore, to examine the longitudinal breastfeeding duration patterns for women with more than one child. Methods: Breastfeeding duration data for 9773 children have been self-reported by a national sample of 5091 mothers aged 30 – 36 years in 2009, participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. Results: Only 60 % of infants received the minimum recommended 6 months of breast milk, irrespective of breastfeeding exclusivity. Less than 30 % of infants received any breast milk at 12 months, and less than 3 % were breastfed to the international target of 24 months. Young, less educated, unmarried or low-income women were at an increased risk of premature breastfeeding cessation. For women with three or more children, nearly 75 % of women who breastfed their first child for at least six months reached this breastfeeding duration target for their next two children. Conclusion: While national breastfeeding rates are typically evaluated in relation to the infant, a novel component of our study is that we have assessed maternal adherence to breastfeeding duration targets and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feeding</b> practices of women with more than one child. Separate evaluations of maternal and infant breastfeeding rates are important as they differ in their implications for public health policy and practice...|$|R

The aim of this investigation was to identify contextual factors that influenced first-time mothers' breastfeeding practices in the immediate postpartum period. Employing an exploratory, qualitative design, data were collected through unstructured in-depth interviews with 19 primiparous mothers at one-month postpartum. Thematic analysis revealed two main themes: sociocultural and environmental influences, and lactation management. Although the participants wanted to succeed at breastfeeding, they faced many impediments in a society that was not supportive of lactating mothers. Health professionals' mixed messages, life stresses (short maternity leaves and lack of work place support for breastfeeding) and the participants' poor understanding of the physiological process of lactation presented obstacles for continued breastfeeding. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Early {{ontogeny}} {{is a time}} {{of rapid}} anatomical and behavioral development in most organisms. The degree of synchrony between form and function during this period, and the concomitant performance consequences, can strongly impact individual survival. Understanding the development of feeding during early ontogeny is important because nutrient acquisition universally influences organismal biology. A one-year, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feeding</b> study was conducted for two elasmobranch species that were selected for their disparate morphology, behavior, and habitat: the whitespotted bambooshark Chiloscyllium plagiosum and the leopard shark Triakis semifasciata. To quantify changes in cranial morphology, external attributes of the feeding apparatus were measured weekly. Additionally, specimens were dissected to examine trends in the growth of select muscles and the volume of the buccal cavity. To quantify feeding behavior, individuals were observed weekly using high-speed digital cameras as they consumed various food types. Suction performance was evaluated using particle image velocimetry and direct measurements of suction pressure. The cranial morphology of C. plagiosum exhibited primarily isometric growth while the cranial morphology of T. semifasciata was dominated by allometric growth. Allometric increases were noted in the cross-sectional area of every muscle examined in both species, though the primary hyoid depressor, the coracohyoideus, hypertrophied to a greater degree in C. plagiosum. Although intra-individual differences throughout ontogeny complicated comparison, modulation in response to food attributes was clearly evident in T. semifasciata but broadly absent in C. plagiosum. Over ontogeny C. plagiosum generated allometrically greater suction while T. semifasciata generated relatively less. The shape of the parcel of water ingested during feeding did not change over ontogeny in either species. The capacity to perform diverse feeding behaviors thro ughout ontogeny is not constrained in T. semifasciata but tends to be stereotyped and accompanied by enhanced performance in C. plagiosum. A functionally generalized feeding apparatus and repertoire may benefit T. semifasciata by allowing the use of diverse feeding behaviors in variable environments, such as estuaries, over ontogeny. Morphological and behavioral conservation of the feeding apparatus throughout ontogeny, however, may allow C. plagiosum to exploit taxonomically varied crevice-dwelling reef organisms using a single specialized behavior...|$|R

40|$|Count {{data with}} excess zeros {{relative}} to a Poisson distribution are common in many biomedical applications.

To account for the preponderance of zero counts and the inherent correlation of observations, a class of multi-level ZIP regression model with random effects is presented. Model fitting is facilitated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, whereas variance components are estimated via residual maximum likelihood estimating equations. A score test for zero-inflation is also presented. The multi-level ZIP model is then generalized to cope with a more complex correlation structure.

40|$|Abstract. Grinding-hardening is a thermo-mechanical process {{capable of}} {{simultaneous}} material removal and surface enhancement. However, there are difficulties {{in dealing with}} cylindrical workpieces, because of the complex 3 D-helical movement of the grinding-induced heat source. This paper investigates the effects of some key grinding parameters on the profile and microstructure variations of the hardened layer generated by a traverse cylindrical grinding, both experimentally and numerically. It {{was found that the}} ratio of the <b>longitudinal</b> wheel <b>feed</b> to the rotational speed of the workpiece R is most influential on the hardened layer profile. A larger R results in a thicker hardened layer but a more pronounced discontinuity of two adjacent hardening zones. Although a smaller R yields a relatively thinner hardened layer, the non-uniformity could be minimised by the overlapping of the grinding heating. The microstructure of the hardened layer can be altered by the tempering in subsequent grinding heating. A thermal analysis with the aid of the finite element method in conjunction with an experimental microstructural examination showed that the temperature distribution in the tempered region would lead to a variation of the precipitated carbide, and that a higher tempering temperature could result in a higher degree of the carbide precipitation and a more significant reduction of hardness...|$|R

Zn is very reactive with oxygen and form ZnO which is impermeable for most of the atmosphere elements, so their presences on the surface of the coating passivate the substrate from further oxidation. For this study, the effect of deposition time, coating thickness and microstructure of Zinc coatings on Copper substrates by friction surfacing process using a Vertical Milling Machine apparatus, was investigated.

40|$|Purpose. This {{research}} is aimed {{to obtain the}} regression dependence of the machinability on the chemical composition of pig iron (C, Cr, Mn and Ni) in cast state. Methodology. The method of active experiment planning was used to build a mathematical model. Cast irons of composition 1. 09 … 3. 91 % С; 11. 43 … 25. 57 % Cr; 0. 6 … 5. 4 % Mn; 0. 19 … 3. 01 % Ni were studied. Cutting tools with plates 10 х 10 mm out of ВК 8 according to State Standard 19051 - 80 were used for turning. Cutting modes: cutting depth – 0. 8 mm, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>feed</b> – 0. 15 mm/rot., spindle’s rotation frequency during turning – 200 … 360 rot. /min. Lubricating and cooling liquids were not applied. Evaluation of iron workability was produced by determining the linear tool flank wear per unit length of the cutting path. Findings. Mathematically probabilistic equation of the regression dependence of the cutting tool’s wear on the C, Cr, Mn and Ni content in the machined cast iron were obtained. It was established that {{with the increase of}} Cr content in the cast iron to 14. 8 % the cutting tool’s wear decreased as a result of formation of carbide eutectic which destroyed the doped ledeburite continuous frame. Further increase of chromium content promoted appearing of chromic carbides with high microhardness which considerably increased the tool’s wear. The conducted research shown that the minimum cutting tool’s wear 0, 18 mkm/m was observed during the machining of cast iron containing: 1. 09 % C, 14. 8 % Cr, 2. 3 % Mn and 1. 2 % Ni; and the maximum wear is 48, 96 mkm/m – when the content was: 3. 91 % C, 11. 43 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni. The tool’s wear reached 47. 61 mkm/m during the treatment of cast iron containing 3. 91 % C, 25. 57 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni. Originality. Mathematically probabilistic model of the dependence of the cutting tool’s wear on the C, Cr, Mn and Ni content in the machined cast iron has been elaborated by the author. Practical value.

Additional rats were fed either soya-bean oil or rapeseed oil throughout. Rats fed rapeseed oil had lower rates of ATPase-catalysed ATP/[32 P]Pi exchange than rats fed soya-bean oil. Arrhenius plots showed higher transition temperature (Tt) and activation energy (Ea) for rats fed rapeseed oil. Switching from soya-bean oil to rapeseed oil was dynamically followed by changes in the thermotropic and kinetic properties of the mitochondrial ATPase exchange reaction. Returning to soya-bean oil reversed these changes. The rapid and reversible modulation of Tt caused by a change {{of the type of}} fat ingested suggests that membrane physicochemical properties are not under rigid intrinsic control but are continually modified by the profile of exogenously derived fatty acids. The studies suggest that in vivo the activity of mitochondrial ATPase is in part determined by dietary lipid via its influence on the microenvironment of the enzyme.

Details for compressors used for generation and petrochemical plants and medical devices can be mentioned as a few examples. Plastic deformation during forming of the metals introduces residual stresses. Fatigue, creep and corrosion are typical failure mechanisms that are stopped or accelerated {{in the presence of}} tensile residual stress. Metal cutting as a manufacturing method generates residual stresses in the surface layer. The stress state in the near-surface zone of components is of special interest as the surface often suffers loads and consequently the cracks initiate and begin to grow at that location. The scope of this thesis is to investigate the properties of the machined surface with regards to measurement of residual stresses. The results achieved by X-ray diffractometry were compared with the results using a simulating method with the same cutting data for checking the accuracy of these two methods. This review highlighted the residual stress character and how they can be measured by X-ray diffractometry in two different directions, the transversal, the cutting direction, and <b>longitudinal,</b> the <b>feed</b> direction. For measurement of residual stress under the surface, the material was removed by an electro-chemical polishing method for not introducing more stress. The same procedure was checked using Finite Element simulations. The results obtained from the investigation clarified that: The residual stress measurement by X-rays was quite accurate in comparison with finite element simulation on the surface generated by turning on titanium alloy. There were compressive residual stresses in the cutting and feed directions of the cut. Residual stress is beneficial for delay of crack propagation.

40|$|Breastfeeding is a co-occupation that {{supports}} the life-course health of both infants and mothers, and occupational engagement in breastfeeding is often defined by exclusivity and duration. Public health, medicine, and advocacy groups recommend exclusive breastfeeding of infants to at least 6 months of age (AAP, 2005; USDHHS, 2011). Most women in the United States do not meet this recommendation, often due to barriers from contextual factors. Many of these factors supporting or hindering breastfeeding are identified, but their influence on breastfeeding duration and exclusive breastfeeding is less understood (Li et al., 2008). This study uses the life-course perspective of health to examine relationships among breastfeeding duration and exclusive breastfeeding and various contextual factors of maternal employment, child care setting, and maternal health status (USDHHS, 2010). Results may inform health policy decisions related to the broader occupation of mothering. Study data {{were obtained from the}} <b>longitudinal</b> Infant <b>Feeding</b> Practices Study II (IFPS II) conducted by the FDA and CDC from 2005 - 2007. IFPS II surveyed a national sample of more than 4, 900 mothers prenatally and repeatedly until their children were 12 months old (Fein et al., 2008). Bivariate and multivariate methods were used to measure association between the dependent variables breastfeeding duration and exclusive breastfeeding with personal contextual factors and contextual factors of maternal employment and child care setting. Duration of breastfeeding varied within the sample based on employment, childcare, and depression risk. The interaction of contextual factors also influences occupational engagement in breastfeeding. Recognizing and understanding those contextual factors that may influence duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding can assist in developing informed policies and practices likely to achieve the full health benefit of breastfeeding for mothers, infants, and society.

The number of population comparisons observed to be significantly differentiated were found to diminish at the subpopulation scale when nucleotide differences were examined, indicating that more complex processes underlie genetic structure at this scale. It is crucial that these complexities and uncertainties are afforded greater consideration in management and regulatory efforts...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the genetic parameters for <b>longitudinal</b> measurements of <b>feed</b> intake (FI) in a crossbred population of pigs to develop a genetic evaluation model for the estimation of breeding values for FI of Piétrain boars. Data were collected on crossbred pigs in test station in the context of the genetic evaluation system of Piétrain boars in the Walloon Region of Belgium. Trait analyzed was daily FI (DFI). Because there were no facilities to record individual DFI in the Walloon test station, individual DFI were assumed to be the total pen FI divided by the number of pigs per pen. The edited dataset consisted of 3, 902 measurements of DFI recorded on 1, 975 crossbred pigs from 75 purebred Piétrain sires and 150 Landrace dams from the hyperprolific Landrace K+ line. A random regression animal model with fixed effects of sex and pen, and random effects of additive genetic, permanent environment and residual was developed in this study. Random additive genetic and permanent environment effects were modeled with linear splines with knots located at 75, 100, 175 and 210 d. The mean DFI was 1. 979 kg/d with a SD of 0. 479 kg/d. Estimated heritability for DFI increased with age from 0. 02 at 75 d to 0. 30 at 210 d. Estimated genetic correlation between age decreased when age interval increased. These preliminary results are consistent with literature. However, additional research are ongoing to test alternative random regression models that should be better than using splines for longitudinal performance of DFI. Furthermore, genetic relationship between DFI and other production traits, like growth and carcass traits, must be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{associations}} between dietary intakes of fathers {{and their children}} at child age 20 months, 3 · 5 years and 5 years, and to determine if fathers 2 ̆ 7 intake predicts change in children 2 ̆ 7 s intake between 20 months and 3 · 5 and 5 years of age. DESIGN: The diets of fathers and their first-born children participating in the <b>longitudinal</b> Melbourne Infant <b>Feeding</b> Activity and Nutrition Trial (InFANT) Program were assessed using FFQ and three 24 h recalls, respectively. SETTING: Sixty-two pre-existing first-time parent groups were selected from fourteen local government areas within a 60 km radius of Deakin University Burwood, Victoria, Australia. SUBJECTS: Fathers and their first-born children at 20 months (n 317), 3 · 5 years (n 214) and 5 years of age (n 208). RESULTS: Positive associations were found between fathers 2 ̆ 7 and children 2 ̆ 7 s intakes of fruit and sweet snacks at 20 months (P= 0 · 001) and 5 years of age (P= 0 · 012). Fathers 2 ̆ 7 intake at child age 20 months was associated with change in children 2 ̆ 7 s intake for fruit, sweet snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages between child age 20 months and 3 · 5 years, and for sweet snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages between child age 20 months and 5 years (all P< 0 · 05). After adjustment for maternal intake, fathers 2 ̆ 7 intake of sweet snacks remained a predictor of change in children 2 ̆ 7 s sweet snack intake between 20 months and 3 · 5 years of age (P= 0 · 03). CONCLUSIONS: Associations between the dietary intakes of fathers and their children commence {{at a young age}} and continue through early childhood. Fathers should be included in future interventions aimed at improving children 2 ̆ 7 s diets...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{structure}} and function of the small intestine before and after enteral feeding given via a percutaneous feeding gastrostomy (PEG). It is not known whether this method of feeding provides a good luminal drive to the small intestine. Methods: Studies were performed of patients at the time of PEG placement, in a cross-sectional group after a period of feeding and in a smaller <b>longitudinal</b> subgroup. Enteral <b>feeds</b> were adjusted in volume and caloric content for each patient. Duodenal biopsies were taken during endoscopy for quantitative morphometry, and lactulose-rhamnose permeability tests were performed during the next day. Duodenal fluid was cultured quantitatively in the first study, and disaccharidases determined in the second study. Results: The first study of 15 patients, who had enteral feeding for a median (range) period of 13 (8 to 104) weeks, showed partial villous atrophy with normal crypt length, no increase in duodenal bacteriology, and abnormal lactulose-rhamnose sugar permeability due to rhamnose malabsorption. These changes were also present in 38 similar patients before enteral feeding. A second study before enteral feeding showed lowered maltase activity (24 patients), and similar intestinal permeability findings (22 patients). Twelve of these patients were followed longitudinally for 3 months of enteral feeding that maintained but did not improve nutrition, as assessed by body mass index and mid-arm muscle circumference, and there was no change in duodenal morphometry (11 patients), rhamnose malabsorption (4 patients), or disaccharidases (11 patients). Conclusions: These studies suggest villous atrophy was not due to an inflammatory enteropathy but resulted from a poor luminal "drive" associated with the enteral feeding. Enteral feeding maintained but did not improve nutrition status. Adrian Cummins, Geoff Chu, Logan Faust, George Chandy, John Argyrides, Trevor Robb, and Peter Wilso...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The early {{introduction}} of solid foods before 4 {{months of age}} {{has been associated with}} an increased risk of diarrhoea in infancy and a greater risk of wheeze and increased percentage body fat and weight in childhood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the level of compliance with national recommendations related to the timing of the {{introduction of}} solid foods and to describe the maternal and infant characteristics associated with the timing of the introduction of solids. Methods Subjects were 519 participants in the second <b>longitudinal</b> Perth Infant <b>Feeding</b> Study (PIFS II) recruited from two maternity hospitals in Perth, Western Australia in 2002 / 3. Data collected prior to, or shortly after discharge from hospital, and at 4, 10, 16, 22, 32, 40 and 52 weeks postpartum included timing of the introduction of solid foods and a variety of maternal and infant characteristics associated with the introduction of solid foods. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify those factors associated with the risk of introducing solid foods early, which for the purposes of this study was defined as being before 17 weeks. Results The median age of introduction of solid foods was 17. 6 weeks. In total, 44 % of infants had received solids before 17 weeks and 93 % of infants had received their first solids before 26 weeks of age. The strongest independent predictors of the early introduction of solids were young maternal age, mother smoking prior to pregnancy and not fully breastfeeding at 4 weeks postpartum. In general, mothers introduced solids earlier than recommended because they perceived their baby to either need them or be ready for them. Conclusion This study showed a high level of non-compliance among Australian mothers with the infant feeding recommendation related to the timing of solids that was current at the time. In order to improve compliance health professionals need to be aware of those groups least likely to comply with recommendations and their reasons for non-compliance. Infant feeding recommendations need to be evidence-based, uniformly supported by professionals and widely, clearly and consistently articulated if higher rates of compliance are to be achieved in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|In diamond {{grinding}} cutting forces {{affect the}} quality of the machined surface. We can estimate a wear rate of the diamond wheel by the magnitude of the forces and promptly resort to the restoration of its cutting properties. To solve this problem it is necessary to define a relationship between grinding wheel wear and cutting forces. There was no this dependence found in the sources of literature. The forces acting on a single worn diamond grain are considered to find the relationship between wheel wear and cutting forces. The main forces acting on the diamond grain are such as a reaction force of machining material, a frictional force over a worn place of the grain, and a total pressure on the contact surface of the grain and machining material. According to calculation results, in grinding the cutting forces are proportional to the hardness of machining material, and depend on the grain wear, {{as well as on the}} process operation conditions. The paper presents a technique for calculating the number of cutting (active) grains per unit surface of diamond wheel to determine a total cutting force in grinding. The number of cutting grains depends on the properties of diamond wheel and on the operation conditions of grinding process. During grinding a total cutting force is calculated through the single grain cutting force, the number of cutting grains per unit surface of the grinding wheel and the contact area between the wheel and the work piece. Theoretical calculation of the forces is based on the condition that protrusions of all cutting grains are identical and all grains have a maximum wear, i. e. maximum worn place of grain. Calculations based on proposed theoretical formulas are compared with the calculations from the empirical formulas given in the literature. Varying the operation conditions of grinding makes the comparison. Convergence of results in the range of 5 - 20 % is regarded as acceptable. On the BMSTU base flat diamond grinding of tungsten carbide (Т 15 К 6) work pieces was experimentally made. Experiments were carried out on the universal flat-grinding machine 3 G 71 M using a diamond grinding wheel 6 А 2 250 х 20 х 4 х 29 х 76 АС 6 160 / 125 А 1 100 % М 1 - 01  according to GOST 16170 - 91. When using this equipment, cutting operation conditions, namely grinding speed and <b>longitudinal</b> table <b>feed</b> were 35 m/s and 3 - 12 m/min, respectively. The work piece was clamped in a vise. Vise was set on the universal attachment. Device was installed on a three-component dynamometer brands Kistler 9257 B to measure cutting forces. Grinding was carried out under the following operation conditions: traverse Strav= 3 m/min, depth of cutting t = 20 μm. Grinding used a water-based cooling emulsion. Wheel speed was 35 m/s. The dynamometer was tuned to the frequency of signal equal to 250 Hz. After processing the experimental and calculated data were compared using the theoretical formulas. The maximum difference between them was 17 %. Owing to the presented model it is possible to obtain data on the diamond tool wear during cutting through a change of the tangential component of the cutting force. With the definite maximum wear of diamond wheel it is possible to calculate a threshold value of the tangential component of the cutting force. When the threshold value of the tangential component of the cutting force is reached, a diamond wheel must be subjected to dressing. On-time wheel dressing allows us to avoid reducing quality of the machined surface. Control of forces in the cutting zone is difficult to organize; the procedure can be performed by power control of the grinding spindle through the current control. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the distribution of feeding habits and dietary habits of Swedish children of different ages, to search for determinants of the observed distributions and to analyse some possible implications of those habits regarding health and growth. The present results emanate from a <b>longitudinal</b> study of <b>feeding,</b> growth and development of 312 infants and from a cross-sectional study on the dietary habits of 738 children aged 4, 8 and 13 years. The dietary assessement techniques used in these epidemiological studies are evaluated (e. g. 24 -hour recall, 7 -day recording of food intake and dietary history technique). The infant feeding habits in three communities are described and the variation of those habits in different strata is discussed. Breastfeeding habits are analysed using multivariate techniques. The energy and nutrient intake of weaned infants aged 6 and 12 months was characterized by a good supply of most nutrients in comparison with recommended dietary allowances. The mean energy intake of the studied, normally-growing infants at 6 months was 80 per cent of the recommended intake. The growth velocity {{during the first three}} months of life for entirely breastfed infants was found to be higher than for mixed-fed or formula-fed infants. The need for a revision of present growth standards for use in breastfed populations during the first 6 months of life is discussed. An attempt was made to formulate a causal model for dental caries, including dietary factors and caries-preventive activities, and to make som quantitative interpretations from this model and the present set of data. Dietary habits associated with different short- or long-term health risks were analysed in the ages 4, 8 and 13 years. The dietary intake of iron was satisfactory and no cases of iron deficiency anaemia were found. On average 10 per cent of the daily energy intake derived from sucrose. The fat intake was characterized by a high intake of saturated fat and a low P/S ratio. Most children had a daily sodium intake above recommended levels. The prevalence of obesity differed between different social strata, especially in the oldest age group. Overweight children did not have a higher energy intake than normal-weight children. The need for a population approach to prevention in childhood of some diet-related health problems in adult life is discussed. The present dietary patterns and health of children in northern Sweden are compared with the situation 15 and 50 years ago, when nutrition surveys were performed in the same areas.
