Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions.

5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties.

25|$|In appeals {{cases the}} Supreme Court {{generally}} had three remedies available: direct appeal from a decree {{of a lower}} court (comparable to a writ of Certiorari), and judicial review of an entire case (comparable to a petition for a writ of Mandamus), both in cases decided by the judiciary, and by an arbiter. In cases of original jurisdiction (which were ipso facto also cases of final jurisdiction) the court had all the usual <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> avalilable. The court had also single jurisdiction over petitions for rechterlijke middelen van herstel en gunst, a number of <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> that had been executed by the Hoge Overheid (Sovereign) under his powers of Grace and Pardon but now fell to the courts. An example are acts of cession by debtors. In these cases the Supreme Court usually committed the case to a lower court for disposal.

25|$|The {{superior}} courts {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> and relief.|$|E

For its part, WAP argued that an absolutist free speech doctrine ended up compromising the civil rights of women.

25|$|After the massacre, {{the village}} was {{practically}} abandoned {{for a number of}} years and the survivors were told that reprisals would follow if they spoke about the incident or revealed the location of the numerous mass graves they had helped to dig. With the gradual return to democracy that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the survivors felt they could begin to talk about the killings without fearing for their lives. Accusations were filed with the authorities in 1992 and, in 1993, a criminal investigation was launched. However, faced with delays and other irregularities in the proceedings, and stonewalled by a National Reconciliation Law that granted amnesties to the suspected perpetrators, the survivors saw that Guatemala's domestic <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> were ineffective in this case and consequently decided to lodge a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the supranational human rights arm of the Organisation of American States, in 1996.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the active}} {{participation}} of {{many women in}} the revolution helped awaken many women about their political potential, and many middle-class women acted increasingly to support women’s rights. Increasing vocal opposition to policies which sanctioned polygamy, temporary marriage, free divorce for men, and child custody to fathers also took hold. A growing trend of women began to interpret Islam in more gender-egalitarian ways with the entry of more women {{in the public sphere}} and limitation of discourse to Islamic parameters. Growing activism and publicity brought some <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> to the women’s struggle for example limits on a husband’s right to prevent his wife from taking a job, and a new marriage contract which gave women the right to divorce. Judges became more sympathetic to women’s issues because of the hardship, and when some reforms did not make it through the legislative process, the government tried to ameliorate some of the injustices and gave instructions to the courts on how to do so.|$|E
25|$|The Instructie {{that the}} States-General drew up, promulgated on 31 May 1582 by William the Silent, to {{regulate}} the Supreme Court was in large part based on the Ordonnance of 1559 that governed the Great Council.

The first 50 articles describe the jurisdiction and competence, composition and internal procedures of the court. Then follow the articles governing the work of the procureur-generaal (sollicitor-general) and advocaat-fiscaal (attorney-general) (art. LI-LXIII). Next follow articles regarding the griffier (Clerk of court) and secretaries (art. LXIV-XCIII). Then follow rules governing the competence and procedure of the court (XCIV-CIV), directly followed by rules about the way the bailiffs would execute the decrees of the court (CV-CXX). Then follow rules about the division of work between procureurs (sollicitors) and advocaten (attorneys, barristers), and the tariff for their services (CXXI-CLXVI), followed by rules about the procedures during trials (CLXVII-CXC). And finally details about the different <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> to be sought before the court were given (CXCI-CLXXXXIX).|$|E
