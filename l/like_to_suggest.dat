25|$|The war {{prevented}} Peter Holtz and {{his group}} in Rostock from being recognized {{side by side with}} von Euler as discoverers of the second catecholamine transmitter noradrenaline. Their approach was different. They sought for catecholamines in human urine and found a blood pressure-increasing material Urosympathin that they identified as a mixture of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. “As to the origin of Urosympathin we would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the following. Dopamine in urine is the fraction that was not consumed for the synthesis of sympathin E and I. … Sympathin E and I, i.e. noradrenaline and adrenaline, are liberated in the region of the sympathetic nerve endings when these are excited.” The manuscript was received by Springer-Verlag in Leipzig on October 8, 1944. On October 15, the printing office in Braunschweig was destroyed by an airstrike. Publication was delayed to volume 204, 1947, of Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie. Peter Holtz later used to cite the paper as ″Holtz et al. 1944/47″ or ″Holtz, Credner and Kroneberg 1944/47″.|$|E
2500|$|A popular {{hypothesis}} is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time. The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like Cailleach figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. Margaret Murray proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, [...] "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..." ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{questions}} raised {{as to the}} accuracy of the information and the evidence used in the trial. Dr. Elaine Samuels, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, had originally concluded that hairs recovered from the body were consistent with that of the victim; after Dr. Samuels had come to that conclusion, the hair evidence was examined by Diane Hanson, a hair analyst from a crime lab in Madison, Wisconsin. Hanson stated that two of the hairs were consistent with samples taken from Laurie Bembenek's hairbrush. Dr. Samuels refuted that claim, stating in a 1983 letter, quoted in the Toronto Star in 1991, that [...] "I recovered no blonde or red hairs of any length or texture ... ll of the hairs I recovered from the body were brown and were grossly identical to the hair of the victim ... do not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that evidence was altered in any way, but I can find no logical explanation for what amounted to the mysterious appearance of blonde hair in an envelope that contained no such hair {{at the time it was}} sealed by me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Only now are {{scholars}} {{beginning to}} chart its {{course in the}} science of the age, and we {{have every reason to}} expect that it will prove to be very important there as well. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest,</b> that patronage, together with other practices that the age itself reveals to us, may be the avenue most likely to lead us into a fruitful social history of the Scientific Revolution, a movement to which the present generation of scholars has devoted itself extensively. In our investigations, it appears to me, we have allowed ourselves to be dominated excessively by concepts derived in the nineteenth century which are more applicable to that century and our own than to ... Efforts to impose them on the 17th century have appeared forced and largely barren, and I want to propose, not as a new dogmatism, but as a topic for discussion, the possibility that we need to come at the problem from a different angle, using seventeenth-century categories instead of nineteenth-century ones. Patronage was certainly a seventeenth-century category.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but what I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E

At first, he focused—in what a publisher described (considering his parallel employment writing for television) as [...] "nibbling the hand that feeds him"—on television criticism in his usual droll style; a collection of this criticism was published in 1955 as The Book of Little Knowledge: More Than You Want to Know About Television.|$|R

60|$|He was {{sufficiently}} affectionate, {{that being a}} matter on which she did not require much demonstration; but joined to his affection there seemed to be--; she hardly <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> herself a harsh word, but could it be possible that {{he was beginning to}} think that she was not good enough for him? And then she asked herself the question--was she good enough for him? If there were doubt about that, the match should be broken off, though she tore her own heart out in the struggle. The truth, however, was this--that he had begun that teaching which he had already found to be so necessary. Now, had any one essayed to teach Patience German or mathematics, with that young lady's free consent, I believe that she would have been found a meek scholar. But it was not probable that she would be meek when she found a self-appointed tutor teaching her manners and conduct without her consent.|$|R

500|$|In 1898, as {{a result}} of overwork, Shaw's health broke down. He was nursed by Charlotte Payne-Townshend, a rich Anglo-Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs. The {{previous}} year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry. He had declined, but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country, Shaw, concerned that this might cause scandal, agreed to their marriage. The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898, in the register office in Covent Garden. The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty-one. In the view of the biographer and critic St John Ervine, [...] "their life together was entirely felicitous". There were no children of the marriage, which it is generally believed was never consummated; whether this was wholly at Charlotte's wish, as Shaw <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest,</b> is less widely credited. In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of Wagner's Ring cycle, published as The Perfect Wagnerite late in 1898. In 1906 the Shaws found a country home in Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire; they renamed the house [...] "Shaw's Corner", and lived there {{for the rest of their}} lives. They retained a London flat in the Adelphi and later at Whitehall Court.|$|R

The advent of technology has brought to the usage of mobile technology in museum, thus ensure visitor’s meaningful experiences. Further, the integration of mobile technology in museum has facilitated visitor’s understanding on information about artifacts in the museum. In addressing this issue, the present study focused on designing a 'Mobile Apps. Learning' application as an approach to deliver an information to museum’s visitor. The study also aims to determine the usability, and factors that might influence museum visitors' usage of 'Mobile Apps. Learning' application, that was self-developed for this study. Systematic instructional materials procedures and phases were implemented in designing the “Mobile Apps. Learning’ application.
