50|$|The {{island and}} {{differentiated}} itself {{from many of}} the others in the Aleutian chain by supporting a large and diverse group of seabirds, most famously for their colony of more than 100,000 crested auklets and 150,000 least auklets, which was one of only seven colonies in the Aleutian chain. Other species included seabirds such as the <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>petrel,</b> the whiskered auklet, the ancient murrelet, gulls, guillemots, and cormorants. These seabirds attracted many avian predators as well, such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons. The birds of Kasatochi were the dominant vertebrates on the island and the most prominent link between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems.|$|R

40|$|Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) is a {{worldwide}} spread pathogen which penetrates host skin and then induces several diseases in infected host, such as fibrosis, formation of granulomas, hepatocirrhosis, and hepatomegaly. In present study, {{for the first}} time, transcriptomic profiles of mouse livers and skins infected by <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>S.</b> japonicum cercaria or non-fork-tailed S. japonicum cercaria were analyzed by using RNA-seq. The present findings demonstrated that transcriptomic landscapes of livers and skins infected by <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>S.</b> japonicum cercaria or non-fork-tailed S. japonicum cercaria were different. S. japonicum has great influence on hepatic metabolic processes. <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>S.</b> japonicum cercaria upregulated hepatic metabolic processes, while non-fork-tailed S. japonicum cercaria downregulated hepatic metabolic processes. For the metabolism process or the metabolism enzyme expressional change, the pharmacokinetics of host could be changed during S. japonicum infection, regardless the biotypes of S. japonicum cercariae. The changes of infected skins focused on upregulation of immune response. During the S. japonicum skin infection period, <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>S.</b> japonicum cercaria infection induced stronger immune response comparing with that immune response triggered by non-fork-tailed S. japonicum cercaria.

40|$|Antenna {{diversity}} {{has been}} used as a method to mitigate multipath fading. For mobile communications, this has usually been at the base station, but there is an increasing demand for diversity antennas to be implemented at the mobile. In this case, there is often a main antenna, as in any other handset, and also a smaller diversity antenna. With such antennas, it is difficult for both to maintain high mean effective gain (MEG), which is a disadvantage to the overall system performance. Also, implementing more than two elements usually increases the handset volume. An intelligent quadrifilar helix antenna (IQHA) (see <b>Leach,</b> <b>S.</b> M. et al., IEE Proc. on Microwaves, Antennas and Propag., vol. 147, no. 3, p. 219 - 23, 2000) is based on four helix antenna elements that can be combined to allow beam steering towards satellites and terrestrial base stations. Combining the elements in an appropriate fashion gives scope for a four-branch diversity system. The paper investigates why an IQHA provides good diversity potential. An IQHA is primarily an angular diversity system and it is shown that the equal gain combining (EGC) method (see Saunders, S. R., "Antennas and Propagation for Wireless Communication Systems", Wiley, 1999) provides the highest system gain since there is a significant increase in MEG. The analysis is carried out both for the standard sized IQHA and the reduced-size meandered IQHA...|$|R
40|$|Optimisation of S {{release from}} decomposing {{soil organic matter}} and S {{fertiliser}} related to plant S uptake is a central issue and goal in applied research in agricultural systems. Two lysimeter experiments were conducted in central Italy in two subsequent seasons on two commercial durum wheat cultivars to investigate the effects on yield, S and N uptake and leaching of different rates of N and S fertilisers, soil type and split applications of S. Sulphur fertiliser increased grain yield and N and S uptake of both varieties. Grain yield increase was mainly due to an increase {{of the number of}} kernels per spike, which was interpreted as a stimulation of the initiation of spikelets and/or florets, or to a reduction the floret mortality. As an average of the two seasons, <b>S</b> <b>leaching</b> during wheat cycle was 35 kg S ha− 1. Sulphur fertiliser rate increased S concentration in drainage water and consequently <b>S</b> <b>leached</b> during wheat cycle. Compared to unfertilised control, <b>S</b> <b>leached</b> was by 13 kg ha− 1 higher at 60 kg S ha− 1 and by 19 kg ha− 1 higher at 120 kg S ha− 1. The splitting of sulphur fertiliser during crop cycle modified both grain yield and <b>S</b> <b>leaching.</b> The highest grain yield and S plant uptake was obtained with the splitting of S rate into 60 kg S ha− 1 before seeding and 60 kg S ha− 1 at stem elongation and the lowest amount of <b>S</b> lost by <b>leaching</b> occurred with the application of 36 kg S ha− 1 before seeding and 84 kg S ha− 1 at stem elongation. Sulphur output was equally accounted for by leaching and plant uptake. The input–output balance of S was positive in both experiments only when the higher S rate was applied, as more S was imported than removed. Thus, no substantial S deficit may be expected in short term, provided that high S fertiliser rate is applied and the availability of S is synchronised with plant needs...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} cost {{of agricultural}} grade sulphur {{and the high}} leaching losses of sulphate sulphur(S) from superphosphate fertilized pastures in New Zealand create a need to develop more efficient S fertilization techniques. The objective {{of the present study}} was to identify the main origins of the sulphate being leached from superphosphate fertilized hill country pastures with soils (Typic Dystrachrepts) developed from underlying sedimentary parent materials. Origins of leached sulphate were categorized as <b>S</b> <b>leached</b> directly from fertilizer, from zones enriched in animal excreta and from the mineralization of soil organic matter. Mineralization studies, both in la??oratory and in field were conducted to establish the extent of and the relationship between sulphur and nitrogen mineralization and the fate of mineralized nutrients in pasture soils that contrasted in their superphosphate fertilizer history. In the preliminary laboratory study in which an open incubation technique was used to measure potential net mineralization, top soils (0 - 7. 5 cm) taken from sites that had received higher rates of superphosphate in the past, mineralized more soil organic sulphur and nitrogen than soils taken from sites that had received smaller amounts of superphosphate in the past. In addition top soils collected from low slope (0 - 12 °) sites where a greater proportion of animal excreta is returned, mineralized more S and N than the soils from medium slope (13 - 25 °) sites. The ratio of N to S mineralized was narrower (2. 0 to 3. 6) than the N to S ratio of the whole soil (7. 1 to 8. 9) suggesting that in these soils relatively more S remains in a mineral form in the soil and is more susceptible to leaching than N which is conserved in the soil. Cylindrical, mini-lysimeters with ion exchange resin traps for collecting solutes from drainage water were developed to measure the net mineralization of soil organic S and N under field conditions. <b>Leaching</b> losses of <b>S</b> and N, pasture uptake of S and N and changes in mineral S and N pools in the soil at the same site were measured simultaneously and the rate of mineralization calculated. A laboratory evaluation of the lysimeter showed that the resin trap was capable of removing all the sulphate from drainage water at several different flow rates. The main advantage of these lysimeters over the conventional methods of measuring the leaching losses of anions and cations in the field is that regular drainage collection was not necessary. By introducing mixtures of both anion and cation exchange resins in the trap in the lysimeter it was possible to monitor the amount of anions and cations in field drainage over long periods of time before it was necessary to change the resin mixtures. In the initial field lysimeter study the net mineralization and pasture uptake of N (119 to 251 kg N ha- 1) was 10 times more than that of S (12 to 27. 5 kg S ha- 1), yet approximately 10 times more sulphate S (2. 0 to 17. 3 kg S ha- 1) than mineral N (0. 19 to 1. 3 kg N ha- 1) was lost by leaching. Previous fertilizer history had a marked effect on the leaching losses of sulphate with seven times more S lost (2. 1 vs 1 5. 3 kg S ha- 1) from sites which received greater rates of superphosphate and had higher stocking rates. During the initial seven month period <b>S</b> <b>leaching</b> losses on the low and high fertility sites were equivalent to 1 5 % and 3 3 % of the annual fertilizer application. More sulphate was leached from areas identified as animal camping areas. The lack of any change in sulphate below the 150 mm soil depth during a period of active plant growth and no leaching suggested that any sulphate that moved below 1 50 mm of the soil could be considered to be effectively lost from the system. Increased leaching losses of calcium and magnesium were associated with increased sulphate losses. The amount of calcium lost by leaching (4. 7 5 to 12. 5,kg Ca ha- 1) was far greater than potassium (0. 8 to 3. 6 kg. K ha' 1), although twice the amount of potassium (240 kg K ha· 1 vs 120 kg Ca ha' 1) was. cycled through the plant-animal system. The amount of magnesium lost by leaching was greater than the amount of potassium lost by leaching. In a second lysimeter study the direct effects of freshly applied fertilizer on the mineralization of S and N from soil organic matter, their plant availability and losses by leaching were studied under field conditions using 35 S labelled superphosphate. Fertilizer application significantly increased the mineralization of both organic S and N. The recovery and measurement of 35 S activity over a nine month period showed that major proportions of pasture S (8 5 and 8 6 % of the pasture S for low and high fertility farmlets, respectively) and <b>leached</b> <b>S</b> (75 and 87 % of the <b>leached</b> <b>S</b> for low the mineralization of soil organic matter and not recently applied fertilizer. The amounts of both S and N mineralized from soil organic matter depends upon the past fertilizer history of the site and the present fertilizer application rate (22 and 40 kg S ha- 1 and 125 and 204 kg N ha- 1 for low and high fertility farmlets, respectively). Further, when the net mineralization of S was greater a greater proportion (59 %) of mineralized S was lost by leaching than removed by pasture (39 %). Irrespective of the amount N mineralized virtually all was removed by pasture. The results suggested that low N availability was a major factor limiting carbon fixation and the formation of organic S in these pasture soils. In a third lysimeter study, field simulated sheep dung and urine events boosted pasture growth and S and N uptake by approximately (50 %), whereas the <b>leaching</b> losses of <b>S</b> and N were not influenced by the their application. A preliminary computer simulation model describing the mineralization of soil organic S, pasture <b>S</b> uptake and <b>leaching</b> losses in grazed pasture was developed. The preliminary model gave reasonable predictions of the changes in soil sulphate concentrations in the soil up to a depth of 25 cm, pasture uptake of <b>S</b> and <b>leaching</b> losses of <b>S</b> at four pasture sites varying in their fertilizer history. Further refinement of the model is necessary before it can provide the basis for predicting fertilizer S requirement for hill country pastures. The experimental results and model output confirm balance study predictions that large <b>leaching</b> losses of <b>S</b> occur and these are derived mainly from the mineralization of soil organic matter which accumulates in well fertilized soils. The extent of S losses appear to be a function of the general levels of soil productivity and the data suggested that only a small, probably less than 20 % reduction in this loss could be achieved by changing to slow release S fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|Metaldehyde {{removal from}} aqueous {{solution}} was evaluated using Granular Activated Carbon(GAC), a non-functionalized hyper-cross-linked polymer Macronet (MN 200) and an ion-exchange resin (S 957) with sulfonic and phosphonic functional groups. Equilibrium experimental data were successfully described by Freundlich isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity of S 957 (7. 5 g metaldehyde/g S 957) exceeded those of MN 200 and GAC. Thermodynamic studies showed that sorption of metaldehyde onto all sorbents is endothermic and processes are controlled by entropic rather than enthalpic changes. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that experimental data for MN 200 and GAC obey pseudo-second order models with rates limited by particle diffusion. Comparatively, S 957 was shown to obey a pseudo-first order model with a rate-limiting step of metaldehyde diffusion through the solid/liquid interface. Results obtained suggest that metaldehyde adsorption onto MN 200 and GAC are driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, as leaching tendencies were high since no degradation of metaldehyde occurred. Conversely, adsorption of metaldehyde onto S 957 occurs via ion-exchange processes, where sulfonic and phosphonic functionalities degrade adsorbed metaldehyde molecules and failure to detect metaldehyde in <b>leaching</b> studies for <b>S</b> 957 supports this theory. Consequently, the high adsorption capacity and absence of <b>leaching</b> indicate <b>S</b> 957 is promising for metaldehyde removal from source water...|$|R
