5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone <b>laid</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E

Finkelstein says that Goldberg admits to personally sending prisoners to the zinzana, which he says has been repeatedly condemned as torture in human rights reports. Goldberg referred to the allegation as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and he had [...] "never <b>laid</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> anybody." [...] Goldberg said his [...] "principal role" [...] was [...] "making sure prisoners had fresh fruit." [...] He characterized Finkelstein as a [...] "ridiculous figure" [...] and accused him of [...] "lying and purposely misreading my book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Path of Fire was {{released}} on May 21/24 2010 in Europe and on May 25 in the U.S. via Metal Blade Records. In June, Aeon released a music video for [...] "Forgiveness Denied" [...] and Dlimi commented {{on the theme of}} the song and video: [...] "There {{have been a lot of}} scandals revealed lately, regarding priests (especially catholic ones) who have been abusing children sexually. In my world, there is nothing more innocent than a child, and the ones who abuse a child sexually will never be forgiven. In my opinion, they deserve to die a horrible, painful death. We want to dedicate this song/video to them, the filthy fucking priests who have <b>laid</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a child sexually; we hate you, and want you dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) {{went on to}} face John Cena at WrestleMania. On the SmackDown! after No Way Out, Cena and The Big Show {{defeated}} JBL and Orlando Jordan. The following week, JBL cut a promo and Cena, and insulted him, while Cena {{defended his}} United States title against Jordan. Jordan won the title after the Basham Brothers distracted the referee, and JBL hit Cena with the WWE Championship belt. They then blew up Cena's customized design of the United States Championship, {{and replaced it with}} the original one. Later that night, Cena attacked the General Manager, Long, and was thrown out of the arena. During JBL's match that night, Cena returned and attacked JBL's cabinet. The next week, Long announced that if Cena <b>laid</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> JBL, apart from in matches, he would lose his WrestleMania match. In a six-person tag team match that night, Cena's team won, but Cena had to stop himself from attacking JBL after the bell had rung. On a later episode of SmackDown!, Long clarifies that if JBL physically provoked Cena, then Cena could retaliate. Cena then attempted to provoke JBL, by vandalising his limousine, and spray painting [...] "FU" [...] on JBL's shirt. On the last SmackDown! before WrestleMania, however, JBL had Cena arrested for vandalism and, once Cena was handcuffed, attacked him. At WrestleMania, Cena pinned JBL after an FU, to win the WWE Championship for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Australia ruled out any Chinese involvement in security operations when the Olympic torch arrives in Australia. Chinese flame attendants will be allowed into Australia, but only to maintain the flame. The chairman of the Canberra relay taskforce, Ted Quinlan, has stated they [...] "could be subject to arrest [...] if they <b>laid</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> somebody". On April 22, Chinese ambassador to Australia Zhang Junsai stated that the flame attendants would [...] "use their bodies" [...] to protect the torch in Canberra. Following a talk with Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates, Ambassador Zhang subsequently said that his statement had been [...] "misinterpreted". Coates said that the flame attendants were [...] "technical assistants", and re-iterated that they would play no security role. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} the Canberra relay, Australian and Chinese officials argued in public over the role of the flame attendants, during a press conference. Beijing spokesman Qu Yingpu stated that the attendants' role included security, a claim immediately rejected by Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who, sitting a few metres from Qu and [...] "clearly furious" [...] according to the Herald Sun, re-iterated once more that Australian police would handle all security. The International Olympic Committee subsequently backed Australia's position, with IOC president Jacques Rogge stating: [...] "The sovereignty of Australia is absolute; security is a matter for Australia, it is not a matter for these people, that is very clear." [...] During the relay itself, three Chinese guards nonetheless attempted to run alongsided the torchbearers, and were repeatedly pulled away by Australian police.|$|E
