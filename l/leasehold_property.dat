6000|$|Opportunity was the {{daughter}} of Ovid, who was the son of Jason, of the house of Newcome. In using the term [...] "house," [...] I adopt it understandingly; for the family had dwelt in the same tenement, a <b>leasehold</b> <b>property</b> of which the fee was in myself, and the dwelling had been associated with the name of Newcome from time immemorial; that is, for about eighty years. All that time had a Newcome been the tenant of the mill, tavern, store and farm, that lay nearest the village of Ravensnest, or Little Nest, as it was commonly called; and it may not be impertinent to the moral of my narrative if I add that, for all that time, and for something longer, had I and my ancestors been the landlords. I beg the reader to bear this last fact in mind, as there will soon be occasion to show that there was a strong disposition in certain persons to forget it.|$|E
6000|$|... 148. I may {{interrupt}} {{myself for}} a moment to give you an instance of what I mean. The most wretched houses of the poor in London often pay ten or fifteen per cent. to the landlord; and I have known an instance of sanitary legislation being hindered, to the loss of many hundreds of lives, in order that the rents of a nobleman, derived from the necessities of the poor, might not be diminished. And it is a curious thing to me to see Mr. J. S. Mill foaming at the mouth, and really afflicted conscientiously, because he supposes one man to have been unjustly hanged, while by his own failure, (I believe, wilful failure)[A] in stating clearly to the public one of the first elementary truths of the science he professes, he is aiding and abetting the commission of the cruelest possible form of murder on many thousands of persons yearly, for the sake simply of putting money into the pockets of the landlords. I felt this evil so strongly that I bought, in the worst part of London, one freehold and one <b>leasehold</b> <b>property,</b> consisting of houses inhabited by the lowest poor; in order to try what change in their comfort and habits I could effect by taking only a just rent, but that firmly. The houses of the leasehold pay me five per cent.; the families that used to have one room in them have now two; and are more orderly and hopeful besides; and there is a surplus still on the rents they pay after I have taken my five per cent., with which, if all goes well, they will eventually be able to buy twelve years of the lease from me. The freehold pays three per cent., with similar results in the comfort of the tenant. This is merely an example of what might be done by firm State action in such matters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{determination}} of buy-out value of leasehold interest arises when the freeholder {{of a real}} property wants to acquire and integrate {{the interest of the}} leaseholder into his holding. This study examined the relevance of contemporary valuation technique in the {{determination of}} buy-out value of <b>leasehold</b> <b>properties</b> in Uyo, Nigeria. Data for the study were collected from 348 residential investment properties and 18 registered valuers in the city through field survey, using multi- stage sampling technique. Results of data analysis show evidence of periodic rental reviews in the residential property market, the expected rent review pattern being 2. 9366 years (say 3 years). In the market valuation of <b>leasehold</b> residential <b>properties</b> in the city, {{it was found that the}} buy-out value of leasehold interest obtained using contemporary technique was 7. 31 % higher than that obtained using the conventional valuation technique. The study recommends the adoption of contemporary valuation technique in the determination of buy-out value of <b>leasehold</b> <b>properties</b> in the city as the conventional valuation technique used by valuers in the city for such valuation is not sensitive enough to interpret the realities of the property market due to its inability to incorporate rental growth and rent review frequency in its computation...|$|R
