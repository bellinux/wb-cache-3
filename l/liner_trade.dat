40|$|The {{impressive}} {{growth of}} the Soviet Merchant Marine {{during the past two}} decades. and its anticipated future expansion have given rise to questions concerning the likely future impact of that fleet on world shipping and the relative importance of maritime commerce to the Soviet Union itself. U.

Charges of predatory Soviet rate cutting practices have been widely advertised by American operators concerned with the growing presence of Soviet carriers in the highly competitive <b>liner</b> <b>trades.</b> At the same time, such claims are made with little or no reference to the mushrooming of the flags of convenience liner fleet, the comparative rates of growth of other merchant shipping powers, and the added value of the West 2 ̆ 7 s hugely dominant cellular container ship fleet.

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the application of}} Community principles of freedom to provide services and of free competition in international shipping lines in relation to unilateral and bilateral measures implemented by various countries to defend the interests of their flag shipping companies and in relation to agreements between shipowners (conferences, shipping consortia, strategic alliances) {{in order to reduce}} competition. With regard to the latter aspect is taken into account the question of the compatibility between agreements in liner shipping and EU antitrust rules (article 101 and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) with particular attention to liner conferences. In 1986 a block exemption from the application of the European antitrust law had been justified on the assumption that liner conferences brought stability, ensuring shippers reliable services that could not be achieved by less restrictive means. The block exemption had been in place for two decades. More recently a study conducted by the European Commission determined that liner conferences operating in EU trades were not producing the anticipated benefits that had justified the original block exemption. So, in 2006 the European Union decided to repeal the block exemption from competition law for liner shipping conferences. After a two years transition period, the repeal went into effect in October 2008. It is therefore examined the impact of the repeal of the conference block exemption on the shipowners, on the shippers and in general on the international <b>liner</b> <b>trades.</b> The importance and actuality of the subject taken into account in this book are, inter alia, confirmed {{by the fact that the}} Federal Maritime Commission, in a recent study, published in 2012, compares US and EU <b>liner</b> <b>trades</b> in order to identify the effects of the UE repeal of the block exemption...|$|R

There was strong demand for shipping space in the bulk trades, especially for Russian grain imports which had been held over from the preceding year, and the sharp fall of freight rates came to an end.

40|$|The recent OECD Report {{calling for}} a {{revision}} of the liner shipping competition rules has met with predictable response from the liner operators. What appears to be lacking in this perennial dilemma is once again the absence of adequate supporting data {{to make a case}} for regulatory changes.

Furthermore, the dialog has paid scant attention to the ongoing changes in the broader context of global supply chains and their inherent expectations. Hence, the author proposes a new approach that takes into account contemporary business practices and the predominance of global supply chains seeking sustainable competitive advantage. Accordingly, a logical and rational hierarchical model is proposed that fuses the expectations from an efficient supply chain partnership with the current regulatory freedoms in the U.

40|$|Containerized <b>liner</b> <b>trades</b> {{have been}} growing {{steadily}} since the globalization of world economies intensified in the early 1990 s. However, these trades are typically imbalanced {{in terms of the}} numbers of inbound and outbound containers.

In this paper, we consider the dynamic empty container allocation problem where we need to reposition empty containers and to determine the number of leased containers needed to meet customers' demand over time. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic network: in, stage one, the parameters such as supplies, demands, and ship capacities for empty containers are deterministic; whereas in stage two, these parameters are random variables. We need to make decisions in stage one such that the total of the stage one cost and the expected stage two cost is minimized. By taking advantage of the network structure, we show how a stochastic quasi-gradient method and a stochastic hybrid approximation procedure can be applied to solve the problem. In addition, we propose some new variations of these methods that seem to work faster in practice. We conduct numerical tests to evaluate the value of the two-stage stochastic model over a rolling horizon environment and to investigate the behavior of the solution, methods with different implementations...|$|R

40|$|Steam {{and screw}} {{propeller}} {{took a long}} time to displace sail in coastal bulk trades: 60 years compared with the 20 years needed for steam and the paddle to dominate coastal <b>liner</b> <b>trades.</b> As this thesis confirms, conquering the bulk trades was a much more difficult undertaking. To offset far greater capital and running costs, the developer of the steam bulk carrier could offer only that his steamer, largely independent of weather and tide, would carry significantly more cargo in a given period than a sailing vessel. This thesis demonstrates how, to fulfil this promise, many obstacles had to be overcome, including the high cost of iron hulls and steam engines, the inefficiency of early steam engines and boilers, the water ballast problem, slowness of discharge, archaic port practices, and physical constraints of ports and waterways. The findings suggest that, in the rise of the steam bulk carrier, the role of the railways should be diminished, and that of the gas industry accentuated. The impact of rail competition on the London collier trade was no more than a pinprick when the first screw collier was building, and the coal market's subsequent growth was so strong that the steady increase in rail-hauled coal barely dented the tonnage delivered by sea from the north east. On the other hand, without the gas industry's demand for large, regular and guaranteed deliveries, the coal interests would probably not have encouraged the development of the screw collier when they did.

40|$|Due to the {{intensified}} {{globalization of}} world economies, containerized <b>liner</b> <b>trades</b> have been steadily growing {{since the early}} 1990 s. However, more than 50 years after containerized shipping was extended to international trades, the industry is still struggling {{with the problem of}} how to manage empty containers. On one hand, this industry is highly dynamic and unstable, with a constant ebb and flow in supply and demand for containers. On the other hand, trades are typically imbalanced in terms of the numbers of inbound and outbound containers, especially on the arterial East-West trade routes. To alleviate the effects of uncertainty and trade imbalance, ocean carriers are pressurized to seek effective policies to rationalize empty container movement. This paper considers the dynamic empty container reposition problem for a network of transhipment services in a random setting. The objective is for ocean carriers to minimize the finite horizon total expected empty container operational cost, comprising the transportation cost, the unloading cost, the loading cost, the holding cost and the leasing cost. The decisions in the model include when and where we need to reposition how many empty containers, and the number of leased containers needed to meet customers’ demand over time. The randomness arises from the demands for and the supplies of empty containers. The problem is formulated using chance constrained programming approach. For this special case, an inequality constraint containing random parameters can be transformed into chance constraint and further reduced to a deterministic programming problem. According to the principle of chance constrained programming approach, a probability level or service level is specified, with which the decisions feasibility can be guaranteed. Numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the model validity and to investigate the effects of different factors on both decisions and cost results...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, A.P. Moller considered possibilities of going into <b>liner</b> <b>trade</b> business. The tramp trade, where vessels sailed from port to port depending on the demand, was expected to lose ground to liners in time. On 12 July 1928, the vessel LEISE MÆRSK left Baltimore on its first voyage from the American East Coast via the Panama Canal to the Far East and back. The cargo consisted of Ford car parts and other general cargo. This heralded the start of Maersk's shipping services. Maersk Line began to grow in 1946 after the Second World War by transporting goods between America and Europe before expanding services in 1950. On 26 April 1956, ocean-borne container transport was introduced with the shipment of a Sea-Land container aboard the SS Ideal X from Port Newark, New Jersey, to Houston, Texas. In 1967, Anglo carrier P&O was part of the first European initiative, a pooling of liner services from four companies, into the new company Overseas Containers Limited (OCL). Both Sea-land and P&O would later be taken over by Maersk Line as it expanded operations between 1999 and 2005.|$|E

Bigger multi-purpose vessels are able to carry different kinds of loading on the same voyage. Smaller multi-purpose vessels do not have this advantage but they are employed to get into smaller harbours because of their limited draught.

40|$|D. Phil. The {{progress}} of the South African economy relies heavily upon earnings from physical exports, which depend increasingly upon the competitiveness in global markets of the maritime supply chains that serve the country. Competition in world markets is becoming increasingly stronger as production resources are obtained globally and subsequently the competition exists between the effectiveness of whole supply chains rather than only production costs. South Africa therefore has great interest in ensuring that its maritime supply chains compare with world best practice. Amongst other things, this world best practice requires those chains to function as entities structured to serve their logistical purpose, i. e. {{that it should not}} include links consisting of separate transport businesses. In practice, this requires that links traditionally provided by third parties be structurally integrated as cost centres instead of profits centres in the chains. Such integrated maritime supply chains will inevitably only be developed by the intervention of chain leaders. South Africa’s major supply chains conveying commodities and manufactured products are examined {{in order to determine the}} scope for the integration of their links as a means of raising their efficiency as ‘complete chains’. Features of selected maritime supply chains serving other countries that could serve as models for the structuring of South Africa’s are identified. Transnet’s role in the existing maritime supply chains in accordance with the policy of the Government is examined and attention is focused on the under-investment in recent years that has led to the deterioration in the company’s performance. The rejection by the Government of the privatisation of the core assets of the railways and ports in favour of public-private partnerships, as a means of overcoming the problems, is considered in order to conclude whether a solution will be forthcoming in that manner. Special consideration is given to Transnet’s proposed spending of R 40 bn on infrastructure projects and attention is focused on the fact that this will not address all the problems. The marine links in South Africa’s maritime supply chains are currently provided by foreigners. Virtually all South Africa’s bulk exports are sold free-on-board, which concedes control over the shipping of the cargo to foreign importers. Reasons for such arrangements are complex and chartering by South African exporters in order to maintain control is often not feasible, although it is done in the fruit trade and by Australian exporters of iron ore competing with South African exporters. Ship owning by South Africans will facilitate new legislation to increase the market share of citizens in the country’s exports and imports, but price-wise market entry will be difficult and it is debatable whether exporters will make use of their services. In the <b>liner</b> <b>trades,</b> the trend is for shipping companies to integrate port and overland links into their services, and the efficiency of South Africa’s container supply chains will need to be raised in that manner. The criteria for determining maritime supply chain efficiency and the integration of the links of particular South African chains based on their cost structures, as well as the leadership needed to pursue such development, are motivated. Proposals are also made for the integration of the links of the iron ore and coal supply chains under the leadership of public-private partnerships, as well as for a container supply chain incorporating both a dedicated terminal in the Port of Ngqura and the railway between Coega and Gauteng, under the leadership of a liner shipping company or consortium of companies. The conclusion is reached that the present role of Transnet in accordance with the declared policy of the Government is not conducive to improving maritime supply chain efficiency through the structural integration of the links. It is also concluded that the efficiency of the chains could be raised through private leadership with public participation, subject to a change in the Government’s policy towards the role of Transnet in order to allow such leadership.

40|$|Abstract: The {{traditional}} {{world economy}} has changed. Dominant markets {{such as the}} US and Europe are struggling, while new economic growth is driven by developing nations. The maritime industry is essential to this growth - facilitating the global movement of goods {{through the use of}} ports. By means of a literature review, the study illustrates how the changing liner industry has initiated the building of larger containerships. The rapid economic growth of the SADC region together with the presence of larger containerships on the East-West trade route has highlighted the largely ill-equipped nature of the SADC port system as the cascading effect displaces “smaller” containerships on secondary North-South trade routes. The cascading effect has necessitated the need for a hub-and-spoke network configuration in the SADC region. The study further emphasises current investments and expansion projects for strategic SADC ports and corridors to determine a future port scenario in the <b>liner</b> shipping <b>trade.</b> The changing port landscape in the SADC region means that the traditionally strong South African ports are subject to greater competition for cargoes originating from the hinterland. The purpose of this study has been to determine the impact of the cascading effect in liner shipping on the SADC port system, in order to identify a hub port for the region and additionally identify a future structure for strategic SADC ports in relation to the hinterland. The research methodology was structured as a secondary data analysis. The application of a comparative matrix for both strategic ports and strategic corridors established the future SADC port structure. Furthermore, an east-facing hub port for the SADC region was identified. The overall finding of the study was that for the long-term future, the port of Durban would remain the ideal hub port for the SADC region. The port is ideally positioned to capture cargo on the growing and lucrative South-South East trade route and the future development of the Durban-Gauteng corridor will facilitate the movement of cargo to and from the SADC hinterland [...] .
