Mosimane said; [...] "We have good players playing in Europe {{and we have}} other players that we haven't called up. There is a striker who is {{constantly}} scoring goals, Davide Somma.

But setting these aside, {{there are other}} principles equally essential, in regard to which the whole community are agreed; or at least, {{if there is a}} dissenting minority, it is so small, that it is hardly to be considered. Let us <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> principles.|$|E

The fifth glass, the one Stottlemeyer's fingerprints were on, was obviously planted there later. As they leave the hotel, they run into Slade in the lobby. Slade says they {{need to talk about}} how with the way Monk is working, he is eventually going to destroy himself. Back at the jail, Stottlemeyer suggests that they look at Braddock's arrest records. He tells Monk and Natalie that a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> arrests will bring up note that they came {{with the help of a}} confidential informant. Natalie calls Danielle and has her meet them at Monk's apartment. When Danielle enters (and Monk spends 30 minutes washing his hands), Natalie tells Danielle that she has realized how Slade has been using the GPS systems to track her and Monk around on their cases. But Danielle also has the information they need on Linda Wurzel and Dalberg Enterprises.|$|E

The discipline will benefit from a more detailed <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> concepts. The concepts of Risk, Gap and Strength are the particular concepts that are explored in some more detail within this paper. A reason for describing these elements as concepts rather than terms is discussed. More precise definitions for the concepts described can provide management support about the knowledge resource in decision-making. Several function definitions for Risk, Gap and Strength are offered. Finally, the paper considers how these concepts can influence organisational knowledge management schemes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRegular {{users and}} {{enterprises}} are now increasingly dependent on web services. This growing dependence {{on one hand}} has simplified routine tasks, {{but on the other}} hand it has resulted in loss of direct control over the data. Nevertheless, both users and enterprises require simplified and generic solutions to access their data. The classical mediation approach from the data integration field provides a uniform query interface to diverse data sources hiding the underlying heterogeneity. But using this approach over multiple heterogeneous and autonomous web services has several open challenges. In this article, we will take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> challenges that need to be addressed for achieving a fully automated solution...|$|E

A user who has blundered is often rewarded by an effect that is not obviously related to the cause. In this paper, we will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> unexpected rewards.

40|$|Requirements {{have always}} been {{acknowledged}} as the backbone of any system. However, in many past development efforts, requirements were paid little heed. At NASA, in recent years, the hue and cry for project development has been "Faster, Better, Cheaper and Safer". This has impacted the way we develop software; it has increased the risks to quality, safety and reliability. At NASA, the Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) is working with projects to emphasize the criticality of requirements throughout development, {{not just in the}} initial phases. This emphasis is on requirements relationship to all aspects of quality, including reliability and safety. In this presentation, we will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> relationships through the eyes of quality...|$|E

Treatment of neurological disorders takes place within the wider context of the delivery of health services and, here too, there are many problems to be solved to ensure patients are able to have access to optimal care.
