40|$|These days, MDMA {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular drugs of abuse. Due to its illegality, MDMA and its {{chemical}} precursors are watched by governmental organizations in many countries. To avoid conflicts with legal instances, underground chemists have tried to market several new unregulated amphetamine analogues, such as 4 -MTA. Para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), on the other hand, is regulated by law but its precursors are easily obtained since they are cheap and unwatched. This article presents such a case, namely the large scale synthesis of PMA using anethole, a main constituent of anise oil, as precursor. Anethole has been converted to its phenyl acetone analogue via peracid oxidation, while PMA itself has been synthesized using this ketone as precursor in the <b>Leuckart</b> <b>synthesis.</b> The synthesis of PMA using anethole as starting product has been investigated applying GC/MS and GC-HSPME/MS techniques, hereby discovering new specific (4 -methoxyphenol) and already identified synthesis impurities (4 -methyl- 5 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) pyrimidine, N-(beta- 4 -methoxyphenylisopropyl) - 4 -methoxybenzyl methyl ketimine, 1 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) -N-(2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -methylethyl- 2 -propanamine, 1 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) -N-methyl-N-(2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -methylethyl- 2 -propanamine, N-(beta- 4 -methoxyphenylisopropyl) - 4 -methoxybenzaldimine). The new impurity 4 -methoxyphenol is specific for the application of a peracid oxidation method where anethole is used as precursor. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Impurity {{profiling}} of drug seizures is {{a scientific}} approach employed to understand drug trafficking networks thus {{has becoming increasingly}} important in criminal investigation. This paper presents the feasibility of using the Collaborative Harmonisation of Methods for the Profiling of AmphetamineType Stimulants (CHAMP) established by the European Commission authority for impurity profiling of amphetamine and methamphetamine samples. Both drugs were analysed using similar extraction procedure and analytical conditions. The impurities were extracted from an alkaline buffer solution (pH 8. 1) using toluene prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. The {{results showed that the}} reproducibility of the method for detecting amphetamine and methamphetamine ranged between 7. 4 - 8. 9 and 6. 2 - 8. 4 %RSD, respectively. Identification of impurities was performed by referencing against the available MS databases as well as to previous reported impurity profiling studies. Phenyl- 2 -propanone (P 2 P), also known as benzyl-methyl-ketone (BMK), as well as other specific impurities such as 4 -methyl- 5 -phenylpyrimidine, bis-(1 -phynelisopropyl) amine, N-formylamphetamine and N,N-di (b-phenylisopropyl) amines were identified in the amphetamine samples, indicating Leuckart’s pathway as the route of synthesis. Because P 2 P was also detected in the methamphetamine samples, the possible route of synthesis of the methamphetamine samples being <b>Leuckart’s,</b> nitrostyrene <b>synthesis</b> or reductive amination could not be ruled out...|$|R
