To this end, the Flash Eu­ro­barom­e­ter 366 : Qual­ity of <b>life</b> <b>in</b> Eu­ro­pean cities was used. The sur­vey pro­vides opin­ions of 41 thou­sands in­hab­i­tants from 79 Eu­ro­pean cities, which en­ables analy­sis of in­ter­re­la­tion be­tween cit­i­zen char­ac­ter­is­tics, neigh­bour­hood {{and city}} con­texts and sat­is­fac­tion with <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city. The study {{analysed}} the fol­low­ing di­men­sions po­ten­tially re­lated to sat­is­fac­tion with <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city: (1) avail­abil­ity of ser­vices, en­vi­ron­ment and so­cial as­pects {{in cities and}} neigh­bour­hood; (2) so­cio-de­mo­graphic fac­tors; and (3) city char­ac­ter­is­tics such as eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, labour mar­ket pres­sures, size, lo­ca­tion, qual­ity of in­sti­tu­tions and safety.

5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E

Bosch renders the plant <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E

5|$|Orhan, the Ottoman Turkish {{prince of}} Bithynia {{was married to}} Theodora, {{daughter}} of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. The Greek clergy believed that the marriage of a Christian princess and a prominent Muslim would increase the region's power. Orhan already had several other wives, and although Theodora was permitted to keep her religion, she was required {{to spend the rest}} of her <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Islamic harem. Kantakouzenos hoped that Orhan would become his ally in any future wars, but Orhan, like his fellow Turks, became his enemy in the Genoese war. As part of the alliance, the Ottoman prince was permitted to sell the Christians he had captured at Constantinople as slaves in the public market.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{invasion of}} Gibraltar {{was by the}} Moors, Muslim Arabs and Berbers who arrived from North Africa {{at the beginning of}} the eighth century. They used the area as a base from which to launch an invasion of the rest of the Iberian Peninsula which resulted in most of Iberia coming under Moorish rule. The Spanish Reconquista began later in the eighth century. The campaign eventually took 800 years to force the Moors back across the Strait, and did not reach the Bay of Gibraltar until the fourteenth century. It was not until 1309, nearly 600 years after Gibraltar was first settled, that the first siege of Gibraltar was recorded. King Ferdinand I of Castile began a siege of Algeciras on the other side of the bay in July, but his naval blockade was unable to stop supplies being smuggled in small boats from Gibraltar to the besieged city. He sent an army under Alonso Pérez de Guzmán to take Gibraltar. De Guzmán succeeded after a month-long siege, and Gibraltar was settled by the Castilians for the first time. Six years later, the Moors attempted to retake the peninsula in the brief second siege which was abandoned at the sight of a Castilian relief force. Another Moorish attempt eventually succeeded in the third siege of February–June 1333. A Castilian attempt to retake it in the fourth siege of June–August 1333 failed, as did the fifth siege of 1349–50, in which King Alfonso XI of Castile lost his <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> outbreak of bubonic plague among the besiegers. The Moors of Granada and Fez fell out with each other over Gibraltar in 1411, leading to the Granadans besieging the fortified town in the sixth siege and seizing it from the Marinids of Fez. Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla made a failed attempt to capture Gibraltar in the seventh siege of 1436, during which he perished.|$|E
