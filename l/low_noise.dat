40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effects of gamma {{irradiation}} on the residual phase noise of SiGe HBTs. The excellent phase noise capabioity of SiGe HBT is retained after 1 Mrad(si) irradiation. The observed radiation hardness is attributed to the minor changes in the <b>low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> and device nonlinearities after irradiations, {{as well as the}} nonlinearity cancellation mechanism. The radiation-induced defects do not significantly add to the <b>low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> in these SiGe HBTs, even though they produce a large space-charge-region recombination component in the base current.

40|$|AbstractBackground and Purpose: Although the {{evolution}} of industrial systems toward digital technologies decreased the exposure {{to high levels of}} noise, it has created some problems encountered with low level and provoking <b>noise</b> (<b>low</b> frequency <b>noise).</b> In the present work, the mental performance of students exposed to low frequency and reference <b>noises</b> at <b>low</b> and high levels (45 & 65 dB) were studied. Additionally, other factors such as annoyance, sensitivity to <b>low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> and hearing status of participants were considered. Materials and Methods: After generating low frequency and reference noises required for the study, a pilot study was conducted. Then, 54 students participated in the main study after preliminary tests. Their mental performances were evaluated with standard psychological tests while they were exposed to low frequency and reference noises at 45 and 65 dBA. Results: The results showed that <b>noise</b> annoyance and <b>low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> sensitivity do not have a significant correlation with age and sex. The results also revealed that, <b>low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> at 65 dB can decrease concentration (P= 0. 003) and increase response time (P= 0. 039) of performance in comparison with <b>low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> at 45 dB. On the other hand, reference noise at 65 dB can increase speed (P< 0. 001) of performance in comparison with reference noise at 45 dB. Conclusion: <b>Low</b> frequency <b>noise</b> can reduce the mental performance and increase its response time.

25|$|A {{problem with}} the {{derivative}} term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts {{of change in the}} output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a low-pass filter in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear median filter may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.|$|E

25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source.

In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch.
