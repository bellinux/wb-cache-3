Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve.

5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contained}} several elaborate stunts {{and effect}} sequences. Gish performed {{all of her}} stunts in the episode, including one shot when she jumped from a thirty-foot descender. She later called the sequence [...] "the biggest stunt of my career." [...] For several of the special effect shots, Manners was forced to compromise on his original decision. One specific shot, wherein Audrey Pauley had to disappear after appearing in front of Gish, was originally {{going to be done}} via CGI. Eventually, Manners decided to [...] "tie the two actresses [...] together [...] and then you [...] to Annabeth and in her face there's an 'oh shit' reaction, and then [...] straight up on a crane, all right, and see that she's completely alone." [...] He called effects like these [...] "creative ways to trim [...] budget." [...] To create the floating hospital scene, a small door set was merged with a CGI hospital. Initially, the scene used a straight flat [...] "piece of cement" [...] as the bottom of the building. The effects team tried adding a [...] "big piece of earth" [...] under the building, but Paul Rabwin felt it looked too much <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Prince, so the piece of earth was removed. The final result also removed the cement-like base.|$|E
500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to hear those songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without telling me. I could have strangled him." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Rita Ora and her boyfriend, played by Michael Madsen, {{entering}} a diner. The man steps on and squishes a spider with his boot, just before Iggy Azalea is shown {{as a waitress}} named Fox behind the diner counter. Azalea then approaches the couple and hands them the menu. The man orders a BLT sandwich [...] "dripping with melted cheese" [...] and just when Ora is about to order he interrupts her by saying [...] "she's gonna have the same damn thing", which causes Ora {{to look at him}} somewhat upset. As Azalea arrives with the order, the man starts complaining about the sandwich and refuses to eat it. Then, the owner of the diner, Big Wanda, jumps over the counter and asks if there's a problem. After hearing the man's complaint, Azalea tries to explain but to no avail when the owner says [...] "What did the Fox say? Nothing!" [...] and she is told to make another sandwich with more cheese. Ora is shocked when the owner begins to flirt with her boyfriend in front of her, and her boyfriend ignores her because the owner promises him a [...] "big, juicy BLT sandwich" [...] that is the menu's special. When Ora tries to speak up, she is verbally put down by the owner, who says her special order is [...] "nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> sandwich" [...] Ora has. Ora continues to show disapproval towards the situation.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Las Abejas" [...] (Spanish for [...] "the bees") was chosen, {{according}} to {{one member of the}} organization, because [...] "like the bees we want to build our houses together, to collectively work and enjoy the fruit of our work.

We know that, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> bees, the work is slow but the result is sure because it is collective." [...] Another member of the organization notes a political element in the choice of the name: [...] "The bee is a very small insect that is able to move a sleeping cow when it pricks.

[...] Stevenson lost heavily outside the Solid South; he carried only nine states and lost the Electoral College vote 442 to 89.

2500|$|Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, {{bowls and}} throws {{with his right}} hand, but writes with his left hand. He also {{practices}} left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the [...] "most wholesome batsman of his time". His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia. He {{is known for his}} unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot. In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that [...] "it is hard to imagine any player {{in the history of the}} game who combines classical technique with raw aggression <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> champion does".|$|E

[...] Blair also had short hair for her role, avoiding long hair from her portrayal in the first film, which she felt [...] "brought her face down". The actress emphasized Liz Sherman's growth in the sequel, [...] "She's looking to the future much more, and things are happening in this one that she has to buck up... I think you're dealing with a lot knowing this young girl that we last saw as very damaged, and now she's with this guy, and all these people around her, I think, we've really had to step up a strength, and a confidence in her so that I don't look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> baby kid sister tagging along." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress and singer-songwriter Mandy Moore had been cast as the voice of Rapunzel, and actor Zachary Levi would provide the voice of Flynn Rider. Mandy Moore approached the project through auditioning, when she heard that a film about the story of Rapunzel was being made. Moore later expressed that she had dreamed to be a Disney princess since she was young and said that with the role of Rapunzel, she had fulfilled her [...] "ultimate childhood dream". She described herself as a [...] "girly fan" [...] of Disney classics <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, and that it was an honor for her {{to be part of this}} [...] "legacy"—the lineage of such Disney icons. Since the film was going to be a musical, it was required that all auditionees had to read several scenes and perform a song of their choice, to ensure that the voice actors could both act and sing. For this singing section, Moore chose [...] "Help Me" [...] by Joni Mitchell, a song that she herself had covered on her fourth studio album, Coverage (2003). Moore revealed that she had to attend several audition sessions and described the experiences as [...] "pretty fun" [...] but didn't put much hope in getting the part because she believed there would be much competition for this role; she just performed her best without any anxiety. When she received a callback from Disney telling that she got the part, Moore described herself as being [...] "over the moon": [...] "I was working in New York at the time. I was with some friends and my husband—and I screamed as soon as I found out the news." ...|$|E
