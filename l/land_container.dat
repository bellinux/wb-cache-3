40|$|Aggregate {{comparisons}} of the efficiency of container ports using techniques such as Data Envelopment Analysis usually rely {{on the number of}} Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) moved across the quay face per year to provide the measure of output from which to derive efficiency measures. This may be {{due in part to the}} difficulty of obtaining large sample publicly available data sets at a more disaggregated level. Detailed simulation of individual container terminals using actual vessel sizes and schedules, together with detailed breakdowns of containers by size and intermodal transfer (land-sea or maritime transshipment), suggests that the nature of the market served can have a significant effect on the throughput of terminals managed and operated at similar levels of efficiency. The manufacturing centres in the Pearl River Delta are served by large, world-class terminals at Yantian and Hong Kong. These use similar technologies, operating methods and yard management systems. They operate at similar levels of efficiency at the micro-level (crane container handling rates, etc), but over the last 6 years the markets they serve have steadily diverged. This paper discusses the results of a preliminary study of the effects of exogenous market differences on the potential throughput capacity of container terminals with similar levels of efficiency as measured at the micro-level. Factors considered include the proportion of containers of differing size in the market, vessel size, the number of container moves per vessel, and the relative size of the transshipment and <b>landed</b> <b>container</b> markets. The paper concludes that the aggregate effect of these factors on throughput as measured in TEUs can be very significant and that aggregate analyses of container terminal efficiency should disaggregate the output measure into separate components. This will require larger sample sizes and more comprehensive data sets, particularly if varying returns to scale are to be assessed. It also considers the specification of frontier models of container terminal efficiency and puts forward proposals to ensure that the requirements of isotonicity and homogeneity are addressed and that the sensitivity of these models to data errors, weakly correlated inputs and outlying observations are taken into account.

(According to Comecon decisions, Polish industry was responsible for developing agricultural aircraft). There were several agricultural plane designs proposed in the early 1960s {{by a group of}} young designers from WSK PZL Warszawa-Okęcie, led by Andrzej Frydrychewicz. These proposals were made on their own initiative, but never realized because the USSR was content with the An-2 and was planning to replace it with a jet aircraft (later PZL M-15 Belphegor). The first was the PZL-101M Kruk 63 of 1963. That remained a paper aeroplane, but did give its name to later designs. Next were the PZL-106 Kruk 65 (1965), PZL-110 Kruk-2T (1969) and PZL M-14 Kruk (1970, it was planned to produce this variant in PZL-Mielec). Only in 1971 did the authorities decide to start development of the new agricultural design as the PZL-106 Kruk 71. Despite this decision, its development was quite protracted, due to both economic and political reasons. The work, led by Andrzej Frydrychewicz, started in 1972, and was based on earlier designs. The first prototype was flown on April 17, 1973. The designers chose a safe layout of a braced low-wing monoplane with a container for chemicals in front of the pilot, and was inspired by planes like Piper PA-25 Pawnee (in case of an emergency <b>landing,</b> the <b>container</b> would not crush the higher sitting pilot).|$|R

40|$|The {{high volume}} and minimal {{screening}} of sea <b>land</b> cargo <b>containers</b> presents a vulnerability in which explosive devices may be smuggled across national borders. Fast neutrons are a strong candidate {{for use in}} container screening due to their high target penetration and ability to discriminate between materials of low atomic mass, such as explosives and non metallic container contents. An algorithm has been developed that uses flags, calculated from specific measurements of the reflected neutrons and photons produced during active neutron interrogation, to discern explosives hidden in cargo containers. Steps in algorithm development included Monte Carlo simulations for scatter characterization, identification of flags in idealized scenarios, refinement of flags in realistic scenarios, combining the flags into a detection algorithm, and evaluation of the algorithm and associated detection system. Simulations compared favorably with small scale neutron scatter measurements using the explosives surrogate, melamine. The detection algorithm included corrections for different types of cargo contents and cargo inhomogeneity, surrounding environment, and realistic neutron sources and radiation detectors. The proposed algorithm has two variations, one {{of which can be}} easily implemented with today’s technology. The proposed scanning system utilizes a shielded 14. 1 MeV neutron generator, eleven large liquid scintillators neutron detectors, and several inorganic scintillators for photon spectroscopy.

40|$|Container {{terminals}} {{have been}} playing {{an important role in}} global transportation and serve as multi-modal interfaces between sea and <b>land</b> transportation. Import <b>containers</b> are those containers that arrive at container terminals from overseas and transship to their destination through inland transport, feeders or wait to be picked up by consignees. As trucks assigned by consignees arrive more or less randomly to pick up specific containers, there is uncertainty about which container will be picked up first, before another one. This uncertainty may result in a great number of unproductive moves. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide terminal operators with a good solution to improve yard crane operation efficiency in container terminals. A booking system for picking up import containers is designed to collect information in advance and to reduce the uncertainty of container pick-up time.

40|$|Crtics {{have much}} ignored Pan’s (潘人木) {{elaborate}} metaphorical system exhibited in The story of Ma-lan. This paper thus explores metaphors in this text, using George Lakoff’s metaphorical theory. Examining {{the relationships between}} the characters, plants, and lands in this novel from the perspectives of metaphoricla mapping, this paper discusses Pan’s characterization and her intention of writing. 	Plant metaphors unfold in the metonymy and metaphor relations between plants and characters as shown in the three main characters: Ma-lan, Lin Jin-mu (林金木), and Ma-lan’s father Cheng Jian (程堅). The main female character Ma-lan’s humility and perseverance is shown in her name, because Ma-lan tzou (weed 馬蘭草) is the native plant of Pan-North-Eastern China. In contranst, Lin Jin-mu, a popular name for a Taiwanese born boy, literally means any “green tree. ” In this novel, it can be symbolized as any plant other than Ma-lan tzou. Used in a more general term, “jin-mu” can be associated with agriculture or any kind of living things. Further, the second kind native plant of North-Eastern China used in the novel is red rice. Owned by and symbolizing Ma-lan’s father Cheng Jian, another main character and a shaper of Ma-lan’s personality, red rice is closely related with him. Like Cheng Jian, red rice grows in North-Eastern China-the “Fatherland” of Taiwan. This connection between lands and characters reveals a crucial metonymy and metaphor relation. Red rice signifies Cheng Jian, bonds the grandfather-grandson relationship between Cheng Jian and Jin-mu, and thus extends the blood metaphor that links Taiwan and North-East China (the Mainland China). 	Furthermore, Taiwan and China, as two <b>lands,</b> are <b>container</b> metaphors. Each has “a bounding surface” and “an in-out orientation,” as Lakeoff terms it. As two containers, Taiwan and China have their own boundaries and allow people to freely move in and out. Metaphorically speaking, china is a container full of darkness, misery and depression, whereas Taiwan holds rebirth and hope. 	Along with this is an attempt to dissipate the racial hatred between China and Japan. Using the Characters’ immigration to another space and intermarriage and a new version of plants’ prosperity in a different land, a blood metaphor that links China, Japan and Taiwan is created. 《馬蘭的故事》是潘人木的代表作品，論者多忽略其自成天地的譬喻系統。本文藉助George Lakoff的譬喻理論，從植物與人、容器與土地之間的映射關係，探討潘人木的人物形塑和寫作意圖。 	此書的寫作重心在女主角程馬蘭謙抑、堅韌的性格，潘人木選擇故鄉東北（遼寧）的馬蘭草為她命名，並隱喻她性格的各種面向。林金木是與馬蘭對應的角色，他的命名呈現草、木相應的意義。再者「金木」帶有臺灣本土味道，意在交代他的出生地；「林木」的「綠」則象徵了馬蘭草之外的植物，經由「植物」一詞，語意延伸至農業與生機。馬蘭的父親程堅亦為要角，是她性格的養成者，也是東北傳奇作物紅粳米的擁有者，因此紅粳米轉喻程堅；紅粳米成長在東北與程堅的父親身分結合，產生中國大陸「父土」的象徵意義；銜接程堅、林金木之間非血緣的祖孫關係，再引出臺灣、東北（中國大陸）之間的血脈聯繫。 	另外，臺灣、中國大陸二塊土地有界限範圍，提供人和物活動的空間與出入的方位，為容器譬喻之一種，譬喻性地中國大陸裝填陰暗、苦難和絕望，臺灣則裝慎新生與希望。 	此書也有消弭中、日民族仇恨的企圖，藉由人物的空間移動與通婚，植物改換生長地點與農業改良的情節來完成...|$|R

There the troop were briefed with aerial reconnaissance photographs of the objective that were provided by the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which showed that there were actually two aqueducts in the area, one larger than the other; after a brief discussion it was decided that the larger of the two would be targeted. At 18:30 on 10 February the six Whitleys took off from Malta, each carrying one officer and five other ranks of X Troop; the flight to the target area was uneventful, with clear weather and perfect visibility. The lead Whitley reached the drop zone, which was approximately [...] from the aqueduct, at 21:42. All six men and their equipment <b>containers</b> <b>landed</b> within [...] of the drop zone, as did the men from the next four aircraft; however two of the bombers failed to drop their containers due to the icing up of the release mechanisms, and the sixth aircraft failed to locate the drop zone and eventually dropped its six men and containers two hours later in a valley two miles from the aqueduct. The six men who had not landed in the drop zone were Royal Engineer sappers who were supposed to rig the aqueduct for demolition, and their Whitley had been carrying most of the explosives to be used in the operation. Despite these losses, the troop gathered up the remaining containers and took up positions around the aqueduct. However, on examining the aqueduct it was found the piers supporting it were made of reinforced concrete and not brick as had been expected, leading Pritchard to suspect that the remaining explosives might be insufficient to demolish the aqueduct. After closer inspection, Pritchard ordered that the majority of the explosives be placed around the western pier and the rest against its abutment, in the hope that this would cause enough damage to destroy the aqueduct. A small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged the Ginestra river.|$|R

When the container has been filled the truck drives to the landing site where it’s offloaded. From the <b>landing</b> site the <b>containers</b> are being transported to industry by fork lifter trucks. The aim of the study was: - To measure the productivity of the system during various conditions considering distance of transportation, the quality of the windrow, mix of tree species and weight of the loads - To identify parameters within the system that could be improved - To compare the system to a similar system, tractor chipper and a truck equipped with a dipper Within the final thesis a time study has been carried out which have made it possible to estimate the productivity of the system and the time consumption of each work element. These data have then been used to analyze the system to show differences in productivity depending on different conditions on the site and constellation of vehicles. During the time study 50 % of the container chipper truck’s work time was consumed by chipping, which means that the utilization of the chipper is relatively low. The utilization of the chipper could be increased by reducing the distance between the windrow and the landing site, because the workelement container switch consumed 18 % of the worktime. Data were collected from SDC and Åkarewebben, which data showed that logging residues that have been extracted during summer and with a high share of pine had low moisture content when measured at industry. At the same time it was discovered that a dryer material took longer to chip because it was harder. During the time study of the system it was discovered that with a transport distance of 85 km one way, there were no waiting time when using one transport lorry. For two transport vehicles the optimal transport distance was 165 km one way. This means that at 85 km transport distance one transport vehicle should be used and at 165 km should two transport vehicles be used...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{generation}} {{is a natural}} and expected outcome of productive activity. Waste is produced, much like any other commodity, although rather than considering waster as a "good" where more is preferred to less, we would tend to consider waste as a 'bad' - less is preferred to more. However, {{it is also true}} that waste supply is an increasing function of production and that is we prefer more consumption to less, we must accept the production of more waste. The point here is that waste disposal is a cost which in aggregate increases with the demand for productive activity; it is a cost which is assigned to both producers and consumers in the form of a trash removal fee. However, as a cost of production, one would expect that disposal fees are passed on to consumers in the prices they pay for goods. Hence, disposal fees in general are borne by consumers, either directly as residential disposal fees or indirectly through prices of goods and services. When waste disposal is performed unsatisfactorily, an additional cost is imposed: the cost of pollution. The burden of this cost often escapes those who are responsible, since disposers interested in maintaining a competitive position will transfer the pollution cost to the public in general or to future generations. The issue here is not merely a problem of cost allocation, but rather a conflict in interests over the use of a natural resource - namely, groundwater. Waste disposal requires land as an input. To simplify the discussion, consider <b>land</b> as a <b>container</b> to hold waste. This same land may also be a container for groundwater, although these two uses of land are mutually exclusive where proper disposal techniques are not utilized. In other words, we have a situation where the disposer has the right to utilize the land for disposal activities, and the public has the right to safe drinking water and uncontaminated soil. But where rights conflict, it is necessary to protect one of the interests. Under Act 641, the right is assigned to the public, thereby prohibiting the waste disposer form interfering with the groundwater. Hence, the waste disposer is legally constrained from creating an externality; that is, from imposing pollution costs on others. One can argue, then, that a mechanism to protect a natural resource is property rights assignment, or as Demsetz points out, "a primary function of property rights is that of guiding incentives to achieve a greater internalization of externalities". Although the Act regulates all facets of solid waste management, this study is confined to an examination of sanitary landfill regulation and the costs incurred by the county in conforming to these regulations. It is the hypothesis of this study that costs will not be distributed evenly between Michigan counties, but rather, will be a function of the degree to which a county can meet Act 641 standards, subject to certain constraints. Since a major objective of Act 641 is to regulate landfills, the author considered the analysis of this facet of the Act indicative of the economic ramifications of the entire Act. However, where regulatory changes in other waste management activities are particularly significant to this study, implications will be noted. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
