40|$|This study {{described}} {{the level of}} skills, and interests in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about, selected teaching activities and educational technologies among faculty with teaching appointments in the College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas. As part of a United States Department of Agriculture grant, the study served as a needs assessmentfor designingfaculty development activities. Teaching faculty perceived that they had relatively high levels of skills in traditional classroom teaching areas such as lecture and discussion methods. However, they had high levels of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about these skills. Their self-perceived levels of skills were low in such non-traditional areas as case studies, discovery learning, and peer observation, and they expressed little interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about these topics. There was little relationship between their level of skill and level of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about teaching methods. These faculty rated their levels of skill in educational technologies lower than for the teaching methods. However, they expressedgenerally high levels of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about the technologies. A substantial positive relationship was found between level of skill and interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> about educational technologies...|$|R
