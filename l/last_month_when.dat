25|$|Reporting in the {{international}} press on the explosion {{of interest in the}} subject focused on the central role of the Castle incident. The British newspaper The Guardian reported:But the real impact has been a video that has garnered hundreds of thousands of hits on the web (in which Congressman) Mike Castle, address(es) a town hall meeting on health care in Delaware <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> a woman suddenly stands up waving a bunch of papers...The encounter was a warning to Republican officials how far the conspiracy theory has permeated parts of their party.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Michael Logan of TV Guide {{felt that}} Victor was [...] "pushing {{it with the}} fans", stating: [...] "The megalomaniacal patriarch earned {{considerable}} viewer backlash <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> he threw his ex-wife [...] {{from the back of}} an ambulance and left her bruised and bloodied." [...] In an interview with Logan, Braeden stated that Victor [...] "doesn't give a shit" [...] and [...] "he doesn't take any shit", saying that is [...] "the whole point of the character". The actor also stated he does not like women defeating Victor, admitting that he wasn't pleased in a 2003 scene where his daughter Victoria (portrayed by Heather Tom) slaps him.|$|E
60|$|In less earthly matters, too, such as non-attendance at church, a {{predisposition}} to poaching, or any inclination to moral laxity, {{he could say}} with a clear conscience that the Rector was sure of his support. A striking instance had occurred within the <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>when,</b> discovering that his under-keeper, an excellent man at his work, had got into a scrape with the postman's wife, he had given the young fellow notice, and cancelled the lease of his cottage.|$|E

50|$|Mimise Dotti-Guttuso died on 6 October 1986. Guttuso {{was soon}} to follow his wife. He died in Rome of lung cancer {{at the age of}} 75 on 18 January 1987. On his deathbed, he {{allegedly}} embraced again the Christian faith with which he had been critical. However, there are doubts as to what really happened — in his <b>last</b> <b>months,</b> <b>when</b> he was bedridden, a circle of politicians and priests excluded his oldest friends from his villa. He donated many of his works to his hometown Bagheria, which are now housed in the museum of the Villa Cattolica.|$|R

'Slyme's biographer, sir, {{whoever he}} may be,' resumed the gentleman, 'must apply to me; or, if I am gone to that what's-his-name from which no thingumbob comes back, he must apply to my executors for leave to search among my papers. I {{have taken a}} few notes in my poor way, of some of that man's proceedings--my adopted brother, sir,--which would amaze you. He made use of an expression, sir, only on the fifteenth of <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> he couldn't meet a little bill and the other party wouldn't renew, which would have done honour to Napoleon Bonaparte in {{addressing}} the French army.' ...|$|E

I {{am going to}} tell you {{something}} so you will know how much more you owe him. Do you remember <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> that red heifer of yours got away. Well, Clarke chased her away and finally caught her in the woods. He asked me to say I had caught her. Somehow or other he seems to be afraid of you. I wish you and he would be good friends. He is a mighty fine fellow." ...|$|E

I mature my men slowly but thoroughly. First I put 'em in a town which is liable to be attacked by night, where they can attend riding-school in the day. Then I use 'em with a convoy, and last I put 'em into a column. It takes time,' he says, 'but I flatter myself that any men who have worked under me are at least grounded in the rudiments of their profession. Adrian,' he says, 'was there anything wrong with the men who upset Van Bester's applecart <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> he was trying to cross the line to join Piper with those horses he'd stole from Gabbitas?' ...|$|E
50|$|In 1948, the new {{communist}} regime stripped him of Academy membership after Capidan {{refused to sign}} an adulatory telegram for Joseph Stalin. However, upon the intervention of Iorgu Iordan, {{he was allowed to}} continue working on the dictionary as an outside collaborator with the Linguistics Institute. Still involved with the project until his <b>last</b> <b>months,</b> <b>when</b> weakening vision forced him to abandon it, he died in 1953. In accordance with his wishes, was cremated in a simple ceremony. Capidan was married to Iulia George Dan, a housewife. The couple's only child, Emil, was born in 1912 and studied literature and philosophy at Cluj.|$|R
50|$|In general, Western recon {{aircraft}} were unarmed, {{not only}} to maximize performance, but to emphasize the objective of bringing back pictures, not engaging the enemy. They also usually flew singly or in widely spread pairs. In special circumstances {{it was necessary to}} bring along fighter escorts; this phenomenon arose again in the <b>last</b> <b>months</b> <b>when</b> the hitherto sovereign Mosquito began to be picked off by Me-262 jets. Selected heavy bombers carried film cameras and cameramen. The 8th Air Force’s 8th Combat Camera Unit thus documented much of the air war, and these films are much more frequently shown today than are the static images of regular reconnaissance.|$|R
50|$|The Gregorio project {{started in}} 2006 at TELECOM Bretagne, a {{graduate}} engineering school in France.

6000|$|... "Then again, {{the delay}} at Plasencia has upset all Sir Arthur's arrangements. Had he pressed {{straight}} {{forward on the}} 28th of <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>when</b> he crossed the frontier, disregarding Cuesta altogether, {{he could have been}} at Madrid long before this; for I know that at that time Victor's force had been so weakened that he had but between fourteen and fifteen thousand men, and must have fallen back without fighting. Now he has again got the troops that had been taken from him, and will be further reinforced before Sir Arthur arrives on the Alberche; and of course Soult has {{had plenty of time to}} get everything in readiness to cross the mountains, and fall upon the British rear, as soon as he hears that they are fairly on their way towards Madrid. Here we are at the 20th, and our forces will only reach Oropesa today.|$|E
60|$|Though Captain Bob had {{stated that}} he did not wish to volunteer, and would not leave her if he could help it, the remark {{required}} some qualification. That Anne was charming and loving enough to chain him anywhere was true; but he had begun to find the mill-work terribly irksome at times. Often during the <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>when</b> standing among the rumbling cogs in his new miller's suit, which ill became him, he had yawned, thought wistfully of the old pea-jacket, and the waters of the deep blue sea. His dread of displeasing his father by showing anything of this change of sentiment was great; yet he might have braved it but for knowing that his marriage with Anne, which he hoped might take place the next year, was dependent entirely upon his adherence to the mill business. Even were his father indifferent, Mrs. Loveday would never intrust her only daughter to the hands of a husband who would be away from home five-sixths of his time.|$|E
60|$|The time Campbell ran was in 1850. I {{have not}} the exact date here. It was {{some time in}} 1850 that these {{interrogatories}} were put and the answer given. Campbell was elected to Congress, and served out his term. I think a second election came up before he served out his term, {{and he was not}} re-elected. Whether defeated or not nominated, I do not know. [Mr. Campbell was nominated for re-election by the Democratic party, by acclamation.] At the end of his term his very good friend Judge Douglas got him a high office from President Pierce, and sent him off to California. Is not that the fact? Just {{at the end of his}} term in Congress it appears that our mutual friend Judge Douglas got our mutual friend Campbell a good office, and sent him to California upon it. And not only so, but on the 27th of <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>when</b> Judge Douglas and myself spoke at Freeport in joint discussion, there was his same friend Campbell, come all the way from California, to help the Judge beat me; and there was poor Martin P. Sweet standing on the platform, trying to help poor me to be elected. That is true of one of Judge Douglas's friends.|$|E

50|$|Black Mamba APU {{has already}} arrested six poachers, shut down five poacher's camps and reduced snaring of {{wildlife}} by 76% since 2013.

6000|$|... "It matters nought who it is," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. [...] "She is ever ready {{to carry on}} with anyone, while she can hardly give me a civil word when I call. I know {{that if we were}} to marry it would be just the same thing, and that I am a fool to stop here and let it vex me. It would be better for me to get right out of it. John is old enough to take my place on the farm. Some of these days I will take the Queen's shilling. If I were once away I should not be always {{thinking}} of her. I know I am a fool to let a girl trouble me so, but I can't help it. If I stay here I know that I shall do mischief either to her or to someone else. I felt like doing it <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> she was over at that business at Squire Carthew's--he is just such another one as Captain Mallett, only he is a bad landlord, while ours is a good one. What made him think of asking all his own tenantry, and a good many of us round, and getting up a cricket match and a dance on the grass is more than I can say. He never did such a thing before in all the ten years since he became master there. They all noticed how he carried on with Martha, and how she seemed to like it. It was the talk of everyone there. If I had not gone away I should have made a fool of myself, though I have no right to interfere with her, and her father and mother were there and seemed in no way put out.|$|E
50|$|Some blame protesters for {{violence}} that local news media said has included vandalism, setting cars on campus alight and storming university buildings. Cairo University “will not tolerate students who practice violence and vandalism on campus,” university chairman Gaber Nassar said in statement <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> 23 students were {{expelled from the}} university {{for violence}}, according to local media.|$|E
5000|$|A TIME {{story of}} October 1989 also {{recalled}} that Afanasyev [...] "suffered a nasty embarrassment <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>when</b> Pravda reprinted a lurid dispatch from an Italian newspaper claiming that reformist Supreme Soviet Deputy Boris Yeltsin boozed and shopped {{his way through}} a tour of the U.S." [...] The report noted that the newspaper was pressured into publishing an apology, although recorded video subsequently broadcast over the Soviet television [...] "appeared to show Yeltsin at least mildly intoxicated." ...|$|E

50|$|Following his {{retirement}} from The Detroit News, in March 2015, {{it was announced}} that Gage was hired as a columnist for Fox Sports Detroit, where he began writing commentary and analysis about the Tigers from their spring training complex.

50|$|However, this working {{relationship}} barely <b>lasted</b> a <b>month.</b> <b>When</b> Cage Rage signed K-1 star Bob Sapp to a main event in London for their 21 April 2007, show K-1 stopped Sapp from {{fighting on the}} card. This left a desperate Geer and O'Donnell scrambling for a new main event on just days notice with aged veteran Tank Abbott eventually stepping in.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of murals, Maxine Albro moved {{right up}} {{in line with}} Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, and Clifford Wight <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>when</b> the Ebell Club of Los Angeles, {{after two years of}} {{internal}} squabbling, finally destroyed frescoes of the four Sybils which Miss Albro had painted in the loggia of its more or less Italian Club House.

50|$|On Wednesday, 17 January a {{demonstration}} {{was held in}} Larissa, where more than three thousand people protested against the anti-terrorism act and requested {{the withdrawal of the}} charges and the release of four jailed students, who were arrested during the demonstrations of December 2008. Larissa was the only city where the act was applied <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>when</b> twenty five teenagers were arrested. At the same time protesters of a separate rally also in Larissa destroyed bank cameras and wrote slogans on walls, churches and supermarkets.|$|E
40|$|Personalization {{has become}} a buzzword in the <b>last</b> <b>months</b> <b>when</b> talking about the {{internet}} and the World Wide Web. Nowadays, a lot of sites promise personalization features, but the services provided differ a lot. Most of the recent publications utilize personalization as a marketing tool, which helps to address customers in a one-to-one marketing manner. Apart from this, personalization and more personalized information services can be seen as unique information commodities supplied by content providers. In order to maximize benefits, the production tools have to be perfectly integrated into the production process applied for the production of recent mass publications. In this paper, we present a definition and characterization of personalization and resulting information goods and sketch an integrated production framework applicable mainly for publishers to provide personalized information services as a unique product in their portfolio. Finally, the paper discusses usability aspects of personalized information services...|$|R

He was raising needed revenue. And he was addressing a great injustice of the information age. State and federal legislators made a big mistake when they exempted e-commerce from taxes in the 1990s. They were giddy with the rhetoric of cyberanarchism and inspired by anti-tax yahoos convinced raising revenue is an optional part of running a government. The kindest thing one can say about the policy is that it constituted an overgenerous subsidy to an infant industry.” ...|$|E
