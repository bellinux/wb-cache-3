50|$|Many theatres {{also use}} Edison plugs, {{which are the}} {{standard}} connector used in homes and businesses in North America, because of their availability {{and the ability to}} connect household fixtures to a theatrical control system. Twist-lock connectors are used in many theatres because of their locking feature, which will not allow fixtures to become accidentally <b>disconnected.</b> <b>Connectors</b> used to power lighting fixtures must be rated at 20 amperes or higher, depending on local electrical codes. Temporary high-power distribution wiring often employs camlock connectors to connect dimming equipment, power distribution units, controllers for motorized chain hoists, and other high-power equipment to a company switch, generator, or other tie-in point.|$|R

40|$|Unprotected quick <b>disconnect</b> {{electrical}} <b>connectors</b> {{were exposed}} to fibers of 3 mm, 7 mm, and 12 mm lengths. The average exposure to failure was determined. Results indicate that when the fiber length divided by the airgap is less than one, multiple fibers are required to bridge the gap, and the exposure time to failure rises rapidly...|$|R
50|$|The Push-pull {{connector}} {{was invented}} by Swiss connectors manufacturer LEMO and {{is a type of}} cable interconnect that provides a strong locking mechanism that is only released by squeezing the connector body, preventing accidental <b>disconnects.</b> The <b>connector</b> is cylindrical, enabling a wide range of body styles and configurations such as low or high voltage multipin, coaxial, triaxial, fluid and gas.Fischer Connectors and Lemo are well-known Swiss manufacturing company that are leaders in developing and manufacturing broad range of circular push-pull connectors.|$|R

Technique is applied to other types of electrical actuation circuits, also launch of mapped vehicles, such as balloons, submarines, test sleds, and test chambers-all requiring assistance of ground crew...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Space Station Freedom tasks that are compatible with both telerobotic as well as extravehicular activity is a necessary redundancy {{in order to insure}} successful day to day operation. One task to be routinely performed aboard Freedom will be the changeout of various quick <b>disconnect</b> fluid <b>connectors.</b> In an attempt to resolve these potentially contradictory issues of compatibility, mock-ups of couplings suitable to both extravehicular as well as telerobotic activity were designed and built. An evaluation performed at the Remote Operator Interaction Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center is discussed, which assessed the prototype couplings as well as three standard coupling designs. Data collected during manual and telerobotic manipulation of the couplings indicated that the custom coupling was in fact shown to be faster to operate and generally preferred over the standard coupling designs...|$|R
50|$|Flight {{controllers}} from Houston also radioed Reilly {{that they}} had decided to have him <b>disconnect</b> the P-12 <b>connector</b> that was installed during EVA 1 since the Russian flight controllers were planning to make an attempt to restart the problematic computers in the ISS. Even though the connector was not in use at that time, engineers decided to have Reilly disconnect it {{to make sure that it}} was not causing any electrical noise or grounding issues that might have played a role in the computer trouble.|$|R
40|$|The first {{tests of}} the arcing during a hot <b>disconnect</b> of <b>connectors</b> in typical {{electric}} circuits of a 42 V automotive powernet have shown, that actions to control and minimize arcing are necessary. The only slight exceeding of the minimum arcing voltage, compared to high voltage devices, allows {{to look for a}} simple but effective new method to avoid damages by arcing. The technique of making use of the air flow in the connector chamber is chosen as the best suiting solution to fulfil the particular needs of applications in automotive powernets. Based on a theoretical model, a software tool to calculate the response of the arc has been developed. Various parameter settings have been calculated. The arcing characteristics have been plotted and the best suiting parameter set has been chosen. The results are verified with a prototype of a corresponding connector chamber. The calculated reduction of arcing could be achieved...|$|R
2500|$|Twist-locking {{connectors}} {{were first}} invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and [...] "Twist-Lock" [...] remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated, although {{the term is}} used generically to refer to NEMA locking connectors manufactured by any company. Locking connectors use curved blades. Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated blades latch into the receptacle. To unlatch the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a more reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings, where vibration or incidental impact could <b>disconnect</b> a non-locking <b>connector.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{they got}} closer, {{they found the}} ATDA {{to be in a}} slow rotation, with the conical nose shroud still attached, the two pieces hanging agape at the front like a giant, open jaw. Stafford {{described}} [...] "It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating around". He asked if maybe he could use the spacecraft to open the 'jaws' but the ground decided against it, fearing this might cause damage to the spacecraft.The crew described how the shroudâ€™s explosive bolts had fired but, because the quick <b>disconnect</b> <b>lanyards</b> that were designed to unlock the electrical connectors to the explosive bolts had not been hooked up, the electrical wiring to the bolts held the two 1-1/2 inch wide steel shroud retaining bands together. If the electrical wires were cut {{on one side of the}} shroud, the two steel bands would immediately straighten and, being still held together by the wires on the opposite side of the shroud, it was difficult to predict the path of the released bands. Their ability to rip open a space suit caused the salvage mission to be abandoned. At the Cape, backup pilot Buzz Aldrin suggested that Cernan cut the electric wires with surgical scissors from the equipment pack. An experiment on the ground demonstrated this could indeed slice the wires, but also showed the ATDA bristled with dangerous, sharp edges. Ground controllers were, in Deke Slayton's words, [...] "just aghast" [...] at the idea, which did not take into consideration the substantial risks of the energy in the released shroud retaining bands holding the shroud halves together, the constant spinning of the ATDA, or the fact that the released shroud retaining bands, might whip back, and puncture Cernan's spacesuit.|$|R
5000|$|Akers {{started the}} EVA by {{installing}} a foot restraint on the RMA for Thornton {{and proceeded to}} begin <b>disconnecting</b> three electrical <b>connectors</b> and a clamp assembly on the solar array. He had a slight problem with the clamp assembly but had the connectors demated by 11:17 pm EST. Thornton held the array in place {{so that it would}} not drift freely after being detached. The solar arrays weigh 160 kg and are 5 m long when folded. The astronauts dismounted the damaged array at 11:40 pm EST above the Sahara (during a nighttime pass to minimize electrical activity), and Thornton held the array until the next daylight pass (approximately 12 min) before throwing it overboard at 11:52 pm EST over Somalia. The jettison during daylight allowed the astronauts and flight controllers to accurately track its position and relative velocity. The release by Thornton imparted zero velocity to the arrays and then the orbiter did a small burn to put some distance between it and the array. The array, moving away from Endeavour at 5 ft/s, separated about 11 to 12 mi each orbit. [...] The crew then installed a new array, (finishing around 1:40 EST) and rotated the telescope 180 degrees. They then replaced the second solar array which was stowed away for return to ESA. After the 6.5 hour EVA, successful functional tests were performed by the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) on four of HST's six gyros. [...] Gyros 1 and 2 were not able to be tested due to the orientation of the telescope and were tested during the crew sleep period Monday afternoon (6 December 1993).|$|R
