40|$|Formation of {{the lateral}} {{olfactory}} tract (LOT) and innervation of the piriform cortex represent fundamental steps to allow the transmission of olfactory information to the cerebral cortex. Several transcription factors, including the zinc finger transcription factor Gli 3, influence <b>LOT</b> <b>formation</b> by controlling the development of mitral cells from which LOT axons emanate and/or by specifying the environment through which these axons navigate. Gli 3 null and hypomorphic mutants display severe defects throughout the territory covered by the developing {{lateral olfactory tract}}, {{making it difficult to}} identify specific roles for Gli 3 in its development. Here, we used Emx 1 Cre;Gli 3 fl/fl conditional mutants to investigate <b>LOT</b> <b>formation</b> and colonization of the olfactory cortex in embryos in which loss of Gli 3 function is restricted to the dorsal telencephalon. These mutants form an olfactory bulb like structure which does not protrude from the telencephalic surface. Nevertheless, mitral cells are formed and their axons enter the piriform cortex though the LOT is shifted medially. Mitral axons also innervate a larger target area consistent with an enlargement of the piriform cortex and form aberrant projections into the deeper layers of the piriform cortex. No obvious differences were found in the expression patterns of key guidance cues. However, we found that an expansion of the piriform cortex temporally coincides with the arrival of LOT axons, suggesting that Gli 3 affects LOT positioning and target area innervation through controlling the development of the piriform cortex...|$|E

40|$|Realizou-se um estudo epidemiológico de observação de 63 unidades terminadoras de suínos, com o objetivo de identificar os fatores de risco associados à ocorrência de artrite no abate. Em cada granja foram acompanhados cerca de 220 suínos por 110 dias e anotadas 42 variáveis, uma objetiva (condenação por artrite) e 41 explicativas (fatores de risco), desde a chegada dos leitões na propriedade até o serviço de inspeção federal no abate. Foram utilizados métodos descritivos e análises multivariadas. Das 63 granjas estudadas 39, 7 %, 33, 3 % e 27, 0 % apresentaram, respectivamente, nenhuma (0, 0 %), baixa (£ 0, 7 %) e alta (> 0, 7 %) ocorrência de carcaças condenadas por artrite. Observou-se associação entre a ocorrência de artrite com baixo ganho de peso diário, baixo rendimento de carne na carcaça, conversão alimentar ruim e baixo peso de carcaça. Os fatores de risco associados à ocorrência da artrite foram: granjas com histórico de condenações por artrite, mais de cinco anos sem reforma do piso, lote do sexo macho, ausência de forro nas instalações, limpeza das baias somente uma vez ao dia, condições ruins de transporte para o abate, galpões com mais de 250 suínos alojados e mais de 10 fornecedores de leitões na formação do lote.

40|$|Formaldehyde {{formation}} and reaction with muscle proteins in lean fish species during frozen storage {{is considered to}} be a major factor affecting texture and functionality deterioration. Formaldehyde {{formation and}} reaction with muscle compounds was reduced in lean fish minces and model systems when lipids with different degrees of oxidation were added. In order to increase the lipid content and slow down functional and textural changes, hake (Merluccius merluccius) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) minces mixed in the ratios 3 : 1; 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 (w/w) were stored at - 20 °C and studied for 1 year. Dimethylamine formation and, by deduction, formaldehyde formation increased. However, less free formaldehyde was detected, probably owing to reaction with muscle compounds in the mixed minces. Nevertheless, addition of sardine minces improved the texture, protein solubility and viscosity of the mixed minces compared with the hake minces. In the mixed <b>lots,</b> <b>formation</b> of large protein aggregates was delayed or prevented.

The export of lacquer from China to Japan accounted for 80 % of the total production, and was supported by the development of port areas that were led from the opening of river ports along the Chang Jiang. This paper tries to clarify the role of the merchants, using historical documents and deep interview data. The lacquer circulation relied on Chang Jiang basin basically and chose transit routes to as near ports as possible from each production region. Other than the influence of the transportation by ship, the location where the Jiangxi merchant purchased lacquer was rule factor. The formers tended to sell lacquer to places where many merchants purchase rather than convenient places to the waterway. Therefore distribution centers where a number of merchants gathered replaced production centers as lacquer brand names. Also, lacquer merchants’ skill meant a <b>lot</b> for the <b>formation</b> of brands. Lacquer merchants who could regulate the quality of lacquer well got big trust from Japanese merchants, and the brands of the distribution centers have become well-known.

The Information resulting from Formation Integrity Tests (FIT) is used throughout the life of the well and also for nearby wells. Casing depths, well control options, formation fracture pressures and limiting fluid weights may be based on this information. To determine the strength and integrity of a formation, a Leak Off Test (<b>LOT)</b> or a <b>Formation</b> Integrity Test (FIT) may be performed. This test is first: a method of checking the cement seal between casing and the formation, and second: determining the pressure and/or fluid weight the test zone below the casing can sustain. Whichever test is performed, some general points should be observed. The fluid in the well should be circulated clean to ensure it is of a known and consistent density. If mud is used for the test, it should be properly conditioned and gel strengths minimized. The pump used should be a high-pressure, low-volume test or cementing pump. Rig pumps can be used if the rig has electric drives on the mud pumps, and they can be slowly rolled over. If the rig pump must be used and the pump cannot be easily controlled at low rates, then the leak-off technique must be modified. It is a good idea to make a graph of the pressure versus time or volume for all leak-off tests.|$|R

Since atomic hydrogen cannot exist at high temperatures, this gas is not very luminous, so needs to be observed by other means, such as the absorption lines it produces in the spectra of background quasars. In this report, I present simulations showing how the small scale structure of the Lyman Alpha clouds could be measured by observing the spectra of a gravitationally lensed quasar {{over a period of}} time. The strength of the Lyman Alpha absorption lines relative to the continuum in the spectrum of a microlensed quasar is shown to vary with time, with the properties of the variations depending on the structure of the absorbing material. I conclude that such variations will be measurable via UV spectroscopy of image A of the lensed quasar Q 2237 + 0305 if the Lyman Alpha clouds between the quasar and the lensing galaxy possess structure on scales smaller than 0 : 1 pc.

Dielectrophoresis {{deals with the}} force on an electric dipole placed in an external in-homogenous field. The force depends on the geometry and volume of the dielectric material and on the frequency and gradient of the electric field. We report the self-assembly of metallic palladium nanowires from the aqueous solution by dielectrophoresis. The metal cations with the surrounding hydration shell and counter-ion cloud results {{in the formation of}} a dipole which responds to the local dielectrophoretic forces. Structural properties and morphology of the palladium nanowires are listed. Depending on the experimental conditions two different types of nanowires were grown. Some of them were extremely thin (5 nm diameter) and branched while the others were thick (25 nm diameter) and dendritic. The wire formation can be divided into the nucleation and growth process. For the particle assembly, a minimum threshold force is needed to overcome the random Brownian motion. The nucleation depends on the asperities on the electrode surface and the growth depends on the tip of the growing wires where exists extremely high field magnitude and in-homogeneties and so the force overcomes the threshold at these locations. We showed that wire growth depends a <b>lot</b> on the <b>formation</b> of the double layer at the electrode/solution interface and potential drop within the double layer. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) were also deposited between the electrodes leading to the formation of field-effect transistors (FETs).

Besides these inorganic systems, we also investigated the dielectrophoretic experimental conditions required for self assembly of bio-molecules like microtubules between the electrodes. Hybrid structures were also formed by mixing these materials in combination of two.

40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} is {{a flexible}} and efficient way of utilizing widely available domestic renewable resources. Syngas from biomass {{has the potential}} for biofuels production, which will enhance energy security and environmental benefits. Additionally, with the successful development of low Btu fuel engines (e. g. GE Jenbacher engines), syngas from biomass can be efficiently used for power/heat co-generation. However, biomass gasification has not been widely commercialized because of a number of technical/economic issues related to gasifier design and syngas cleanup. Biomass gasification, due to its scale limitation, cannot afford to use pure oxygen as the gasification agent that used in coal gasification. Because, it uses air instead of oxygen, the biomass gasification temperature is much lower than well-understood coal gasification. The low temperature leads to a <b>lot</b> of tar <b>formation</b> and the tar can gum up the downstream equipment. Thus, the biomass gasification tar removal is a critical technology challenge for all types of biomass gasifiers. This USDA/DOE funded program (award number: DE-FG 36 -O 8 GO 18085) aims to develop an advanced catalytic tar conversion system that can economically and efficiently convert tar into useful light gases (such as syngas) for downstream fuel synthesis or power generation. This program has been executed by GE Global Research in Irvine, CA, in collaboration with Professor Lanny Schmidt's group at the University of Minnesota (UoMn). Biomass gasification produces a raw syngas stream containing H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4 and other hydrocarbons, tars, char, and ash. Tars are defined as organic compounds that are condensable at room temperature and are assumed to be largely aromatic. Downstream units in biomass gasification such as gas engine, turbine or fuel synthesis reactors require stringent control in syngas quality, especially tar content to avoid plugging (gum) of downstream equipment. Tar- and ash-free syngas streams are a critical requirement for commercial deployment of biomass-based power/heat co-generation and biofuels production. There are several commonly used syngas clean-up technologies: (1) Syngas cooling and water scrubbing has been commercially proven but efficiency is low and it is only effective at small scales. This route is accompanied with troublesome wastewater treatment. (2) The tar filtration method requires frequent filter replacement and solid residue treatment, leading to high operation and capital costs. (3) Thermal destruction typically operates at temperatures higher than 1000 oC. It has slow kinetics and potential soot formation issues. The system is expensive and materials are not reliable at high temperatures. (4) In-bed cracking catalysts show rapid deactivation, with durability to be demonstrated. (5) External catalytic cracking or steam reforming has low thermal efficiency and is faced with problematic catalyst coking. Under this program, catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) is being evaluated for syngas tar clean-up in biomass gasification. The CPO reaction is exothermic, implying that no external heat is needed and the system is of high thermal efficiency. CPO is capable of processing large gas volume, indicating a very compact catalyst bed and a low reactor cost. Instead of traditional physical removal of tar, the CPO concept converts tar into useful light gases (eg. CO, H 2, CH 4). This eliminates waste treatment and disposal requirements. All those advantages make the CPO catalytic tar conversion system a viable solution for biomass gasification downstream gas clean-up. This program was conducted from October 1 2008 to February 28 2011 and divided into five major tasks. - Task A: Perform conceptual design and conduct preliminary system and economic analysis (Q 1 2009 ~ Q 2 2009) - Task B: Biomass gasification tests, product characterization, and CPO tar conversion catalyst preparation. This task will be conducted after completing process design and system economics analysis. Major milestones include identification of syngas cleaning requirements for proposed system design, identification and selection of tar compounds and 2 mixtures for use in CPO tests, and preparation of CPO catalysts for validation. (Q 3 2009 ~ Q 4 2009) - Task C: Test CPO with biomass gasification product gas. Optimize CPO performance with selected tar compounds. Optimize CPO performance with multi-component mixtures. Milestones include optimizing CPO catalysts design, collecting CPO experimental data for next stage kinetic modeling and understanding the effect of relative reactivities on ultimate tar conversion and syngas yields. (Q 1 2010 ~ Q 3 2010) - Task D: Develop tar CPO kinetic model with CPO kinetic model and modeling results as deliverables. (Q 3 2010 ~ Q 2 2011) - Task E: Project management and reporting. Milestone: Quarterly reports and presentations, final report, work presented at national technical conferences (Q 1 2009 ~ Q 2 2011) At the beginning of the program, IP landscaping was conducted to understand the operation of various types of biomass gasifiers, their unique syngas/tar compositions and potential tar mitigation options using the catalytic partial oxidation technology. A process simulation model was developed to quantify the system performance and economics impact of CPO tar removal technology. Biomass gasification product compositions used for performance evaluation tests were identified after literature review and system modeling. A reaction system for tar conversion tests was designed, constructed, with each individual component shaken-down in 2009. In parallel, University of Minnesota built a lab-scale unit and evaluated the tar removal performance using catalytic reforming. Benzene was used as the surrogate compound. The biomass gasification raw syngas composition was provided by GE through system studies. In 2010, GE selected different tar compounds and evaluated the tar removal effectiveness of the CPO catalyst. The catalytic performance was evaluated under different operating conditions, including catalyst geometry, S/C ratio, O/C ratio, GHSV, and N 2 dilution. An understanding of how to optimize catalytic tar removal efficiency by varying operating conditions has been developed. GE collaborated with UoMn in examining inorganic impurities effects. Catalysts were pre-impregnated with inorganic impurities commonly present in biomass gasification syngas, including Si, Ca, Mg, Na, K, P and S. UoMn performed catalyst characterization and has acquired fundamental understandings of impurities effect on catalytic tar removal. Based on experimental data and the proposed reaction pathway, GE constructed a model to predict kinetic performance for biomass gasification tar cleanup process. Experimental data (eg. tar conversion, reactor inlet and outlet temperatures, product distribution) at different operating conditions were used to validate the model. A good fit between model predictions and experimental data was found. This model will be a valuable tool in designing the tar removal reactor and identifying appropriate operating conditions. We attended the 2011 DOE Biomass Program Thermochemical Platform Review held in Denver, CO from February 16 to 18 and received very positive comments from the review panel. Further, syngas utility and biomass to power/fuel companies expressed strong interest in our tar removal technology...|$|R
