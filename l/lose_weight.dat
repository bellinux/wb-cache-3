5|$|In 1948, Turner {{appeared}} {{in her first}} Technicolor film, as Lady de Winter in The Three Musketeers, opposite Gene Kelly, Van Heflin, and June Allyson. In November 1947, she agreed to do the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission for doing so because of her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens a gym in the building, which intrigues Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who's {{been looking}} to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> However, Dwight's gym is only filled with his farming {{equipment}} as exercising equipment. Darryl says he needs actual equipment, which Dwight finally gets, but sees that Darryl is barely using it. Dwight asks more employees to join to help motivate Darryl to exercise harder. During a bench-press, Dwight refuses to spot Darryl unless {{he says his}} motivation to work out. Darryl finally says it is to impress the new female warehouse worker Val.|$|E

5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest {{during the summer}} and declines during winter, {{although}} populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more seasonally stable. Animals also often <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during winter. Population size varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas. In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> {{but it is also a}} masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Khan was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Three actors had {{initially}} been considered for the lead female role; Kapoor was ultimately chosen because she insisted on playing the part. Rampal accepted the role of Ra.One after Sinha expressed {{a strong desire to}} cast him in the film. Wu was contracted to the film in July 2010, and Goswami was cast one month later. Bachchan agreed {{to be a part of}} the film after being requested by Khan and Sinha. Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> and Verma learnt capoeira. Khan and Verma performed their own stunts, and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Males {{appear to}} reach {{maturity}} at around 45–50mm, at between 9 and 12 months, {{and at this}} size begin to develop a grey to brownish yellow wash beneath the chin. This indicates {{the development of a}} vocal sac and thus an ability to commence calling behaviour. Females reach sexual maturity at two years; those smaller than 65mm are not seen in amplexus; this length is not reached until the second season after metamorphosis. The frog is not of a type that only breeds once. Females can shed up to 26% of their weight when spawning, while males have also been seen to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during breeding, because they are eating less. The weight lost during the breeding season is typically regained from January to September.|$|E

5|$|Nigel and Vanessa Lawson {{divorced}} in 1980, when Nigella was 20. They both remarried: her father that {{year to a}} House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death). As her father {{was at the time}} a prominent political figure, some of the things Nigella found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. In the mid 1990s, he decided to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> for medical reasons, and subsequently wrote the best-selling The Nigel Lawson Diet Book. Nigella has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2014, Kesha {{checked into}} Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center, a rehab {{facility}} in Lemont, Illinois, for eating disorder treatment. Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa {{and that she had}} been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that Luke had allegedly told her to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> after he signed her, comparing the shape of her body to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da's {{father told}} Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E
