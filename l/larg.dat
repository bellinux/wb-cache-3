5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest, Marge Funeral, uses {{the legend of the}} so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and fuels the Lion War between <b>Larg</b> and Goltana. To stave off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza {{has no choice but to}} slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|Ramza joins a {{mercenary}} group, led by Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia {{from being}} hunted by both sides. Delita joins Prince Goltana's forces {{to rise up}} through the ranks and gain control over his own destiny. Ramza and Delita are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince <b>Larg,</b> though this proves futile. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia, while Delita continues to work in the shadows, working with multiple sides to realize his ambitions. Along the way to Lionel Castle, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Draclau's intervention.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot is then portrayed {{through the}} eyes of Ramza Beoulve, who is the player {{character}} of the story. His exploits in the war introduced him to a number of characters; each with their own roles and agenda concerning the war and the fictional world, Ivalice, that they inhabit. The most prominent factions {{at the beginning of the}} story are those of Prince Goltana and Prince <b>Larg,</b> both are nobles seeking to obtain control of the throne by being the guardian to the monarch's young heir and were thus engaged in a war. The story progresses to include characters from the Murond Glabados Church, which have been controlling Ivalice silently and engineering the war in question.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, {{including}} their leaders <b>Larg</b> and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper into the story, Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot. The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, who in the past was Saint Ajora, and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation. While racing off to find her, Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag's death. Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant, and frequently begs for death during the encounter.|$|E

At the conclusion of their participation, the Dutch marines embarked in Barnstable County, and the tank landing ship returned them to their base on Curaçao. She met up with the <b>LARG</b> again briefly at Vieques on 12 February before making a three-day port visit to Fredericksted, St. Croix. She rejoined the <b>LARG</b> to conduct Fleet exercises and transit back to Little Creek. The ship landed the marines at Morehead City on 22 February and reentered her home port the next day.|$|E

25|$|All these {{regional}} {{varieties of}} the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan, also called occitan <b>larg</b> (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis that respects and admits soft regional adaptations (which {{are based on}} the convergence of previous regional koinés). So Occitan can be considered as a pluricentric language. The standardisation process began with the publication of Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians, grammar of the languedocien dialect, by Louis Alibert (1935), followed by the Dictionnaire occitan-français selon les parlers languedociens (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of Pierre Bec (Gascon), Robèrt Lafont (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet. It is mostly supported by users of the classical norm. Due to the strong situation of diglossia, some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive Occitan as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.|$|E

Adding to its problems is the recent death of the king, whose heir is only an infant. A regent is needed to rule in place of the prince, and the kingdom is split between Prince Goltana, represented by the Black Lion, and Prince <b>Larg,</b> symbolized by the White Lion. The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War. Behind this backdrop is a revelation by the game's historian Alazlam J. Durai, who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom's church. [...] The setting is based around this character, named by default as Ramza, and revolves around his early life and the future conflicts he faced while the events that changed the kingdom unfold.|$|E

[...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at <b>larg)</b> and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be. Let no man seek [...] Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall [...] Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, [...] Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, [...] And hee the future evil shall no less [...] 770 [...] In apprehension then in substance feel [...] Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, [...] Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't [...] Famin and anguish will at last consume [...] Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope [...] When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, [...] All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd [...] With length of happy days the race of man; [...] But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see [...] Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. [...] 780 [...] How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, [...] And whether here the Race of man will end. [...] To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst [...] In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they [...] First seen in acts of prowess eminent [...] And great exploits, but of true vertu void; [...] Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste [...] Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby [...] Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, [...] Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, [...] 790 [...] Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride [...] Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. [...] The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr [...] Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose [...] And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd [...] In sharp contest of Battel found no aide [...] Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale [...] Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, [...] Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords [...] Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear [...] 800 [...] More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: [...] So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, [...] Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; [...] One Man except, the onely Son of light [...] In a dark Age, against example good, [...] Against allurement, custom, and a World [...] Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, [...] Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes [...] Shall them admonish, and before them set [...] The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, [...] 810 [...] And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come [...] On thir impenitence; and shall returne [...] Of them derided, but of God observd [...] The one just Man alive; by his command [...] Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, [...] To save himself and houshold from amidst [...] A World devote to universal rack. [...] No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast [...] Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, [...] And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts [...] 820 [...] Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre [...] Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep [...] Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp [...] Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise [...] Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount [...] Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd [...] Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, [...] With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift [...] Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, [...] And there take root an Iland salt and bare, [...] 830 [...] The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. [...] To teach thee that God attributes to place [...] No sanctitie, if none be thither brought [...] By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. [...] And now what further shall ensue, behold. [...] He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, [...] Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, [...] Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie [...] Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; [...] And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass [...] 840 [...] Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, [...] As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink [...] From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole [...] With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt [...] His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. [...] The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground [...] Fast {{on the top of}} som high mountain fixt. [...] And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; [...] With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive [...] Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. [...] 850 [...] Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, [...] And after him, the surer messenger, [...] A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie [...] Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; [...] The second time returning, in his Bill [...] An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: [...] Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke [...] The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; [...] Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, [...] Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds [...] 860 [...] A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow [...] Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, [...] Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. [...] Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad [...] Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. [...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. [...] Farr less I now lament for one whole World [...] 870 [...] Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce [...] For one Man found so perfet and so just, [...] That God voutsafes to raise another World [...] From him, and all his anger to forget. [...] But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, [...] Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, [...] Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde [...] The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, [...] Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? [...] To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; [...] 880 [...] So willingly doth God remit his Ire, [...] Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, [...] Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw [...] The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh [...] Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, [...] Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, [...] That he relents, not to blot out mankind, [...] And makes a Covenant never to destroy [...] The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea [...] Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World [...] 890 [...] With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings [...] Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set [...] His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look [...] And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, [...] Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost [...] Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, [...] Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.|$|E

Today the monument is {{all that remains of}} the old kirk.From its beginnings as a small village around its kirk, <b>Largs</b> evolved into a busy and popular seaside resort in the nineteenth century. Large hotels appeared and the pier was constructed in 1834. It was not until 1895, however, that the railway made the connection to <b>Largs,</b> sealing the town's popularity.|$|R
