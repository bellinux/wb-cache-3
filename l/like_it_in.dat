5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

The play is {{not mentioned in the}} list of Shakespeare's plays published by Francis Meres in 1598. Based on these two points, {{as well as a number}} of contemporary allusions, and the belief that the play is similar to Hamlet in vocabulary, and to Henry V and As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>in</b> metre, scholars have suggested 1599 as a probable date.|$|E

25|$|After the Jacobean/Caroline era, A Midsummer Night's Dream {{was never}} {{performed}} {{in its entirety}} until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like Henry Purcell's musical masque/play The Fairy Queen (1692), which had a successful run at the Dorset Garden Theatre, but was not revived. Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of Love in a Forest, his 1723 adaptation of As You <b>Like</b> <b>It.</b> <b>In</b> 1755, David Garrick did {{the opposite of what}} had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called The Fairies.

In the tournament itself, little balls of fire were lobbed among the horses as they crossed.

500|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{is legal}} to possess a bat'leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are {{considered}} to be [...] "potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle." [...] They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. A replica bat'leth was surrendered to Gloucestershire Constabulary as part of the 2006 knife amnesty in the UK. In 2008, a miniature bat'leth was seized in Oxford after a 17-year-old was caught trying to smuggle it into a College. Police described the weapon as [...] "most horrendous". The person was arrested and sentenced to six months in a young offenders' institution. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of a miniature bat'leth in a public street.

500|$|Chris is {{extremely}} health-conscious and exercises constantly; he runs 10 miles during his lunch break alone, and considers a 15km run to be [...] "light" [...] exercise. He avoids eating red meat and fatty foods {{in favor of}} dishes like lean turkey burgers and vegetable loaf sweetened with fruit reduction, and takes a huge assortment of unusual vitamins.

500|$|In March 2006, {{when the}} {{structural}} {{part of the}} narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes {{that needed to be}} kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say [...] "Snow and Hope reconcile". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a [...] "reliable and calm leader type" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was [...] "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include something <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.|$|E
500|$|Chandler {{had been}} {{dissatisfied}} with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he took the advice of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, after taking a five-week break from recording while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Assisted by engineer Mike Ross, the band were especially productive during the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] and basic instrumental tracks for [...] "Love or Confusion", [...] "Can You See Me", and [...] "Third Stone from the Sun". Ross recalled the impact of Hendrix's Marshall stacks: [...] "It was so loud you couldn't stand in the studio... I'd never heard anything <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my life." [...] When Ross asked Hendrix where he would like the microphone placed Hendrix replied: [...] "Oh, man, just put a mic about twelve feet away {{on the other side}} of the studio. It'll sound great." [...] Ross agreed, and with a Neumann U87 tube mic he recorded Hendrix's guitar playing in a large room that, according to Ross, [...] "was absolutely vital to the uniquely powerful Experience sound." [...] Ross noted that input from Mitchell and Redding was minimized, and he asserted that Chandler was clearly [...] "the one in charge" [...] of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and backup vocals were overdubbed. Despite his dwindling finances, Chandler encouraged the Experience to record numerous takes of a song, affording them the luxury of repeated attempts at a satisfactory recording. With a live instrument track as the foundation of the recordings, they eschewed the common practice of piecing together parts of several takes to make one continuous piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their television debut, on Britain's Ready Steady Go! ...|$|E
500|$|Scant {{details are}} {{known about the}} early history of the Dumas Brothel; however, two early {{boarders}} of the house listed their occupations as [...] "gambler" [...] and [...] "saloon man" [...] in census records. By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis, her servant, a Chinese cook and four prostitutes. The cost of sex in the brothel {{at the turn of the}} 20th century was fifty cents, with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount. [...] Despite the size of the brothel, by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment. In 1903 the Dumas and businesses <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Butte's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures. These businesses were frequented by miners from the local Anaconda Copper Mining Company. That year, traffic grew to a point where the Dumas's operations had to be expanded, building [...] "cribs" [...] (tiny cubicles where the girls worked) in the basement of the house. There were several ways potential clients could access the brothel. A back door of the Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley, near South Wyoming Street, which was the busiest section of Butte's red light area. The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk. Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts, by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there. Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley, and commuted to the brothel for their shifts. In Butte, the activities of the city's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street. From the windows of their street-facing cribs, the girls would attract prospective clients in varying states of undress. The Butte Miner, a local newspaper, explained how the girls did this: ...|$|E
