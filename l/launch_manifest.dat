40|$|NASA’s human Lunar and Mars {{exploration}} (HLE/HME) program {{requires a}} sustainable and affordable transportation system between Earth and Moon/Mars. A crucial element {{of this system}} is the launch vehicle. Much debate has centered on the trade between expendable launch vehicles and heavy-lifters; however, arguments to date have been largely qualitative or limited in scope. This paper provides a quantitative enumeration of the launch vehicle trade space (in terms of both cost and risk), based on a generalizable process for generating <b>launch</b> <b>manifests</b> from transportation architectures (sets of vehicles for carrying out Lunar/Mars missions). For the baseline HLE/HME architecture considered here, an optimal launch vehicle size is found at approximately 82 metric tons; a 28 -mt EELV emerges as another good option. The results show optimal launch vehicle selection is highly dependent on the transportation architecture. Therefore, launch vehicle selection should be considered {{an integral part of}} the design of the Moon/Mars exploration transportation system.

The transition of this function to the commercial sector under Firm Fixed-Price contracting has forced both NASA and commercial providers to adjust to make this effort successful. Improving bag-level cargo <b>launch</b> <b>manifests</b> delivered from NASA to the provider {{more than a year}} in advance is an area where significant gains can be realized by reducing, if not eliminating, costly and time-consuming analysis and/or physical rework during the launch campaign.

This research investigates the application of Monte Carlo simulation based on historical launch cargo data as a proof-of-concept demonstration for improving these manifest deliverables.

The comparison was done assuming an 11 -year mission model beginning in 1995 and averaging over 100 MT of payloads per year to GEO. When analyzed from a total transportation standpoint, the launch system employed had the greatest impact on the basing mode comparison. A launch fleet consisting of both a basic STS and a Shuttle derivative cargo vehicle provided the least cost. Only a small advantage (3 %) was found in flight performance for the space based (SB) OTV once it incorporated the necessary provisions for space debris protection and on-orbit maintenance. Propellant storage and transfer losses associated with the SB OTV amounted to 12 % of the actual flight propellant requirement. Turnaround of the SB OTV required a crew of 3 and 40 % duty cycle. The life cycle cost comparison including all involved space elements indicated less than a 10 % difference between basing modes.

Through this combination of propulsion technologies, these architectures take advantage of the high efficiency SEP propulsion system to deliver cargo, while maintaining the faster trip times afforded by chemical propulsion for crew transport. Evolved configurations of the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) are considered for cargo delivery.

40|$|NASA's human lunar and Mars {{exploration}} program {{requires a}} new transportation system between Earth and the Moon or Mars. In recent years, unfortunately, human space exploration programs have faced myriad political, technical, and financial difficulties. In {{order to avoid}} such problems, future human space exploration programs should be designed from the start for affordability. This thesis addresses one aspect of affordable exploration programs by tackling the issue of high costs for access to space. While launch vehicle trades for exploration programs are relatively well understood, on-orbit assembly has been given much less attention, but is an equally {{important component of the}} infrastructure enabling human access to space. Two separate but related perspectives on in-space assembly of modular spacecraft are provided: first, the coupling between launch vehicle selection, vehicle design, and on-orbit assembly is explored to provide a quantitative understanding of this combined tradespace; and second, a number of on-orbit assembly methods are analyzed {{in order to understand the}} potential value of a reusable assembly support infrastructure. (cont.) Within the first topic, a quantitative enumeration of the launcher-assembly tradespace (in terms of both cost and risk) is provided based on a generalizable process for generating spacecraft modules and <b>launch</b> <b>manifests</b> from a transportation architecture. An optimal module size and launcher capability is found for a sample architecture at 82 metric tons; a 28 -mt EELV emerges as another good option. The results show that the spacecraft design, assembly planning, and launcher selection are highly coupled and should be considered together, rather than separately. Within the second topic, four separate assembly strategies involving module self-assembly, tug-based assembly, and in-space refueling are modeled and compared in terms of mass-to-orbit requirements for various on-orbit assembly tasks. Results show that the assembly strategy has a significant impact on overall launch mass, and reusable space tugs with in-space refueling can significantly reduce the required launch mass for on-orbit assembly. This thesis thus examines a broad but focused set of issues associated with on-orbit assembly of next-generation modular spacecraft. by Erica Lynn Gralla. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Human {{missions}} to Mars, {{particularly to the}} Martian surface, are grand endeavors that place extensive demands on ground infrastructure, launch capabilities, and mission systems. The interplay of capabilities and limitations among these areas can have significant impacts on the costs and ability to conduct Mars missions and campaigns. From a mission and campaign perspective, decisions that affect element designs, including those based on launch vehicle and ground considerations, can create effects that ripple through all phases of the mission and have {{significant impact on the}} overall campaign. These effects result in impacts to element designs and performance, <b>launch</b> and surface <b>manifesting,</b> and mission operations. In current Evolvable Mars Campaign concepts, the NASA Space Launch System (SLS) is the primary launch vehicle for delivering crew and payloads to cis-lunar space. SLS is currently developing an 8. 4 m diameter cargo fairing, with a planned upgrade to a 10 m diameter fairing in the future. Fairing diameter is a driving factor that impacts many aspects of system design, vehicle performance, and operational concepts. It creates a ripple effect that influences all aspects of a Mars mission, including: element designs, grounds operations, launch vehicle design, payload packaging on the lander, launch vehicle adapter design to meet structural launch requirements, control and thermal protection during entry and descent at Mars, landing stability, and surface operations. Analyses have been performed in each of these areas to assess and, where possible, quantify the impacts of fairing diameter selection on all aspects of a Mars mission. Several potential impacts of launch fairing diameter selection are identified in each of these areas, along with changes to system designs that result. Solutions for addressing these impacts generally result in increased systems mass and propellant needs, which can further exacerbate packaging and flight challenges. This paper presents the results of the analyses performed, the potential changes to mission architectures and campaigns that result, and the general trends that are more broadly applicable to any element design or mission planning for human exploration...|$|R
