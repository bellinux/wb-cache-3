5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Iniki's {{high winds}} caused {{extensive}} damage in Kauai. 1,421houses were destroyed, and 63 were <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> {{the storm surge}} and wave action. A total of 5,152homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A few were restored quickly, though some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii—never reopened after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. Heat is {{constantly}} <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> the body. Food products reach {{the heart and}} are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.|$|E
5|$|A {{second wave}} set off from Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> this wave. Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured. The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice-Marshal Paul Maltby, who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Both choughs {{occupied}} {{more extensive}} ranges in the past, reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present, with the Alpine chough breeding in Europe {{as far south}} as southern Italy, and both the decline and range fragmentation continue. Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and Alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent. In the Canary Islands, the red-billed chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and the Alpine was <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> the archipelago altogether.|$|E

5|$|Cielo started {{competing}} in backstroke. In the region at the time, Guilherme Guido stood {{out as the}} opponent to beat. Guido defeated Cielo repeatedly in freestyle, while Cielo won the backstroke events. However, at a certain point, Guido began to lose to freestyle opponents, and began {{competing in}} backstroke events. He defeated Cielo, who then decided not swim backstroke anymore. At age 15, Cielo attended a series of trainings in Florida, USA, and returned home, willing to defeat Guido. When Cielo and Guido were reunited in a 100m freestyle contest, Guido fell behind and <b>lost.</b> <b>From</b> then on, Guido focused on backstroke, reversing positions with Cielo.|$|E
5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|In February 1999, Air Stord {{filed for}} bankruptcy. On 21February, Teddy Air {{launched}} a route between Stord Airport, Sørstokken, and Oslo, using Saab 340 aircraft. This allowed four daily round trips during the week, and two on Sundays. Other airlines saw the route as attractive, and Coast Air launched eight daily round trips {{between the two}} airports. Teddy Air was soon forced {{to withdraw from the}} route, after it was unable to make any profits from it. The Fagernes routes were <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> 1August 1999, when the contract was won by Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August, the Luftwaffe {{began an}} all-out assault on RAF airfields. Christened Adlertag (Eagle Day), the raids saw the {{heaviest}} fighting thus far. Scrambling at 16:00 to intercept an incoming raid near Dover, 65 Squadron encountered {{large numbers of}} Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 51 led by Hannes Trautloft. Finucane claimed a Bf 109 shot down and damaged another, leaving the Messerschmitt streaming smoke. Finucane lost contact with it in cloud and he claimed as a probable. One Bf 109 was <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> JG 51 and the pilot wounded. Two more were 80 percent damaged. 65 Squadron suffered no losses. 0n 18 August Finucane {{was involved in the}} large air battles that characterised the campaign. 65 Squadron engaged Heinkel He 111 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 1 downing one of their number.|$|E

5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Middle East, the 2/3rd was {{assigned}} to the 7th Division, the 2nd AIF's second division and subsequently joined them in Palestine, establishing a camp at Hill 95, to the north of Gaza. There the battalion undertook a vigorous physical training regime to regain the fitness <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> the sea voyage. The final elements of unit identity were issued at the time: s and colour patches. It also finally began to receive its vehicles and heavy equipment, including its Vickers machine guns as preparations were made for the battalion to join the fighting in the Western Desert.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was <b>lost</b> <b>from</b> the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E
