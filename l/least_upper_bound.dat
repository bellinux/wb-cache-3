25|$|More formally, real {{numbers have}} the two basic {{properties}} of being an ordered field, and having the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> property. The first says that real numbers comprise a field, with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be totally ordered on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an upper bound, then it has a real <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound.</b> The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an upper bound (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> property.|$|E

50|$|In other words, PD is the {{collection}} of downward-closed subsets of D that are also closed under existing <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> of directed sets in D.

50|$|The {{fact that}} there exist {{increasing}} sequences without <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> may seem strange to those accustomed to thinking about the semantics of sequential programs. It may help {{to point out that}} the increasing sequences produced by sequential programs all have <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds.</b> Indeed, the partial computations that can be produced by sequential computation form an ω-complete subdomain of the domain of Actor computations Diagrams. An informal proof follows.|$|R
25|$|The {{order is}} Dedekind-complete; that is: every {{non-empty}} subset S of ℝ with an upper bound in ℝ has a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> (also called supremum) in ℝ.|$|E
25|$|Every {{real number}} is either {{rational}} or irrational. Every real number {{corresponds to a}} point on the number line. The real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> property.|$|E
25|$|A {{partially}} {{ordered set}} (L, ≤) is a complete lattice if every subset A of L has both a greatest lower bound (the infimum, also called the meet) and a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> (the supremum, also called the join) in (L, ≤).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{directly}} working with typed unification grammars in which type unification is not well-defined. This {{is often the}} case, as large-scale HPSG grammars now usually have type systems for which many pairs do not have <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds.</b> Our method yields a unification algorithm that compiles quickly and yet is nearly as fast during parsing as one that requires <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds.</b> The method also provides a natural naming convention for unification results in cases where no user-defined type exists...|$|R
50|$|Zorn's lemma states that, if a poset has an <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> {{for every}} chain, {{then it has}} a maximal element. Thus, it applies to chain-complete posets, but is more general in that it allows chains that have <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> but do not have <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{partially}} {{ordered set}} can {{be treated as a}} category, using the order relation as the morphisms. In this case the products and coproducts correspond to greatest lower <b>bounds</b> (meets) and <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> (joins).|$|R
25|$|A {{totally ordered}} set {{is said to be}} {{complete}} if every nonempty subset that has an upper bound, has a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound.</b> For example, the set of real numbers R is complete but the set of rational numbers Q is not.|$|E
25|$|The last {{property}} is what differentiates the reals from the rationals. For example, {{the set of}} rationals with square less than 2 has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.5) but no rational <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound,</b> because the square root of 2 is not rational.|$|E
25|$|For another example, {{consider}} {{again the}} relation | on natural numbers. The <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> of two numbers {{is the smallest}} number that is divided by both of them, i.e. the least common multiple of the numbers. Greatest lower bounds in turn are given by the greatest common divisor.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{a class of}} arithmetic equations over the complete lattice of integers (extended with −∞ and ∞) and provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing least solutions. For systems of equations with addition and <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds,</b> this algorithm is a smooth generalization of the Bellman-Ford al- gorithm for computing the single source shortest path in presence {{of positive and negative}} edge weights. The method then is extended to deal with more general forms of operations as well as minima with constants. For the latter, a controlled widening is applied at loops where unbounded increase occurs. We apply this algorithm to construct a cubic time algorithm for the class of interval equations using <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds,</b> addition, intersection with constant intervals as well as multiplication...|$|R
50|$|A {{continuous}} semiring {{is similarly}} defined as one {{for which the}} addition monoid is a continuous monoid: that is, partially ordered with the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> property, and for which addition and multiplication respect order and suprema. The semiring N ∪ {∞} with usual addition, multiplication and order extended, is a continuous semiring.|$|R
25|$|The supremum/superior/outer {{limit is}} a set that joins these {{accumulation}} sets together. That is, it is the union {{of all of the}} accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the supremum limit is the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> on the set of accumulation points because it contains each of them. Hence, it is the supremum of the limit points.|$|E
25|$|These {{properties}} imply Archimedean property (which is not {{implied by}} other definitions of completeness). That is, {{the set of}} integers is not upper-bounded in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> N; then, N – 1 {{would not be an}} upper bound, and there would be an integer n such that , and thus , which is a contradiction with the upper-bound property of N.|$|E

At first sight the definitions above appear to be circular: || ∈|| depends on ||=||, which depends on ||⊆||, which depends on ||∈||. However, a close examination shows that the definition of ||∈|| only depends on ||∈|| for elements of smaller rank, so ||∈|| and || =|| are well defined functions from VB'VB to B.|$|E

25|$|A lattice is an {{abstract}} structure {{studied in the}} mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra. It consists of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum (also called a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> or join) and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound or meet). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.|$|E
25|$|It follows by an {{induction}} {{argument that}} every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> and a greatest lower bound. With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; see Completeness (order theory) for more {{discussion of this}} subject. That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition {{in terms of the}} existence of suitable Galois connections between related partially ordered sets — an approach of special interest for the category theoretic approach to lattices, and for formal concept analysis.|$|E
25|$|Every {{non-empty}} well-ordered set has a least element. Every element s of a well-ordered set, {{except a}} possible greatest element, {{has a unique}} successor (next element), namely the least element of the subset of all elements greater than s. There may be elements besides the least element which have no predecessor (see Natural numbers below for an example). In a well-ordered set S, every subset T which has an upper bound has a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound,</b> namely the least element of the subset of all upper bounds of T in S.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} regular algebras, admitting in nitary regular terms {{interpreted as}} <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> of suitable approximation chains. We prove that nitary observable contexts are sucient for observational indistinguishability {{in a regular}} algebra. Moreover, assumed all observable sorts to be essentially at, observational equivalence is also completely characterized by nitary contexts. As a corollary, methods of proving behavioural properties and observational equivalence of standard algebras can be reused {{in the setting of}} regular algebras...|$|R
40|$|Characterising colimiting omega-cocones of {{projection}} pairs {{in terms}} of <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> of their embeddings and projections {{is important to the}} solution of recursive domain equations. We present a universal characterisation of this local property as omega-cocontinuity of locally continuous functors. We present a straightforward proof using the enriched Yoneda embedding. The proof can be generalised to Cattani and Fiore's notion of locality for adjoint pairs. Comment: Talk proposal for the Domains XI 2014 Workshop, uploaded for archiving purpose...|$|R
40|$|The <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> of {{the powers}} {{extracted}} and scattered by bi-anisotropic particles are investigated analytically. A rigorous derivation for particles having invertible polarizability tensors is presented, and the particles with singular polarizability tensors that {{have been reported in}} the literature are treated explicitly. The analysis concludes that previous <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> presented for isotropic particles can be extrapolated to bi-anisotropic particles. In particular, it is shown that neither nonreciprocal nor magnetoelectric coupling phenomena can further increase those <b>upper</b> <b>bounds</b> on the extracted and scattered powers. The outcomes are illustrated further with approximate circuit model examples of two dipole antennas connected via a generic lossless network. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure...|$|R
25|$|These {{last two}} properties, {{together}} with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the Heine–Borel theorem. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> axiom. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of constructing the real numbers as {{the completion of the}} rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.|$|E
25|$|No {{polygonal}} {{path between}} two points is {{shorter than the}} line between them. This implies that no curve can have an arc length less than the distance between its endpoints. By definition, the arc length of a curve is the <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> of the lengths of all polygonal approximations of the curve. The result for polygonal paths shows that the straight line between the endpoints is shortest of all the polygonal approximations. Because the arc length of the curve is {{greater than or equal}} to the length of every polygonal approximation, the curve itself cannot be shorter than the straight line path.|$|E
25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a <b>least</b> <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> on X, namely {{an upper}} bound on X that is less or equal to every {{upper bound on}} X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E
