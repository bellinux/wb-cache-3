For a given film sensor, the output voltage produced due to mechanical impact is {{highly dependent on}} the direction of stretching (or compressing) and active area of the film sensor. More is the active area of the film; higher will be the output voltage. It is shown that the active area is significantly increased due to the ridge-like shape given at the inner surfaces of the plates of sandwich type <b>loadcell</b> {{and as a result}} of which higher conversion efficiency is obtained. The effectiveness of the ridge-like shape is confirmed statistically by conducting two factorial design of experiment in which shape and material of the <b>loadcell</b> are considered as the two factors with 2 × 4 matrix. In case of <b>loadcell</b> made of glass plates, more than 100 % increase in the output voltage is observed for ridge-like shape in comparison to its plain counterpart.

These various movements are heaving motion, rolling motion, pitching motion, etc. In this paper, these various movements are collectively called as “vibration-like movements”. The term of “vibration-like moving conditions” means the conditions in which vibration-like movements exist. In the previous paper[1], the weighing system which has 3 dummy loadcells is discussed. “Dummy <b>loadcell</b> ” is the <b>loadcell</b> which observes the vibration-like movements. We manufactured the weighing system and made several experiments with the weighing system. As a result of those experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed method is able to weigh under the vibration-like moving conditions accurately. The purpose of this research is the practical realization of the weighing system. In order to put the weighing system into practical use, it is needed to reduce the size and weight of the weighing system. Accelerometers are substituted for the dummy loadcells.

40|$|The force {{performance}} of different tillage tools {{was investigated in}} sandy loam and clay loam fields at a working depth of 18 cm and at three operating speeds. The tools included four cutting edges: flat, 90 Â°, 40 Â°, and elliptical with rake angles of 20 Â° and 33 Â°. Draft, vertical, and side forces were measured using six <b>loadcells</b> in a three directional arrangement such that two <b>loadcells</b> measured draft, three measured vertical force, and one measured the side force. All the variables were combined to form a 2 x 3 x 4 factorial experiment with three replicates. The force {{data were analyzed using}} balanced analysis of variance with a Mini tab statistical package. The instrumentation included an accelerometer to investigate the movement of the shank, a potentiometer to determine working depth, and a magnetic pickup to indicate operating speed. The draft measurements for all tools were compared to the values generated using a prediction equation from an ASAE standard. Results indicated that two of the modified tools had lower draft than the predicted values. Draft increased from a minimum for the flat cutting edge to a maximum for the elliptical shape in the sandy loam and clay loam soils. There {{was no significant difference in}} draft with respect to the rake angle, but there was a significant increase in draft due to higher operating speeds in sandy loam and clay loam soils. The clay loam field had draft values lower than those of the sandy loam field. Similar trend was observed for the vertical force. Due to tool symmetry, the side force was insignificant. A linear relationship existed between resultant force and operating speed in both soil types. The accelerometer data showed that there was vibration of the shank during tillage. The results were similar to the ones reported by Zhang (1997) and indicated an increase in vibration frequency of the shank with an increase in resultant force...|$|R

However, in general, four-brake calipers are required to implement a mechanical brake system for one car. In this article, we implement a brake hardware-in-the-loop simulation system only with one brake caliper and three air tanks accounting for hysteresis and pneumatic cylinder dynamics, ultimately saving installation space and reducing financial budget costs. Since the brake caliper has a high nonlinearity, such as hysteresis resulting from friction and from the precompressed spring of the brake cylinder, we measured the hysteresis of the brake caliper clamping force for a mechanical brake system using <b>loadcells,</b> based on which a mathematical model was constructed for the hysteresis of the clamping force between the brake pad and the disk.

40|$|Friction and {{lubrication}} {{are important}} in the roll bite of cold rolling process as they influence the rolling force and other rolling process parameters. The rolling force determines the reduction of strip being rolled, the rolling mill stretch and final strip thickness and shape accuracy. The ability to control more accurately the rolling force in industry is becoming increasingly important. Inaccurate understanding of friction in the roll bite has affected the accuracy of rolling force prediction, and hence the accuracy the final strip thickness. Much research {{work has been done}} in modeling the pressure distribution for the rolling process under fully hydrodynamic lubrication and mixed film lubrication. At the same time, some experimental works have also been done in determining the value of friction coefficient in cold rolling by using embedded pin transducer method in the work roll. This study proposes to determine the friction coefficient and temperature in the roll bite in cold rolling by experimental methods. A sensor roll embedded with <b>loadcells</b> and strain gauged pins was designed and manufactured to determine the friction coefficient along the roll bite in cold rolling. The <b>loadcells</b> and strain gauges were calibrated insitu. The average friction coefficient was also derived from the forward slip which was determined by Laser Doppler method and a strip marking method. The temperature over the roll bite was measured by the embedded thermocouple under different rolling conditions. A large number of experiments were performed to determine the friction coefficient under different reduction, rolling speed, surface roughness, material property and lubricants. The relationships between the rolling parameters such as rolling force, rolling torque, temperature, lubricant, friction coefficient and surface roughness etc. have been discussed. Empirical formulae of friction coefficient and rolling force were given. The measured friction coefficient was used in the calculation of rolling force and torque which were compared with the measured values to validate the measured friction coefficient. A theoretical model was developed by to consider the hydrodynamic inlet zone, plastic work zone and hydrodynamic outlet zone. The effects of lubricant and friction coefficient etc. in the mixed film model were discussed. The effect of the modification to the hydrodynamic film thickness at the inlet caused by the strip elastic recovery at entry was also considered. The temperatures in the lubricant and at the asperity contacts were calculated, respectively. The lubricant temperature at the roll and strip interface and lubricant mean temperature was obtained by using the energy equation. The temperature at asperity contact was calculated by using the moving heat source theory. The temperature calculation considers not only the plastic deformation of the bulk material, but also the frictional heat at the interface. The effects of different friction coefficient, reduction and fraction of plastic work converted to heat have been discussed.

This bunching causes data loss for automatic walk-through devices {{placed in the}} lanes that require cows to pass through one at a time. The StepMetrixTM is such a device developed for early detection of hind-limb lameness in individual cows. The system utilizes a split-floor design with <b>loadcells</b> to record and analyze the ground reaction forces generated by a cow's walk after milking. The analysis uses a statistical model to produce an SMXTM score, which {{is associated with the}} probability of a cow being lame.; Upon examination of hundreds of data signatures, it was discovered that certain signatures have data generated by hind limbs that can be extracted {{to be used in the}} statistical lameness model. Specific types of steps produced by two cows walking in tandem were identified, and cutoffs were found for specific metrics to enable automatic detection of those step types. Using basic assumptions about the walk of a cow, the SoftSeparatorTM identifies specific step sequences to recognize where data generated by hind limbs is present and then extracts the data. The results of the SoftSeparatorTM algorithm were tested on 200 data files generated at two different farms. In its best incarnation, SoftSeparatorTM successfully extracted 509 instances of hind-limb data out of 629 total instances, while incorrectly extracting only 25 instances.

The main parachute in the PDS was a 30. 5 -meter supersonic Disksail parachute. The term Disksail {{is derived from}} the canopy's constructional geometry, as it combined the aspects of a ringsail and a flat circular round (disk) canopy. The crown area of the canopy contained the disk feature, as a large flat circular disk that extended from the canopy's vent down to the upper gap. From this upper gap to the skirt-band the canopy was constructed with characteristics of sails seen in a ringsail. There was a second lower gap present in this sail region. The canopy maintained a nearly 10 x forebody diameter trailing distance with 1. 7 Do suspension line lengths. During the test, the parachute was deployed at the targeted Mach and dynamic pressure. Although the supersonic Disksail parachute experienced an anomaly during the inflation process, the system was tested successfully in the environment it was designed to operate within. The nature of the failure seen originated in the disk portion of the canopy.

The forces between the supporting arms and the tower are calculated theoretically and then simulated by a computere. A measuring devise is then designed to measure the forces experimentally. The forces acting on the attachment between the supporting arms and the tower is primarily the centripetal force, gravitational force and the aerodynamic forces on the rotor wings. The maximum forces were theoretically calculated and is 13. 38 kN along the x-axis, - 0. 25 kN along the y-axis and then 0. 5 kN along the z-axis. The axis are acording to a rotational reference system where the x-axis runs along the supporting arm and the y-axis runs along the axis of rotation. The maximum torque that occurs is 0. 53 kNm along the y-axis and 1. 29 kNm along the z-axis. The size of the forces have been confirmed with a deviation of up to 1. 8 % in the simulation using SolidWorks 2010.

40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) is a {{flexible}} process where an indenter moves {{over the surface}} of a sheet of metal to form a 3 D shell incrementally by a progression of localised deformation. Despite extensive research into the process, the deformation mechanics is not fully understood. This thesis presents new insights into the mechanics of ISF applied to two groups of materials: sheet metals and sandwich panels. A new system for measuring tool forces in ISF is commissioned. The system uses six <b>loadcells</b> to measure reaction forces on the workpiece frame. Each force signal has an uncertainty of ± 15 N. This is likely to be small in comparison to tool forces measured in ISF. The mechanics of ISF of sheet metals is researched. Through-thickness deformation and strains of copper plates are measured for single-point incremental forming (SPIF) and two-point incremental forming (TPIF). It is shown that the deformation mechanisms of SPIF and TPIF are shear parallel to the tool direction, with both shear and stretching perpendicular to the tool direction. Tool forces are measured and compared throughout the two processes. Tool forces follow similar trends to strains, suggesting that shear parallel to the tool direction is a result of friction between the tool and workpiece. The mechanics of ISF of sandwich panels is investigated. The mechanical viability of applying ISF to various sandwich panel designs is evaluated by observing failure modes and damage under two simple tool paths. ISF is applicable to metal/polymer/metal sandwich panels. This is because the cores and faceplates are ductile and largely incompressible, and therefore survive local indentation during ISF without collapse. Through-thickness deformation, tool forces and applicability of the sine law for prediction of wall thickness are measured and compared for a metal/polymer/metal sandwich panel and a monolithic sheet metal. The mechanical results for ISF of sheet metals transfer closely to sandwich panels. Hence, established knowledge and process implementation procedures derived for ISF of monolithic sheet metals may be used in the future for ISF of sandwich panels.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} force exerted of lower body on estimation of EE during an incremental bicycle exercise. METHODS: 21 healthy, nontrained males (age: 25. 0 ± 2. 1, range 24 - 33 yr) participated in this study. Bicycle exercise protocol consists of four stages : resting for 5 min, warm-up for 5 min, an incremental exercise(increase 10 RPM and 1 friction) for every 3 min and cool-down for 5 min. Both acceleration and force devices were designed and fabricated. Force of lower body exerted by pedaling is measured using <b>loadcell.</b> Acceleration and <b>loadcell</b> sensor were put inside the pedal of bicycle. Acceleration(x, y, z) and force(f) data were sampled at 100 Hz and transmitted to PC program. Acceleration, force data and EE value using respiratory gas analysis were collected at the same time. To evaluate developed device, our result was compared with estimated value from accelerometer attached on waist. ‘SVM’ and ‘FORCE’ parameters calculated each from acceleration and force data. Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used as statistical method. The significance level was p< 0. 05. RESULTS: Waist. SVM(r= 0. 720, p< 0. 001), pedal. SVM(r= 0. 741, p< 0. 001) and pedal. FORCE(r= 0. 712, p< 0. 001) variables were significant relationship with EE value. As the predictor of multiple regression equation, SVM, FORCE, exercise time(r= 0. 613, p< 0. 001), height(r= 0. 073, p< 0. 001), weight(r= 0. 159, p< 0. 001) and BMI(r= 0. 144, p< 0. 001) variables were selected. Multiple linear regression of EE estimation using acceleration sensor on waist and using both acceleration and force sensors inside the pedal generated the following result, R 2 = 0. 660, SEE= 274. 54 and R 2 = 0. 723, SEE= 247. 78, respectively.

40|$|Presented {{within this}} {{dissertation}} is {{the evolution of}} the research leading to the selection of small, low power architectural solutions to the University of Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s (URI) Neural Machine Interface (NMI) algorithm. The NMI is designed to provide volitional control of an artificial limb for transfemoral amputees. The NMI algorithm is based on neuromuscular-mechanical fusion, gait phase dependent, non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classification. URI 2 ̆ 7 s NMI algorithm utilizes electromyography to detect direct commands from the human brain to the residual thigh muscles in conjunction with mechanical signals derived from <b>loadcell</b> to determine the user 2 ̆ 7 s intended locomotion mode. ^ Of utmost importance is the classification accuracy, since any misclassification can cause the user to stumble, possibly leading to serious injury or death. Furthermore, of importance is the development of a small and low power architectural solution, such that it can be included {{within the confines of the}} artificial limb. URI has tackled both these challenges, leading to its mobile Central Processing Unit (CPU) solution. The mobile CPU solution was the first solution with sufficient processing throughput to execute the NMI at 20 ms window increments. This led to an astounding 99. 94...|$|E
40|$|For {{measuring}} the draft forces exerted by implements into tractor, {{we use the}} dynamometers that are divided into pull type or three-point hitch type. For {{measuring the}} forces between the tractor and the mounted implements, three-point hitch dynamometers are used. In this research, an adjustable three-point hitch dynamometer with a draft capacity of 25 kN was designed and built which is made up from two frames {{that one of them}} placed inside the other. The force sensing elements were comprised of a <b>loadcell</b> that was installed between the frames. All mounted tillage implements were able to be tested by this measuring device excluding mounted implements which are powered by PTO and by using this dynamometer, the variations of implements draft force in the different tillage conditions consist of the various work depths and different forward speeds would be studied. After design and construction steps, dynamometer was calibrated, tested and evaluated. Field tests were done by using of four mounted tillage implements and obtained data were compared by obtained data from ASAE D 497. 5 standard formula. So with these data, the design of tines, their stems, equipment frames and the selection of the optimal size of the tillage equipments in regard of the soil type of the region {{and the power of the}} available tractors will be more scientific and reasonable...|$|E
30|$|Each {{specimen}} {{was mounted}} in the testing machine (Model LRX-Plus; Lloyd Instruments Ltd.) with a <b>loadcell</b> of 5 kN, and the data were recorded using computer software (Nexygen-MT; Lloyd Instruments) as previously mentioned {{in the evaluation of}} SSBS. The specimens underwent cyclic loading by means of a monobeveled steel chisel that was attached to the upper movable component of the machine. The load was applied {{at the base of the}} bracket in the occlusogingival direction. The load profile was in the form of a wave at a rate of 1 Hz. Compressive shear fatigue test for 5, 000 load cycles or until bond failure was determined by testing according to the staircase (up-and-down) method [24, 25]. The first specimen was tested at the approximate value of about 25 % of the static shear bond strength previously evaluated [26]. Then, the load was raised by a fixed amount of 20 Newton (N) for the next tested specimen. On the other hand, if the bracket did not survive, i.e., the bond failed at some point during the 5, 000 cycles, the load was lowered also by the same fixed amount of 20 N for the next specimen. This procedure of raising the maximum load by 20 N following a test where the orthodontic bond has not failed and lowering the load by the same fixed amount following a bond failure was continued for each following specimen until all ten specimens in each group were evaluated.|$|E
40|$|Rain has an {{important}} role in the hydrologic cycle. Rainfall (in mm) is the height of rain water which collected in a flat place and assuming that the water does not evaporate, does not sink in, and does not flow. This rainfall data is needed for agriculture and flood prevention, as used as an estimate for the construction of drainage channels, ditches, and irrigation. A device to measure rainfall is called rain gauge. The rain gauge that is designed in this thesis are expected to measure rainfall automatically using AT 89 S 51 microcontroller which organize and process data from the load cell sensor. Weight data will be generated by the load cell in any specific period, then it will be converted into data in units of millimeters according to standards specified by the WMO (World Meteorological Organization). The processed data will be stored in external memory such as an MMC (Multi Media Card) and sent to the user's computer by using a mobile phone. The data that has been stored on the MMC in a ". txt” extention can be taken periodically by the user as a data back up and can be read directly by PC. If data is required from a remote area, the user can send instructions to a mobile phone that has been connected with a sensor to transmit the rainfall data at the time.

40|$|Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) is a system, {{which is}} able to weigh a moving vehicle. The system {{is a part of}} Intelligent Transport System (ITS). The data {{obtained}} by this system can be used for many purposes in the road and railway system. Most of the WIM systems operate at a relative low speed. At high speed, the accuracy of the system reduces. Therefore, a new WIM system was developed so that the weighing can be performed at high speed with a better accuracy. Besides, the system was able to recognize the plate number of the overloaded vehicle, record its weight and snap its picture: for Mher law enforcement. This project utilized various weight sensors to detect the vehicle weight, investigated the response of the weight sensor to the axle force, developed a suitable algorithm to facilitate the vehicle weight measurement at high speed, created an interface to trigger the plate number recognition system from the WIM system and developed a database to record the results of the WIM system measurement and the captured violated vehicles. <b>Loadcell</b> and piezoelectric WIM systems including the weight estimation algorithm and vehicle plate number recognition system have been developed successllly {{in the course of this}} project. The load-cell WIM system which has been developed has a weighing capacity up to 20 tonnes and able to measure at the speed up to 60 km/h. The piezoelectric WIM system has been tested to weigh various types of vehicles. The system {{is able to}} weigh at high speed with 95 % accuracy...|$|E
