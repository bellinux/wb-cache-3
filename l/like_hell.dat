A few lyrics of Cry to Heaven begin rather sweet, but turning rather bitter: (Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead and cry <b>like</b> <b>hell.)</b> The two parts are bridged by an {{instrumental}} dominated by an Irish flute.|$|E

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of talkies, Vélez {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} Pre-Code films <b>like</b> <b>Hell</b> Harbor (directed by Henry King), The Storm (1930, directed by William Wyler), and the crime drama East Is West opposite Edward G. Robinson (1930). In 1931, she appeared in her second film for Cecil B. DeMille, Squaw Man, opposite Warner Baxter and in Resurrection, directed by Edwin Carewe. In 1932, Vélez filmed The Cuban Love Song (1931), with the popular singer Lawrence Tibbett. That same year, she had a supporting role in Kongo (a sound remake of West of Zanzibar), with Walter Huston. She also starred in Spanish-language versions of some of her movies produced by the Universal Studios like Resurrección (1931, the Spanish version of Resurrection), and Hombres de mi vida (1932, the Spanish version of The Cuban Love Song). Vélez soon found her niche in comedy, playing beautiful but volatile characters.|$|E

However, Canada was {{eliminated}} in the quarterfinal against Slovakia, 4–3. [...] Getzlaf was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct {{late in the game}} for kneeing Juraj Mikúš. A dejected Getzlaf lamented the result and his penalty following the game: [...] "It hurts <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> right now. I feel like I let the guys down.

500|$|Gorillaz are a British virtual band {{created in}} 1998 by Damon Albarn of rock band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator {{of the comic}} book Tank Girl. While {{watching}} MTV, Hewlett {{came up with the}} idea to create the band, and later commented, [...] "if you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> – there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that." [...] Gorillaz is a virtual band consisting of four cartoon characters: 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel. They are used in promotional material such as album covers, posters, and in concerts, during which holographic versions of the characters are used. The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians; Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor. Gorillaz have released five studio albums, all on the Parlophone and Virgin record labels: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (digital in 2010, physical in 2011), Humanz (2017).|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} former {{poet laureate}} Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky {{was chosen to}} guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa, [...] and because they knew that Pinsky was {{a fan of the}} show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he [...] "admired the writing" [...] of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was [...] "stranded" [...] there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; [...] "Ian [...] and The Simpsons people were very nice to me," [...] he said. [...] "...

50|$|Before embarking in {{a career}} in show business, Shane studied law at USC and UCLA law schools. He later became a {{journalist}} {{and moved on to}} become a Hollywood publicist and later, a screenwriter. Most of his early work was for forgettable low-budget films. Becoming a director in 1947, he worked on noirish films, as a writer or director, <b>like</b> <b>Hell's</b> Island, Fear in the Night and the remake Nightmare. Shane scripted City Across the River, the 1949 film of Irving Shulman's The Amboy Dukes, and directed 1955's The Naked Street, starring Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft.|$|R
500|$|The {{series was}} given a budget of $100 million (£58 million), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between March 2004 and July 2005, at {{locations}} in or around Rome, and on a set considered [...] "to be {{the biggest and most}} expensive ever built for television." [...] It was built at Cinecittà, where the epic films Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) had been filmed. Production designer Joseph Bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity. He said, People think of Rome as white and cold and beautiful, powerful but distant. But based on the research, I don't think it was like that at all. If you go to Pompeii, you're struck by how garish it is, even now. The temples and sculptures were all brightly painted. Rome was like Pompeii, but much bigger. And Rome was so noisy it was impossible to sleep. It was <b>like</b> <b>hell.</b> Think of it as a combination of New York and Calcutta, with insane wealth and insane poverty. It was pretty extreme.|$|E
500|$|As on Mos Def's other albums, {{he spoke}} a {{dedication}} to God in Arabic ("Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem") {{at the start}} of The Ecstatic, before [...] "Supermagic" [...] began with a sample of Malcolm X's 1964 speech at Oxford Union. The sample prefaced the album's [...] "small-globe statement", Pitchfork journalist Nate Patrin explained, indicating that Mos Def had [...] "a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from Consequence of Sound believed the speech introduced [...] "a political album encompassing global beats and viewpoints". According to Washington Post critic Allison Stewart, Mos Def seemed equally interested in the Obama-era zeitgeist and accounts of the past, such as the early-1980s Bedford–Stuyvesant setting of [...] "Life in Marvelous Times". Young deemed the song anthemic for [...] "a seemingly paradoxical age that routinely sees events such as a Black man being elected president of a nation wallowing in racial inequality". From Christgau's perspective, Mos Def offered a credo in the lyrics: [...] "More of less than ever before / It's just too much more for your mind to absorb / It's scary <b>like</b> <b>hell,</b> but there's no doubt / We can't be alive in no time but now".|$|E
500|$|Gibbes {{handed over}} command of No.3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19April 1943. With his rank of {{squadron}} leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, until October. While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No.464 Squadron RAAF, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, {{he gave a}} series of morale-building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students: [...] "So I, you know, went round and lied <b>like</b> <b>hell.</b> I {{said that it was}} all a [...]" [...] In January 1944, he joined No.2 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Mildura, Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March. He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No.2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1July. In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No.80 Wing. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, [...] "a little dark-haired popsy" [...] named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23January 1945.|$|E

50|$|A {{culturally}} astute, often funny, and painstakingly researched read, Jagger {{offers a}} far richer portrait than biographies published previously. The book reveals {{much about his}} relationships (with Marianne Faithfull and ex-wives Bianca Jagger and Jerry Hall); his complex, creative partnership with Keith Richards; his friends like John Lennon and David Bowie; and enemies <b>like</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels leader Sonny Barger. Spitz goes even deeper, exploring Jagger's many roles: an authentic soul man; powerful social commentator; sexual liberator; would-be movie star; and yes, sometimes, a shrewd businessman with an enthusiasm for much younger women. The myth of Mick is examined and rebooted for the twenty-first century.|$|R

500|$|An {{immediate}} focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions hired {{to create the}} costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into the gutters and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{included}} Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{who gave}} the film one-and-a-half stars out of four saying: [...] "The movie deserves more stars for its bottom-line craft, but all the craft in the world can't redeem its story." [...] Bob Mondello of NPR said the film was [...] "A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that [...] "No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News compared the film to 2007's Vacancy - a comparison which [...] "does [...] "Strangers" [...] no favors. Vacancy director Nimród Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> to survive, becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertino's undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid and frustratingly passive." [...] Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post panned the film, calling it [...] "a fraud from start to finish." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film [...] "uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile," [...] but admitted that [...] "it does it well, with more than usual skill." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of the director, [...] "Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries to get under our skin with a pile driver." [...] Stephen Whitty of The Newark Star-Ledger opined of the film, [...] "Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films that it plays like a parody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of Buena Vista the war essentially was over for the Arkansas volunteers. [...] On June 7, with their one-year enlistment nearly completed, the Arkansas troops were paid and mustered out of the service. [...] Many of the Arkansans, eager to return home as quickly as possible, took passage on a steamer to New Orleans and then up the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers to Little Rock. [...] William F. Pope, who lived in Little Rock at the time, later wrote in his memoirs that one young man from Colonel Roane's forces was greeted by his father who said: “I hear you all fought <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> at Buena Vista”. [...] But the young veteran replied with a loud laugh: “We ran <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> at Buena Vista.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was still experiencing extensive teething troubles {{as well as}} being victimized by [...] "urban legends", mostly involving inapplicable twin engine factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed. In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a [...] "widow maker" [...] as it could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high sub-sonic speeds. [...] The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe. Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long range escort duties. Nonetheless, General Spaatz, then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: [...] "I'd rather have an airplane that goes <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won't go <b>like</b> <b>hell</b> and has a few things wrong with it." ...|$|E
