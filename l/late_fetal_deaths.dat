40|$|Background: Diabetes {{constitutes}} {{the most frequent}} medical complication during pregnancy, {{and it has a}} direct impact on the perinatal results. Objectives: To determine the effect of the diabetes on perinatal results. Methods: A descriptive study of series of cases was carried out. Of an universe of 13 603 childbirths from January 1 st, 2003 to December 31 st, 2005, in the Obstetric Service of the University Hospital ¨Dr. Gustavo Aldereguía Lima¨ in Cienfuegos, a sample of 229 pregnant women with diabetes was taken. Rates were determined for under weight, premature births, congenital malformations, <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths,</b> macrosomia, asphyxia and assessment of caesarean operation in the diabetic women; as well as the risk of these complications for this group with regard to the non diabetic pregnant women and between the gestational and pre-gestational diabetes. Results: Diabetes incidence and pregnancy was of 1, 68 %. The risk of premature birth (17, 4 %), of under weight of the newborn (13, 1 %), macrosomia (15, 3 %), malformations (3, 5 %), neonatal death (0, 4 %), late fetal death (0, 9 %) and birth by Caesarean operation (64, 2 %) was higher in the diabetic population, with regard to the non diabetic. The pre- gestational diabetes turned out to have bigger risks with regard to the gestational one regarding the premature childbirth, the most important congenital malformations and the <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths.</b> Conclusion: Although the province shows a low incidence of diabetes in the pregnancy, the risk of adverse perinatal results is considerable for this group, especially in pre-gestational diabetic women...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether the effect modification of smoking by maternal age previously reported for small for gestational age births was also obtained for <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> and placental abruption, the author analyzed single births in Sweden (n = 1, 057, 711) from 1983 to 1992. An effect modification of smoking by maternal age was obtained only {{with regard to}} fetal growth: Compared with nonsmokers aged 40 - 44 years, the risk of small for gestational age births among women smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day in the same age group was 4. 5, whereas the corresponding risk increase among teenagers was only 2. 0.

40|$|In the 1980 National Natality and Fetal Mortality Surveys, {{information}} about fetal monitoring {{and type of}} delivery was obtained from hospitals for a sample of 9, 941 live births and 6, 386 fetal deaths of 28 weeks' gestation or more. Data in this analysis are weighted to provide national estimates of live births and <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> that occurred in U. S. hospitals during 1980. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was used for 47. 7 percent of live births; 27. 2 percent were monitored by Doppler ultrasound only, 10. 2 percent by scalp electrode only, 6. 3 percent by Doppler ultrasound and scalp electrode only, and 4. 0 percent by other methods and combinations. The distribution by type of EFM used was similar for the 42. 7 percent of <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> (also called stillbirths) that were monitored. Variation {{in the use of}} EFM for live births and stillbirths is examined according to maternal age, parity, education, race, marital status, income, previous fetal loss, underlying medical conditions, complications of pregnancy, complications of labor, duration of labor, infant birth weight, and length of gestation. Among live births, 17. 1 percent were delivered by cesarean section, as were 16. 8 percent of stillbirths. The association between fetal monitoring and the primary cesarean section rate (the probability of cesarean section for women who had never had one) for all birth orders and for first births is examined according to characteristics of the mothers and the infants.

In contrast to the infant mortality rate, the declining trend for perinatal mortality shows no evidence of slowing. As in previous years, the perinatal mortality rate was higher for the black population (17. 4) than the white population (9. 6). The race differential widened between 1981 and 1985 because the rate of decline for the white population (15 percent) exceeded that of the black population (10 percent).

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{identify}} markers for <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> a multicenter {{study was}} performed, based on routinely obtained data from maternal health care units. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Prospectively recorded {{data were obtained}} from maternal health care units belonging to five delivery units. In all, 233 consecutive cases of singleton pregnancy involving <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> (> or = 28 weeks) were identified between 1983 and 1989. As a control for each case, the next consecutive mother giving birth to a live infant at the same delivery unit was selected, the sole matching criterium being parity. RESULTS. After exclusion of pregnancies with lethal malformations or trauma, 205 cases remained for the statistical analysis. Two main subgroups were identified: mothers with placental abruption (n = 44), and pregnancies with no obvious reason for <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> (n = 101). An increased risk for <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> was evident in expectant mothers > or = 40 years (10 vs 1; chi 2 = 7. 6, p or = 42 weeks) estimated from first day of last menstrual period (but not post dated by ultrasound) imply {{a higher rate of}} <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> as has been suggested in previous studies. CONCLUSION. In the present material, {{there was no sign of}} systematic error in the evaluation of data routinely obtained from the antenatal clinics and maternity units. Apart from placental abruption in smokers, a high maternal age, and medical treatment for essential hypertension, deviating data were recorded as often among controls as among cases.

40|$|Background: stillbirth, {{also called}} late fetal death if it occurs between 28 weeks' {{gestation}} and birth, {{is one of}} the most feared complications of pregnancy. The late fetal mortality rate is an indicator of scientific progress and social development of a country. Objective: to describe the factors associated with late fetal death. Methods: a study of a series of 221 cases of <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> was conducted in Cienfuegos province from January 2006 to December 2013. The variables studied included: time and place of death, cause of death, maternal age, maternal weight, number of pregnancies, maternal diseases, pregnancy complications, gestational age and placental and umbilical cord abnormalities. Results: late fetal death rate was 6. 38. Fetal deaths from unknown cause predominated, followed by those associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and intrauterine growth retardation. The largest number of fetal deaths occurred antepartum, before term, outside the hospital, in obese pregnant women, in women with hypertensive disorders and diabetes, and in malformed fetuses. Placental insufficiency and obliterating angiopathy were the most common placental abnormalities.

40|$|Since the midtwentieth century, {{stillbirths}} (<b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths)</b> {{and early}} neonatal deaths {{have often been}} combined into a single category of “perinatal ” deaths. In the past, such a combination was justified {{by the fact that}} asphyxia was a common cause of death during labor (intrapartum stillbirth) and shortly after birth and by geographic and temporal differences in classification of livebirths versus stillbirths. In more recent years, however, the etiologic determinants have diverged sharply, with many fewer early neonatal deaths caused by asphyxia and relatively many more caused by congenital anomalies. Moreover, the increasingly common stratification of pregnancy outcome measures by gestational age or birth weight leads to the use of an inappropriate denominator (total livebirths plus stillbirths within each gestational age or birth weight category) for denoting risk for the stillbirth component, because all unborn fetuses (including the majority of those not born within the specified gestational age or birth weight range) are at risk of being stillborn in that range. The authors suggest that, whenever possible, stillbirths and early neonatal deaths should be reported separately, with gestational age-specific risks of stillbirth based on all fetuses at risk, and that antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths be reported separately.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} ethanol, diabetes mellitus and the combination of both on mouse fetuses. METHODS: We used 24 female Swiss mice, dividing them into four groups of 6 each: control (C), ethanol (E), diabetes (D) (blood glucose > 200 mg/dL) and diabetes + ethanol (DE). Diabetes was induced by alloxan (40 mg/kg) on day 7 of pregnancy. Groups E and DE received 4 g/kg of 25 % v/v ethanol intraperitoneally, whereas groups C and D received saline. On day 18, all fetuses were harvested. RESULTS: In group DE the following anomalies were found: exencephaly, situs inversus totalis, situs inversus partialis, eyelid skin tag and one animal from group E had pulmonary artery hypoplasia. Ethanol administration partially reverted diabetes-fetal resorption caused by diabetes, yet it induced <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death.</b> Both diabetes and ethanol reduced placental diameter and increased its weight. Ethanol had more effect on fetal length in males than in females, however, such bias was not found for diabetes. Ethanol prevented diabetes-induced tail shortening in both genders.

40|$|Background:The {{prevalence}} of obesity in school children and pregnant women, a known risk factor of the reproductive cycle, has increased significantly {{over the last few}} years. Aim: To analyze the association between maternal obesity and the outcome of pregnancy and newborn health. To quantify the attributable population risk of obesity in relation to negative events of pregnancy. Material and methods: A prospective study in 883 pregnant women of 6 public health centers in Santiago. Weight, height, arm circumference, skinfold thicknesses, body mass index (BMI) and fat mass were determined in each trimester. Maternal socio demographic history, smoking habits, incidence of diseases during pregnancy, labor and newborn characteristics were analyzed. Logistic regressions of multiple factors were used to determine nutritional and non-nutritional variables associated to negative events, to determine the population attributable risk of each variable that the model retained. Results: Controlling the effect of other variables, a BMI  30 or initial body fat mass  35 % determined a greater risk for assisted labor with an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 9 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 3 - 2. 9), gestational diabetes with an OR of 6. 4 (95 % CI 2. 1 - 19. 6), hypertension with an OR of 7. 8 (95 % CI 3. 0 - 20. 4), late fetal mortality with an OR of 3. 4 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 10. 0), p < 0. 001.

40|$|Abstract Background Normal and {{abnormal}} {{processes of}} pregnancy and childbirth are poorly understood. This second article {{in a global}} report explains {{what is known about}} the etiologies of preterm births and stillbirths and identifies critical gaps in knowledge. Two important concepts emerge: the continuum of pregnancy, beginning at implantation and ending with uterine involution following birth; and the multifactorial etiologies of preterm birth and stillbirth. Improved tools and data will enable discovery scientists to identify causal pathways and cost-effective interventions. Pregnancy and parturition continuum The biological process of pregnancy and childbirth begins with implantation and, after birth, ends with the return of the uterus to its previous state. The majority of pregnancy is characterized by rapid uterine and fetal growth without contractions. Yet most research has addressed only uterine stimulation (labor) that accounts for Etiologies The etiologies of preterm birth and stillbirth differ by gestational age, genetics, and environmental factors. Approximately 30 % of all preterm births are indicated for either maternal or fetal complications, such as maternal illness or fetal growth restriction. Commonly recognized pathways leading to preterm birth occur most often during the gestational ages indicated: (1) inflammation caused by infection (22 - 32 weeks); (2) decidual hemorrhage caused by uteroplacental thrombosis (early or late preterm birth); (3) stress (32 - 36 weeks); and (4) uterine overdistention, often caused by multiple fetuses (32 - 36 weeks). Other contributors include cervical insufficiency, smoking, and systemic infections. Many stillbirths have similar causes and mechanisms. About two-thirds of <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> occur during the antepartum period; the other third occur during childbirth. Intrapartum asphyxia is a leading cause of stillbirths in low- and middle-income countries. Recommendations Utilizing new systems biology tools, opportunities now exist for researchers to investigate various pathways important to normal and abnormal pregnancies. Improved access to quality data and biological specimens are critical to advancing discovery science. Phenotypes, standardized definitions, and uniform criteria for assessing preterm birth and stillbirth outcomes are other immediate research needs. Conclusion Preterm birth and stillbirth have multifactorial etiologies. More resources must be directed toward accelerating our understanding of these complex processes, and identifying upstream and cost-effective solutions that will improve these pregnancy outcomes. </p...|$|E

The lack of timely diagnosis of gestational diabetes probably had resulted in undesirable fetal complications such as metabolic disorders, macrosomia and intrauterine <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> caused by <b>fetal</b> hypoxia and acidosis. Analysing the whole course of delivery a few fundamental obstetric rules were omitted: taking the patient’s medical history was done quite inadequately (nobody asked her about previous attack of tachycardia and fetal movements), and the simple auscultation of the fetal heartbeat with simultaneous checking of the maternal radial pulse rate was ignored, leading to an unacceptable situation, where intrauterine <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> was unrecognized through the first 3 hours of labor. The authors offer a clinical opinion that the obstetricians, as well as midwifes have to use modern medical technology and diagnostic tests wisely and critically, but can never allow themselves to skip the simple propaedeutic rules of obstetric care. Only with the better collaboration of the patient and with a watchful and critical analysis of the complete medical documentation and diagnostic tests, it could be possible to correct possible own or somebody else’s professional errors...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reviews of {{perinatal}} {{deaths are}} mostly facility based. Given {{the number of}} women who, globally, deliver outside of facilities, this data may be biased against total population data. We aimed to analyse population based perinatal mortality data from a LMIC setting (Mpumalanga, South Africa) to determine the causes of perinatal death and the rate of maternal complications in the setting of a perinatal death. METHODS : A secondary analysis of the South African Perinatal Problems Identification Program (PPIP) database for the Province of Mpumalanga was undertaken for the period October 2013 to January 2014, inclusive. Data on each individual late perinatal death was reviewed. We examined the frequencies of maternal and fetal or neonatal characteristics in <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> and analysed the relationships between maternal condition and fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. IBM SPSS Statistics 22. 0 was used for data analysis. RESULTS : There were 23503 births and 687 late perinatal deaths (stillbirths of ≥ 1000 gr or ≥ 28 weeks gestation and early neonatal deaths up to day 7 of neonatal life) in the study period. The rate of maternal complication in macerated stillbirths, fresh stillbirths and early neonatal deaths was 50. 4 %, 50. 7 % and 25. 8 % respectively. Mothers in the other late perinatal deaths were healthy. Maternal hypertension and obstetric haemorrhage were more likely in stillbirths (p = < 0. 01 for both conditions), whereas ENNDs {{were more likely to have}} a healthy mother (p < 0. 01). The main causes of neonatal death were related to immaturity (48. 7 %) and hypoxia (40. 6 %). 173 (25. 2 %) of all late perinatal deaths had a birth weight less than the 10 th centile for gestational age. CONCLUSION : A significant proportion of women have no recognisable obstetric or medical condition at the time of a late perinatal death; we may be limited in our ability to predict poor perinatal outcome if emphasis is put on detecting maternal complications prior to a perinatal death. Intrapartum care and hypertensive disease remain high priority areas for addressing perinatal mortality. Consideration needs to be given to novel ways of detecting growth restriction in a LMIC setting. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction This is {{the first}} of seven {{articles}} from a preterm birth and stillbirth report. Presented here is an overview of the burden, an assessment of the quality of current estimates, review of trends, and recommendations to improve data. Preterm birth Few countries have reliable national preterm birth prevalence data. Globally, an estimated 13 million babies are born before 37 completed weeks of gestation annually. Rates are generally highest in low- and middle-income countries, and increasing in some middle- and high-income countries, particularly the Americas. Preterm birth is the leading direct cause of neonatal death (27 %); more than one million preterm newborns die annually. Preterm birth is also the dominant risk factor for neonatal mortality, particularly for deaths due to infections. Long-term impairment is an increasing issue. Stillbirth Stillbirths are currently not included in Millennium Development Goal tracking and remain invisible in global policies. For international comparisons, stillbirths include <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> weighing more than 1000 g or occurring after 28 weeks gestation. Only about 2 % of all stillbirths are counted through vital registration and global estimates are based on household surveys or modelling. Two global estimation exercises reached a similar estimate of around three million annually; 99 % occur in low- and middle-income countries. One million stillbirths occur during birth. Global stillbirth cause-of-death estimates are impeded by multiple, complex classification systems. Recommendations to improve data (1) increase the capture and quality of pregnancy outcome data through household surveys, the main data source for countries with 75 % of the global burden; (2) increase compliance with standard definitions of gestational age and stillbirth in routine data collection systems; (3) strengthen existing data collection mechanisms—especially vital registration and facility data—by instituting a standard death certificate for stillbirth and neonatal death linked to revised International Classification of Diseases coding; (4) validate a simple, standardized classification system for stillbirth cause-of-death; and (5) improve systems and tools to capture acute morbidity and long-term impairment outcomes following preterm birth. Conclusion Lack of adequate data hampers visibility, effective policies, and research. Immediate opportunities exist to improve data tracking and reduce the burden of preterm birth and stillbirth. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of the Perinatal Mortality occurred during the years 1985 - 1989 in the Hospital of Integrated Support III IPSS Tarapoto. Lapse in which there were 0512 live births, 161 <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> and 97 early neonatal deaths, all with 100 grs. Or more than birth weight, {{with the exception of}} 14 cases found, whose birth weight ranged from 500 to 999 grams, but were recorded in the study because they had a gestational age by amorphous from 28 weeks onwards. In most cases, maternal complications were found that explain the causes of fetal death; The threat of preterm birth (24 %), bleeding (15 %) and infections (14 %) were the most common complications during pregnancy. While during delivery, the most frequently occurring intercurrences were: Premature Birth (36 %), Birth Distocias (24 %) and Fetal Suffering (19 %). The main causes of death were asphyxia with 34 %, prematurity with 15 %, infections and obstetric trauma with 10 % each. Of the total deaths, 47 % died before 24 hours of life; Associated with moderate to severe hypoxia in 69 % of cases (Apgar score). Of the deaths recorded, 45 % were preterm infants (28 - 30 weeks), 37 - 41 weeks 42 % and 42 weeks 7 %. 63 % of all births were for low birth weight infants. Mothers aged less than 20 years, with a short intergenic interval (< 12 months) and with low pre-natal control were the group with the highest obstetric risk. It was found that in 28 % of the cases there was intervention of some other person before the mother's admission to the hospital. The Perinatal Mortality rate was 29. 74 x 1000 live births; Of which 18. 56 x 1000 live births corresponds to Late Fetal Mortality and 11. 39 x 1000 live births at the Early Neonatal Mortality Rate. TesisSe presenta un análisis estadístico de la Mortalidad Perinatal ocurrida durante los años 1985 - 1989 en el Hospital de Apoyo Integrado III IPSS Tarapoto. Lapso en el cual se produjeron 0512 nacimientos vivos, 161 muertes fetales tardías y 97 muertes neonatales precoces, todos con 100 grs. O más de peso al nacimiento a excepción de 14 casos encontrados, cuyo peso al nacimiento oscilaron entre 500 a 999 grs., pero que fueron registrados en el estudio por tener una edad gestacional por amorrea de 28 semanas en adelante. En la mayoría de los casos se encontraron complicaciones maternas que explican las causas de la defunción fetal; la amenaza de parto prematuro (24 %), las hemorragias (15 %) y las infecciones (14 %), fueron las complicaciones de mayor incidencia durante el embarazo. Mientras que durante el parto, las intercurrencias que con mayor frecuencia se presentaron son: Parto Prematuro (36 %), Distocias del Parto (24 %) y Sufrimiento Fetal (19 %). Las principales causas de muerte fueron las asfixias con 34 %, la Prematuridad con 15 %, las infecciones y el traumatismo obstétrico con 10 % cada uno. Del total de fallecidos, el 47 % murió antes de las 24 horas de vida; asociados a hipoxia moderada a grave en el 69 % de los casos (índice de Apgar). De las muertes registradas el 45 % correspondió a recién nacidos pre términos (28 a 30 semanas), de 37 a 41 semanas 42 % y a 42 semanas 7 %. El 63 % del total de nacimientos correspondió a recién nacidos de bajo peso. Las madres con edades menores de 20 años, con un intervalo intergenésico corto (< 12 meses) y con un escaso control pre natal constituyeron el grupo de mayor riesgo obstétrico. Se encontró que en el 28 % de los casos hubo intervención de alguna otra persona antes del ingreso de la madre al hospital. La tasa de Mortalidad Perinatal, fue de 29. 74 x 1000 nacidos vivos; del cual 18. 56 x 1000 nacidos vivos corresponde a Mortalidad Fetal Tardía y 11. 39 x 1000 nacidos vivos a la Tasa de Mortalidad Neonatal Precoz...|$|E
50|$|Following a {{stint as}} Vice Minister of Health for the Province of San Luis, in 2002 he was named Public Health Secretary of the District of La Matanza, a western, mainly blue-collar suburb of the Argentine capital. Recommended by the National Health Minister, Ginés González García, Manzur was {{appointed}} Health Minister of Tucumán Province by the new Governor, José Alperovich, in 2003. Manzur soon earned plaudits in his post, which oversaw public health in one of Argentina's least-developed provinces. One widely used yardstick of public health, the infant mortality rate, fell from 23 per 1,000 births (40% above the national average) in 2003, to 13 in 2006 (matching the national average). The perinatal mortality rate (a <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> or of an infant under one week old) likewise fell {{during the same period}} in Tucumán from 24 to 18 per 1,000 births. These news helped Manzur secure Governor Alperovich's nod to be a running mate for his successful, 2007 bid for re-election.|$|R
40|$|Background: Pregnancy at extreme ages is a {{risk factor}} for maternal, {{perinatal}} and infantile death. Aim: To assess the obstetric risk of women over 40 years old. Material and methods: The risk of maternal, <b>late</b> <b>fetal,</b> neonatal and infantile deaths and the risk of low birth weight was assessed in women over 40 years old and compared to the risk of women aged 20 - 34 years. Data was obtained from the 1999 Annual Report of the National Statistics Institute and the odds ratios (OR) with a 95 % confidence interval were calculated. Results: Women over 40 years had a higher risk of maternal death (OR 7. 13, 3. 31 - 14. 97), <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> (OR 2. 19, 1. 69 - 2. 85), neonatal death (OR 1. 8, 1. 4 - 2. 32), infantile death (OR 1. 8, 1. 49 - 2. 18) and low birth weight (OR 1. 72, 1. 58 - 1. 88). Conclusions: The higher reproductive risk of women over 40 years is confirmed. Better birth control programs at this age will reduce this risk (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 55 - 59...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> is a desolating {{event that}} inspite {{the effort to}} {{implement}} new surveillance protocols in perinatal continues to defy our clinical pratice. Objective: To examine etiological factors contributing to main causes and conditions associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> in <b>late</b> pregnancies over a 10 -year period. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of 208 late singleton stillbirth delived in a tertiary-perinatal referral maternity over a 10 -year period. Clinical charts, laboratory data and feto-placental pathology findings were systematically reviewed. Results: The incidence of <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> demise was 3. 5 per 1000 pregnancies. No significant trend {{in the incidence of}} stillbirth was demonstrated during the study period. Stillbirth was intrapartum in 12 (5. 8 %) cases and 72 (35 %) were term pregnancies. Fourteen percent of cases were undersurveilled pregnancies. Mean gestacional age at diagnosis was 34 weeks. The primary cause of <b>death</b> was <b>fetal,</b> it was present in 59 cases, 25 % were considered small for gestational age. Stillbirths were unexplained in 24. 5 % of cases. Maternal medical disorders were identified in 21 %. Hypertensive disorders were frequent and associated with early gestacional age (p = 0. 028). Conclusion: There was no change in the incidence of late stillbirth during the 10 years under evaluation. The incidence was 3. 5 ‰ which was identical to that described in developed countries. About one quarter of the stillbirths was unexplained. The most frequent maternal pathology was chronic hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Presentation {{of study}} that found women with with {{intellectual}} and developmental disabilities (IDD) had longer hospital stays and {{were less likely}} to have Caesarean section deliveries in contrast to women without these conditions. Rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes were elevated among the women with IDD, across a range of measures. Women with IDD {{were more likely to have}} early labor, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and other hypertensive conditions, and <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> or stillbirth. There were no differences between the two groups of women in maternal death rates, which is relatively rarer in the US. Women comprise fewer than 1 % of deliveries in the United States, but they and their infants are at significantly elevated risk of adverse outcomes. The public health costs of these outcomes are likely to be substantial. Further research is needed to understand the determinants of these adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, pending further evidence, health care providers are advised that their patients with IDD are at elevated risk of serious pregnancy complications. Intervention to improve these outcomes are needed...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} {{are one of}} {{the potential}} adverse effects of the environment on reproductive health. Registries of congenital anomalies are useful to detect abnormal frequencies, clusters, and trends. Such registries should meet a number of conditions, including an appropriate population denominator, an efficient system for collecting information, standardized diagnostic procedures, postmortem examinations of still-births, and linkage of records. The EUROCAT (European Registration of Congenital Anomalies and Twins) program is a Concerted Action of the Commission of the European Communities initiated in 1979. One of its objectives is the surveillance of congenital anomalies as related to environmental hazards. This surveillance system covers at present 350, 000 births per year in 15 countries. A number of problems encountered in the development of EUROCAT {{and in the course of}} ongoing activities are reviewed: populations coverage, classification of malformations, coding, definition and coverage of <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> registration of induced abortion, validation of diagnostic information, registration of late diagnosed cases, and maintenance of motivation in data collection. The issue of confidentiality and the need for strict safeguards for the protection of individual privacy are emphasized...|$|R
5000|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{collects}} {{statistical information}} on [...] "live births, <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths,</b> and induced termination of pregnancy" [...] from 57 reporting {{areas in the}} United States. Each reporting area has different guidelines and definitions for what is being reported; many do not use the term [...] "stillbirth" [...] at all. The federal guidelines suggests (at page 1) that <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> and stillbirth can be interchangeable terms. The CDC definition of [...] "fetal death" [...] {{is based on the}} definition promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 (see section above on Canada). Researchers are learning more about the long term psychiatric sequelae of traumatic birth and believe the effects may be intergenerational The federal guidelines recommend reporting those <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> whose birth weight is over 12.5 oz (350 g), or those more than 20 weeks gestation. Forty-one areas use a definition very similar to the federal definition, thirteen areas use a shortened definition of <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> and three areas have no formal definition of <b>fetal</b> <b>death.</b> Only 11 areas specifically use the term 'stillbirth', often synonymously with <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> however they are split between whether stillbirths are [...] "irrespective of the duration of pregnancy", or whether some age or weight constraint is applied. A movement in the U.S. has changed the way that stillbirths are documented through vital records. Previously, only the deaths were reported. However 27 states have enacted legislation that offers some variation of a birth certificate as an option for parents who choose to pay for one. Parents may not claim a tax exemption for stillborn infants, even if a birth certificate is offered. To claim an exemption, the birth must be certified as live, even if the infant only lives for a very brief period.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic biparental preconceptional {{alcoholization}} followed by alcohol consumption during the preimplantation period on the maternal and fetal homeostasis of some alkaline and alkaline-earth metals was studied in albino rats. Female and male rats consumed 20 % ethanol (v/v) for 50 - 60 days before mating (group E). Further on pregnant females were alcoholized until day 5 of pregnancy. Control {{females and males}} consumed tap water (group C). Animals were sacrificed on day 20 of pregnancy. Blood samples were obtained from fetuses (the blood of each litter being pooled) and from pregnant females. Biochemical determinations were made by atomic emission spectroscopy for Na and K and by atomic absorption spectroscopy for Ca and Mg. Early and late mortality of conceptuses were checked. Non significant changes were observed within group E in the maternal serum as to Na (increase) and K(decrease), while Ca and Mg showed a significant decrease. Similar changes {{were found in the}} pooled fetal serum, the decrease of K and Mg being less marked. No structural anomalies were detected. With respect to tanatogenesis, both early resorptions and <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> were increased. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Women with antiphospholipid syndrome(APS) {{may suffer}} from {{recurrent}} miscarriage, <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> <b>fetal</b> growth restriction (FGR), pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, premature delivery and thrombosis. Treatment with aspirin and {{low molecular weight}} heparin (LMWH) combined with close maternal-fetal surveillance can change these outcomes. Objective: To assess maternal and perinatal outcome in a cohort of Portuguese women with primary APS. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 51 women with primary APS followed in our institution (January 1994 to December 2007). Forty one(80. 4 %) had past pregnancy morbidity and 35. 3 %(n= 18) suffered previous thrombotic events. In their past they had a total of 116 pregnancies of which only 13. 79 % resulted in live births. Forty four patients had positive anticardiolipin antibodies and 33 lupus anticoagulant. All women received treatment with low dose aspirin and LMWH. Results: There were a total of 67 gestations (66 single and one multiple). The live birth rate was 85. 1 %(57 / 67) with 10 pregnancy failures: seven {{in the first and}} second trimesters, one <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death</b> and two medical terminations of pregnancy (one APS related). Mean (± SD) birth weight was 2837 ± 812 g and mean gestational age 37 ± 3. 3 weeks. There were nine cases of FGR and 13 hypertensive complications(4 HELLP syndromes). 54. 4 % of the patients delivered by caesarean section. Conclusions: In our cohort, early treatment with aspirin and LMWH combined with close maternal-fetal surveillance was associated with a very high chance of a live newborn...|$|R
40|$|Obesity {{is known}} to have a {{negative}} impact on pregnancy outcome, as it is associated with an increase in the incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, neural tube defects, macrosomia, and <b>late</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>death.</b> Gastric banding is considered an appropriate intervention for morbid obesity when other weight-loss measures are unsuccessful, and this treatment has been shown to be effective in causing a sustainable weight loss. Some women will become pregnant after bariatric surgery, and the nutritional and metabolic challenges brought by gastric banding may have a profound impact on maternal health and pregnancy outcome. The authors report the case of a 27 year old pregnant woman, with a past medical history of gastric banding surgery for morbid obesity. At 18 weeks of gestation, the patient started complaining of severe nausea and vomiting, The situation deteriorated three weeks later when she rapidly developed severe desnutrition, dehydration and early signs of liver and renal failure. Migration of the gastric band was diagnosed, and laparoscopy conducted to remove it. In the day following surgery the patient complained of absent fetal movements, and an intrauterine demise was diagnosed on ultrasound. Pathological examination of the fetus and placenta failed to reveal the cause of death, but no growth restriction was documented, suggesting the occurrence of an acute event...|$|R
