50|$|Most of the Wilkanowski guitars {{adhere to}} a {{standard}} shape. A few guitars do not adhere to the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock {{is thought to have}} been the main influence in the headstock for the current Ovation Guitar. The flattened oval was the standard shape on most guitars, although some featured a violin like scroll. The backs of most were one piece of flamed maple (actually, the wood is often Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple.) with no center joint. The finishing techniques included very <b>light</b> <b>stain,</b> or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared. Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One bearing this label was sold at the Johnny Cash estate auction by Sotheby's in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Whole, {{unbroken}} henna leaves {{will not}} stain the skin. Henna will not stain skin until the lawsone molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaf. Dried henna leaves will stain the skin {{if they are}} mashed into a paste. The lawsone will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the proteins in it, creating a fast stain.Since {{it is difficult to}} form intricate patterns from coarse crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder made by drying, milling and sifting the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with {{one of a number of}} liquids, including water, lemon juice, or strong tea, and other ingredients, depending on the tradition. Many artists use sugar or molasses in the paste to improve consistency and keep it stuck to the skin better. The henna mix must rest for 1 to 48 hours before use, to release the lawsone from the leaf matter. The timing depends on the crop of henna being used. Essential oils with high levels of monoterpene alcohols, such as tea tree, cajeput, or lavender, will improve skin stain characteristics. Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and clove, are also useful but are too irritating and should not be used on skin.The paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. In India, a plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes is used. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A <b>light</b> <b>stain</b> may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible. To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste, or simply adding some form of sugar to the paste. After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} stain wood in various colours, {{according}} to any suitable design, leaving, if desired, parts of the wood unstained, so as to obtain an imitation of inlay, I proceed as follows: I first apply a varnish or solution which will fill the pores of the wood, and exclude the staining liquid from such parts of the surface as are to remain unstained, then when the varnish or solution is dry, I apply over the whole surface the <b>lightest</b> <b>stain</b> I intend to use; this stain being dry I again apply the varnish, or stopping, coating with it such parts of the surface as I desire to retain of a colour corresponding to the <b>lightest</b> <b>stain,</b> and so I proceed until the desired effect is obtained, the last stain applied being usually black or a very dark stain. The surface having been cleared off may, if desired, be varnished or polished all over, or it may remain as it is left by the last staining process.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{euchromatin}} {{appears as}} light-colored bands when stained in G banding and observed under an optical microscope, {{in contrast to}} heterochromatin, which <b>stains</b> darkly. This <b>lighter</b> <b>staining</b> {{is due to the}} less compact structure of euchromatin. The basic structure of euchromatin is an elongated, open, 10 nm microfibril, as noted by electron microscopy. In prokaryotes, euchromatin is the only form of chromatin present; this indicates that the heterochromatin structure evolved later along with the nucleus, possibly as a mechanism to handle increasing genome size.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of chromohysteroscopy in detecting endometrial pathologies in recurrent in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. Materials and methods Sixty-four patients in whom con-ventional hysteroscopy did not show any apparent endo-metrial pathology were included. Five milliliter of 1 % methylene blue dye was introduced through the hystero-scopic inlet. Biopsies were obtained both from dark <b>stained</b> and <b>light</b> <b>stained</b> areas. Results The study group was grouped according to the staining characteristics. Group I included 22 patients in whom focal dark staining was observed. Group II included 41 patients in whom diffuse <b>light</b> blue <b>staining</b> without dark areas was observed. There {{was no significant difference}} between two groups in age, smoking, body mass index, number of IVF failure and time to hysteroscopy after the last failure. But, there was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of endometritis between two groups (p= 0. 007). The power of dark staining for detection of endometritis was calculated as follows: sensitivity 69. 2 %, specificity 74 %, positive predictive value 40. 9 % and negative predictive value 90. 2 %. Conclusion Chromohysteroscopy improves {{the efficacy of}} hysteroscopy in recurrent IVF failure. Observation of diffuse <b>light</b> blue <b>staining</b> without dark areas strongly suggests a normal endometrium free of endometritis...|$|R

40|$|Dark blue {{rings and}} circles emerged when the {{non-specific}} polysaccharide stain lactophenol cotton blue {{was added to}} Gram stained slides. The dark blue staining is attributable {{to the presence of}} capsular polysaccharides and bacterial slime associated with clumps of Gram-negative bacteria.  Since all bacterial cells are glycosylated and concentrate polysaccharides from the media, the majority of cells <b>stain</b> <b>light</b> blue. The contrast between dark and <b>light</b> <b>staining</b> is sufficient to enable a digital image processing thresholding technique to be quantitative with little background noise. Prior to the addition of lactophenol cotton blue, the Gram-stained slides appeared unremarkable, lacking ubiquitous clumps or stained polysaccharides.  Adding lactophenol cotton blue to Gram stained slides is a quick and inexpensive way to screen cell cultures for bacterial slime, clumps and biofilms that are invisible using the Gram stain alone...|$|R

He advised on <b>lighting,</b> <b>stained</b> glass, metalwork, altar furnishings, plate, carved ornamentation, murals, opus sectile mosaics, and floor coverings.

50|$|The trophozoites are 9-14 micrometres in diameter. Trophozoites {{are one of}} the {{two forms}} of I.bütschlii. This form has a pseudopodia for locomotion. The pseudopodia is short and blunt. It moves in a slow manner. The trophozoite has a single nucleus, {{prominent}} for nuclear endosome and many cytoplasmic vacuoles. The ectoplasm and the granular endoplasm are often hard to distinguish. The nucleus is fairly large and vesicular, containing a large endosome, surrounding by <b>light</b> <b>staining</b> granules about midway between it and the nuclear membrane. Achromatic strands stretch between the endosome and nuclear membrane without any peripheral granules. Food vacuoles are commonly filled with bacteria and yeast.

40|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the human {{observer}} gradually disappeared from optical treatises.

Turned into a material optical instrument, the eye no longer furnished the observer with genuine representations of visible objects. It became a mere screen, on which rested a blurry array of <b>light</b> <b>stains,</b> accidental effects of a purely causal process. It thus befell the intellect to decipher one natural object—a flat image of no inherent epistemic value—as the vague, reversed reflection of another, wholly independent object.
