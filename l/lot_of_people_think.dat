Why are they spending money on something that's an unnecessary add-on {{at the same time}} they're talking about cutting bus routes again?" [...] The agency's general manager responded that all possibilities would be considered, though TriMet officials confirmed that cuts to its public art program were not an option and the MAX Orange Line's budget was separate from TriMet's financial problems.|$|E

But if you really analyze that situation, he’s a good guy and has done the right thing at every turn. Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone Ed Leimbacher {{wrote that}} Idlewild South [...] "augurs {{well for the}} Allmans' future," [...] calling it [...] "a big step forward from the Allmans' first" [...] but {{considered}} the second side of the LP a disappointment. Robert Christgau at The Village Voice gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] and considered it a companion piece to Duane Allman's work on Layla, noting that [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that Duane Allman is already a ranking titan of the electric guitar." [...] A retrospective five-star review from Bruce Eder at Allmusic deemed it [...] "the best studio album in the group's history, electric blues with an acoustic texture, virtuoso lead, slide, and organ playing, and a killer selection of songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Sorensen {{also felt}} {{that it would be}} strange to see Declan played by Mullally, saying: [...] "Of course it will be strange to see someone playing the part that I started and {{basically}} created, it's been my life. It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that – I can understand why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan {{for the past three years}} and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{had five}} {{selections}} {{in the first}} two rounds of the 1986 NFL Draft, as opposed to the normal two, and 14 selections in the 12-round draft overall. Of the draft Giants' General Manager George Young said, [...] "This is not a blue-chip draft, but a strong blue-collar draft. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> there's better quantity than quality." [...] With their first selection they chose defensive end Eric Dorsey #19 overall from the University of Notre Dame. With their four second-round selections they chose Mark Collins, cornerback out of Cal State-Fullerton, Erik Howard, nose tackle out of Washington State University, Pepper Johnson, linebacker out of Ohio State University, and Greg Lasker, defensive back out of the University of Arkansas.|$|E

It was during this time that he cut red meat from his diet to begin his new near-vegetarian diet. At this point new Stoke manager Frank Taylor enquired as to whether he might bring Matthews back to the club; all parties agreed to the idea in {{principle}} until Joe Smith put his foot down to ensure he stayed, with an inspirational speech he promised Matthews that an FA Cup winners medal was still possible, telling him that [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> I'm mad, but even though you're 37, I believe your best football is still to come." ...|$|E

For these valuable revelations she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch. Of what a sentimental fool was Carrie. Of what a lazy brat was Pete. Of how nice Fulton Bemis could be--"course <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> he's a regular old grouch when they meet him because he doesn't give 'em the glad hand the first crack out of the box, but when they get to know him, he's a corker." ...|$|R

I gave up trying to run my own affairs within a week of his coming to me. That was about half a dozen years ago, directly after the rather rummy business of Florence Craye, my Uncle Willoughby's book, and Edwin, the Boy Scout.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with HipHopDX, Legacy said the album was, [...] " [...] pretty much like the lifestyle {{and the culture of}} the typical California teenager put in music. It’s going to surprise a lot of people, because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> we just make the jerk songs [...] dance music." [...] According to Legacy, only two tracks on the album are jerking songs. He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was {{quick to point out that}} most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'. Most of the producers on the album were mostly unknown, local producers. Legacy said, [...] "We have no big producers on our album. All of our producers are like kids ...|$|E
500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes it, just for fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where she would say that her future husband [...] "is out there somewhere, chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs sound very similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E

You know, whether that's a second chance at life, or at a relationship, or when they think they've screwed something up too bad.

She finds it almost impossible to tell a lie, bitch - or accept the goods Pete sometimes brings home that have fallen off the back of lorries. It's as if she's had such a long hard fight to be thought of and accepted as a respectable/decent person, that she's frightened of anything happening that might soil that image. A great sense of humour...She's practical in that she doesn't shatter Pete's dreams even though she knows none of them will ever materialise, because she realises to do so would also shatter him...Kathy never forgets a favour."

It came out very quickly, I wrote it in about half an hour. Even though a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> it sounds complicated, on the guitar it's very simple to play. It nearly never got recorded - when the time came to record it, the keyboard player I wanted to use, Peter Jones, was out of town, so we cut the band track with a different keyboard player. It didn't work. A few days later when we tried it again with a different keyboard player, again it didn't work, and the band was losing interest in the song. Just before the album was finished, Peter Jones came back into town, the band and I had an argument because I wanted to give Reminiscing a third chance. Peter played on it, we cut it, and finished it, and sent the album to Capitol. Capitol said that they couldn't hear any singles on the album, and didn't know what to release. Five weeks later, someone at Capitol's New York office said 'You're all crazy, Reminiscing is a smash.' Capitol put it out, and it just immediately caught on fire, and became our highest chart hit." ...|$|E

Hence, SMEs who are highly cost conscious and suffer from lack of human resources, can be greatly benefited from cloud computing. However, there are some disadvantages of cloud computing as well. In this report, an effort has been made to understand and analyse what factors affect the growth of SMEs and how cloud computing can help to increase the efficiency of those factors thus help SMEs to grow faster in this competitive business environment. In my research, I analysed the merits, demerits, risk factors and risk mitigation factors of cloud computing to understand whether it can embraced by the SMEs and ended up with the idea that today or tomorrow companies have to use cloud computing to operate successfully in this competitive global business environment...|$|R
