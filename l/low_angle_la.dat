With such small grains, the deformation mechanisms taking place at grain boundaries (GBs) become dominant compared to the intragranular crystal plasticity. Recent studies have revealed that the deformation mechanisms {{are influenced by the}} GB network For instance, a high yield stress in nanostructured metals can be obtained by choosing the relevant grain boundary character distribution (GBCD). In this paper we present an original numerical multiscale approach to predict the mechanical behavior of nanostructured metals according to their GBCD composed of either high angle (HA) GBs (HAB) or <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> (<b>LA)</b> GBs (LAB). Molecular simulations using the quasicontinuum method (QC) are performed to obtain the mechanical response at the nanoscale of GB undergoing simple shear (GB sliding behavior) and tensile loads (GB opening behavior). To simulate the grain behavior, a mechanical model of dislocation motions through a forest dislocation is calibrated using a nanoindentation simulation performed with QC. These QC results are then used in a finite element code (direct numerical simulation-DNS) as a GB constitutive model and as a grain constitutive model.

5000|$|The Woodlark Basin {{is one of}} {{very few}} places on the earth to have active <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults. A <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal fault is a normal fault that has a dip of less than thirty degrees (dip <30°). This is a topic that is {{currently}} debated heavily, the <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal fault paradox. <b>Low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults have been proposed {{to be a key}} structural feature for crustal extension. In the Woodlark Basin the active <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults have a dips between 15°-35°, and are all located in the small range of 150.5° E to 152.5° E. [...] This is a very interesting area in the Woodlark because it is the area where sea-floor spreading makes the transition to continental rifting. However, some scientist do not believe that <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults exist actively in the world. They instead believe that the <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal faults found are old normal faults that are no longer active and have been rotated to a different orientation. This would make a normal fault look like it was a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> normal fault that is no longer active.|$|R

Although measurements at <b>low</b> <b>angles</b> are better for fundamental physical reasons (molecules tend to scatter more light in lower angle directions than in higher <b>angles),</b> <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> scattering events caused by dust and contamination of the mobile phase easily overwhelm the scattering from the molecules of interest. When the low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS) became popular in the 1970s and mid-1980s, good quality disposable filters were not readily available and hence multi-angle measurements gained favour.|$|R

The <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> XRD and micro-Raman spectroscopy analysis indicate amorphous-to-nanocrystalline transition occurred at Ts = 300 °C.

The <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> XRD study also shows nc-Si:H films with well-identified lattice planes of (111) orientation. In addition, it is observed from the FTIR spectroscopy that the hydrogen is incorporated in the film mainly in Si-H 2 and (Si-H 2) n complexes. The nc-Si:H films with low hydrogen content (< 4 at. %) and wide band gap (1. 83 - 1. 89 eV) and low refractive index (< 3) is useful for various device applications...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{continuum}} model to compute the energy of <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> grain boundaries for any given degrees of freedom (arbitrary rotation axis, rotation angle and boundary plane orientation) based on a continuum dislocation structure. In our continuum model, we minimize the grain boundary energy associated with the dislocation structure subject to the constraint of Frank's formula for dislocations with all possible Burgers vectors. This constrained minimization problem is solved by the penalty method by which it is turned into an unconstrained minimization problem. The grain boundary dislocation structure is approximated by a network of straight dislocations that predicts the energy and dislocation densities of the grain boundaries. The grain boundary energy based on the calculated dislocation structure is able to incorporate its anisotropic nature. We use our continuum model to systematically study the energy of $ $ <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> grain boundaries in fcc Al with any boundary plane orientation and all six possible Burgers vectors. Comparisons with results of the atomistic simulations show that our continuum model is able to give excellent predictions of the energy and dislocation densities of <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> grain boundaries. We also study the energy of <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> grain boundaries in fcc Al with varying rotation axis while the rest degrees of freedom are fixed. With minor modifications, our model can also apply to dislocation structures and energy of heterogeneous interfaces.
