25|$|Mayfair Games {{released}} a fourth edition of The Settlers of Catan in 2007, with new artwork, a <b>locking</b> <b>frame,</b> a deeper box, and an insert tray; {{there was also}} a minor rule change. Soon after its release, two changes were made to the fourth edition. The robber playing piece was changed from a black to a grey color and the soldier development card was renamed a knight. Fourth-edition versions of Cities & Knights, Seafarers, and the 5–6 player expansions were also released.|$|E

50|$|In 1907 the Caledonian Railway Working Timetable (WTT) {{shows that}} the 12.10pm goods from Gushetfaulds to Ardrossan via Cathcart worked Gree siding. The May 1915 'appendix' to the WTT states that - The Siding must only be worked during {{daylight}} and not during a Fog or Snowstorm. The Points <b>Locking</b> <b>Frame</b> is secured by a padlock. The Key of the Box in which the Points <b>Locking</b> <b>Frame</b> is placed, is {{in the custody of}} the Signalman at Lugton Station.|$|E
50|$|The {{back plate}} assembly, by {{absorbing}} {{the energy of}} the <b>lock</b> <b>frame,</b> reduced the shock against the carrier pin as the <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> was hatched to the rear.|$|R
50|$|The driving spring {{assemblies}} {{held the}} <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> against the carrier dog until the carrier {{was released by}} carrier catch which was pivoted by the incoming round. The springs then drove the <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> assembly forward to operate the ejector, chamber the round and raise the breech block.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> was {{retracted}} by recoil action during automatic firing and {{is forced}} {{forward by the}} driving springs. The major function of the <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> assembly was to force the cartridge into the chamber, actuate the breech block, fire the round {{by means of the}} hammer striking the firing pin, extract the cartridge case from the chamber, and operate the ejector.|$|R
50|$|The GWR {{signal box}} stood {{slightly}} {{to the east of}} Codsall station. It was taken out of use and control of the area passed to Madeley Junction {{as a result of the}} 2006 resignalling scheme. The lever and <b>locking</b> <b>frame</b> from the signal box were recovered by Network Rail for re-use in the south-west of England. The remaining re-usable parts of the signal box have been relocated to the Dean Forest Railway.|$|E

50|$|The {{signal box}} was {{fitted with a}} new <b>locking</b> <b>frame</b> in 1912 and was rebuilt circa 1928. The next signal box to the east was at Largin, and to the west was at Lostwithiel. A new signal box was opened on 31 January 1931 at Onslow Sidings (to serve a china clay works), 1.25 mi towards Largin, but closed again on 10 November 1968. The signal box at Bodmin Road was itself closed on 30 May 1985 and Largin too on 14 December 1991.|$|E
50|$|Romulan {{fashion of}} the late 24th century had {{distinctive}} squared shoulders. Hair is generally cut straight across the brow close to the eyebrows, with longer <b>locks</b> <b>framing</b> the face, cut following the cheekbones, a style reminiscent of a helmet.|$|R
25|$|<b>Frame</b> <b>Lock</b> – Also {{known as}} the {{integral}} lock or monolock, this locking mechanism was invented by custom knifemaker Chris Reeve for the Sebenza as an update to the liner <b>lock.</b> The <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> works {{in a manner similar}} to the liner lock but uses a partial cutout of the actual knife handle, rather than a separate liner inside the handle to hold the blade in place.|$|R
25|$|This was a {{much closer}} copy of the Mauser {{original}} than the ETAI/Royal model and variants, with the full separate <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> and all. It was of much better quality than the earlier gun, though still not at Mauser level. The MM31 was manufactured until 1934. A total of about 10,000 were made, in perhaps four successive variants. These models came in semi-auto and semi-auto/full auto selective fire variants.|$|R
50|$|The Outburst is the company's {{proprietary}} {{mechanism for}} their assisted-opening knives. These knives are standard pivot joint liner <b>lock</b> or <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> folding knife. Inside the knife {{there is a}} spring tab that catches the tang of the blade as it is manually opened. Once the blade reaches thirty degrees the spring takes over and quickly snaps the knife open.|$|R
5000|$|Doom did {{not have}} a higher frame rate than Wolfenstein 3D. It had a lower frame rate. (Doom was <b>locked</b> at 35 <b>frames</b> per second while Wolfenstein 3D was <b>locked</b> at 70 <b>frames</b> per second, a common {{vertical}} refresh rate in displays of that time).|$|R
2500|$|Produced by Beistegui Hermanos in Eibar, Spain, {{this was}} the first pseudo-Mauser on the market, a {{relatively}} crude semi-auto appearing in 1926 and full-auto variants appearing in 1927. Mechanically, it was laid out approximately like the Mauser original, but without the removable <b>lock</b> <b>frame.</b> Internal parts (trigger, hammer, safety lever, etc.) pivoted on pins and screws extending through the frame. The screws also held the frame together. The bolt was of round cross-section, unlike the square Mauser bolt. The weapon was stamped with either [...] "Royal" [...] or [...] "ETAI".|$|R
50|$|Recoil and counter-recoil were {{controlled}} hydraulically {{by means of}} a piston and spring combination connected to the recoiling mechanism and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder mounted to the stationary trunnion block assembly. The recoiling mechanism of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly.|$|R
50|$|UL allows an {{individual}} {{composition of the}} door set from various components such as hinges, <b>locks,</b> <b>frames,</b> door leaves etc. as long as every single component has satisfied the UL standard and been tested individually as such. This is not true for the EN standard. Even though for each component there is a separate test standard available, which the single hardware component must satisfy, the EN standard allows only for the tested composition of components. Therefore exchanging hinges, locks, steel sheet thicknesses, etc. is generally not possible without additional tests.|$|R

5000|$|Although TDM {{can be used}} {{to carry}} {{arbitrary}} bit streams at the rates defined in G.702, there are standardized methods of carrying bit streams in larger units each containing the same number of bits, called <b>frames.</b> TDM <b>framing</b> <b>locks</b> the <b>frame</b> rate to the sampling frequency of voice traffic, so that there are always 8000 frames per second; a T1 frame consists of 193 bits and an E1 frame of 256 bits.|$|R
2500|$|The signal boxes use to {{two types}} of frame, both {{manufactured}} at the GWR signal works in [...] The older frames are the 1892 developed Stud frame, which replaced the original twist frames. It operates {{in a similar manner}} to tappet locking except that the blades are curved. The remained signal boxes use 5-bar tappet <b>locking</b> <b>frames</b> dating from the 1930s. Power supply within the boxes is standard 110-volt AC, 50Hz, derived via transformer from the standard UK/EU 230-volts AC individual supplies. Inside the box, most voltages are DC, with standras derived from those in operations during British Railways ownership of the line.|$|R
50|$|Middle Forge is 450 yd {{away from}} Norchard and {{consists}} of a three lever ground <b>frame</b> <b>locked</b> by a Token.|$|R
50|$|The O-lock {{also serves}} as a {{deterrent}} to ownership disputes, as the person who has the O-lock key is proven to be the owner of the bike. More recent O-locks have a slot to attach an armored cable, allowing a cyclist to <b>lock</b> the <b>frame,</b> wheels, and seat.|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 2010, {{after several}} years of unavailability, Aliens versus Predator was commercially re-released under the title Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000. This version of the game has been updated to work on modern computers, as well as support for the Xbox 360 controllers. Moreover, this release {{includes}} all the levels from the original AvP Gold Edition and the extra content of the Millennium Add-on Pack. Supporting only single player initially, multiplayer functionality has since been added. This release can be purchased either through Valve's Steam digital distribution service, through OnLive cloud computing platform, through Green Man Gaming, and through GOG.com where it started as free giveaway. A patch released on 19 January 2010 added proper widescreen support, optional unlimited saves, a <b>locked</b> <b>frame</b> rate, mouse improvements, and other updates to the game.|$|R

5000|$|Important part of shutter lock {{to secure}} shutter in place, can be locked with Bullet Lock or Shutter lock with arms that <b>lock</b> shutter to <b>frame</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The O-lock also {{conveniently}} secures {{the rear}} wheel: only <b>locking</b> the <b>frame</b> is needed, to secure both {{the frame and}} the rear wheel. Used {{in addition to a}} U-lock it can be a convenient second lock. Some models have an optional cable or chain that plugs into the body of the lock to enable the bicycle to be secured as well.|$|R
50|$|Instead, Pontbriand {{stated that}} the {{decision}} for parity came from {{the limitations of the}} consoles' CPUs. The number of NPCs and general amount of AI was paramount to keeping the game <b>locked</b> at 30 <b>frames</b> per second.|$|R
50|$|The {{doors are}} double skinned glass fibre fitted with {{anti-burst}} <b>locks,</b> steel window <b>frames,</b> and steel strengthers to avoid door drop, often found on glass fibre cars. The sliding windows are toughened glass, {{coming from the}} Mini traveler.|$|R
5000|$|The Browning M1919 remains {{popular with}} {{civilian}} enthusiasts in the United States, though changes in 1986 to the National Firearms Act of 1934 (the US Federal law regulating private ownership of machine guns) prohibited the registration of new machine guns for sales to private citizens, thus freezing {{the number of}} [...] "transferable" [...] machine guns in private ownership. The inflation of prices that followed, {{and the availability of}} parts from surplussed and scrapped machine guns, {{led to the development of}} semi-automatic versions of the Browning M1919. Typically, these are built using a new right sideplate (the portion legally considered the [...] "firearm" [...] under US law), which has a raised [...] "island" [...] protruding into the interior of the receiver. This requires the use of a modified bolt, barrel extension and <b>lock</b> <b>frame</b> which have been designed to allow only semi-automatic firing. The [...] "island" [...] prevents the insertion of unmodified full-automatic parts. A number of small gun companies have produced these [...] "semi-auto machine guns" [...] for commercial sales. The fairly simple modifications necessary to convert M1919 parts to the semi-automatic version, and the relatively easy process of riveting used in the assembly of the Browning machine gun's receiver, have also made it a popular gun for hobbyists to build at home.|$|R
5|$|The Windows {{version of}} Remastered {{was criticized for}} {{suffering}} {{from a number of}} technical issues in the multiplayer, with players also being dissatisfied with the game's available settings for PC. On Steam, it received mostly negative user reviews, with complaints including poor performance, a <b>locked</b> 90 <b>frames</b> per second, inadequate mouse support, numerous hackers, and a low player count. Some users suggested that the multiplayer of Modern Warfare would be a more suitable alternative, which still attracted a sizable amount of players and offered better options for performance, modding and customization.|$|R
50|$|Monster Maker ran in four megs of memory. The {{animation}} {{engine was}} <b>locked</b> at 12 <b>frames</b> per second, {{regardless of the}} speed of the computer. It required an Intel 80486 processor and a video card that could do 640x480x8. Under Windows, it relied on the WinG library for its blitter engine.|$|R

5000|$|O-locks {{provide a}} limited degree of security, like all locks. [...] The {{greatest}} security requires using multiple types of locks together. In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft {{and the owner}} must show {{that they have the}} key, to demonstrate that the bike was locked. The key can only be removed by locking the lock. In other locations, the O-lock is used along with <b>locking</b> the <b>frame</b> to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.|$|R
50|$|Some merchants {{resisted}} this {{disapproval of}} the packaging, as longboxes theoretically {{made it harder}} for shoplifters to hide the items as well as avoiding friction with retailers. Several proposals for new types of packaging that served the display-size of the longbox and theft-prevention goals were developed. A common replacement consisted of <b>locking</b> plastic <b>frames</b> (security keepers) containing anti-theft detection strips, designed to roughly meet the same dimensions as the longbox {{to fit into the}} same racks in a record store, and removed by the cashier upon purchase. Eventually, as LP-sized sales racks were phased out, these frames were reduced to a size only slightly larger than the disc boxes themselves.|$|R
50|$|Also {{called an}} O-lock, ring-lock or <b>frame</b> <b>lock.</b> This {{is a low}} {{security}} mechanism {{mounted on the frame}} that immobilizes the rear wheel by moving a steel bolt through the spokes to prevent motion. It uses a straight or circular bolt which extends from the housing. This type of lock is common in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, China, India and Japan.|$|R
30|$|In {{the typical}} tiled display {{architecture}} as described above, rendering nodes send parts of overall image to be displayed to individual display nodes. The display nodes then utilize a distributed synchronization algorithm and individually display {{parts of the}} image on their display tiles to provide the overall perception of a single continuous image. In some cases, the display nodes can utilize advanced graphics cards such as Nvidia Quadro family of cards and can utilize Genlock <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> [8] to achieve a better frame synchronization amongst them. However, these cards are expensive. Furthermore, the Genlock <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> techniques cannot completely solve the synchronization problem as each display node is receiving its image parts over the network. Thus, the image part ready to be displayed by each node at a given refresh instance (e.g., at 60 [*]Hz) may {{not belong to the}} same overall image depending upon the network stream reception performance of each node.|$|R
