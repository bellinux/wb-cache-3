2500|$|As {{the weight}} of the {{caissons}} and counterweights would now be borne by the lift superstructure instead of by the rams, the superstructure was strengthened and put on stronger foundations. The new superstructure was built around the original <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> {{in order to avoid the}} need to dismantle the original lift, which would have taken it out of service for a long period. The new superstructure consisted of ten steel A-frames, five on each side, supporting a machinery deck 60ft (18 m) above the river level where the electric motors, drive shafts and cast-iron headgear pulleys were mounted. Wire ropes attached to both sides of each caisson passed over the pulleys to 36 cast iron counterweights weighing [...] each, 18 on each side to balance the [...] weight of each loaded caisson. The electric motor had to overcome friction between the pulleys and their bearings. A [...] motor was installed, but normal operation only required about half of this power.|$|E
50|$|After the Meillerwagen {{was close}} to the launch point, the Firing Platoon Truck Section took charge and removed the rockets {{camouflage}} cover and rudder protection. The control compartment batteries, alcohol-filling connection, tools, and other equipment were loaded into a box on a strut {{at the top of the}} Meillerwagens <b>lift</b> <b>frame.</b> The Meillerwagen was moved via hand winches to the firing stand and then levelled via the two extendable outriggers with end-jacks.|$|E
50|$|The rocket {{was raised}} via the Meillerwagen <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> and hydraulics. When vertical, the rocket was {{suspended}} above the firing stand, which {{was raised to}} touch the rocket fins. Clamping collars were used to connect the rocket to the firing stand, and the Meillerwagen was withdrawn less than a meter and the rocket was turned a quarter turn for the fuel connections to face the Meillerwagen platforms, which were lowered into position for standing. A separate three-section extendable ladder, the Magirus ladder, was used for areas of an erected rocket not accessible via the Meillerwagen.|$|E
50|$|Acting as gantry, the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} {{a number of}} work platforms from which crewmen serviced the rocket. Three (later two) platforms folded flat against the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and could be folded out from the elevated <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{with the use of}} a hand winch. Each folding platform {{included a}} safety rail of folding posts and chains.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its launch table. The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts {{running up the}} port <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> beam. The drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were operated by a crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> one running half {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> while the other ran the full length.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} two digital filters {{are applied to}} {{elaborate}} acceleration data acquired from two accelerometers fixed in a <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> during safety gears tests. The experimental tests consist in free falls of a test lift car and the subsequent gripping phases initiated by the safety gears activation due to over-speed condition. Unfortunately, the reliability of acceleration data is heavily impaired by measurement noise, which needs to be suppressed to the largest extent possible {{in order to use}} the data for comfort evaluation. To this end, two classes of digital filters are tested: the Savitzky–Golay and the Butterworth filters. This choice is motivated by the key features of these filters, including their computational simplicity and high suitability to represent time varying features in acceleration measurements. A tuning procedure is proposed for these filters, such that the measurement noise corrupting the experimental data is maximally dumped...|$|E
50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or lowering the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> One hand tap selected direction to either raise or lower the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from its vertical position.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with tubular and box transverse braces. The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was fitted with plumbing for fuelling the rocket; wiring for powering and monitoring the rocket and for field telephones; accommodations for carrying and dismounting the rocket; and folding platforms {{to service the}} rocket with rungs to access them.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{was fitted}} with outlet sockets and wiring for field telephones. A main {{connection}} from the armoured launch vehicle switchboard to inlet sockets on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> provided circuits for four field phone stations at the Meillerwagen - one each {{at the upper}} and lower folding work platforms and two at the launch table.|$|R
40|$|Trends in the {{offshore}} wind market show that newly installed wind farms move towards deeper waters. Wind turbine generators are currently installed using jack-up vessels, {{which have a}} limited operating depth. Installation of wind turbines using a floating vessel is an alternative for the current method, but blade installation is an area which is not explored yet. Using the innovation model from the Delft System Approach, a new method for blade installation enabling competitive wind turbine generator installation is developed. The current installation method is analysed, and a logistical concept is proposed which can install wind turbines competitive using the Oleg Strashnov. Concepts are generated, from which the tower ring concept is the most feasible. A blade <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> {{is attached to the}} tower ring to eliminate the motions at the blade from the vessel. Wind turbine blade can be installed in 4. 2 hours, which is within the competitive time-frame. It is defined that wind turbines can be installed 38 hours faster than current jack-up vessels.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the extensibility and stiffness of the hamstrings {{in patients with}} nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Design: An experimental design. Setting: A university laboratory for human movement analysis in a department of rehabilitation medicine. Participants: Forty subjects, a patient group (20) and a healthy control group (20). Interventions: Subjects laid supine on an examination table with a <b>lift</b> <b>frame,</b> with left leg placed in a sling at the ankle. Straight leg raising, pulling force, and activity of hamstring and back muscles were recorded with electrodes. Patients indicated when they experienced tension or pain. Main Outcome Measures: The lift force, leg excursion, pelvic-femoral angle, first sensation of pain, and the electro-myogram of the hamstrings and back muscles measured in an experimental straight-leg raising set-up. Results: The patient group showed a significant restriction in range of motion (ROM) and extensibility of the hamstrings compared with the control group. No significant difference in hamstring muscle stiffness can be assessed between both groups. Conclusion: The restricted ROM and the decreased extensibility of the hamstrings in patients with nonspecific LBP is not caused by increased muscle stiffness of the hamstrings, but determined by the stretch tolerance of the patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{three-dimensional}} extended {{finite element}} method (X-FEM) coupled with a narrow band fast marching method (FMM) is developed and implemented in the Abaqus finite element package for curvilinear fatigue crack growth and life prediction analysis of metallic structures. Given the level set representation of arbitrary crack geometry, the narrow band FMM provides {{an efficient way to}} update the level set values of its evolving crack front. In order to capture the plasticity induced crack closure effect, an element partition and state recovery algorithm for dynamically allocated Gauss points is adopted for efficient integration of historical state variables in the near-tip plastic zone. An element-based penalty approach is also developed to model crack closure and friction. The proposed technique allows arbitrary insertion of initial cracks, independent of a base 3 D model, and allows non-self-similar crack growth pattern without conforming to the existing mesh or local remeshing. Several validation examples are presented to demonstrate the extraction of accurate stress intensity factors for both static and growing cracks. Fatigue life prediction of a flawed helicopter <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> under the ASTERIX spectrum load is presented to demonstrate the analysis procedure and capabilities of the method.

40|$|Deltastream is an {{on-going}} project {{carried by}} Tidal Energy Limited since almost twenty years. It is a tidal energy converter with a triangular shape and one turbine on each tower. It {{has gone through}} many evolutions of design but a first prototype will be installed {{in the end of}} 2014 at Ramsey Sound. The deployment and recovery operations will be carried out with a single lift point through a heavy <b>lift</b> <b>frame.</b> Two issues have to be tackled during the operation: the rate of flooding of the ballasts and the tension on the lift crane cable. The most favourable sea state must be found in order to minimise the crane cable tension as well as the best inlets and outlets configuration for the ballasts system. In order to tackle those issues, preliminary analytical work was conducted on the demonstrator to assess the stability during the flooding process. A scaled model was designed and built in order to be tested in a wave-towing tank. The results from the tests highlight that the deployment and the recovery operations are safe for both the barge and Deltastream for the range of wave conditions tested in the tank. However, the sea state has an important impact on the proceeding of the operations, especially the period of the waves...|$|E

50|$|An early {{configuration}} of the Meillerwagen included hard-wiring of two electrical power circuits and two FLAK-plug circuits for the power and control needs of the rocket. The system included four sockets at the upper and {{at the lower end}} of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and the connective wiring fixed along the starboard beam. The four circuits were connected to two Stotz ejecting plugs, stowed with their cables along the side of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> All of this wiring had become redundant by the time the rocket attacks began, but was not removed from the Meillerwagen.|$|R

50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one {{on each side of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R

50|$|Each {{front corner}} of the chassis was fitted with a swing-out A-frame boom {{equipped}} with a screw jack and foot plate. The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it during erection of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> trunnion axis to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|R

This <b>frame</b> was <b>lifted</b> by means of a pulley until the casualty’s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.|$|R
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to <b>lift</b> the <b>frame</b> and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|R
