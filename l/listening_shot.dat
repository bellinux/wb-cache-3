60|$|RAINA (sternly, as {{she sees}} him <b>listening</b> to the <b>shots).</b> So much the better for you.|$|R
60|$|He <b>listened</b> attentively for <b>shots</b> in the distance, {{but none}} came, and this {{caused him to}} be more perplexed than ever.|$|R
60|$|As {{he moved}} along, he <b>listened</b> for some <b>shots</b> from Shep, but, hearing none, {{concluded}} that his chum was having no success.|$|R
50|$|Carmen, the {{youngest}} of all, is the only survivor of the group. Desolated, she <b>listens</b> to the <b>shots</b> that killed her terrified friends.|$|R
5000|$|According to Blabbermouth.net, [...] "Shot to Hell {{will not}} cause band to lose fans, {{even with the}} {{abundance}} of ballads this time around. In fact, {{it is easier to}} <b>listen</b> to <b>Shot</b> to Hell in one sitting because of the song variety....Shot to Hell is probably more of what you expect with just a hint of progression." ...|$|R
60|$|The old ancestor, {{asleep on}} his blanket, {{was awakened by}} the <b>shots.</b> <b>Listening</b> further, he heard a great cry from some man in mortal {{distress}} or anguish, and rose up grumbling at the disturbing ways of moderns.|$|R
6000|$|Guy Pollock {{crossed the}} street to be {{pleasant}} apropos of California and new novels. Vida Sherwin dragged her to the Jolly Seventeen. There, with every one rigidly <b>listening,</b> Maud Dyer <b>shot</b> at Carol, [...] "I hear Erik has left town." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then they {{pleaded with}} her {{to give up her}} purpose. But in vain! She pushed them back and ran out through the kitchen with Jacobs's wife {{following}} her. Jean turned to the window in time to see both women run out into the lane. Jean looked fearfully, and <b>listened</b> for <b>shots.</b> But only a loud, [...] "Haw! Haw!" [...] came from the watchers outside. That coarse laugh relieved the tension in Jean's breast. Possibly the Jorths were not as black as his father painted them. The two women entered an open shed and came forth with a shovel and spade.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} some {{miles from the}} ranch, and {{crossing}} a deep ravine, {{when he heard the}} sound of a rifle far above him. Halting, he <b>listened</b> intently. Another <b>shot</b> rang out, nearer and to the south, and a moment later the faint reports of a revolver. This sent a wave of excitement through his blood. A rifle-shot might mean only a poacher. A volley of revolver-shots meant battle.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually it is {{revealed}} that Neela's employer Beni Prasad is the mastermind behind Neela's imprisonment. He is after her property and devises {{a plan in}} which Ranjan, Neela's co-actor, is {{to act as if}} he is in love with her and get her will signed. But on the night Ranjan has taken the papers to Neela and is just getting them signed, he changes his mind. He was about to surrender and tell the whole truth when Neela held him at gunpoint [...] - [...] just before he could tell the name of his employer he was shot. Neela believes it's she who had killed him whereas it was Beni Prasad who was hiding and <b>listening</b> had <b>shot</b> Ranjan dead.|$|R
50|$|For the {{remainder}} of the night, Wheeling <b>listened</b> to <b>shots</b> being fired sporadically but did not leave station. Unknown to the gunboat, UB-50 also scored a hit on SS Elswick Grange, but the English steamer succeeded in making port under her own power. The convoy continued its voyage to Bizerte unmolested and reached port on 21 May. Upon arrival, Wheeling learned that severe damage had forced one of the two submarines which had attacked the convoy, U-39, to intern herself at Cartagena, Spain. Originally, the gunboat claimed that her depth charges had caused the damage, but that conclusion seems unlikely. German reports of the action make no mention of a depth charge attack and attribute all the damage to an attack by two British planes which occurred the following day.|$|R
60|$|I whistled {{a little}} tune softly, which always rouses the wood folk's curiosity; {{but as he}} lay quiet, <b>listening,</b> his ears <b>shot</b> back and forth nervously at a score of sounds that I could not hear, as if above the music he caught faint echoes of the last fearful chase. Then I brought out my lunch and, {{nibbling}} a bit myself, pushed a slice of black bread over the crust towards him with a long stick.|$|R
50|$|Jean spots a {{man with}} an {{electronic}} device and informs Grant. Mavros is called to speak to the President of the United States, only to realize he is to be sacrificed as a warning that Hassan is serious. Hassan points a gun to Mavros' head as he tries in vain to get the President to <b>listen,</b> but is <b>shot</b> in the head. Meanwhile, the soldiers use the plane's taillights via Morse code to signal U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter jets that they are on board and not to shoot them down.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall never}} forget that day. Polly Ann left my side only to feed the {{children}} and to keep watch out of the loopholes, and I lay on my back, listening and <b>listening</b> to the <b>shots.</b> At last these became scattered. Then, though we strained our ears, we heard them no more. Was the fort taken? The sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light, now through one loophole and now through another, until a ray slanted from the western wall and rested upon the red-and-black paint of two dead bodies in the corner. I stared with horror.|$|R
60|$|The day {{was half}} spent when there broke {{unexpectedly}} upon her startled ears {{the sound of}} a rifle shot not far ahead of her. As she paused to <b>listen,</b> this first <b>shot</b> was followed by another and another and another. What could it mean? The first explanation which sprung to her mind attributed the firing to an encounter between the Arab raiders and a party of Waziri; but as she did not know upon which side victory might rest, or whether she were behind friend or foe, she dared not advance nearer on the chance of revealing herself to an enemy.|$|R
40|$|PETALING JAYA: More {{university}} students have apparently made their presence felt on campuses after law student K. S. Bawani (pix) of the "Listen, <b>Listen,</b> Listen" video <b>shot</b> to fame. She {{said she has}} seen more students come out boldly on issues that pertain to them. "They are ready to take up responsibilities to voice out student issues by contesting in student elections," she told the Sun. She said the elections at Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), where she won {{a seat on the}} student supreme council, were different this time around as students came out actively to participate in the polls...|$|R
50|$|Selina and Spark {{initially}} think {{themselves to}} have killed the Talon, but later {{realize that the}} Talon is in a way immortal. Ephraim takes Selina's whip and begins to mercilessly beat Spark and then choke Selina's lover with it with Selina not understanding. Selina decides to bargain with the Talon, offering him {{a full set of}} Talon daggers. Ephraim begins to <b>listen</b> but is <b>shot</b> in the head by the Penguin. Selina and Spark eventually decide not on stealing the Talon daggers that Penguin originally had in his possession and head off to deposit the Talon's body, which they leave at the Batsignal, with the Night of the Owls having come to a close.|$|R
60|$|Be it confessed that, {{beautiful}} as the dead form looked, and guiltless as Septimius {{must be held}} in causing his death, still {{he felt as if}} he should be eased when it was under the ground. He hastened down to the house, and brought up a shovel and a pickaxe, and began his unwonted task of grave-digging, delving earnestly a deep pit, sometimes pausing in his toil, while the sweat-drops poured from him, to look at the beautiful clay that was to occupy it. Sometimes he paused, too, to <b>listen</b> to the <b>shots</b> that pealed in the far distance, towards the east, whither the battle had long since rolled out of reach and almost out of hearing. It seemed to have gathered about itself the whole life of the land, attending it along its bloody course in a struggling throng of shouting, shooting men, so still and solitary was everything left behind it. It seemed the very midland solitude of the world where Septimius was delving at the grave. He and his dead were alone together, and he was going to put the body under the sod, and be quite alone.|$|R
5000|$|Jessica Hopper of Spin rated it {{eight out}} of ten and said: [...] "The {{unexpected}} triumph lies not in the spectacle of the singer raw-dogging her emotions, but in her total command of the anarchy that results." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune called it [...] "more stripped down and turbulent than before" [...] and gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and said: [...] "It makes for a raw, unsettling <b>listen,</b> tempered by <b>shots</b> of dark humor." [...] NME put the album as [...] "NME Recommends" [...] and rated it as eight-out-of-ten and said: [...] "The tension created by the lyrics and music is wonderful and uneasy, ensuring that The Idler Wheel... is endlessly fascinating and unlike anything else you're likely to hear this year." [...] Slant Magazine was also positive and gave it four-stars-out-of-five and said: [...] "The Idler Wheel captures what's made Apple one of the defining artists of her generation: a persona that's reflected changing views of private versus public spheres. The results have often been misunderstood, but Apple has continued to present herself as someone who refuses to resort to niceties of tact or self-censorship when she engages with her audience." [...] The A.V. Club graded the album an A and said: [...] "The beauty of The Idler Wheel... is how it transmits each of those feelings in excruciating, frank, and lovely detail." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard gave a very positive review to the album and wrote: [...] "The result is an album that was absolutely worth the seven-year wait, {{not to mention the}} mountain of hype atop which Apple has sat since her big comeback at SXSW in March." [...] The Boston Phoenix praised the album, awarded it with three-and-a-half stars out of four and said: [...] "Her fourth album is arguably her funniest ... but also her leanest and most melodically daring." [...] Paste magazine reviewer Stephen M. Deusner wrote a positive review and rated as 8.4 out of 10 and said: [...] "To her immense credit, Apple never flinches at such uneasy insights and insoluble contradictions, which makes The Idler Wheel a tough but rewarding listen." [...] Now magazine was also positive on the album, picked [...] "Hot Knife" [...] as the [...] "Top Track", gave it four out of five stars and noted, [...] "Apple's return to music is not only undeniably powerful, but Idler is arguably her best work yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was about}} the {{beginning}} of winter," [...] said he, [...] "that I set off on snow-shoes, accompanied by an Indian, to a small lake to fetch fish caught in the autumn, and which then lay frozen in a little house built of logs, to protect them for winter use. The lake was about ten miles off; and as the road was pretty level and not much covered with underwood, we took a train of dogs with us, and set off before daybreak, intending to return again before dark; and as the day was clear and cold, we went cheerily along without interruption, except an occasional fall when a branch caught our snow-shoes, or a stoppage to clear the traces when the dogs got entangled among the trees. We had proceeded about six miles, and the first grey streaks of day lit up the eastern horizon, when the Indian who walked in advance paused, and appeared to examine some footprints in the snow. After {{a few minutes of}} close observation he rose, and said that a bear had passed not long before, and could not be far off, and asked permission to follow it. I told him he might do so, and said I would drive the dogs in his track, as the bear had gone {{in the direction of the}} fish-house. The Indian threw his gun over his shoulder, and was soon lost in the forest. For a quarter of an hour I plodded on behind the dogs, now urging them along, as they flagged and panted in the deep snow, and occasionally <b>listening</b> for a <b>shot</b> from my Indian's gun. At last he fired, and almost immediately after fired again; for you must know that some Indians can load so fast that two shots from their single barrel sound almost like the discharge in succession of the two shots from a double-barrelled gun. Shortly after, I heard another shot; and then, as all became silent, I concluded he had killed the bear, and that I should soon find him cutting it up. Just as I thought this, a fierce growl alarmed me; so, seizing a pistol which I always carried with me, I hastened forward. As I came nearer, I heard a man's voice mingled with the growls of a bear; and upon arriving at the foot of a small mound, my Indian's voice, apostrophising death, became distinctly audible. `Come, Death!' said he, in a contemptuous tone; `you have got me at last, but the Indian does not fear you!' A loud angry growl from the bear, as he saw me rushing up the hill, stopped him; and the unfortunate man turned his eyes upon me with an imploring look. He was lying on his back, while the bear (a black one) stood over him, holding one of his arms in its mouth. In rushing up the mound I unfortunately stumbled, and filled my pistol with snow; so that when the bear left the Indian and rushed towards me it missed fire, and I had only left me the poor, almost hopeless, chance, of stunning the savage animal with a blow of the butt-end. Just as he was rearing on his hind legs, my eye fell upon the Indian's axe, which fortunately lay at my feet; and seizing it, I brought it down with all my strength on the bear's head, just at the moment that he fell upon me, and we rolled down the hill together. Upon recovering myself, I found that the blow of the axe had killed him instantly, and that I was uninjured. Not so the Indian: the whole calf of his left leg was bitten off, and his body lacerated dreadfully in various places. He was quite sensible, however, though very faint, and spoke to me when I stooped to examine his wounds. In a short time I had tied them up; and placing him on the sledge with part of the bear's carcass, which I intended to dine upon, we returned immediately to the fort. The poor Indian got better slowly, but he never recovered the perfect use of his leg, and now hobbles about the fort, cutting firewood, or paddling about the lake in search of ducks and geese in his bark canoe." ...|$|R
