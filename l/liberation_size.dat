40|$|International audienceFor mineral processing, an ore can {{be defined}} as the {{assemblage}} of useful mineral grains and gangue mineral grains. The first step of ore mineral processing involves crushing the material in order to achieve required mineral liberation. When it is achieved, in the ideal case, resulting fragments are formed: 1) only by useful minerals or 2) only by gangue minerals. This work consists to develop a numerical tool to determine the <b>liberation</b> mesh <b>size</b> of a given ore. With this aim, 1) a sample of the considered ore is modelled by a binary 3 D image segmentation. Then, 2) a grinding process is modelled by a digital approximation of a Voronoi tessellation of the image, with random seeds. Each Voronoi cell represents a fragment of the ground ore sample. Fragments must meet several conditions so that they reproduce the characteristics of the crushing products in the mineral industry (e. g. the particle size distribution must follow a Rosin-Rammler law and the shape of the fragments must be close to spheres). This modelling allows obtaining the characteristics of the <b>liberation</b> mesh <b>size.</b> This is an important parameter to evaluate the feasibility of a mining project because the grinding operations are very expensive. This study would: 1) to evaluate and predict grinding costs from the bulk ore texture and 2) to provide an assessment tool downstream of the means of current observations and conventional analysis...|$|R

30|$|Indian coals of drift origin (Gondwana Coal) can be {{characterized}} by high ash content with impurities disseminated in the coal bed. Very thin bands (5  mm– 3  cm) of impurities are often encountered in between coal bands.

However, operating a coal washery with such small coal size is not feasible under present techno-economics.

Coal beneficiation by froth flotation is a well-established processing method to recover fine particles (mainly below 700  µm) (Dey and Bhattacharyya 2007; Dickinson et al. 2015; Jaiswal et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017). The oil-based reagents are typical collectors to cover oxidized surfaces of coal particles and improve their float-abilities (Polat et al. 1999; Harris and Fuerstenau 2000; Jena et al. 2008; Han et al. 2014; Wen et al. 2017).|$|E

40|$|Brannerite, UTi 2 O 6, is {{the most}} common {{refractory}} uranium mineral and {{is the most}} important uranium ore mineral after uraninite and coffinite. In order to develop an effective treatment method for the hydrometallurgical extraction of uranium from ores containing brannerite, it is necessary to understand the chemistry of the leaching process. Part 1 of this series described the results of a study of the chemical reaction mechanisms of brannerite under conditions similar to those used industrially. In this paper, the mineralogical data obtained from samples collected during the leaching work is used to derive further insight into the transformations that take place during leaching. Detailed characterisation of the brannerite feed specimen and leach residues was carried out using surface imaging and X-ray diffraction techniques. It was shown that the brannerite specimen is heterogeneous, consisting of at least two phases. The brannerite phase was metamict and showed signs of natural alteration to fine-grained (10 - 20 nm) crystalline anatase. Comparisons between the feed and residues showed that the X-ray amorphous materials, in particular lead and silicon enriched areas identified near the anatase were most susceptible to leaching while the crystalline material was relatively resistant to leaching. These results demonstrate that the extent of brannerite alteration and its texture are important considerations to the hydrometallurgical behaviour of a particular ore along with the typical concerns such as grade, <b>liberation</b> <b>size</b> and gangue mineralogy...|$|E

A cumulative of optimum weight percent retained and passed were calculated and plotted against a graph of particle sizes. The elemental percent compositions of the minerals in the respective sieve sizes were examined {{with the use of}} Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The AAS result agrees with the graphical result in which the optimum liberation particle size of between - 100 + 75 µm yielded 55. 53 and 47. 47 % weights retained and passed respectively and an elemental recovery of a high concentration of zinc, lead and iron at 12. 05, 18. 09 and 10. 03 % in that order. Wills (2007) established that the optimum particle size of galena ore liberated in order to give maximum concentration or recovery of valuable minerals should be between + 200 and - 75 µm with a weight percent (wt %) retaining and passing as 60 and 40 respectively.

40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that {{flotation}} recovery is {{strongly influenced by}} the physical properties of the particles in the stream being processed. Other factors, including {{the environment in which}} the particles exist, are also influential but in many cases these remain constant through the circuit. It has recently been shown for various different ore types that the liberation properties of a given mineral in the ore remains consistent for a given size fraction irrespective of the overall particle size distribution. This is particularly valid for the finer size fractions relevant to the flotation feed. For different ore types the amount of liberated mineral in a given size fraction {{has been shown to be}} related to the textures present in the ore. The implications of this are that when the particle size distribution of the stream changes (i. e. from changing mill throughput), then the fact that the amount of material of a specified <b>liberation</b> per <b>size</b> fraction remains constant means that the mass of values in each fraction (mass x amt) can be calculated.

The present study was carried out to provide information that will enable the development of a more effective processing strategy for the extraction of uranium from ores containing brannerite. A detailed study was carried out to understand the leaching behaviour of brannerite in sulphate media (10 – 200 g/L H 2 SO 4) under moderate temperature conditions (25 – 96 °C), and in alternative acid and alkaline systems. The feed and the leached residues were characterised by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry techniques. The brannerite dissolved up to 95 % after 5 h leaching in ferric sulphate media, up to 89 % in ferric chloride media under similar conditions, and up to 82 % in 24 h in sodium carbonate media. The alkaline leaching was repeated with a high-carbonate brannerite-bearing ore, which showed comparable extractions. Mineralogical characterisation showed that altered and amorphous regions are a regular feature of brannerite, and that pitting is typically observed {{on the surface of the}} leached grains. Brannerite was shown to generally dissolve congruently, with altered and amorphous regions in the brannerite grains dissolving faster than the crystalline regions, which implies that the extent of brannerite alteration is a key parameter in the process selection, along with the grade, <b>liberation</b> <b>size</b> and gangue mineralogy...|$|E
40|$|Modern digital mine planning, plant {{design and}} mineral {{processing}} operations demand detailed characterisation of the ore and plant feed. Textural parameters, such as mineral <b>liberation</b> <b>size</b> and mineral association, combine with modal mineralogy data to strongly influence mineral processing conditions and recovery.

These methods are time consuming, costly and frequently produce semi-quantitative results from data sets that {{are too small to}} be statistically valid. Thus, the results cannot be used reliably and effectively in digital mine planning and design. In the last 10 years, modern SEM-based quantitative mineralogy tools have advanced rapidly with increasing computer power, improved SEM hardware and the development of sophisticated image analysis methods. Texture resolutions can now be submicron and SEM measurement times have reduced to less than an hour for simple analyses, where previously they required many hours. Through image analysis, particle sections are recognised and separated, and the mineral grains within are delineated for discrete X-ray analysis to determine mineralogy. The modern tools not only increase the speed and accuracy of liberation analysis, but also enhance measurement automation. Automated standard collection assists with the setup of new ore types for routine analysis and automated elemental quantification of target minerals enables the tracking of variations in the composition of the minerals of interest. The key to success for any modern SEM-based mineral liberation analysis system is the close integration of BSE image and EDS X-ray analyses. Integration of the SEM-based quantitative mineral liberation analysis with optical microscope, dual beam systems and X-ray tomography will further enrich the analysis results and the derived user experience...|$|E
40|$|The Ispat Inland plant {{processes}} two blends of ore during {{different time}} periods throughout the year. Although these two blends have mineralogical differences, {{they go through}} the same process. The major difference in the process becomes fineness of grind required to achieve desired level of liberation, which is in tum controlled by the rod mill feed rate. This created a unique opportunity for modeling the effect of mineralogy on separation equipment and measuring reliability of the simulator in predicting perfonnance of non-concentration equipment, such as hydrocyclones and fine screens, under different operating and feed conditions. While performance of concentration devices including magnetic separator, hydroseparator and flotation banks was expected to show dependence on variation in mineralogy, particularly on <b>liberation</b> <b>size,</b> performance of classification and screening devices would be largely independent of the liberation characteristics. Therefore, the models were expected to reasonably simulate the performance of these devices for a given blend when plant data from the other blend was available. On the other hand, performance of grinding mills is mostly governed by the grindability characteristics of a given ore type. Differences in mineralogy {{may or may not have}} significant effect on their performance, depending on whether or not change in mineralogy create significant variations in grindability.

40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) based {{assessments}} {{are the most}} widely used and trusted imaging technique for mineral ore quantification. X-ray micro tomography (XMT) is a more recent addition to the mineralogy toolbox, but with the potential to extend the measurement capabilities into the three dimensional (3 D) assessment of properties such as mineral <b>liberation,</b> grain <b>size</b> and textural characteristics. In addition, unlike SEM based assessments which require the samples to be sectioned, XMT is non-invasive and non-destructive. The disadvantage of XMT, is that the mineralogy must be inferred from the X-ray attenuation measurements, which can make it hard to distinguish from one another, whereas SEM when coupled with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) provides elemental compositions and thus a more direct method for distinguishing different minerals. A new methodology that combines both methods at the mineral grain level is presented. The rock particles used to test the method were initially imaged in 3 D using XMT followed by sectioning and the 2 D imaging of the slices using SEM-EDX. An algorithm was developed that allowed the mineral grains in the 2 D slice to be matched with their 3 D equivalents in the XMT based images. As the mineralogy of the grains from the SEM images can be matched to a range of X-ray attenuations, this allows minerals which have similar attenuations to one another to be distinguished, with the level of uncertainty in the classification quantified. In addition, the methodology allowed for the estimation of the level of uncertainty in the quantification of grain size by XMT, the assessment of stereological effects in SEM 2 D images and ultimately obtaining a simplified 3 D mineral map from low energy XMT images.

The present study was carried out to provide information that will enable the development of a more effective processing strategy for the extraction of uranium from ores containing brannerite. The leaching behaviour of brannerite in sulphate media under moderate temperature conditions was investigated and compared with its relative leachability in alternative acid and alkaline systems. The feed and the leached residues were characterized by XRD and SEM-EDX techniques. Brannerite dissolutions of up to 95 % after 5 hours of leaching in ferric sulphate media, up to 89 % in ferric chloride media under similar conditions, and up to 82 % in 24 hours in sodium carbonate media were obtained. Since alkaline leaching was considered promising for acid-consuming ores, leaching was repeated with a high-carbonate brannerite-bearing ore, with comparable extractions. Mineralogical characterization showed that altered and amorphous regions are a regular feature of brannerite, and that pitting is typically observed on the surface of the leached grains. The leaching results, coupled with mineralogical data, showed that the uranium and titanium in brannerite generally dissolve congruently, with faster dissolution of the altered and amorphous regions in the brannerite grains than of the crystalline regions.

40|$|The mineral <b>liberation</b> <b>size</b> of {{run of mine}} ores has {{dramatically}} reduced over recent years. As a result, the demand for fine grinding {{which is the most}} energy-intensive form of grinding has markedly increased in the minerals industry. Furthermore, the fine grinding costs increase exponentially with decreasing product particle size. As a result of the increased energy requirement for fine grinding, it is desirable to optimise fine grinding processes such as stirred media milling (ie IsaMill) to enhance energy efficiency, throughput and the product fineness. In the present study, the influence of slurry rheology, grinding media type and grinding media-to-feed size ratio on energy efficiency in a pilotscale IsaMill was investigated under certain industrially relevant pulp processing conditions. It was shown that a critical rheological state existed, below which the energy required to achieve an 80 per cent passing (ie P 80) 20 μm product size was unaffected by shear rheology (ie apparent viscosity and shear yield stress) whilst above which the grinding energy required increased dramatically with increasing shear rheology. Colorado River sand (3. 35 mm) showed higher energy efficiency than MT 1 ceramic media (2. 5 mm) for a target P 80 of 20 μm in the solids concentration range of 38 to 55 per cent by weight, but the former experienced more than four times the wear rate of the later. The high wear rate of the Colorado River sand may be due to its much lower hardness. For feeds with an 80 per cent passing (ie F 80) 70 to 110 μm, 2. 0 or 2. 5 mm MT 1 media appeared to be more energy efficient than 3. 5 mm MT 1 media whilst a media-to-feed size ratio of 41 to 53 is applicable for ~ 50 μm (ie F 80) feeds for effi cient grinding...|$|E

Three ores have been studied - Bahariya and Aswan from Egypt and Frodingham ironstone from U. K. The iron in the Bahariya iron ore is mainly as hematite and goethite. The gangue minerals are halite, gypsum, barytes, quartz and calcite. Iron content is between 49. 8 to 63. 2 % and phosphorus 0. 14 to 0. 34 %. The phosphorus occurs as very fine particles of apatite which are distributed throughout the ore. Removal of the phosphorus would require very fine grinding followed by acid leaching. Aswan iron ore is an oolitic iron ore; the iron content between 41 - 57 % and phosphorus content 0. 1 to 2. 9 %. It is mainly hematitic with variable quantities of quartz, apatite and small amount of clay minerals. In the oolitic iron ore beds, apatite occurs in the hematite matrix; filling in the pores of the oolithic surfaces, or as matrix cementing the ooliths with the hematite grains. In sandstone claybeds the distribution of the apatite is mainly in the matrix.

Upon addition of non-coordinating solvents, coordinated THF is rapidly liberated, producing unsolvated, dimeric complexes {{of the general}} formula [Ln(p-TolForm) 3] 2 [Ln = La (La 1), Ce (Ce 2), Nd (Nd 3 a), Sm (Sm 4 a) ], containing rare μ- 1 κ(N,N') : 2 κ(N,N') formamidinate ligands bridging between the two metal centres. Such binding is unprecedented in rare-earth N,N'-diarylformamidinate chemistry, and is generally uncommon in formamidinate or amidinate coordination chemistry. This tendency for THF <b>liberation</b> is metal <b>size</b> dependent since the smaller lutetium analogue [Lu(p-TolForm) 3 (thf) ] (Lu 5) remains solvated with a seven coordinate monomeric structure. The dimeric species Sm 4 a is cleaved by treatment with Ph 3 PO, N,N'-bis(2, 6 -difluorophenyl) formamidine (DFFormH), or [K(p-TolForm) (18 -Crown- 6) ] producing [Sm(p-TolForm) 3 (Ph 3 PO) 2] (Sm 4 b), [Sm(DFForm) 2 (p-TolForm) (thf) 2] (Sm 4 c), and the charge separated [K(18 -Crown- 6) ][Sm(p-TolForm) 4] (Sm 4 e) respectively, the last being the first complex with a discrete [Ln(ArForm) 4]– ion...|$|R
40|$|Many gold {{treatment}} plants have sulphides and coarse particle gangue components that contain gold in their tailings (cyanide leach residues and flotation tailings). Coarse and very fine liberated gold {{may also be}} present in some tailings streams. Two issues usually govern the economics of recovering additional gold from gold occluded in sulphide and gangue particles. The liberation characteristics of the gold in the sulphide and coarse gangue (gold <b>liberation</b> versus grind <b>size)</b> is {{the first and most}} important of the two. If fine grinding can liberate a reasonable amount of the gold, then the next important issue is how effectively these two constituents can be concentrated. Flotation will achieve high sulphide recovery but is usually costly. Selectivity is also an issue because of entrainment. Continuous centrifugal gravity concentration offers a viable solution to the recovery of both sulphides and coarse gangue however selectivity is also likely to be a problem. The possibility of improving concentrate grade by using a Falcon B separator was investigated. This paper describes a program of test work carried out on a gold leach tailings using a laboratory Falcon "B" separator. The program involved three different bowl angles: 10, 12 and 14 degrees and two bowl speeds (giving 250 and 350 G accelerations). A number of tests were also performed on samples that had free gold present to ascertain the size-by-size recovery of gold in these samples...|$|R
40|$|The results {{reported}} were obtained on a meteoric eucrite sample called Millbillillie Sample no. 173. Optical microscopy {{studies of the}} sample showed it to consist of ilmenite, troilite, and transparent gangue. The transparent gangue consisted of feldspar (anorthite), pyroxenes, olivines, and opaques. Troilite was present in minor quantities. Screen assay analyses of the 30, 100, 200, and 400 US mesh screen fractions showed that minor concentration of titanium occurred in the 200 x 400 and - 400 mesh screen fractions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of the bulk sample showed {{the presence of a}} variety of ilmenite grains, ranging from 50 microns down to less than 1 micron without any evidence of liberation. Electron Diffraction Scans (EDS) confirmed the ratio of Fe to Ti in the ilmenite grains. Dry magnetic separation in a Frantz Isodynamic Separator was found to be effective only at sizes finer than 150 microns (100 US mesh) and more so at 200 mesh (74 microns). In each case, dedusting of the sample to remove - 400 mesh (- 0. 037 microns) fines was required. <b>Liberation</b> <b>size</b> was determined to be 200 mesh and finer. The highest grade concentrate assaying 3. 45 percent Ti was produced by magnetic separation of the - 200 + 400 mesh screen fraction assaying 0. 44 Ti (from a - 30 mesh sample) at a current setting of 0. 35 AMP. This concentrate contained 21. 2 percent of the Ti values in the screen fraction with 2. 72 weight percent of feed to test. The results can be projected to a sample stage ground to - 200 mesh. Magnetic separation of the 200 + 400 mesh (- 0. 074 + 0. 037 microns) should produce a concentrate accounting for 1. 41 weight percent of the feed. This concentrate will analyze 3. 45 percent Ti and contain 10. 3 percent of the Ti values in the feed. By changing the Frantz Magnetic Separator settings, a lower grade concentrate analyzing 0. 98 percent Ti can be produced at an increased recovery of 25. 4 percent. The concentrate weight will be 11. 7 percent of the feed. It must be emphasized that improved grades and recoveries can be obtained with the - 400 mesh fines. However, beneficiation of these extremely fine materials is not possible in a practical process scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} mineral liberation is {{important}} for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore <b>liberation</b> (particle <b>size</b> distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split {{from the rest of the}} ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness...|$|R

Precondition is physical <b>liberation</b> in coarse <b>size</b> ranges (~10 - 300 mm) to make physical separation possible.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 116 - 119. In South Africa, ever {{increasing}} quantities of fine (- 0, 5 mm) coal are being produced {{as a result}} of the increased use of mechanised mining methods. Very few mines beneficiate the fines; in most cases they are discarded. However the fine size of this material suggests that it should be well liberated, with the potential to produce a low ash product. This thesis forms part of an ongoing research program examining the use of flotation to beneficiate coal fines to produce a low ash product. Coal is a highly heterogeneous material, consisting of a number of both organic (maceral) and inorganic (mineral) components with different physical and technological properties. Therefore in order to evaluate and interpret flotation results, an understanding of the liberation characterist ics of both the organic and inoganic components is required. This thesis presents a liberation study on fine coal from the Greenside Colliery, a typical colliery in the Witbank Coalfield which is the most important source of South African low ash coal. The study was performed by mining a run of mine coal sample to varying degrees of fineness (from 30 % finer than 150 micron to 90 % finer than 150 micron), screening, and assessing the <b>liberation</b> of each <b>size</b> fraction. These results were compared to those obtained from a sample of naturally arising fines (thickener underflow). Liberation was assessed by float and sink analysis, and for this purpose a new technique was developed that enables rapid and accurate float and sink analysis of coal down to a few micron in size. Petrographic analyses were performed to determine the liberation of the organic coal components...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{the mineral}} {{processing}} industry, comminution circuits contain slurries {{composed of a}} mixture of particles of varying degrees of <b>liberation</b> and <b>size.</b> Hydrocyclones are commonly used to classify these particles. If the classification stage is not efficient, both grinding and flotation cannot be optimised or operated efficiently. Ores that are mined in industry contain metals of varying specific gravity, which makes recovery of the desired metal challenging. This study focussed {{on the effect of}} the hydrocyclone spigot to vortex finder diameter ratio, termed as the cone ratio, solids concentration and viscosity on the classification of two dual density ores. The rheological characteristic of the overflow was also evaluated. A UG 2 ore (Upper Group), which consists mainly of silicates, and chromite, and an iron ore, containing mainly iron and silicates, were used as feed material. The UG 2 test work was carried out on a University of Cape Town (UCT) 4 inch Multotec cyclone, while the iron ore test work was carried out on an Anglo-American 4 inch Krebs cyclone. The cyclone performance was assessed using the corrected cut size, water recovery to the underflow, sharpness of separation and feed throughput. The rheological characterisation of both the UG 2 and iron ore were carried out using an AR (ARES-G 2) 1000 EX vane rheometer. The results obtained indicated that the cyclone cone ratio, feed solids concentration and viscosity influence the cyclone performance. For the UG 2 it was observed that as the cone ratio increased the cut size decreased and levelled off at a cone ratio of 1. However, for the iron ore it was observed that the cut size increased with an increase in the cone ratio, until it reached a peak at a cone ratio of approximately 0. 68, before decreasing. The water recovery to the underflow increased with cone ratio and solids concentration and for both ore types. However it was observed that the water recovery was more sensitive to the cone ratio within the range of conditions investigated. The sharpness of separation for the UG 2 ore increased with cone ratio for all solids concentrations investigated and reached a peak at a cone ratio of approximately 1 then decreased. The sharpness of separation for the iron ore illustrated different trends at different feed solids concentration. Between 10 and 20 wt. % feed solids concentration the sharpness of separation for iron ore was fairly constant, while at 50 wt. % solids concentration the sharpness of separation increased with cone ratio and then levelled off at a cone ratio of 0. 67. An increase in the volumetric throughput with cone ratio was observed for both ore types. Rheological characterization revealed Bingham plastic behaviour for both ore types. An increase in the feed viscosity led to an increase in the cut size, water recovery and sharpness of separation for both UG 2 and iron ore. A comparison of the results with a semi mechanistic model revealed a good fit for the volumetric throughput, water recovery and viscosity. However, the sharpness of separation and cut size had more scatter. The standard error for the sharpness of separation model fit was 21 % for UG 2 and 23 % for iron ore while the error for the cut size was 41 % for the UG 2 ore and 43 % for the iron ore. It was recommended that for future work, test work should be carried at a constant pressure in order to assess purely the effect of cone ratio. Furthermore, a coarser ore should be used in order to evaluate the effect of cone ratio and feed viscosity on the individual deportment of the prevalent components in the dual density ore types investigated by carrying out assays...|$|R
40|$|Many {{particle}} properties {{critical to}} the flotation process originate from the comminution stage. A {{better understanding of how}} these properties are affected by the methods of particle size reduction used will help determine whether current strategies for comminuting ores can be modified to further enhance particle floatabilities. This thesis investigates how different comminution mechanisms affect the properties of ore and mineral particles and assesses how changes to these properties subsequently affect flotation performance downstream. Three ores were selected for this study: Northparkes (a low-grade, copper porphyry ore); Ernest Henry (an iron-oxide hosted copper-gold ore); and Century (a high-grade strataform zinc ore). These were each comminuted to various particle size distributions using a hammer mill and a piston-die compression unit (simulating the breakage mechanisms used by high pressure grinding rolls). Progeny particles were then characterised using the JKMRC’s mineral liberation analyser (MLA) on a size-by-size basis. It was found that size-by-size liberation properties were independent of both the mechanism used to comminute the ore samples, as well as the final size distribution of the progeny particles. This was observed for both valuable and gangue mineral phases. Variations in the liberation properties of a mineral in a given size fraction were explained in terms of the effect of mineral grade upon the statistical uncertainties of liberation measurements. Rather than being dependent on the method of breakage used to comminute an ore, liberation properties were instead found to be dependent on the mechanical properties of associated mineral phases. Where large differences existed between the mechanical properties of associated minerals, the “harder” mineral was found to be conserved during the breakage process, deporting directly to high-grade <b>liberation</b> classes upon <b>size</b> reduction without forming composite particles. These effects were not observed for “softer” minerals. The mechanism of comminution used was not found to have any effect on the liberation properties of the discharge particles. However, relationships were found between the shape properties of particles (quantified using the MLA) and the breakage devices from which they were discharged. Samples comminuted in the hammer mill were found to be comparatively more round than those discharged from the piston-die compression unit which, conversely, were more angular. This was attributed to rebreakage events during the hammer mill grinding process whereby topographical features on particle surfaces (such as sharp edges and corners) were chipped away, resulting in the production of round, spherical particles. The effect of particle angularity on flotation performance was subsequently tested by floating sized, fully liberated chalcopyrite particles that were comminuted in either the hammer mill or piston-die compression unit, and retrospectively analysing the angularity properties of the timed concentrates. It was found that, in the absence of collector, angular chalcopyrite particles exhibited faster flotation kinetics than comparatively round particles, likely due to the enhancement of particle-bubble adhesion mechanics as hypothesised by past studies. Additionally, surface chemistry analysis conducted in collaboration with the Ian Wark Research Institute also showed that the comparatively angular concentrates also had higher degrees of surface coverage by hydrophobic polysulphide species, and this is also likely to have contributed to their faster flotation kinetics. The results of this thesis clearly show that mineral liberation properties cannot be controlled by the method of breakage used. However, it is expected that the results will aid in the development of both empirical as well as fundamental mineral liberation models. Additionally, it is shown that a potential method of enhancing particle floatability during the comminution stage is through the manipulation of particle shape properties. This has important implications for the development of property-based flotation models {{as well as for the}} eventual integration of comminution and flotation models...|$|R
