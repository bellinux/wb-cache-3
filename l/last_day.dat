40|$|Background: To {{improve the}} quality of {{end-of-life}} care in geriatric hospital wards we developed the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life. It consists of 1) the Care Guide for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life, 2) supportive documentation and 3) an implementation guide. The aim of this study is (1) to determine the feasibility of implementing the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life in the acute geriatric hospital setting and (2) to explore the health care professionals' perceptions {{of the effects of the}} Care Programme on end-of-life care. Methods: A phase 2 mixed methods study according with the MRC framework was performed in the acute geriatric ward of Ghent University Hospital between 1 April and 30 September 2013. During the implementation process a mixed methods approach was used including observation, interviews and the use of a quantitative process evaluation tool. This tool measured the success of implementation using several indicators, such as whether a steering group was formed, whether and how much of the health care staff was informed and trained and how many patients were cared for according to the Care Guide for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life. Results: The process evaluation tool showed that implementing the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life in the geriatric ward was successful and thus feasible; a steering group was formed consisting of two facilitators, health care staff of the geriatric ward were trained in using the Care Guide for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life which was subsequently introduced onto the ward and approximately 57 % of all dying patients were cared for according to the Care Guide for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life. With regard to health care professionals' perceptions, nurses and physicians experienced the Care Guide for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life as improving the overall documentation of care, improving communication among health care staff and between health care staff and patient/family and improving the quality of end-of-life care. Barriers to implementing the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life successfully are, among others, difficulties with the content of the documents used within the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life and the low participation rate of physicians in the training sessions and audits. Conclusions: Results of this mixed methods study suggest that implementing the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life is feasible and that it has favorable effects on end-of-life care as reported by health care professionals. Based on the identified barriers during the implementation process, we were able to make recommendations for future implementation and further refine the Care Programme for the <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> of Life before implementing it in a phase 3 cluster randomized controlled trial for the evaluation of its effectiveness...|$|R
