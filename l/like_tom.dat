When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi.

500|$|... "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues" [...] was {{recorded}} on August 2, 1965, at Columbia Studios in New York, {{the same day}} Dylan recorded [...] "Ballad of a Thin Man", [...] "Highway 61 Revisited" [...] and [...] "Queen Jane Approximately", three other songs that would appear on Highway 61 Revisited. However, [...] "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues" [...] took more attempts to perfect than the other songs recorded that day; it wasn't until take 16 that Dylan and his band captured on tape the version that was released on the album. The backing musicians on the take that was used on Highway 61 Revisited were Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar, Al Kooper on Hohner Pianet, Paul Griffin on piano, Harvey Brooks on bass guitar and Bobby Gregg on drums.|$|E

500|$|... "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues" [...] has six verses but no chorus. The song's lyrics {{describe}} a nightmare {{vision of the}} narrator's experience in Juarez, Mexico, in which he encounters sickness, despair, prostitutes, saints, shady women, corrupt authorities, alcohol and drugs, before finally deciding to return to New York City. The lyrics incorporate literary references to Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano, [...] Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Jack Kerouac's Desolation Angels, while the song's title references Arthur Rimbaud's [...] "My Bohemian Life (Fantasy)". William Ruhlmann of the AllMusic website has described the song as a comic tour de force and music journalist Toby Creswell included it on his list of the 1001 greatest songs of all time.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues" [...] {{continues}} {{the theme of}} road weariness from the album's previous song, [...] "Highway 61 Revisited." [...] The singer finds himself in Juarez, Mexico, at Easter time, amidst sickness, despair, whores and saints. While there, he encounters corrupt authorities and women of dubious character, named in the song as [...] "Saint Annie" [...] and [...] "sweet Melinda", before seeking succor in drugs and alcohol. The song establishes a nightmare vision as the singer is influenced by gravity, negativity, sex, drugs, drink, illness, remorse and memory. In the song's final verse, the singer decides he has had enough and finds the means to leave it all behind and head back to New York City, where things may be better. Author Paul Williams has noted that scene and situation are combined into a gorgeous evocation of muddied consciousness in [...] "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues", without ever resolving into {{a clear picture of}} what the song is about. Despite the sordid details of the singer's experiences in Juarez, the lyrics maintain a sense of humor, and William Ruhlmann of the AllMusic website considers the song a comic tour de force.|$|E

500|$|Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot covered [...] "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues" [...] in 1965 in {{a version}} that reached number 3 on Canada's {{national}} RPM singles chart, and number 8 on Toronto's CHUM Chart.

Nina Simone also covered it in 1969 on her To Love Somebody album. Nina Simone's version differs considerably in tone from Dylan's: while Dylan's version is sympathetic, if sneering, towards the foolish subject, Simone's version is an intense, first-person account of illusions being crushed, until she is finally helpless {{in the hands of}} fate.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Just <b>Like</b> <b>Tom</b> Thumb's Blues" [...] {{consists}} of no chorus, but six verses, varied {{by a handful}} of chords and Dylan's vocal emphasis. Keyboards, drums and vocals provide texture, while Mike Bloomfield plays Latin Americanesque fills on electric guitar. The keyboard parts in particular make innovative use of two different pianos, with Al Kooper playing an electric Hohner Pianet and Paul Griffin adding a bar room feel on tack piano. In all but the final verse, the even lines rhyme and the odd lines are unrhymed.

In this song, critics have heard literary references to Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano, Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Jack Kerouac's Desolation Angels. The backing musicians, Bobby Gregg on drums, Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar, and two pianists, Paul Griffin on tack piano and Al Kooper on Hohner Pianet, produce a mood that, for Gill, perfectly complements the [...] "enervated tone" [...] of the lyrics.
