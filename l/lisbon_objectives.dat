The percentages of GDP spent on academic research in different nations are significantly correlated to historical contingencies such as the percentage of researchers in the population.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in-depth and {{critical analysis of}} the current Belgian fiscal regime towards business research and development (R&D) expenditures. The paper clearly shows that what matters the most is the way a policy decision is implemented. In this respect the current R&D tax credit scheme is subject to several drawbacks. The first one is the very low level of support for ‘additional’ researchers. The second one is the ‘nominative’ aspect of each tax credit: the deduction is allowed for well-defined employees. The third main drawback is the non-permanent characteristic of the tax credit. Once a deduction is allowed for an employee, it must be validated for each subsequent year. These drawbacks {{are associated with a}} high level of complexity and a heavy administrative burden, for a weak or zero effectiveness of the scheme.

This evidence is the basis for an analysis and better understanding of the factors that influence present EU-policymaking in the field of sustainable transport and leads to the conclusion that there is a danger that the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>objective</b> (i. e. “competitive Europe”) prevails on the Gothenburg objective (i. e. “sustainable Europe”) and that this has a negative effect on the implementation of a European sustainable transport policy.
