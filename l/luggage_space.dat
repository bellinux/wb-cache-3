5|$|As {{part of the}} {{settlement}} during the relocation of the London terminus, two new hearse vans {{were given to the}} LNC by the LSWR in 1899. These new hearse vans were longer, and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each, for a total of 24 coffins per van. These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway. One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950. The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of <b>luggage</b> <b>space,</b> and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the hearse vans were not used and the coffins carried in the <b>luggage</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} LNC's {{business}} was now operated by road, an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC {{to make use of}} SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals, subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR (British Railways after 1948) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train. Although one of the LNC's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used, and coffins were carried in the <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> of the SR's coaches. Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations, or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the new engines, the modernisation programme also included such improvements as: aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets (sharklets), weight savings, a new aircraft cabin with larger hand <b>luggage</b> <b>spaces,</b> and an improved air purification system. Customers will {{have a choice of}} either the CFM International LEAP-1A or the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrically}} operated sliding steel sunroof was optional in 1962, the second automobile {{model in the}} world to have this option. The styling offered more interior and cargo room than the original Karmann Ghia. It featured an electric clock, three <b>luggage</b> <b>spaces,</b> built-in fog lights, round tail lights, upper and lower dash pads, door pads, and long padded armrests. It was the fastest production VW model of its day.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1983 the Hijet Jumbo appeared, a high-roofed {{extended}} cab pickup with {{a shorter}} bed. This meant {{that there was}} space for more comfortable seats, with considerable more travel and folding seatbacks. The resulting rear compartment offered small <b>luggage</b> <b>spaces,</b> a flat-folding passenger seat, and a small luggage rack above. The two-wheel Jumbo was available with a fifth gear, as were some versions of the Atrai passenger van. There was also a Hijet Climber series (two- or four-wheel drive), these were fitted with bigger off-road tires and a limited-slip differential.|$|R
25|$|The type {{underwent}} {{testing in}} July 2015, {{and began to}} enter passenger service in February 2016. The new trains have 12 carriages compared with 10 for the Class 442, and also feature additional <b>luggage</b> <b>space,</b> wireless internet connectivity and passenger service updates.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 until 1988 the Picton Express and the Greymouth and West Coast Expresses {{shared a}} pool of 12 former second class NZR 56-foot {{carriages}} and guard's vans with six 50-ft wooden box wagons/parcel vans, all painted bright red with wall-to-wall carpet, fluorescent strip lights and later, a new design of seat from Addington Workshops. Cars with <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> seated 46, passenger-only cars seated 52.|$|E
25|$|Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, which throws an area into {{darkness}} that cannot be penetrated by wandlight or any magical means, although the effect wears {{off in a}} few minutes. Draco Malfoy uses it to avoid members of Dumbledore's Army in Half-Blood Prince.

5000|$|Among {{its many}} {{features}} is a Hamilton [...] "celestial time-zone clock permitting actual flight-type navigation." [...] The acrylic glass bubble canopy {{also served as}} a sound chamber for the car's high fidelity radio and record player. The car included air conditioning and wrap-around bumper protection that was matched to the height of full-sized car bumpers. The 6 ft width of the concept car was much greater than contemporary passenger automobiles and allowed for extra interior room, as well as storage and <b>luggage</b> <b>spaces</b> that included six pieces of matched integrated luggage.|$|R
50|$|One {{of first}} RR cars was Tatra 77 of 1934, the first serial-produced {{aerodynamic}} car, designed by Hans Ledwinka. Tatra used this layout until end of production of T700 in 1999. In case of T613 and T700 Tatra used layout with engine above rear axle, which reduced some disadvantages of RR layout. Mercedes-Benz also produced several models of RR cars in this period, {{starting with the}} 130H (1934). The radical 1930s Tatra format (air-cooled, rear engine and streamlined, teardrop design) was an influence on Ferdinand Porsche's 'People's Car' (Volkswagen) for Adolf Hitler. As well as being the most produced car ever, it set a trend for RR small cars that lasted well into the 1960s. The final form of the RR Volkswagen was the Type 3 of 1961, which flattened the engine (or 'pancake'), allowing for <b>luggage</b> <b>spaces</b> front and rear. A similar format (albeit with front-mounted radiator for liquid cooling rather than air) has been revived with the 2014 Renault Twingo III and second-generation Smart Forfour.|$|R
50|$|The Airport Narita rapid {{services}} were introduced from 20 April 1991 {{to supplement the}} popular Narita Express limited express services which commenced the previous month. Initially, 16 services ran in each direction daily, using 113 series EMU formations based at ÅŒfuna and Makuhari depots. Trains including SaRo 124 Green (first class) cars were allocated to these services, as these had expanded <b>luggage</b> storage <b>space.</b>|$|R
25|$|The ARV Super2 has {{received}} favourable reviews which {{describe it as}} an aircraft with excellent visibility that is pleasant to fly. The small wing area and the fairly high wing loading produces handling that is responsive but stable. A drawback is the shortage of <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> which makes the ARV unsuitable for touring. The second prototype, G-STWO, has a fuselage luggage compartment aft of the fuel tank which is accessed from the starboard aside, but no other ARVs have this feature.|$|E
25|$|The cabin of the Tu-154, {{although}} of {{the same}} six-abreast seating layout, gives the impression of an oval interior, with a lower ceiling than is common on Boeing and Airbus airliners. The passenger cabin accommodates 128 passengers in a two-class layout and 164 passengers in single-class layout, and up to 180 passengers in high-density layout. The layout can be modified to {{what is called a}} winter version where some seats are taken out and a wardrobe is installed for passenger coats. The passenger doors are smaller than on its Boeing and Airbus counterparts. <b>Luggage</b> <b>space</b> in the overhead compartments is very limited.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 15 November 1999 a new train entered service, made up {{of seven}} (later eight) British Rail Mark 2 cars and the second former Southerner modular 11kW power and baggage van, with 90kW {{generator}} and larger <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> made up from the middle and expanded non-handbrake end compartments. The new cars are about three metres longer than the older cars and more spacious inside, with more headroom, full air-conditioning, 60 seats per car (28 in the servery car), and twin power sockets {{at the foot of}} each pair of seats. Seating arrangement is both alcove and airline-style, using their British Rail InterCity 72 seats. Since October 2016, fire suppressed DFB class locomotives have been assigned to the service.|$|E
50|$|The very spacious {{interior}} of the R42 contains luxurious leather trims and neat Wilton carpets. Visibility is also very good compared to other mid-engined sportscar of that time, even of today. There is {{a good amount of}} <b>luggage</b> and storage <b>space</b> as well.|$|R
5000|$|The hybrid {{includes}} one {{electric motor}} and two clutches {{to allow the}} 3.5L V6 ( [...] 258 lbft Nm) gas engine and electric motor to drive the rear wheels simultaneously. The lithium-ion battery pack {{will come from the}} Infiniti Essence. The VQ35HR 3.5 L V6 Hybrid utilizes the Atkinson cycle. The electric motor, installed in parallel between the engine and the transmission, produces [...] from 1.3kWh lithium-ion batteries that are expected to have a service life of 10 years. The batteries are installed upright behind the rear seats. The main sacrifices are that the <b>luggage</b> compartment <b>space</b> is reduced, the hybrid's rear seats are fixed in place and cannot fold down, and all-wheel drive is not available.|$|R
5000|$|New {{construction}} and renovations are presently underway {{in the terminal}} area. Once fully completed, the new main terminal will be known as Terminal 1 (T1). The T1 building is shaped like an [...] "h" [...] and is divided in two piers or concourses: the international one to the north side and the domestic pier/concourse on the south side. The new terminal has three airline lounges (operated by LATAM, Avianca and American Airlines) in the international concourse, {{as well as a}} food court plaza and several retail stores and cafÃ©s in the duty-free area. There are also car rental facilities, ticket counters, ATM's, telephones, restrooms, <b>luggage</b> storage <b>space</b> and even a small casino. The terminal has complimentary Wi-Fi service.|$|R
25|$|On Wednesday, 25 August 1993, the {{southbound}} Southerner, {{consisting of}} a DF class locomotive, passenger car with <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> at one end, servery car, day car and the second of three TranzAlpine and Coastal Pacific power-baggage vans, was hit at Rolleston by a concrete mixing truck. The bowl of the truck bounced off all three passenger cars, and ripped two wide open. Three people were killed, {{one of whom was}} Louise Cairns, daughter of former New Zealand cricketer Lance Cairns and sister of then-representative Chris Cairns. Chris Cairns has since become a campaigner for safety around the rail corridor and level-crossings through the Chris Cairns Foundation, which later became known as TrackSAFE Foundation New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{trains are}} usually all seated and provide <b>luggage</b> <b>space,</b> {{although}} they seldom {{have all the}} amenities of inter-city trains such as a buffet or dining car. Since their invention, the distinction between regional and long-distance rail has also been {{the use of multiple}} unit propulsion, with longer distance trains being locomotive hauled, although development of trains such as the British Rail Class 390 have blurred this distinction. Shorter regional rail services will still usually be operated exclusively by multiple units where they exist, which have a shorter range and operate at lower average speeds than services on Inter-city rail networks. Not using a locomotive also provides greater passenger capacity in the commuter role at peak periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertible}} roof is fully automatic â€” an unusual feature {{in such a}} small car â€” and can be opened partially {{to act as a}} sunroof whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini â€” it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the closed position, the rear roof section and luggage shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the <b>luggage</b> <b>space</b> easier. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; the rear window is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|E
25|$|The Vulcan railcars had a driver's {{compartment}} at each end, so {{they did}} not need to be turned at the terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments. In the mid-1950s the smaller compartment in each vehicle was reduced by 2 seats and replaced with a small guard's compartment, thus reducing the total number of passengers from 50 to 48. A <b>luggage</b> compartment had <b>space</b> for about 1 ton of luggage, and an onboard toilet was provided.|$|R
50|$|Nick then {{demonstrates}} his father's Dimensional Duplicator, a copy machine, to kill {{time while}} the crew searches for him. Wayne's youngest son, Adam, puts his pet mouse, Photon, in the copy machine and quickly multiplies (in an animation designed by Curious Pictures). This {{does not go}} smoothly, and the audience ends up screaming with the loose mice running under their seats (which is really leg ticklers underneath the seats). To scare the mice away, Nick decides to use Wayne's Holo Pet Generator, which first {{takes the form of}} a cat, which then transforms into a lion, by accidentally giving the machine too much power, in the audience's faces (designed by Kleiser-Walczak). While the demonstrations go awry, Wayne manages to use his shrinking machine to return himself back to normal size. He brings out the machine to demonstrate its uses by shrinking a family's <b>luggage,</b> saving <b>space</b> and money when traveling, hoping they will fit comfortably in the palm of his hand.|$|R
25|$|Most {{cars are}} {{designed}} to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers {{in the front and}} three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their <b>luggage</b> or cargo <b>space</b> has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, and minivan.|$|R
25|$|Gatwick Airport {{railway station}} opened in June 1958. Initially the rail service was {{provided}} entirely by London to Brighton stopping services, but more trains {{began to call}} {{with the introduction of}} the summer timetable in June 1958. One of the key elements of this was the extension of Three Bridges to Bognor Regis stopping services to start and terminate at London Victoria. These trains would run through a reversible platform at Gatwick where a portion would detach and wait in the platform for passengers until the next up train from Bognor Regis was attached and the train would depart for Victoria. For this service British Rail used a small batch of seven Class 402 2HALs in order to work with the trains used on the Bognor Regis services, suitable for airport link use because of their larger <b>luggage</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Zora Arkus-Duntov {{and other}} GM {{engineers}} had become fascinated with mid and rear-engine designs. It {{was during the}} Corvair's development that Duntov took the mid/rear-engine layout to its limits in the CERV I concept. The Chevrolet Experimental Research Vehicle was a lightweight, open-wheel single-seat racer. A rear-engined Corvette was briefly considered during 1958â€“60, progressing {{as far as a}} full-scale mock-up designed around the Corvair's entire rear-mounted power package, including its complicated air-cooled flat-six {{as an alternative to the}} Corvette's usual water-cooled V-8. By the fall of 1959, elements of the Q-Corvette and the Sting Ray Special racer would be incorporated into experimental project XP-720, which was the design program that led directly to the production 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. The XP-720 sought to deliver improved passenger accommodation, more <b>luggage</b> <b>space,</b> and superior ride and handling over previous Corvettes.|$|E
25|$|During 1996, the {{original}} TranzAlpine observation car was thoroughly overhauled and air-conditioning installed, and this car, {{along with the}} two former Lynx Express cars and the car with <b>luggage</b> <b>space,</b> were permanently assigned to this train. The backpackers' car was later replaced by the only former Southerner (later Northerner) car to escape rebuilding as a panorama car or scrapping. It was fitted with 47 of {{the same type of}} Addington seat that it had had in the mid to late 1980s, all seats facing toward the two centre tables, one {{on both sides of the}} aisle of the car, and became the new backpackers' car. The former Connoisseur car, thoroughly refurbished the year before with air conditioning installed, assumed regular duty. The Lynx Express baggage van and later the first of the NIMT baggage vans were also allocated to this service. Later, the second backpacker car had air conditioning installed, and in late 2003, was transferred north for the Overlander or Wairarapa Connection'.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} ÄŒezeta is unique amongst scooters. It is unusually long for a two-wheeled vehicle at 2 metres and has a distinctive torpedo-shaped body with full length running boards and a long seat that lifted to reveal a substantial <b>luggage</b> compartment, using <b>space</b> that in most scooters is occupied by the fuel tank. This made the ÄŒezeta ideal for two people and popular with young Czechs and their lovers. The front mudguard is fixed to the body and fully streamlined into the leg shields. The fuel tank is positioned above the front wheel, with the headlight fitted into a recess and a luggage rack on the flat top surface.|$|R
5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, <b>luggage</b> storage <b>space,</b> and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|R
5000|$|The GM Truck and Coach PD-4103 was {{the last}} {{in a series of}} low-budget [...] "conversion" [...] parlor coach models which were, in actuality, based upon the basic Yellow Coach/GM Truck and Coach transit bus models which first {{appeared}} in 1940. Favored GM customer Greyhound Lines had already been given a near monopoly on the PDA-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Old Silversides" [...] models, which were in part designed by Greyhound themselves. In order to answer complaints from arch competitor Trailways and other independent operators about being locked out from purchasing the PD-3751 model, GM simply took their existing 96" [...] wide, 35' long suburban transit model, added more <b>luggage</b> bay <b>space</b> underneath, added sliding highway-style side windows, added reclining seating, and shortened the overhung portion of the front end by moving the front axle forward using a new front end from the wartime Yellow Coach [...] "Victory Cruiser" [...] model. This was the PD-4101, which appeared shortly after the end of World War II. GM created the model PD-4102 by restyling its PD-4101 in 1950 using a distinctive new front end with the destination sign below the windshield and a new, restyled rear end which used a full-width engine access door, an aluminum alloy bumper to match that on the front and a [...] "post-less" [...] picture window in the rear which used biradial curved glass (a new development by GM supplier, Libbey-Owens-Ford), replacing the divided flat transit bus-type rear windows found on the PD-4101. The front end styling job on the PD-4102 was reactionary, as it closely mimicked the striking styling of the IC41 intercity bus built by ACF-Brill Corporation in 1947-1954, a model bought in large quantities by Trailways to compete with Greyhound Lines' successful and much more efficient PD-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Silversides" [...] models. Mechanically and electrically, however, the PD-4102 was mostly a carry-over model from the PD-4101, including the optional refrigeration unit for air conditioning which used a four cylinder Continental [...] "pony motor" [...] driving an Ingersoll-Rand [...] "oil-less" [...] rotary vane compressor rated at five tons, a unit identical to that used by the PDA-3501/PD-3751 for Greyhound Lines. Only 116 were built.|$|R
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple carburettors were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind the rear seat. To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from the rear seat. Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of <b>luggage</b> <b>space.</b> The rear lights and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market Fronte 360, complete with miles-per-hour speedo and uncovered sealed-beam headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The Fronte soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
500|$|Motoring {{journalists have}} been {{critical}} of its size, being too big for a two-seater with virtually no <b>luggage</b> <b>space,</b> too wide to fit through traffic restrictors or to drive comfortably on most roads. The very heavy unassisted steering and pedals, underwhelming brakes without ABS, poor directional stability and [...] "terrible visibility" [...] were also disliked.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} NZR had {{a need for}} new guards vans for new vans for both freight and {{moderately}} fast passenger and express freight services, to replace old and increasingly decrepit vans, most of the existing vans were built before 1946, including passenger express vans, post war construction being only two batches of 35/30 in 1955 and 1963-67.Cabinet works approval for made for the Van order on 15/5/73 and NZR GM T M Small made a second request for Cabinet Works Committee approval on 15/8/74, but no work was made on design until 1975 {{due to the fact}} the NZR design staff were preoccupied with design of the Wagons and the reconstruction of the Northerner express. The first order for 56 FM vans was approved in the last Cabinet meeting of the Rowling, Labour Government on 18/11/1975 for 4.32 million, officially on Treasury report 1624, 3.4 million being applied to the overseas constructed basic van imported from Japan They were built by Mitsubishi, and were the first all-steel vans. The body was composed of three modules that could be detached from the underframe: a central module, classed GM (guard's module), which contained the guard's office,five first class seats [...] and facilities; and two outer modules, classed LM (luggage module), for freight and luggage. The idea was that should a module become damaged in service it can be removed for repairs and replaced with another, allowing the van to return to service sooner than otherwise would have been the case. It was because of these modules that the vans were given the FM classification, as opposed to the traditional F designation given to all previous NZR guards vans. The FM also pioneered the X28020 bogie, now used under New Zealand's long-distance passenger fleet. The first batch was very well received by guards. Fifty-six were built, and in 1976 an order was placed for an additional 17. The vans were not however entirely appreciated as the passenger train crews on the large crewed prestige trains preferred the old 56 ft passenger vans and the <b>luggage</b> and van <b>space</b> on the Fm vans was not adequate for carriage and fast transfer of mail at parcels from express freight trains at intermediate stations requiring extra ZA vans having to be used for highly profitable mail and parcels on many North Island express freigths and the Northerner.|$|R

2500|$|The Class 220 Voyagers and Class 221 Super Voyagers {{underwent}} refurbishment at Bombardier Transportation's Derby Litchurch Lane Works in 2008/09.
