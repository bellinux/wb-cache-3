25|$|The {{first version}} of {{conventional}} PCI found in consumer desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33MHz bus clock and 5V signalling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one <b>locating</b> <b>notch</b> in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to preventing accidental insertion of 5V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of conventional PCI, called PCI-X (PCI Extended) operated at frequencies up to 133MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became {{the responsibility of the}} PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).|$|E

40|$|Traditionally {{raster scan}} plan is {{employed}} in eddy current testing for imaging flaws in components. Several parallel scans using a single probe {{are made and}} the acquired data is represented in the form an image to obtain, e. g. a comprehensive picture of a flaw in the imaged region. For imaging on large surfaces time for imaging is a constraint. We present a novel probe scan plan for rapid eddy current imaging of flaws. We demonstrate the performance of this scan plan in austenitic stainless steel plates for detection of flaws using a pancake type eddy current probe. We then compare its performance with the traditional raster scan plan {{and other types of}} scan plans based on rapidness, area coverage, POD, and step size for detection of 1000 randomly <b>located</b> <b>notches</b> in a stainless steel plate. Studies reveal that the proposed scan plan outperforms the other scan plans with single probe for rapid and reliable inspection of large surfaces of electrically conducting materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinctive}} brachiopod genus Notoconchidium {{is known}} from late Silurian, mostly sandy, shallow marine strata in Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Material from the Zeehan and Wynyard areas (Tasmania), the Whittlesea-Wallan and Heathcote areas (Victoria), and the Wangapeka River area (New Zealand), permits further insight into detailed aspects of morphology and {{relationships between the}} previously named species N. tasmaniense, N. florencense and N. thomasi. We conclude that N. thomasi is a junior synonym of N. tasmaniense, but N. florencense is retained as a separate species. New species described are N. talenti and N. argentium. The diamond-shaped septalium of Notoconchidium exhibits, depending {{on the degree of}} calcification, either an anteriorly located perforation interpreted as the surface end of a tube extending to the dorsal umbo, or a deep, anteriorly <b>located</b> <b>notch,</b> both presumably housing dorsal adjustor muscles.

40|$|AbstractTo {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of welding on fatigue crack growth, several geometrical configurations have been tested using notched specimens with <b>notch</b> <b>located</b> within base metal and welded joint. This methodology has shown that fatigue crack growth rate was similar for base metal and welded part for the ferritic stainless steel F 18 TNb (corresponding to AISI 441 or EN 1. 4509 grades) considering long crack. Whereas for short crack, the microstructure induced by the welding process was evidenced to drastically increase the resulting crack growth rate. The tested configurations have been systematically modeled by finite element analysis to obtain reliable shape function and SIF assessment for the chosen geometries. Then fatigue crack growth behavior is discussed {{on the basis of}} both SIF values and {{the influence of}} microstructure in crack path and crack growth rate...|$|R
