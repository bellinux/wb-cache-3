40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> {{structures}} play {{an important}} role in self-organization of drift wave turbulence. <b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> perturbations of plasma flow and magnetic field are spontaneously generated in generic electromagnetic drift wave turbulence via the action of Reynolds stress and electromotive force. Initial <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> perturbations are amplifed by positive feedback due to the modulations of wave packets by the shearing effect of the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> flow and/or by the perturbed <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> magnetic field. As a result, the propagation of small scale wave packets is accompanied by the instability of a low frequency, long wavelength components.

40|$|Abstract. Superparameterization is a {{multiscale}} numerical method wherein solutions of prog-nostic equations {{for small}} scale processes on local domains embedded within the computational grid of a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> model are computed {{and used to}} force the <b>large</b> <b>scales.</b> It was developed initially in the atmospheric sciences, but stands on its own as a nascent numerical method for the simulation of multiscale phenomena. Here we develop a stochastic version of superparameterization in a difficult one dimensional test problem involving self-similarly collapsing solitons, dispersive waves, and a tur-bulent inverse cascade of energy from small to <b>large</b> <b>scales.</b> We derive the nonlinear model equations by imposing a formal scale separation between resolved <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> and unresolved small scales; this allows the use of subdomains embedded within the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> grid to describe the local small scale processes. To decrease the computational cost, we make a systematic quasi-linear stochastic approximation of the nonlinear small scale equations and use the statistical mean of the nonlinear small scale forcing (the covariance) in the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> equations. The stochastic approximation al-lows the embedded domains to be formally infinite (unrealistically <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> are suppressed on the embedded domains). Further simplifications allow us to precompute the small scale forcing terms in the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> equations as functions of the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> variables only, which results in significan...|$|R

Fast growing horizontal low modes and fiducial vertical modes over a narrow range of wave numbers amplify these planar averaged fields in the MRI growth phase, before turbulence sets in. The <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> field growth requires linear fluctuations but not nonlinear turbulence (as defined by mode-mode coupling) and grows as a direct global mode of the MRI.
