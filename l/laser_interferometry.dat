25|$|OCT {{is based}} on low-coherence interferometry. In {{conventional}} interferometry with long coherence length (i.e., <b>laser</b> <b>interferometry),</b> interference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing {{to the use of}} broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (femtosecond lasers). White light {{is an example of a}} broadband source with lower power.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sensitive}} class of detector uses <b>laser</b> <b>interferometry</b> to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses. This allows the masses {{to be separated}} by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage {{is that it is}} sensitive {{to a wide range of}} frequencies (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is LIGO — the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana, one at the Hanford site in Richland, Washington and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to India. Each observatory has two light storage arms that are 4kilometers in length. These are at 90degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} compact <b>laser</b> {{feedback}} <b>interferometry</b> imaging system for concurrent reflectance confocal microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry. This system acquires both confocal reflectance and Doppler signals in a confocal architecture to image dynamic turbid media with higher contrast than a system operating in either modality, and is coherent in nature. In a confocal optical configuration, reflectance confocal microscopy provides information about scattering from within a small volume {{centered around the}} focal point of the confocal system, and laser Doppler flowmetry provides information about the velocity of moving scatterers within the same volume. Raster scanning the sample enables the concurrent creation of two images, containing independent information, from a well specified depth within the sample. Concurrent spatial mapping of these independent sensing modalities affords improvement in the capability of the imaging system by obtaining additional information from both morphological and functional features of the dynamic turbid medium, at depths penetrable by near-infrared lasers. We realize the idea using a <b>laser</b> feedback <b>interferometry</b> imaging system scanning a microfluidic channel which contains a dynamic turbid medium. We show the effectiveness of this integrated imager quantitatively through the improvement of the signal to background ratio of a combined (multiplication) image...|$|R
50|$|Since emitter and {{detector}} {{are traveling}} {{at the same}} speeds, Doppler effects cancel out, so the Sagnac effect does not involve the Doppler effect. In the case of ring <b>laser</b> <b>interferometry,</b> {{it is important to}} be aware of this. When the ring laser setup is rotating, the counterpropagating beams undergo frequency shifts in opposite directions. This frequency shift is not a Doppler shift, but is rather an optical cavity resonance effect, as explained below in Ring lasers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>interferometry</b> {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} {{in a range of}} sensing applications, including the measurement of vibration, displacement and velocity of objects. [...] These methods involve the mixing (or superposition) of coherent light waves. Typically, the light from a laser is split into two. Each beam follows a different path before being recombined. A detector is then used to measure the intensity of the light. The Michelson interferometer and Mach-Zehnder interferometers are examples of such systems.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to understand}} the reliability of Sn-Ag-Cu solder interconnects used in plastic ball grid array (PBGA) packages using microstructure evolution, <b>laser</b> moiré <b>interferometry</b> and finite-element modeling. A particle coarsening based microstructure evolution of the solder joint material during thermal excursions was studied for {{extended periods of time}} lasting for several months. The microstructure evolution and particle coarsening was quantified, and acceleration factors were determined between benign field-use conditions and accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) conditions for PBGA packages with different form factors and for two different lead-free solder alloys. A new technique using <b>laser</b> moiré <b>interferometry</b> was developed to assess the deformation behavior of Sn-Ag-Cu based solder joints during thermal excursions. This technique can used to estimate the fatigue life of solder joints quickly in a matter of few days instead of months and can be extended to cover a wide range of temperature regimes. Finite-element analysis (FEA) in conjunction with experimental data from the ATC for different lead-free PBGA packages was used to develop a fatigue life model {{that can be used to}} predict solder joint fatigue life for any PBGA package. The proposed model will be able to predict the mean number of cycles required for crack initiation and crack growth rate in a solder joint. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Sitaraman, Sures...|$|R
