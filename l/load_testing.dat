5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} mockup {{was completed in}} June 1945 by Factory No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for static <b>load</b> <b>testing.</b> This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to be reinforced, and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E

25|$|Stoney Creek Bridge (originally bridge number 26, now bridge 30), {{in front}} of Stoney Creek Falls, is built on a 4 chain (80m) radius curve and was {{designed}} by the government engineer John Gwynneth. The design is unique in Queensland, the curve being {{the only way to}} avoid tunnelling. By the end of 1887 the concrete foundations on which the wrought iron trestles (Phoenix columns) were erected were well underway. It is one of only two Queensland railway bridges constructed with wrought iron trestles, the other being Christmas Creek Bridge, further up the line. A visit to Cairns by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Henry Wylie Norman, in April 1890 was taken as an opportunity to inspect the construction works. A marquee, covering a banquet table and open to the waterfall, had been set up on the almost completed Stoney Creek Bridge with planks laid over the sleepers. There were no speeches due to the roar of the waterfall immediately behind the bridge. The bridge passed <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> on 30 June 1890.|$|E

40|$|Proof pile <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional proof test procedures are studied so that the value derived from proof tests can be maximized. Whether or not a proof test is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the proof test can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several <b>load</b> <b>test</b> parameters such as the number of <b>tests,</b> the <b>test</b> <b>load,</b> the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using proof <b>load</b> <b>tests.</b> A larger <b>test</b> <b>load</b> for proof <b>tests,</b> say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R

The test piles have 22 m of length and 0. 60 m of diameter, constructed in a sandy soil using a recoverable steel casing. Three piles were tested: i) two by dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> ii) and the other companion pile by static <b>load</b> <b>test.</b> The dynamic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> followed a procedure with two stages. Initially, a set of impacts with increasing falling height was applied. Afterwards the energy was kept constant for the maximum falling height. The records from the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> were interpreted using CASE and CAPWAP analyses. The soil-pile parameters obtained from CAPWAP analyses were used to simulate static soil-pile response. Soil non-linearity was considered by applying a stiffness reduction factor.
