25|$|In the Venezuelan llanos, the maguari stork is {{also found}} to nest in low, thick-trunked trees {{including}} Ficus pertusa and Randia venezuelansis. These nests comprise sticks that are usually less than a metre long and less than 2cm in diameter, and often from the palm species Copernicia tectorum. Nevertheless, the species {{does not seem to}} naturally perch in trees because unlike its sympatric heterospecifics such as the jabiru, it cannot stand on its hallux. Therefore, it probably only nests opportunistically above the ground. The same nest may be used by a pair in successive years, sometimes for as long as seven years. However, ground nests composed of herbaceous plants usually disintegrate after a year, whereupon the same breeding pair returns to the nest site to rebuild the nest. Both partners participate in building and lining the nest, which continues throughout incubation and brooding. Nest lining usually begins when the base is about a metre wide, and <b>lining</b> <b>material</b> largely consists of wet grass that dries and hardens in the intense sun.|$|E
500|$|The Puerto Rican amazon is a {{secondary}} cavity nester, nesting in tree trunk cavities, both naturally occurring and excavated by other species. It prefers to nest in Palo colorado trees (Cyrilla racemiflora), but uses other trees, including the laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens) and tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), {{to a lesser}} extent. These trees are mature cavity-forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water. Recently, the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed {{as part of the}} recovery plan for the species. Nest height varies from [...] above ground. The male usually leads the search for nest sites, although the final decision seems to be taken by the female. Once a site is selected, the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possible}} {{heat release}} rates of fires resulting from burning combustibles in 900 karaoke music compartments of 19 local karaokes were studied. Combustibles of concern are furniture foam, partitions and surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Equations {{appearing in the}} literature for calculating the heat release rates of these combustibles are used. Heat release rates of furniture foams were studied first, followed by igniting surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> classified under the Swedish system. The likelihood of flashover in those 900 karaoke music compartments was then investigated. Further, the total heat release rate curves for burning foam, surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> and carpets are studied using the results reported in the literature. Based on this study, it is recommended to select furniture foam with less heat release rates upon burning, and replace timber surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> as soon as possible. As an urgent action, a good fire safety management scheme “tailor-made ” for individual karaokes is to be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} water temperature, in association with four denture cleansers, on the colour and surface roughness of five soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Method: Two silicone soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> (Molloplast B and Sofreliner) represented the heat-cured, laboratory-based and chairside materials that are available. The wide range of chairside, acrylic resin-based, temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> was represented by Coe-Soft, Viscogel and Eversoft. An alkaline hypochlorite (Dentural) and three effervescent peroxide solutions {{with a range of}} active pH values (Steradent Active Plus, pH 6; Steradent Extra Strength, pH 3; Superdrug Fresh, pH 11) were selected as the cleansers. The denture cleansers were used at two temperatures: 55 °C (manufacturers' recommended temperature) and 80 °C. The colour of the specimens was evaluated using a colorimeter and the surface roughness was assessed using a three-dimensional, non-contact surface profilometer. This study reported on the effect of using both the higher temperatures and the recommended temperature on the colour and roughness of permanent and temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Results and Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the temperature of the water used with denture cleansers might have a detrimental effect on the colour and surface roughness of some permanent and temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{species is}} {{apparently}} monogamous, having long-term relationships. Nests are built distanced from other nests. Although occasionally two nests are {{within a few}} meters, colonies do not occur. Males display during the breeding season, while seated on a horizontal branch, with fluttering wings helt low while calling loudly. Mating starts during the sixth day of nest building. The male chases away other birds from the nest, possibly to forestall the deposition of eggs by other couples or cuckoos. Eggs usually are produced between October and March, corresponding to the late dry season and raining season. Nest building may occur as early as August and does not always signal imminent breeding attempts. Nests are conspicuous, usually in the open and away from surrounding vegetation, attached from an often defoliated limb, bamboo stem or vine, hanging above a clearing or a stream at a height of [...] The nest is attached to its hold by a [...] long rope. It is shaped like a retort, having an oval nesting chamber [...] high and [...] in diameter and a vertical entrance hose is attached high up a side and {{is at least as}} long as the nest is high. It is a firm construction made from strips of grass, sedge, and palm fronds, with a thin lining of palm fibres {{at the bottom of the}} nesting chamber. The male constructs the structure of the nest while the female brings <b>lining</b> <b>material.</b> The total time used to construct the nest is approximately twelve days. A clutch consists of one to four (most often three) oval, smooth, somewhat shiny, variably pale blue-green eggs of about 20½mm (0.8in) long and [...] in diameter. The eggs are incubated only by the female for fifteen days before hatching. The male lacks brood patches. Both parents feed the chicks and remove fecal sacs.|$|E

With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the clutch driven platen friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the hardness and energy absorption properties of four commercially available chairside silicone denture soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> and to compare their properties with those of a heat-polymerized silicone denture liner. The denture <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> investigated were four auto-polymerising silicone soft liners (GC Reline Soft, Ufigel SC, Elite Soft Relining and Tokuyama Sofreliner S) and a heat-polymerised silicone liner (Molloplast B).

In each test ten samples of each material were tested. There was strong evidence that Tokuyama Sofreliner S and, to a lesser extent, Ufigel SC, were less stiff and more resilient than Molloplast B.
