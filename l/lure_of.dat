5|$|<b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> the Temptress is Revolution Software's debut point-and-click {{adventure}} game {{published by}} Virgin Interactive Entertainment. It {{was released in}} June 1992 for Atari ST, MS-DOS and Amiga. The player assumes {{the role of a}} young peasant named Diermot who has to overthrow an evil sorceress. <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> the Temptress is the first game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which Revolution used in the subsequent games Beneath a Steel Sky and the first two games in the Broken Sword series. It was received favourably by critics, a commercial success and re-released as freeware on April 1, 2003.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an {{independent}} state, {{it was in}} reality a province of France.

40|$|The pollen tube {{attractant}} peptide <b>LUREs</b> <b>of</b> Torenia fournieri are diffusible peptides {{that attract}} pollen tubes in vitro. Here, we report a method enabling the direct visualization <b>of</b> a <b>LURE</b> peptide without inhibiting its attraction activity by conjugating {{it with the}} Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent dye. After purifying and refolding the recombinant LURE 2 with a polyhistidine tag, its amino groups were targeted for conjugation with the Alexa Fluor dye. Labeling <b>of</b> <b>LURE</b> 2 was confirmed by its fluorescence and mass spectrometry. In our in vitro assay using gelatin beads, Alexa Fluor 488 -labeled LURE 2 appeared {{to have the same}} activity as unlabeled LURE 2. Using the labeled LURE 2, the relationship between the spatiotemporal change of distribution and activity <b>of</b> <b>LURE</b> 2 was examined. LURE 2 attracted pollen tubes when embedded in gelatin beads, but hardly at all when in agarose beads. Direct visualization suggested that the significant difference between these conditions was the retention <b>of</b> <b>LURE</b> 2 in the gelatin bead, which might delay diffusion <b>of</b> <b>LURE</b> 2 from the bead. Direct visualization <b>of</b> <b>LURE</b> peptide may open the way to studying the spatiotemporal dynamics <b>of</b> <b>LURE</b> in pollen tube attraction...|$|R
5|$|With the {{emergence}} of The New Yorker, Benchley was able {{to stay away from}} Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more money than he was making writing for The New Yorker.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV owed nominal {{allegiance}} to the Imperial Habsburgs {{as a member of}} the Order of the Golden Fleece. His relationship with the Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu's 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite potential <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that he likely lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult. From 1636 onward, for the next few years, Władysław strengthened his ties with the Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E

5|$|Roger died in February 1154 and was {{succeeded by}} William I, who faced {{widespread}} rebellions against his rule in Sicily and Apulia, {{leading to the}} presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantine court. Conrad's successor, Frederick Barbarossa, launched a campaign against the Normans, but his expedition stalled. These developments encouraged Manuel {{to take advantage of the}} multiple instabilities on the Italian peninsula. He sent Michael Palaiologos and John Doukas Kamateros, both of whom held the high imperial rank of sebastos, with Byzantine troops, ten ships, and large quantities of gold to invade Apulia in 1155.* J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Decline and Fall, 112 The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible. Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons, including Count Robert of Loritello, Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of southern Italy rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown and the untried William I. There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> gold.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the {{prospect}} of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times {{was assumed to be}} imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and {{made it clear that he}} would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.|$|E
5|$|Video game designer, {{writer and}} {{director}} Charles Cecil began working on the scenario for Broken Sword, Revolution Software's third game following <b>Lure</b> <b>of</b> the Temptress (1992) and Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), in 1992, which would be set in Paris with a Knights Templar storyline. After visiting Paris and reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Cecil was certain the Templars {{would be a good}} subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins and Jonathan L.

Steve Ince, who created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky, was promoted to producer halfway through the project. In 1994 Cecil and Noirin Carmody met with Sean Brennan, then-head of publishing at Virgin Interactive, and Virgin agreed to publish the game's PC version, but were not interested in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to publish the game for the console. Tony Warriner and David Sykes were the game's designer-programmer Carmody the executive producer. The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine, as do Revolution's previous two games.|$|E

50|$|Caudal luring {{is a form}} of mimicry {{classified}} formally {{as aggressive}} mimicry, but perhaps better described by the term feeding mimicry. It is also an example of deception in animals. The behaviour is employed by a number of snake species and allegedly by two lizards, though other interpretations (e.g., distraction) seem more plausible for the lizards. Caudal luring also occurs in a shark, the tasselled wobbegong, Eucrossorinus dasypogon and very likely in the pelican eels, Eurypharynx, which possess a bioluminescent tail tip. The behavior is associated with sedentary predators whose diets include animals susceptible to a worm-like (or fish-like, in the case of Eucrossorinus and perhaps Eurypharynx) luring appendage. Snakes generally lure small ectotherms (e.g., frogs and lizards), although <b>luring</b> <b>of</b> birds has been demonstrated (Spider-tailed horned viper) and <b>luring</b> <b>of</b> insectivorous mammals is suspected. Caudal luring occurs most often in juvenile snakes and is most prevalent in vipers and pitvipers, but it also occurs in boas, pythons, tropidophiids, colubrids, and elapids of the genus Acanthophis.|$|R
5|$|When Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886 by munition workers' from Woolwich, the club {{resisted}} the <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> professionalism and remained an amateur side. Success in local cup competitions soon followed, and a tie against Derby County in the FA Cup on 17 January 1891 led to the opposition approaching two of Arsenal's players, in view of offering them professional contracts. Later that year the club resigned its membership of the Kent County and London Football Associationsboth amateur governing bodiesand voted to turn professional, a move which attracted criticism from many southern clubs. In 1893, the club received an invitation to join the Football League, which the board accepted. Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, while also participating in regional competitions, the Southern Combination and United League. The club won promotion in 1904, and enjoyed strong FA Cup campaigns in the mid-1900s, but the increase of football clubs in the capital and falling attendances at the Manor Ground pushed Arsenal close to bankruptcy by 1910. Sir Henry Norris and William Hall in that year took over Arsenal, and planned to relocate the team to Highbury {{in order to improve}} their financial standing. Arsenal were relegated back to the Second Division in 1913, but the move to North London brought about larger attendances than ever before.|$|E
