5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War.

As a former sportswriter for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Voltz watched Walker play for Oberlin; his signing reunited Walker with his former battery-mate Burket. Though Walker hit in decent numbers, recording a [...]251 BA, he became revered for his play behind the plate and his durability during an era where catchers wore little to no protective equipment.

500|$|The {{traditional}} clothing of a Serjeant-at-Law {{consisted of}} a coif, a robe and a furred cloak. The robe and cloak were later adapted into the robe worn by judges. The cut and colour of this robe varied â€“ records from the King's Privy Wardrobe show judges being instructed to wear robes of scarlet, green, purple and miniver, and Serjeants being ordered to wear the same. In 1555 new Serjeants were required to have robes of scarlet, brown, blue, mustard and murrey. By the time the order {{came to an end}} the formal robes were red, but Mr. Serjeant Robinson recalled that, towards the end days of the order, black silk gowns were the everyday court garb and the red gown was worn only on certain formal occasions. The cape was originally a cloak worn separately from the robe, but gradually made its way into the uniform as a whole. John Fortescue described the cape as the [...] "main ornament of the order", distinguished only from the cape worn by judges because it was furred with <b>lambskin</b> rather than miniver. The capes were not worn into court by the advocates, only by the serjeants.|$|E

[...] Dancers and extras were spotted dressed in multiple looks: some as ballerinas and others in leopard print while Gaga's mother was also seen on stage. Later, other photos of the filming were published on several websites and they showed Gaga with blue lipstick and a leather romper with several male dancers, in a long-sleeve red dress with padded shoulders, a big satellite dish and a big black hat. Footage of the video was posted online on October 14, 2011. Gaga is seen dancing on the roof of a car as she sings the bridge from the song. She then slides down the car and begins running around the hood as the chorus starts. She's dressed in black, with a blond bob wig and black heels while rain is visible in the background, but she appears unfazed by the weather. During an interview with NDTV on October 31, Gaga revealed that she directed the video. She also worked with the director of photography Darius Khondji and art director Gideon Ponte.|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} around 1100 Genoa and Pisa {{expanded}} their mercantile empire {{at the expense}} of other Central European maritime republics like Amalfi and Gaeta which diversified their mercantile operations in other directions at the time. Like Venice on the Adriatic, the dominant republics on the Tyrrhenian Â«found themselves able to supply consumers with whom the older generation of merchants from Amalfi had not been able to make close and regular contactsÂ». But the Genoese, Pisans and Venetians were not the only contenders for supremacy. Just as they had Â«gained control of the elongated routes carrying goods and pilgrims between West and East, the Sicilians established control over the vital passage-ways between the Tyrrhenian and the East, and between the Adriatic and the East. Sicilian naval supremacy in these waters presented the North Italians with a dilemma. Unless they wished their ships to be at the mercy of the Sicilian navy, they had to make friends with the court in Palermo. In 1156 the Genoese made a treaty with King William I [whereby they] were granted reduced taxes on cargoes carried from Alexandria and the Holy Land through Messina, for the treaty was concerned with the security of the routes to the East as much as it was with the right to take certain goods out of Sicily. Equally, the Genoese needed the produce of Sicily. The city had to feed itself as it grew, and Sicilian wheat was more plentiful and of higher quality than Sardinian, for which, in any case, the Genoese competed with the Pisan. The Treaty describes how the Genoese would require wheat, salted pork, wool, <b>lambskins</b> and cotton, mainly from the area around Agrigento. By bringing large quantities of raw cotton from Sicily to Northern Italy, the Genoese laid the basis for a cotton industry that would flourish throughout the Middle Ages. Some of the best cotton came from Malta and Maltese cotton is already recorded in Genoa in 1164 Â». This is the earliest association of Malta with Genoa that can be detected in existing documentation but it is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to contacts between Malta and the North Italian maritime republics. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of <b>lambskins</b> {{plays an important}} role in the New Zealand meat industry. The use of enzyme dewooling offers considerable advantages over the conventional depilation method which generates unpleasant working conditions and poses product quality risks when not properly handled. Prior to this work it was unclear from the literature why the practice of enzymatic depilation had not generally been adopted by industry. The aim of this work was to determine the problems associated with enzymatic depilation and provide a mechanistic understanding of the dewooling and damaging processes of enzyme depilation to provide underpinning knowledge for the design of a successful enzymatic depilation system. It was found that variability in depilation between different regions of the skin resulted in either over exposure of the skin to the enzyme regent and subsequent damage or underexposure of the skin to the enzyme reagent and incomplete depilation. Two approaches were taken in the work: Firstly an attempt was made for the first time to understand the variability in enzymatic depilation so that the variability observed in enzymatic depilation could potentially be reduced, thereby allowing a complete depilation process with no overexposure. Secondly an investigation was made for the first time to understand the cause of damage to skins during the process of enzymatic depilation so that the enzyme depilation process could potentially be modified to avoid damage. Experimental work characterising the time course of depilation and damage development was carried out and compared with the variation of physical properties across the skin. Correlations between depilation and physical properties such as thickness, grease content and follicle density were found. Reduction in the variability of these properties would likely improve the evenness of depilation but would not reduce it enough to eliminate damage due to over exposure. A range of techniques including: immunohistology, 2 -dimensional electrophoresis, matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation, and atomic force microscopy were used to probe the structural and biochemical mechanism of enzyme depilation and damage. In this way it was found that the removal of minor collagen components were the likely cause of damage observed. In particular the removal of collagen VI was associated with a disruption of the smooth mesh of fine collagen fibres observed at the surface of the leather. The key requirement identified for a successful enzyme depilation system was the use of a broad spectrum protease which has no activity against collagen VI. The means to select a protease with these attributes was also developed by adopting a micro depilation assay incorporating immunohistology. This knowledge will enable the future development of non damaging enzyme depilatory reagents that could revolutionise the industry...|$|R

This had become in some degree fashionable; but though the military roads were excellent, yet the accommodation was so indifferent that it was reckoned a little adventure to accomplish it. Besides, the Highlands, though now as peaceable as any part of King George's dominions, was a sound which still carried terror, while so many survived who had witnessed the insurrection of 1745; and a vague idea of fear was impressed on many as they looked from the towers of Stirling northward to the huge chain of mountains, which rises like a dusky rampart to conceal in its recesses a people whose dress, manners, and language differed still very much from those of their Lowland countrymen. For my part, I come of a race not greatly subject to apprehensions arising from imagination only.

60|$|After I had learnt to ride I used {{sometimes}} {{to go with}} my mother and sisters for an afternoon's visit to La Tapera. The wife was the biggest and fattest woman in our neighbourhood and stood a head and shoulders taller than her barrel-shaped husband. She was not, like Dona Mercedes, a lady by birth, nor an educated person, but resembled her in her habits and tastes. She sat always in a large cane easy- chair, outdoors or in, invariably with four hairless dogs in her company, one on her broad lap, another on a <b>lambskin</b> rug at her feet, and one on rugs at each side. The three on the floor were ever patiently waiting for their respective turns to occupy the broad warm lap when the time came to remove the last-favoured one from that position. I had an invincible dislike to these dogs with their shiny blue-black naked skins, like the bald head of an old negro, and their long white scattered whiskers. These white stiff hairs on their faces and their dim blinking eyes gave them a certain resemblance to very old ugly men with black blood in them, and made them all the more repulsive.|$|E
6000|$|The Grand Master {{was a man}} {{advanced}} in age, as was testified by his long grey beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes, of which, however, years {{had been unable to}} quench the fire. A formidable warrior, his thin and severe features retained the soldier's fierceness of expression; an ascetic bigot, they were no less marked by the emaciation of abstinence, and the spiritual pride of the self-satisfied devotee. Yet with these severer traits of physiognomy, there was mixed somewhat striking and noble, arising, doubtless, from the great part which his high office called upon him to act among monarchs and princes, and from the habitual exercise of supreme authority over the valiant and high-born knights, who were united by the rules of the Order. His stature was tall, and his gait, undepressed by age and toil, was erect and stately. His white mantle was shaped with severe regularity, according to the rule of Saint Bernard himself, being composed of what was then called Burrel cloth, exactly fitted {{to the size of the}} wearer, and bearing on the left shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the Order, formed of red cloth. No vair or ermine decked this garment; but in respect of his age, the Grand Master, as permitted by the rules, wore his doublet lined and trimmed with the softest <b>lambskin,</b> dressed with the wool outwards, which was the nearest approach he could regularly make to the use of fur, then the greatest luxury of dress. In his hand he bore that singular [...] "abacus", or staff of office, with which Templars are usually represented, having at the upper end a round plate, on which was engraved the cross of the Order, inscribed within a circle or orle, as heralds term it. His companion, who attended on this great personage, had nearly the same dress in all respects, but his extreme deference towards his Superior showed that no other equality subsisted between them. The Preceptor, for such he was in rank, walked not in a line with the Grand Master, but just so far behind that Beaumanoir could speak to him without turning round his head.|$|E
