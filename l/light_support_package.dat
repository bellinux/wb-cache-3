40|$|A person-centred {{approach}} to care {{is central to}} NHS England’s health policy agenda and a standard for pharmacy practice from the General Pharmaceutical Council. Health coaching is a method of delivering person-centred care. A pilot of a health coaching <b>support</b> <b>package,</b> including a 2 -day course and practice-based follow-up, was delivered to 70 London North West Healthcare NHS Trust pharmacy staff between December 2015 and July 2017. Objectives: To evaluate the <b>support</b> <b>package,</b> identifying key themes from course feedback, evaluating staff perception and evidence of application in practice. To identify key benefits of the <b>support</b> <b>package.</b> Methods: Qualitative analysis of written course feedback was undertaken to identify staff learning themes about person-centred care. The themes were used to design a survey, administered to <b>support</b> <b>package</b> recipients (staff), exploring staff perception of the package. Qualitative review of written examples highlighted use of person-centred themes in practice. Results: Twelve person-centred themes emerged from 49 course evaluations forms, describing what participants learnt about patient-centred care. Of 24 surveys completed, respondents reported increased awareness of themes; however, use in practice varied between themes. Overall, respondents valued the <b>support</b> <b>package</b> and rated practice-support more highly than the course for ongoing development. Patient examples described the use of themes in practice. Conclusions: The <b>support</b> <b>package</b> increased awareness of person-centred themes, portrayed within the practice examples submitted. While the course provided a foundation for use of a person-centred approach, continuing practice-based support is desired by staff to embed learning into day-to-day practice...|$|R
