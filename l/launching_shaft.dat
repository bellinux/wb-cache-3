Adopted EPB shield driving parameters, such as earth chamber pressure, annular filling grouting, and shield {{advance rate}} and cutterhead torque were also detailed. Chen et al. (2014) introduced measures and countermeasures adopted in shield tunneling under the existing operational subway tunnels in Shenzhen. The existing tunnel near the shield <b>launching</b> <b>shaft,</b> a special steel sleeve {{used for the}} launching was fixed at the tunnel portal, and such measures and countermeasures as ground improvement, adjustment of shield driving parameters and information feedback construction were also employed to ensure safety of the under-crossing. Fan (2014) described the schemes for constructing twin Line 3 west extension tunnels of Shenzhen subway, 1.23 and 1.46  m under the two existing operational subway Line 1 tunnels respectively. The adopted technologies were centered on shield driving parameter selection, backfilling grouting and in-tunnel monitoring, and injecting bentonite around the shield. In this project, limiting the speed of trains < 25  km/h during the construction was employed for sake of the public safety. Li et al. (2014) described the shield tunneling technology and measures taken when Line 11 twin running tunnels of Shenzhen subway crossing 1.5  m above Line 1 twin existing operational tunnels. Improving ground above the existing tunnels, elaborate shield driving control together with in-tunnel automatic monitoring helped control the uplift of the existing tunnels within 2  mm and guarantee safety of the subway traffic. Wang et al. (2014) used the 3 D FEM to simulate the excavation process of three crossing forms of the twin new tunnels: first above and then under crossing, two under crossings and two above crossing, based on the actual soil layer of one tunnel overlapping section of Shanghai subway. Reliability of the numerical simulation was verified by the comparison between measured and simulated data. Settlements of the existing tunnels and measures for controlling the settlements were given in the each crossing form. Yun et al. (2014) developed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based monitoring framework using sensor data collected from the existing tunnel while the new tunnel was excavated, which is particularly useful to analyze underdetermined systems due to insufficient sensor data for explicit relations between force and deformation as the system input and output respectively. Zhang et al. (2014) analyzed influence of the two new tunnels construction on the existing twin tunnels for two construction methods of above-crossing and under-crossing, using the commercial program (ABAQUS), and a modified Gaussian equation was proposed to predict ground settlement according to the computation results. Results showed that a secondary disturbance was {{to be caused by}} the shield advance, and greater influences would be exercised on the existing tunnels when the new tunnels were closely spaced. In addition, many other similar shield tunnel close crossing construction projects in mainland China, not reported in literatures or official publications due to various reasons, were realized in demanding conditions not only in respect of inner city environment where space requirements had to be taken into regard but also in respect of safe operations of the neighboring subway tunnels. For instance, in Hangzhou the first shield tunnel crossing project was finished in December 2013, of Hangzhou subway Line 4 tunnel between Guanhe station and Railway East station passing 2.1  m below the twin operational Line 1 tunnels after about 29  m driving from the launching excavation. The Hangzhou subway Line 4 interval tunnel between Qianjianglu station and Jiangjinlu station passing about 1.273  m below Line 1 tunnels was successfully accomplished on April 15, 2014. It is obvious that uttermost publications presented above dealt with only a single case study mainly because of the tribal knowledge of the involved projects. Generalized studies from the many case studies in combination with some undocumented recordings are necessary to improve the shield tunneling in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels. Moreover, it is often necessary in practice to take into consideration a set of distinct elements that frequently influence the construction of tunnels near the existing subway tunnels. Then well-targeted graduated response plans are designed to systematically and consistently manage safeties of the projects throughout the whole construction process. Although further studies on some topics do necessitate performing, a common understanding and recognition of the safety control framework has been reached in many aspects of the shield tunneling in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels in mainland China. Six key elements of the framework are presented. The conclusions of the elements, on which a consensus can be reached, are generalized from the typical close crossing construction projects in mainland China, while individual differences are illuminated. The purpose of the paper is to give the state-of-the-art review on the key elements of the safety control framework for shield tunneling in close proximity to the operational subway tunnels, so as to provide references for later similar projects.|$|E

Parrish and Brady receive a garbled transmission from a NATO agent moments before the KPA launches a final assault on their headquarters, forcing {{the remains of the}} Resistance to flee in disarray. Brady goes into the countryside to meet the NATO agent, who turns out to be Lisa Burnell, a British engineer who tells him that NATO is planning a full-scale assault against the KPA in America in response to the KPA attempting to take over Europe as well. Burnell's mission is to launch a nuclear warhead into space from a nearby decommissioned missile silo so the EMP blast will take out the KPA's APEX satellite network, in order to disable the KPA's massively superior firepower. Brady accompanies Burnell to the silo, and with assistance from the remains of the Resistance manages to hold off a KPA assault long enough for Burnell to prepare and launch the missile. However, a malfunction causes the silo launch doors to jam, forcing Brady to jump into the <b>launch</b> <b>shaft</b> to open them manually. This traps Brady inside the <b>launch</b> <b>shaft,</b> and he tells Burnell to launch the missile anyway even though the ignition blast will kill him. Burnell is initially reluctant to do so, but after KPA soldiers break into the control room and shoot her she hits the launch button before dying. Brady is incinerated by the missile's ignition, and the missile successfully destroys the APEX network. Just as NATO jets begin bombing the KPA, Parrish gives a final speech telling the people of America that they at last have a real chance at freedom and to rise up and fight alongside NATO to liberate the nation.|$|R

40|$|With {{the urban}} rapid development, it is {{necessary}} to build a variety of public facilities including underground lifelines. However, due to the existing heavy traffic, it is difficult to obtain additional space for open-cut installation of pipelines. Therefore, the No-Dig method was developed and applied. No-Dig method often encounters difficult geological problems, which makes the excavation in difficulty and thus affecting the construction schedule. Taichung area is majorly covered by gravel alluvium, in which the strata contains large gravels. Those large size gravels often result in excessive wear and increase in construction cost. In this paper, we took samples from the <b>launch</b> <b>shaft</b> of pipe-jacking projects in Taichung and carried out sieve analyses. Then we transformed the size distribution into borehole data by the newly derived formula. The obtained borehole data was applied to the T-PROGS geostatistic analysis. The purpose of the geostatistic analysis is to building a 3 D geological model by the data from pipe-jacking shaft, then we can obtain the geological and size distribution parameters along the pipe-jacking alignment. In this study, the analysis was performed for different scenerios and the impact of material changes on the pipe jacking rate. The results show that the change of gravel particles larger than 20 cm is highly correlated with pipe jacking rate. In addition, we also tried to use the image analysis to replace the large scale sieving test. Through the image software ”Image J”, we carried out the image sieve analysis, and compared with the size distribution from the original sieving test. And the results suggest that it is feasible to apply the image sieve analysis to replace the in situ sieve analysis. 隨著都市與工業快速發展，需興建各種地下化維生管線之公共設施，但基於現有都市交通壅擠、地下維生管線日益複雜，增設管線空間取得不易，因此免開挖工法便因應而生。免開挖工法經常遭遇到困難地質問題，使得開挖不易進而影響施工進度。台中地質屬於卵礫石沖積層，地層中含許多大型卵礫石，常造成推進過程機頭過度磨耗，造成施工本增加，本研究針對台中之推進工程之地質問題進行研究。 本研究利用現地工程案例推進坑進行地質材料取樣並進行篩分析，再透過自行推導之公式修正轉換為鑽孔柱狀圖數據後，輸入GMS之子程式T-PROGS進行分析。分析之目的在於以工作井之數據來建立三維地質模型，進而求取推進過程中可能遭遇之地質及粒徑條件，分析各種建模狀況，並透過與實際工程案例比較，探討其內部材料分佈對推進速率之影響，結果顯示，粒徑大於 20 公分之材料其變化趨勢與推進速率有高度相關性。 此外，本研究簡單的測試利用於推進坑取得之開挖璧影像，透過影像軟體ImageJ擷取顆粒後進行影像篩分析，觀察比較其結果與真實現地篩分析之差別，討論差異所在，並探討以影像篩分析取代大型篩分析之可行性，結果顯示以面積單位做完篩分析之過篩單位較符合真實現地篩分析粒徑分布。誌謝	I 摘要	II ABSTRACT	III 目錄	IV 表目錄	VII 圖目錄	VIII 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 3 1. 3 研究方法	 4 1. 4 論文架構	 5 第二章 文獻回顧	 6 2. 1 地質統計學簡介	 6 2. 1. 1 地質統計學之相關文獻	 6 2. 2 轉移機率(Transition Probability) 理論簡介	 7 2. 2. 1 轉移機率(Transition Probability) 理論相關文獻	 8 2. 3 GMS與T-PROGS數值分析軟體之簡介	 10 2. 3. 1 GMS與T-PROGS數值分析軟體之相關文獻	 10 第三章 研究方法	 13 3. 1 現地取樣及篩分析試驗	 13 3. 1. 1 大型篩分析試驗	 13 3. 1. 2 試驗流程	 14 3. 2 粒徑分佈轉換有效鑽孔數據值	 15 3. 2. 1 一維有效粒徑	 15 3. 2. 2 二維及三維有效粒徑推導	 15 3. 2. 3 粒徑分佈轉換有效鑽孔數據	 18 3. 3 T-PROGS分析	 21 3. 3. 1 T-PROGS分析理論	 21 3. 3. 2 T-PROGS 分析流程	 27 3. 4 影像篩分析	 29 第四章 篩分析分析結果	 30 4. 1 大型篩分析試驗結果	 30 4. 2 粒徑分佈轉換鑽孔數據與修正粒徑分佈結果	 30 第五章 T-PROGS分析結果與討論	 32 5. 1 自行建模敏感性模擬	 32 5. 1. 1 考慮空間觀點之比較結果	 32 5. 1. 2 考慮推進機具管徑之比較結果	 34 5. 1. 3 考慮整體觀點之比較結果	 35 5. 1. 4 結果討論	 36 5. 2 實際案例之分析探討	 38 5. 2. 1 實際案例分析結果	 39 5. 2. 2 實際案例應用與推進率關係之比較	 39 5. 2. 3 結果討論	 40 5. 3 利用影像軟體進行篩分析	 41 5. 3. 1 分析簡介	 41 5. 3. 2 影像篩分析結果	 43 5. 3. 3 結果討論	 43 第六章 結果討論	 45 6. 1 結論	 45 6. 2 建議	 47 參考文獻	 4...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Golfers are used extensively for equipment testing and development, however, they are inconsistent in performance and they tire. Golf swing simulation devices overcome these shortcomings producing consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for golf research conducted by manufacturers governing bodies and academic institutes. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested {{to ensure that the}} swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. An extensive 3 D kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum model of the swing along with ball <b>launch</b> and <b>shaft</b> deflection data. A technique for generating golf robot motion commands from the kinematic swing data was then developed using interpolation algorithms to increase the continuity of command derivatives. Six golfers' swings with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially availablem odem golf robot and a bespokem otion control system. Quantitative data captured from 20 golfers were compared using gender and skill classifications. All golfers were found to perform consistent swing motions and the kinematic sequencing of joint segments supported the summation of speed principle. Higher skill rated golfers were found to perform swings with greater consistency, faster clubhead speeds at impact, faster down swings and greater delayed wrist releases. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data and a feed-forward control enables in dividual golfer's swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability. The capability for golfers' swings to be replicated accurately using a mechanical device provides new impetus for both clubfitting methodologies and optimisation of swing technique. However, the boundary constraint of the club at the robot's gripping mechanism was found to provide poor representation of golfers' grip, and consequently, the first bending mode of the club was excited during simulations and resultant shaft deflection and ball launch data correlated less well with the golfers' data. Development of the club gripping mechanism has been identified as an area for future research as the benefits of the new robot control system will only be fully realised if this interface is improved...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bradbury {{was less}} {{exclusive}} in his tastes and habits, and combined the hunter and sportsman with the naturalist. He took his rifle or his fowling-piece {{with him in}} his geological researches, conformed to the hardy and rugged habits of the men around him, and of course gained favor in their eyes. He had a strong relish for incident and adventure, was curious in observing savage manners, and savage life, and ready to join any hunting or other excursion. Even now, that the expedition was proceeding through a dangerous neighborhood, he could not check his propensity to ramble. Having observed, on the evening of the 22d of May, that the river ahead made a great bend which would take up the navigation of the following day, he determined to profit by the circumstance. On the morning of the 23d, therefore, instead of embarking, he filled his shot-pouch with parched corn, for provisions, and set off to cross the neck on foot and meet the boats in the afternoon at {{the opposite side of the}} bend. Mr. Hunt felt uneasy at his venturing thus alone, and reminded him that he was in an enemy's country; but Mr. Bradbury made light of the danger, and started off cheerily upon his ramble. His day was passed pleasantly in traversing a beautiful tract, making botanical and geological researches, and observing the habits of an extensive village of prairie dogs, at which he made several ineffectual shots, without considering the risk he ran of attracting the attention of any savages that might be lurking in the neighborhood. In fact he had totally forgotten the Sioux Tetons, and all the other perils of the country, when, about the middle of the afternoon, as he stood near the river bank, and was looking out for the boat, he suddenly felt a hand laid on his shoulder. Starting and turning round, he beheld a naked savage with a bow bent, and the arrow pointed at his breast. In an instant his gun was leveled and his hand upon the lock. The Indian drew his bow still further, but forbore to <b>launch</b> the <b>shaft.</b> Mr. Bradbury, with admirable presence of mind, reflected that the savage, if hostile in his intents, would have shot him without giving him a chance of defense; he paused, therefore, and held out his hand. The other took it in sign of friendship, and demanded in the Osage language whether he was a Big Knife, or American. He answered in the affirmative, and inquired whether the other were a Sioux. To his great relief he found that he was a Ponca. By his time two other Indians came running up, and all three laid hold of Mr. Bradbury and seemed disposed to compel him to go off with them among the hills. He resisted, and sitting down on a sand hill contrived to amuse them with a pocket compass. When the novelty of this was exhausted they again seized him, but he now produced a small microscope. This new wonder again fixed the attention of the savages, who have more curiosity than it has been the custom to allow them. While thus engaged, one of them suddenly leaped up and gave a war-whoop. The hand of the hardy naturalist was again on his gun, and he was prepared to make battle, when the Indian pointed down the river and revealed the true cause of his yell. It was the mast of one of the boats appearing above the low willows which bordered the stream. Mr. Bradbury felt infinitely relieved by the sight. The Indians on their part now showed signs of apprehension, and were disposed to run away; but he assured them of good treatment and something to drink if they would accompany him on board of the boats. They lingered for a time, but disappeared before the boats came to land.|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, when a bored tunnel {{has to be}} constructed, {{a launch}} and a {{reception}} shaft have to be excavated to guarantee sufficient cover. This is necessary to ensure face stability, prevent uplift and risk of blow out. Moreover, especially {{in the western part}} of the Netherlands, the first 10 to 20 meters of soil consists of the Holocene layer consisting of soft clays and peat. By starting the tunnelling process at sufficient depth, the tunnel will be driven through the Pleistocene and and the soil deformations will remain small. In 2009, a new method was introduced in Japan: the Ultra Rapid UnderPass (URUP) method. With this method the tunnel boring machine (TBM) starts tunnelling from ground surface level. Consequently there is no more need for a <b>launch</b> and reception <b>shaft.</b> This eliminates the need for expensive shafts which are time-consuming to build, which makes the URUP method interesting to apply in the Netherlands. However, applying this method will result in small covers at the beginning and the end of the tunnel lining. Therefore complications are to be expected. In this report, the feasibility of this method, applied for large diameter tunnels, is assessed by investigating the main complications associated with this method (tunnelling with marginal cover method) in the Netherlands. As a basis for the feasibility study a reference project, which is planned for the near future, is used. The reference project “Rijnlandroute” is situated in the west of the Netherlands (between Leiden and Voorschoten), where the first 11 meters consist of Holocene soft soil. For this thesis only the eastern start of the tunnel is considered, that is located in a polder. The groundwater level is located approximately one meter below surface level and the surrounding area is largely greenfield. Firstly, the soil deformations in the Holocene layer, when placing the TBM at surface level, are determined. It can be concluded that without ground improvement the settlements will become too big. It is therefore recommended to apply Mixed In Place columns, that have been applied successfully several times in the past for similar cases. When the TBM reaches the Pleistocene layer, ground improvement is no longer required and deformations remain small. Due to the high groundwater table an embankment is necessary in permanent situation to prevent uplift. Moreover, the tunnel invert has to be filled with a sand ballast as well. During construction (ballast is not constructed yet) the water level will be drawn down temporarily with a maximum of two meters. Due to the absence of cover at start of the tunnelling process, the force distribution in the lining differs from the conventional method. The axial loads are negligible, whereas bending moments still exist resulting in opening up of the joints, which might cause leakage. Therefore it is required to increase the capacity to withstand high bending moments when tunnelling with shallow covers. The required embankment will increase the normal force. However, this increase is too low to counteract the occurring bending moments in the lining. The Japanese box, which is a bolt type where the tension forces are transferred directly to the reinforcement, will be applied (permanently). This bolt type can withstand higher forces, though this bolt type will increase the construction costs. It can be concluded that despite these issues, tunnelling with marginal covers is feasible in the Netherlands. To gain more insight in the relative benefits of this method compared to the conventional method, both are assessed, considering the costs as well as the construction time. The comparison shows that the total construction costs only differ 1. 8 % (the costs of the conventional method will be 1. 8 % higher). However, the construction of the tunnel with the marginal cover method will result in a shorter construction time. The construction time of the conventional method is approximately four years whereas the construction time of the tunnel applying the tunnelling with marginal cover method only amounts approximately three years. Therefore, it will be efficient to apply this method in the Netherlands. However, despite the feasibility and efficiency of this method in the Netherlands, it cannot yet be concluded if tunnelling with marginal cover will be recommended in future. Further research is still required to conclude if the marginal cover method will be successfully. With this thesis it can only be concluded that the tunnelling with marginal cover method, applied for large diameter tunnels, is feasible in the Netherlands.
