40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} response of multi-degree of freedom, hysteretic, and degrading systems under random base excitation is presented. A typical hysteretic element is described by a first order nonlinear differential equation. System degradation is governed by the total energy dissipation of the hysteresis. The model can represent multi-degree of freedom shear beam, or discrete hinge structures. Zero time <b>lag</b> <b>covariance</b> matrix response is obtained via equivalent linearization, and agrees more closely with Monte Carlo simulations than do other available approximate solutions. The response power spectral density function of the linearized system is obtained and several available first passage probability estimates are compared. Numerical studies are presented for shear beam models under stationary white noise, Kanai filtered white noise, and non-stationary excitations. Studies for framed structures with discrete hinge regions show {{that in addition to}} the usual covariance response, joint by joint energy dissipation requirements are provided.

NCEP 2 reanalyses are used together with Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR) data from June-September 1979 - 2007. Intraseasonal variability in the 600 hPa zonal wind is isolated using a 10 - 120 day filter. The leading Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) describes north-south displacements of the jet axis. Episodes of AEW activity over the continent are evaluated in terms of the perturbation kinetic energy (PKE) of the less-than-six-day high-pass filtered wind at 700 and 850 hPa. PKE and OLR are also filtered for the intraseasonal signal. <b>Lag</b> <b>covariance</b> analyses reveal a two-way interaction between the AEJ and synoptic-scale transients. Prior to episodes of enhanced transient activity, the AEJ is strengthened in the jet entrance region. During and following these episodes, the AEJ is strengthened on the northern flank of the jet exit region. E-vector analysis shows that this displacement of the AEJ is consistent with forcing by transients that have an AEW-like structure. Analysis of OLR shows that periods of enhanced transient activity over West Africa are associated with enhanced convection over the region at intraseasonal time-scales, and are correlated with prior episodes of enhanced convection to the east, in the 'convective trigger' region identified by Thorncroft et al...|$|E
40|$|The role of decadal {{changes in}} ocean thermal {{structure}} in modulating El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) properties was examined using a hybrid coupled model (HCM), {{consisting of a}} statistical atmospheric model and an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) with an explicitly embedded empirical parameterization for the temperature of subsurface water entrained into the mixed layer (T e), which was constructed via an EOF analysis of model-based historical data. Using the empirical T e models constructed from two subperiods, 1963 – 1979 (T e 63 − 79) and 1980 – 1996 (T e 80 − 96), the coupled system exhibits striking different properties of interannual variability, including oscillation periods and the propagation characteristic of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) along the equator. In the T e 63 − 79 run, the model features a 2 – 3 yr oscillation and a westward propagation of SSTAs along the equator, while in the T e 80 − 96 run, it {{is characterized by a}} 4 – 5 yr oscillation and an eastward propagation. Furthermore, a <b>Lag</b> <b>Covariance</b> Analysis (LCOA) was utilized to illustrate the leading physical processes responsible for decadal change in SST. It is shown that the change in the structure of T e acts to modulate the relative strength of the zonal advective and thermocline feedbacks in the coupled system, leading to changes in ENSO properties. Two additional sensitive experiments were conducted to further illustrate the respective roles of the changes in ocean mean states and in T e in modulating ENSO behaviors. These decadal changes in the simulated ENSO properties are consistent with the observed shift occurred in the late 1970 s and a previous simulation performed with an intermediate coupled model (ICM) described in Zhang and Busalacchi (2005), indicating a dominant role T e plays in decadal ENSO changes...|$|E

Specifically, we analyze the <b>lagged</b> <b>covariance</b> between interferometric baselines of similar lengths but slightly different orientations. For a flow viewed close to face-on, we demonstrate that the peak in the <b>lagged</b> <b>covariance</b> indicates the direction and angular velocity of the emission pattern from the flow. Even for moderately inclined flows, the covariance robustly estimates the flow direction, although the estimated angular velocity can be significantly biased. Importantly, measuring the direction of the flow as clockwise or counterclockwise on the sky breaks a degeneracy in accretion disk inclinations when analyzing time-averaged images alone. We explore the potential efficacy of our technique using three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, and we highlight several baseline pairs for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) that are well-suited to this application. These results indicate that the EHT may be capable of estimating the direction and angular velocity of the emitting material near Sagittarius A*, and they suggest that a rotating flow may even be utilized to improve imaging capabilities.

40|$|Observation network design {{requires}} some framework for sensitivity studies. The {{goal is to}} place observations where they will reduce forecast error the most. We use uncertainty estimates from our best forecast models {{as an indicator of}} forecast error. The first step is then to find initial-state perturbations that reduce forecast uncertainty by minimizing a user-dependent norm. Adjoint models have helped meet this challenge for decades. More recently, ensemble sensitivities have emerged as a powerful alternative to adjoint models. Under the conditions of Gaussian statistics and an infinite ensemble, <b>lagged</b> <b>covariances</b> from an ensemble can be used equivalently to an adjoint model to give the least-squares minimization of a given cost function. One practical advantage is that costly development and maintenance of tangent linear and adjoint models are avoided. Ensemble sensitivities {{have been shown to be}} an effective alternative to adjoint models. They have been used successfully to diagnose predictors of forecast error in synoptic storms, extratropical transition and developing hurricanes. Because they rely on <b>lagged</b> <b>covariances</b> from a finite-sized ensemble, they are subject to sampling error and spurious covariances. However, their efficacy for high-resolution forecasts in mountainous environments has not been thoroughly explored. We present results from experiments designed to establish the potential for ensemble sensitivity computations with a high resolution mesoscale model (grid spacing 4 km) in complex terrain. Using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) we compute sensitivities with cost functions defined to emphasize parameters affecting fog forecasting in the boundary layer. High sensitivities are interpreted as indicating low predictability for forecasting in the mountains.

Much of the research has been motivated by interest in the biology and chemistry of the mixed layer.

With the development of new observation techniques, and of complex numerical models, building upon equations for the development of Langmuir circulations developed by A. Craik and S. Leibovich in the late 1970 ’s, it appears that descriptions of these high-order statistics may be attainable. However, systematic discrepancies appear in the observations that remain to be explained: e. g., the magnitude of near-surface velocities associated with Langmuir circulation varies over a factor of 4 between different wind events for apparently similar conditions, yet is well behaved within each individual event. The last part of this work dwells on some recent observations and the nature of this unexplained variability. ...|$|R

In advance of the fire event, the flow above Portugal came from the north, turning to easterlies at lag time zero and finally coming from the south-east during the post-event phase. Surface wind statistics taken at Castelo Branco supported these results. Smoke plumes from wildland fires detected by satellites indicated a similar flow structure, which was quite different to the averaged summertime flow above Portugal. Cross-covariance regression between the Iberian thermal low and burnt area showed that the peak amount of burnt area occurred up to 3 days after the appearance of a thermal low.

The LIM {{is derived from the}} observed simulta-neous and <b>lagged</b> <b>covariance</b> statistics of 3 -month running mean Pacific SSTA for the years 1951 – 2000. The model forecasts exhibit significant skill over much of the Pacific for two to three seasons in advance and up to a year in some locations, particulary for forecasts initialized in winter. The predicted and observed PDO are significantly correlated at leads of up to four seasons, for example, the correlation exceeds 0. 6 for 12 -month forecasts initialized in January–March (JFM). The LIM-based PDO forecasts are more skillful than persistence or a first-order autoregressive model, and have comparable skill to LIM forecasts of El Niño SSTAs. Filtering the data indicates that much of the PDO forecast skill is due to ENSO teleconnec-tions and the global trend. Within LIM, SST anomalies can grow due to constructive interference of the empirically determined modes, even though the individual modes are damped over time. For the Pacific domain, the basinwide SST variance can grow for 14 months, consistent with the skill of the actual predictions. The optimal structure (OS), the initial SSTA pattern that LIM indicates should increase the most rapidly with time, is clearly relevant to the predictions, as the OS develops into a mature ENSO and PDO event 6 – 10 months later. The OS is also consistent with the seasonal footprinting mechanism (SFM) and the meridional mode (MM); the SFM and MM involve a set of atmosphere–ocean interactions that have been hypothesized to initiate ENSO events. 1...|$|R

In protein folding, matches in hydrophobic free energy statistical wavelengths appear {{to contribute to}} selective aggregation of secondary structures in “hydrophobic zippers. ” In a similar setting, the use of Fourier analysis to characterize the dominant statistical wavelengths of peptide ligands’ and receptor proteins’ hydrophobic modes to predict such matches has been limited by the aliasing and end effects of short peptide lengths, {{as well as the}} broad-band, mode multiplicity of many of their frequency (power) spectra. In addition, the sequence locations of the matching modes are lost in this transformation. We make new use of three techniques to address these difficulties: (i) eigenfunction construction from the linear decomposition of the <b>lagged</b> <b>covariance</b> matrices of the ligands and receptors as hydrophobic free energy sequences; (ii) maximum entropy, complex poles power spectra, which select the dominant modes of the hydrophobic free energy sequences or their eigenfunctions; and (iii) discrete, best bases, trigonometric wavelet transformations, which confirm the dominant spectral frequencies of the eigenfunctions and locate them as (absolute valued) moduli in the peptide or receptor sequence. The leading eigenfunction of the covariance matrix of a transmembrane receptor sequence locates the same transmembrane segments seen in n-block-averaged hydropathy plots while leaving the remaining hydrophobic modes unsmoothed and available for further analyses as secondary eigenfunctions. In these receptor eigenfunctions, we find a set of statistical wavelength matches between peptide ligands and their G-protein and tyrosine kinase coupled receptors, ranging across examples from 13. 10 amino acids in acid fibroblast growth factor to 2. 18 residues in corticotropin releasing factor.

A better MA representation for the covariance and the spectral density is found with Durbin's improved MA method. That uses the parameters of a long autoregressive (AR) model to find MA models, followed by automatic selection of the MA order. A comparison is made between the two MA model types. The best of many MA models from windowed periodograms is compared to the single selected MA model obtained with Durbin's method. The latter typically has a better quality.

40|$|This paper compares frequentist {{risks of}} several Bayesian estimators of the VAR <b>lag</b> {{parameters}} and <b>covariance</b> matrix under alternative priors. With the constant prior on the VAR lag parameters, the asymmetric LINEX estimator for the lag parameters does better overall than the posterior mean. The posterior mean of covariance matrix performs well in most cases. The choice of prior has more significant {{effects on the}} estimates than the form of estimators. The shrinkage prior on the VAR lag parameters dominates the constant prior, while Yang and Berger's reference prior on the covariance matrix dominates the Jeffreys prior. Estimation of a VAR using the U. S. macroeconomic data reveals significant differences between estimates under the shrinkage and constant priors...|$|R
40|$|A datum is {{considered}} spatial if it contains location information. Typically, {{there is also}} attribute information, whose distribution depends on its location. Thus, error in location information can lead to error in attribute information, which is reflected ultimately in the inference drawn from the data. We propose a statistical model for incorporating location error into spatial data analysis. We investigate the effect of location error on the spatial <b>lag,</b> the <b>covariance</b> function, and optimal spatial linear prediction (that is, kriging). We show that the form of kriging after adjusting for location error {{is the same as}} that of kriging without adjusting for location error. However, location error changes entries in the matrix of explanatory variables, the matrix of covariances between the sample sites, and the vector of covariances between the sample sites and the prediction location. We investigate, through simulation, the effect that varying trend, measurement error, location error, range of spatial dependence, sample size, and prediction location have on kriging after and without adjusting for location error. When the location error is large, kriging after adjusting for location error performs markedly better than kriging without adjusting for location error, in terms of both the prediction bias and the mean squared prediction error...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a survey}} of some recent results on the {{rational}} circulant covariance extension problem: Given a partial sequence (c_ 0,c_ 1, [...] .,c_n) of <b>covariance</b> <b>lags</b> c_k=E{y(t+k) y(t) } emanating from a stationary periodic process {y(t) } with period 2 N> 2 n, find all possible rational spectral functions of {y(t) } of degree at most 2 n or, equivalently, all bilateral and unilateral ARMA models of order at most n, having this partial covariance sequence. Each representation is obtained as the solution {{of a pair of}} dual convex optimization problems. This theory is then reformulated in terms of circulant matrices and the connections to reciprocal processes and the covariance selection problem is explained. Next it is shown how the theory can be extended to the multivariate case. Finally, an application to image processing is presented...|$|R
40|$|A datum is {{considered}} spatial if it contains locational information. Typically, {{there is also}} attribute information, whose distribution depends on its location. Thus, error in locational information leads to error in attribute information, which is ultimately reflected in the inference drawn from the data;We propose a statistical model for incorporating locational error into spatial data analysis. We investigate the effect of locational error on the spatial <b>lag,</b> the <b>covariance</b> function, the variogram, and optimal spatial prediction (aka, kriging). We show that the basic methodology of kriging adjusted for locational error {{is the same as}} kriging without locational error;We also develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to incorporate locational uncertainty into spatial data analysis. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to draw from the posterior distribution of the large-scale trend parameters, the covariance-model parameters, the realized site locations, and the process value at a prediction site, given the observed attribute values and the intended sample locations;We use a topographical data set of Davis (1973) as an illustration of kriging without locational error, kriging adjusted for locational error, hierarchical Bayesian kriging without locational error, and hierarchical Bayesian kriging adjusted for locational error. We also investigate, through a simulation study, the effect that varying the trend, the measurement error, the locational error, the range of spatial dependence, the sample size, and the prediction location has on both kriging without locational error and kriging adjusted for locational error...|$|R
