5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> when supplemental oxygen is administered {{as part of a}} treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy.|$|E

Firstly, we compare diffusive volatility on jump and non-jump days. Secondly, we study the change in diffusive volatility in local windows before and after 5 -minute intervals on which price jumps are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>occurred.</b> We find evidence that market price jumps occur simultaneously with a change in diffusive volatility with negative dependence {{in the direction of}} the jump and the volatility change. However, a similar relationship is not detectable in individual stock price data. Honors Thesi...|$|R

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> if the nest is high in a tree {{and there is a}} good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in late fall, early winter, and during spring {{due to the}} higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to}} the lake effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E

5|$|An {{off-season}} Atlantic hurricane is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone {{that existed in}} the Atlantic basin outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 off-season cyclones in the Atlantic hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that {{is not part of the}} official database.|$|E
5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur,</b> giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur.</b> On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E

40|$|Context: Cloud Outsourcing is a {{new form}} of {{outsourcing}} which is not more under implementation and yet to be implemented. It is a form of outsourcing in which software organizations outsource the work to e-freelancers available throughout the world using cloud services via the Internet. Software organizations handovers the respective task to the cloud and from the cloud e-freelancers undertake the development of task and then return back the finished task to the cloud. Organizations recollect the finished task from the cloud and verify it and then pay to the e-freelancer. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the sequence of activities involved during the entire process of cloud outsourcing and to find out the risks which are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>occurred</b> during the implementation of this process. To prioritize the elicitated risks according to their probability of occurrence, impact and cost required to mitigate the corresponding risk. Methods: Data is collected by literature review and then the data is synthesized. On the other side interviews with practitioners are conducted to know the activities involved and to find out the risks that are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>occurred</b> during the implementation of cloud outsourcing. After this, a survey is conducted in order to prioritize the risks and a standard risk analysis is conducted to know the risks which are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>occurred.</b> Literature review is done using four databases including the literature from the year 1990 to till date. Results: Totally we have identified 21 risks that are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>occurred</b> and 8 activities so far.

5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} occurs in several habitats, ranging from coastal salt marshes to {{mountain}} streams and clearings. It is semiaquatic, spending {{much time in}} the water, and usually occurs in wetland habitats. It prefers areas where the ground is covered with grasses and sedges, which protect it from predators. In southern Illinois, marsh rice rats are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in wetlands with more herbaceous cover, visual obstruction, and nearby grasslands. The species also occurs in drier uplands, which serve as sinks for young, dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide. Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers; studies on islands off Virginia's Delmarva Peninsula show that they readily cross 300-m (1000ft) channels between islands.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E

5|$|While RAD is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> {{following}} neglectful {{and abusive}} childcare, {{there should be}} no automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E
