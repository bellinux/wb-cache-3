25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} {{when he was}} watching the television show called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not a science fiction story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son having {{to go out and get}} rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple <b>log</b> <b>line</b> for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Logs are {{generated}} by output statements that de-velopers insert into the code. By recording the system behaviour during runtime, logs {{play an important}} role in the maintenance of large software systems. The rich nature of logs has introduced a new market of log management applications (e. g., Splunk, XpoLog and logstash) that assist in storing, querying and an-alyzing logs. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated the importance of logs in operating, understanding and improving software systems. Thus log maintenance is an important task for the developers. However, all too often practitioners (i. e., operators and administrators) are left without any support to help them unravel the meaning and impact of specific <b>log</b> <b>lines.</b> By spending over 100 human hours and manually examining all the email threads in the mailing list for three open source systems (Hadoop, Cassandra and Zookeeper) and performing web search on sampled logging statements, we found 15 email inquiries and 73 inquiries from web search about different <b>log</b> <b>lines.</b> We identified that five types of development knowledge that are often sought from the logs by practitioners: meaning, cause, context, impact and solution. Due to the frequency and nature of <b>log</b> <b>lines</b> about which real customers inquire, documenting all the <b>log</b> <b>lines</b> or identifying which ones to document is not efficient. Hence in this paper we propose an on-demand approach, which associates the development knowledge present in various development repositories (e. g., code commits and issues reports) with the <b>log</b> <b>lines.</b> Our case studies show that the derived development knowledge can be used to resolve real-life inquiries about logs.

60|$|And so it was. And {{with that}} I {{began to be}} sorry for cartographers. We were scarce doing three and a half; and {{they asked me to}} believe that (in five minutes) we had dropped an island, passed eight miles of open water, and run almost high and dry upon the next. But my captain was more sorry for himself to be afloat in such a labyrinth; laid the Casco to, with the <b>log</b> <b>line</b> up and down, and sat on the stern rail and watched it till the morning. He had enough of night in the Paumotus.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain said}} she had once gone {{at the rate of}} {{thirteen}} knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the navy, who contended that it was impossible, that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some error in the division of the log line,[198] or some mistake in heaving the log. A wager ensued between the two captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examined rigorously the <b>log</b> <b>line,</b> and, being satisfied with that, he determined to throw the log himself. Accordingly, some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the packet, Lutwidge, said he believed she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and owned his wager lost.|$|E
60|$|These conversations, however, were mere {{episodes of}} the great {{business}} of the passage. Throughout the morning, the master was busy in rating his mates, giving sharp reprimands to the stewards and cooks, overhauling the <b>log</b> <b>line,</b> introducing the passengers, seeing to the stowage of the anchors, in getting down the signal-pole, throwing in touches of Vattel, and otherwise superintending duty, and dispensing opinions. All this time, the cat in the grass does not watch the bird that hops along the ground with keener vigilance than he kept {{his eye on the}} Foam. To an ordinary observer, the two ships presented the familiar spectacle of vessels sailing in the same direction, with a very equal rate of speed; and as the course was that necessary to clear the Channel, most of the passengers, and, indeed, the greater part of the crew, began to think the cruiser, like themselves, was merely bound to the westward. Mr. Truck, on the contrary, judging by signs and movements that more naturally suggested themselves to one accustomed to direct the evolutions of a ship, and to reason on their objects, than to the mere subjects of his will, thought differently. To him, the motive of the smallest change on board the sloop-of-war was as intelligible {{as if it had been}} explained in words, and he even foresaw many that were about to take place. Before noon, the Foam had got fairly abeam, and Mr. Leach, pointing out the circumstance, observed, that if her wish was to overhaul them, she ought then to tack; it being a rule among seamen, that the pursuing vessel should turn to windward as often as she found herself nearest to her chase. But the experience of Captain Truck taught him better; the tide was setting into the Channel on the flood, and the wind enabled both ships to fake the current on their lee-bows, a power that forced them up to windward; whereas, by tacking, the Foam would receive the force of the stream on her weather broadside, or so nearly so, as to sweep her farther astern than her difference in speed could easily repair.|$|E
