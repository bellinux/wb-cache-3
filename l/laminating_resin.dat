40|$|The {{factors which}} effect the impact {{resistance}} of <b>laminating</b> <b>resin</b> systems and yet retain equivalent performance with the conventional 450 K curing epoxy matrix systems {{in other areas}} were studied. Formulation work was conducted on two systems, an all-epoxy and an epoxy/bismaleimide, to gain fundamental information on the effect formulation changes have upon neat resin and composite properties. The all-epoxy work involved formulations with various amounts and combinations of eight different epoxy resins, four different hardeners, fifteen different toughening agents, a filler, and a catalyst. The epoxy/bismaleimide effort improved formulations with various amounts and combinations of nine different resins, four different hardeners, eight different toughening agents, four different catalysts, and a filler.

The new <b>laminating</b> <b>resins</b> exhibited cost, handleability and processing characteristics equivalent to 394 K (250 F) curing epoxies. The <b>laminating</b> <b>resins</b> {{were based on}} bisphenol A dicyanate and monofunctional cyanates with hydrophobic substituents. These resins sorb only small quantities of moisture at equilibrium (0. 5 % or less) with minimal glass transition temperature depression and represent an improvement over epoxies which sorb around 2 % moisture at equilibrium. Toughening was accomplished by the precipitation of small diameter particles of butadiene nitrile rubber throughout the resin matrix. The rubber domains act as microcrack termini and energy dissipation sites, allowing increased stress accommodation prior to catastrophic failure. A unique blend of amine terminated butadiene nitrile elastomer (MW 2, 000) and a high nitrile content butadiene nitrile rubber yielded the desired resin morphology...|$|R

For this purpose, the tensile tests of <b>laminated</b> <b>resin</b> composites are carried out at room temperature(20 °C) and high temperature(150 °C and 180 °C). The effect rules of different temperature on the tensile property of these composites are discussed.

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the tensile property of <b>laminated</b> epoxy <b>resin</b> composites reinforced by carbon fiber plain woven fabric with different heating period of time at relatively high temperature. For this purpose, the tensile tests of <b>laminated</b> <b>resin</b> composites are carried out at 150 °C and 180 °C with 15 minutes, 10 hours and 30 hours heating period of time, respectively. The reasons for the variations of tensile property of these composites with different heating period of time at 150 °C and 180 °C are analyzed. At 150 °C and 180 °C，with heating period of time increasing the tensile strength of samples keep the same level. However at 180 °C the average tensile strength of samples is decreased by 14. 95 % compared with that at 150 °C and the variation coefficient (CV) of tensile strengths at 180 °C is much more than that at 150 °C.

The heating of the epoxy resins greatly relies on various factors which includes the dielectric properties, kind of waveguide used and the frequency and power used.

40|$|Chopped strand mat E-glass layers were {{impregnated}} with isophthalic marine <b>laminating</b> <b>resin</b> by {{hand lay-up}} techniques. Once the primary laminate reached the desired Barcol hardness value, the secondary laminate was applied {{and allowed to}} cure. These samples were bonded together at hardness values of 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 Barcol. Lamination was conducted at 70 °F with 35 % glass fibers and 65 % polyester resin catalyzed with 1. 5 % methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. The target thickness of each laminate was 6 mm for short-beam shear testing requiring eight layers of glass and resin. Using the procedures outlined in ASTM D- 2344, each sample set of ten specimens was short-beam shear tested using a 20 mm span with 0. 125 in diameter load nose and supports. The short-beam shear testing of each specimen forced interlaminar shear between the primary and secondary layers, allowing for characterization of the bond strength at different hardnesses. After preliminary testing, all samples showed statistically significant differences with a trend of increasing bond strength with decreasing hardnesses. Twenty percent of the samples delaminated while the other sample failed under flexure loads. The samples that were bonded at higher hardnesses failed under lower loads in tension and compression rather than in shear. Three-point bend testing following ASTM 7264 was conducted to determine the flexural stiffness and strength properties of the samples to determine the validity of preliminary testing. After secondary testing was completed, the preliminary data was confirmed and conclusions were drawn. It was found that hardness {{does not affect the}} strength of adhesion in composite laminates.
