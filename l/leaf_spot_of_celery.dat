50|$|Hosts that {{suffer from}} late <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> include {{groundnut}} species {{belonging to the}} genus Arachis hypogaea, and peanuts. Late <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut that produces sexual spores {{is referred to as}} Mycosphaerella berkeleyi, whereas the asexual spore is referred to as Cercosporidium personatum. Late <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut symptoms usually appear between 30-50 days following planting.

50|$|Early <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut can {{be treated}} {{through the use of}} {{fungicides}} applied at the very early pod stage, and applied every two weeks thereafter. After analyzing the incidence and severity of the disease, strip-tillage techniques have also proven to be effective in delaying an epidemic by reducing the amount of initial infection. Furthermore, the delay in disease caused by the strip-tillage technique proposes that initial application of fungicides for use in disease management may be delayed without having negative effects on the treatment <b>of</b> early <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut. Nevertheless, fungicides, such as the protectant fungicide, chlorothalonil, have been the standard for control <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> since the mid-1970s and is still widely used today. Tebuconazole, a systemic ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide, and Pyraclostrobin, a strobilurin-type fungicide have also both proven effective in controlling early <b>leaf</b> <b>spot,</b> even more so than chlorothalonil.
