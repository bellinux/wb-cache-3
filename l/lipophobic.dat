Monolayers were formed {{on the surface of}} deionized water by spreading tissue components corresponding to 1 mg of the tissue for studying their surface pressure-area isotherms at body temperature. The cholesterol content of cancerous human cervical tissues was higher than that of the normal human cervical tissues. The addition of 3 mu g cholesterol/mg tissue to the normal organic phase changed its tensiometric profile to that of the cancerous profile. Statistically significant tensiometric parameters showed that cholesterol acts as a rigidifier in the cervical tissues and has a remarkable role in shifting the normal cervical lipophilic surface activity towards that of the cancerous lipophilic monolayer. Several mixtures of the lipophilic-lipophobic components of both cancerous as well as normal cervical tissues also were characterized to reveal the relative contribution of these phases in the cervical cancer tensiometric profiles. Though the actual ratio of aqueous and organic phases in the normal tissue was 97 : 3 by weight, the tissue homogenate behavior was similar to that of a 50 : 50 mixture by weight, indicating the nonadditivity of the lipophilic-lipophobic components. The addition of cholesterol to a 97 : 3 by weight aqueous: organic mixture of normal cervical tissue also revealed the rigidifying role of cholesterol. Unlike in normal tissue homogenates, the cancerous tissue homogenate tensiometric profile had more contribution from its aqueous phase components and an additive interaction between the lipophilic and <b>lipophobic</b> components was observed in the tissue homogenate.

The influence of nanoparticles on wetting behaviour of fractured limestone was also demonstrated by Nwidee et al. [32]. They investigated the influence of zirconium(iv) oxide (ZrO 2) and nickel(ii) oxide (NiO). The contact angle measurement demonstrated that application of nanofluid in oil-wet or intermediate-wet formation can increase oil recovery by wettability alteration as the nanoparticles adsorb {{on the surface of the}} calcite crystals and promote oil displacement. Time, concentration and salinity where responsible for the decrease in the water contact angle. The work of Mohammadi et al.

40|$|ABSTRACT Characterizing the {{interactions}} between amino acid residues and lipid molecules is important for understanding the assembly of transmembrane helices and for studying membrane protein folding. In this study we develop TMLIP (Trans-Membrane helix-LIPid), an empirically derived propensity of individual residue types to face lipid membrane based on statistical analysis of highresolution structures of membrane proteins. Lipid accessibilities of amino acid residues within the transmembrane (TM) region of 29 structures of helical membrane proteins are studied with a spherical probe of radius of 1. 9 Å. Our results show that there are characteristic preferences for residues to face the headgroup region and the hydrocarbon core region of lipid membrane. Amino acid residues Lys, Arg, Trp, Phe, and Leu are often found exposed at the headgroup regions of the membrane, where they have high propensity to face phospholipid headgroups and glycerol backbones. In the hydrocarbon core region, the strongest preference for interacting with lipids is observed for Ile, Leu, Phe and Val. Small and polar amino acid residues are usually buried inside helical bundles and are strongly <b>lipophobic.</b> There is {{a strong correlation between}} various hydrophobicity scales and the propensity of a given residue to face the lipids in the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer. Our data suggest a possibly significant contribution of the <b>lipophobic</b> effect to the folding of membrane proteins. This study shows that membrane proteins have exceedingly apolar exteriors rather than highly polar interiors. Prediction of lipid-facing surfaces of boundary helices using TMLIP 1 results in a 54 % accuracy, which is significantly better than random (25 % accuracy).
