5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern <b>legal</b> <b>scholars,</b> who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E

5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{was decided}} {{the next year}} and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. None of these cases have ever been {{overturned}} by the Supreme Court. The decisions were questioned by <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> even before the war had ended. Criticism has included the racist aspects of the cases and the later discovery that officials in the United States Department of Justice lied to the court {{at the time of the}} trial.|$|E
5|$|When the Internet arose as {{a popular}} and {{important}} medium and the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling on the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), Moore's image {{was described as a}} sort of litmus test to determine if the law could be reasonably applied in the current environment by the trial court. When John Paul Stevens' rendered an opinion over a year later, the image was still on the minds of <b>legal</b> <b>scholars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E

5|$|In {{surveys of}} U.S. {{scholars}} ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently {{ranked in the}} top three, often as number one. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> placed him second after Washington. In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of arms or seal has {{generally}} been authorized by {{a provision in the}} state constitution or a legislative act. In most instances a committee (more often than not consisting of three members) was appointed to study the issue, seek advice from qualified artists, historians, <b>legal</b> <b>scholars,</b> etc., and report back to the authorizing legislative body with a design for their approval. Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In public, Hand {{discussed}} {{issues of}} democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus {{a series of}} impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> and journalists, and by 1930 he {{was viewed as a}} serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court. His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law School professor, was among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican candidate for President in 1916, as Chief Justice. With Hughes and another New Yorker, Harlan Fiske Stone, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Lemon {{test has}} been criticized by justices and <b>legal</b> <b>scholars,</b> but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E
5|$|One of Combs' first {{official}} actions as governor {{was to call}} a special session of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had been in effect since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting {{the issue of a}} convention on the ballot in two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by <b>legal</b> <b>scholars</b> that the constitution was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special legislative session. The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special legislative session and again during the subsequent regular legislative session in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on the ballot in November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.|$|E
