500|$|Fear of Scientology's <b>litigiousness</b> {{rendered}} American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I {{think at the end of}} the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E
500|$|Some twentieth-century {{historians have}} been less {{inclined}} to moral judgement, seeing Richard's actions {{as a product of}} the unstable times. In the words of Charles Ross, [...] "the later fifteenth century in England is now seen as a ruthless and violent age as concerns the upper ranks of society, full of private feuds, intimidation, land-hunger, and <b>litigiousness,</b> and consideration of Richard's life and career against this background has tended to remove him from the lonely pinnacle of Villainy Incarnate on which Shakespeare had placed him. Like most men, he was conditioned by the standards of his age." [...] The Richard III Society, founded in 1924 as [...] "The Fellowship of the White Boar", is the oldest of several groups dedicated to improving his reputation. [...] Other contemporary historians still describe him as, a [...] "power-hungry and ruthless politician" [...] who was still most probably [...] "ultimately responsible for the murder of his nephews." ...|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her <b>litigiousness,</b> her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E

No British newspaper would publish the allegations because of Maxwell's famed <b>litigiousness.</b> However, two British MPs raised the matter in the House of Commons, which meant that British newspapers were able to report what had been said without fear of being sued for libel. Maxwell called the claims [...] "ludicrous, a total invention". He fired Davies shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|Ben-Menashe {{claimed that}} Robert Maxwell, then owner of Mirror Group {{newspapers}} in the UK, was a Mossad agent, and that Maxwell had tipped off the Israeli embassy in 1986 about Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu, after Vanunu and a friend approached the Sunday Mirror and The Sunday Times in London with a story about Israel's nuclear capability. Vanunu was subsequently lured by Mossad from London to Rome, kidnapped, returned to Israel, and sentenced to 18 years in jail. According to [...] Ben-Menashe the Daily Mirror's foreign editor, Nicholas Davies worked for the Mossad and {{was involved in the}} Vanunu affair. No British newspaper would publish the Maxwell allegations because of his well-known <b>litigiousness.</b> However, Ben-Menashe was used as a key source by Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Seymour Hersh for his book about Israel's nuclear weapons, , published in Britain in 1991 by Faber and Faber.

2500|$|Operation Clambake founder Andreas Heldal-Lund {{became the}} fourth {{recipient}} of the Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 17, 2003. Operation Clambake was cited by the Committee for exposing what it referred to as [...] "fraud and human rights violations" [...] of the Church of Scientology in the United States. [...] The European-American Citizens Committee said it echoed a statement Heldal-Lund had written at the Operation Clambake website, where he stated: [...] "People {{should be free to}} believe whatever they want, including Scientology," [...] but also cited what he believed to be the organization's [...] "deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its arrogance, its attack on free speech, its <b>litigiousness,</b> its harassment of its critics, its lack of concern for families, its gross neglect and abuse of children." [...] Heldal-Lund was recognized for [...] "maintaining his Web page despite repeated legal attacks from church officials." [...] Church of Scientology officials had attempted to silence Heldal-Lund by requesting Google Inc. and Internet Archive remove links to Operation Clambake, claiming violation of their copyrights. [...] The Awards ceremony again included the presentation of a glass-contained sculpture with an image of St. Nicholas Church. [...] Alain Vivien presented Heldal-Lund with the Award, and stated that his work had revealed the actions of Scientologists with [...] "respect and intelligence." [...] In his acceptance speech, Heldal-Lund spoke about freedom of speech, and emphasized the role of the individual citizen.|$|E
6000|$|In India {{and in many}} of our Colonies {{the absence}} of {{satisfactory}} means for identifying persons of other races is seriously felt. The natives are mostly unable to sign; their features are not readily distinguished by Europeans; and in too many cases they are characterised by a strange amount of <b>litigiousness,</b> wiliness, and unveracity. The experience of Sir W. Herschel, {{and the way in}} which he met these unfavourable conditions by the method of finger prints, has been briefly described in p. 27. Lately Major Ferris, of the Indian Staff Corps, happening to visit my laboratory during my absence, and knowing but little of what Sir W.

60|$|It {{will have}} an odd sound in history, and appear hardly credible, that in several petty republics of single towns, which make up the States General, it should be {{formally}} debated, whether the Queen of Great Britain, who preserved the commonwealth at the charge of so many millions, should be suffered to enjoy, after a peace, the liberty granted her by Spain of selling African slaves in the Spanish dominions of America! But there was a prevailing faction at The Hague, violently bent against any peace, where the Queen must act that part which they had intended for themselves. These politicians, who held constant correspondence with their old dejected friends in England, were daily fed with the vain hopes of the Queen's death, or the party's restoration. They likewise endeavoured to spin out the time, till Prince Eugene's activity had pushed on some great event, which might govern or perplex the conditions of peace. Therefore the Dutch plenipotentiaries, who proceeded by the instructions of those mistaken patriots, acted in every point with a spirit of <b>litigiousness,</b> than which nothing could give greater advantage to the enemy; a strict union between the allies, but especially Britain and Holland, being doubtless the only means for procuring safe and honourable terms from France.|$|E

5000|$|Only {{specially}} instructed psychiatrists {{could recognize}} sluggish schizophrenia to indefinitely treat dissenters in a [...] "Special Psychiatric Hospital" [...] with heavy doses of antipsychotic medication. Convinced of the immortality of the totalitarian USSR, Soviet psychiatrists, especially in Moscow, {{did not hesitate}} to form [...] "scientific" [...] articles and defend dissertations by using the cases of dissidents. For example, Snezhnevsky diagnosed dissident Vladimir Bukovsky as schizophrenic on 5 July 1962 and on 12 November 1971 wrote to writer Viktor Nekrasov that the characteristics of Bukovsky's mental disease were included in the dissertation by Snezhnevsky's colleague. All the paper products were available in medical libraries. As Semyon Gluzman recollects, when he returned to Kiev in 1982 after his absence of ten years, he was amazed to see all this [...] "scientific" [...] literature in open storage at the Kiev medical library and was even more amazed to read all the [...] "ridiculous stuff" [...] hardly put into scientific psychiatric terminology. In their papers and dissertations on treatment for <b>litigiousness</b> and reformism, Kosachyov and other Soviet psychiatrists recommended compulsory treatment for persons with <b>litigiousness</b> and reformism, in the same psychiatric hospitals used for murderers: [...] Compulsory treatment in psychiatric hospitals of special type is to be recommended in cases of brutal murders committed on delusional grounds as well as in cases of persistent <b>litigiousness</b> and reformism with an inclination to induce surrounding persons and with a tendency to repetition of the illegal acts.|$|E

50|$|The book {{is set in}} {{the ancient}} Greek town of Abdera in Thrace and is divided into five chapters, each {{depicting}} a different aspect of the Abderites' foolishness. In the first, Demokritus unter der Abderiten, the philosopher Democritus returns to his home town but finds that the inhabitants doubt his sanity. The second chapter, Hippocrates in Abdera, portrays the physician Hippocrates evaluating Democritus and finding him sane, but the townspeople mad. Euripides in Abdera, the third chapter, is principally a literary satire that reflects the contemporary German enthusiasm for the theatre, while the fourth chapter, Der Prozeß um des Esels Schatten, depicts a legal battle between an ass driver and the animal's hirer, highlighting the extreme <b>litigiousness</b> of the Abderites. In the final part, Die Frösche der Latona, divisions between rival sects of frog-worshippers mean that the Abderites fail to take action against the town's sacred frogs and consequently find themselves being driven out of their homes. At the end of the book, Wieland makes his satirical intent clear with the statement that although Abdera had long since disappeared, the Abderites still exist and {{are to be found in}} every town and city in Germany.|$|E
