Several interested breeders began a campaign of preservation and promotion, which resulted in a Canadian team winning the 1987 North American Driving Championships. Popularity began to increase, and by the mid-1990s population numbers were between 2,500 and 3,000, and The Livestock Conservancy, which had classified the breed as [...] "critical", changed its designation to [...] "rare". With the increase in popularity came pressure for the breed standard to change to meet modern show and market trends, by breeding for taller horses with more refinement. In 2002, the Canadian Horse Heritage and Preservation Society was formed in response to these pressures, with a goal of preserving the original Canadian horse type.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} livestock {{improvement in}} developing countries, records on animal populations and their various productivity levels are important. However, in these countries, livestock recording presents a huge challenge. This paper presents {{an outline of}} the historical developments and the current scenario in dairy and beef recording in Kenya, where a recording scheme {{has been in place}} since 1963, yet the productive potential of most animals in the country remains unknown. The paper brings into context the state of recording in relation to the potential for future developments in dairy and beef production within the country. Despite the enormous existing potential, low numbers of <b>livestock</b> <b>records</b> are captured due to multiple challenges, which include limited funding, lack of incentives to record, limited feedback on records, a fragmented organizational structure, poor infrastructure, limited numbers of skilled personnel and lack of supporting policies. Strategies to overcome the challenges and achieve more sustainable utilization of the existing livestock populations are discussed. Linking recording to key service providers within the livestock production sector could enhance data collection, processing and feedback to livestock producers. The quality of extension services provided must be improved in order to holistically support livestock production. Recent international regulations on the traceability of livestock products sold within different countries mean that unless Kenya implements a robust animal recording programme, the country will be locked out of markets for its livestock products...|$|E

This report is a summary of the financial and production records kept by dairy farmers enrolled in the Telfarm/MicroTel record program through Michigan State University Extension. Farm records were included if a Finan summary was completed on 1999 data including beginning and ending balance sheets, plus income and expenses. The summary was included if cash discrepancy was less than 10 % of gross cash inflow, and if the debt discrepancy was less than $ 1, 000. The averages are reported in the tables that follow; it should be recognized that considerable variability exists in the data. The unweighted mean of the net farm income for the 7 farms was $ 37, 342, the standard deviation of the mean was $ 46, 573 and the median was $ 37, 342. The unweighted mean of the acres cropped was 738; the standard deviation of the mean was 214, and the median was 738. This report has three purposes: 1) to provide statistical information about the financial results on dairy farms during 1999; 2) to provide production costs for comparative analysis and forward planning; and 3) to provide information on the trends in resource use, income and costs during the last few years. Following long term trends may be a problem, as Telfarm/MicroTel and the Department of Agricultural Economics in 1995 adopted Finansum and a different software package for doing annual analysis.

40|$|What is {{the role}} of the ARC-AII in {{livestock}} management? The ARC-AII´s two key responsibilities are to carry out national research and development (R&D) in the field of livestock productivity, and to manage the National <b>Livestock</b> <b>Recording</b> and Improvement Schemes. Our activities put researchers and other institute personnel in direct contact with livestock farmers, industry and policy makers. We assess the needs of all livestock farmers, and develop products that will address those needs. What {{is the role}} of ICTs in livestock management and ARC-AII activities? In Africa, ICTs have become important tools for <b>recording</b> <b>livestock</b> performance and production levels. Many commercial farmers run PC-based recording and management software that turns raw performance data into information that can be used immediately at the local farm level. In many countries ICTs do not go beyond this level, but in South Africa most local livestock data is fed into the centralized Integrated Registration and Genetic Information System (INTERGIS). INTERGIS is managed by the ARC-AII as part of the National Recording and Improvement Schemes. The system sets national livestock productivity benchmarks, enables comparisons of all animals in terms of genetic potential, and provides policymakers and farmers with a reliable source of reference. INTERGIS therefore plays a pivotal role in keeping South Africa´s livestock producers globally competitive. INTERGIS contains productivity and performance data for beef cattle, dairy animals, small stock, pigs and poultry. Farmers or ARC-AII personnel record the data electronically at farm level using a PC or Palmtop and free software that allows them to directly transfer the data to INGERGIS. What are the challenges the ARC-AII faces in applying ICTs? Our biggest challenge is to expand the number of farm units with performance recording capabilities while maintaining our high levels of service for existing programme participants. Another challenge lies in maintaining the fine balance that exists between our R&D and technology transfer activities and the ICT skills and needs of livestock producers in South Africa. When developing applications that make livestock management practices more efficient and less time-consuming, our scientists always have to keep in mind that the majority of end-users will not be computer or ICT-literate. What are the most promising developments in the field of ICTs and livestock management, and how is the ARC-AII planning to pursue them? Advances in Palmtop technology and electronic reporting in standardized formats like PDF, as well as improved access to the web and thin client technology, are having a major impact on the uptake of <b>livestock</b> <b>recording.</b> Thin client technology, or server-based computing, enables users to access and use applications like word processing and spreadsheets over the Internet without having to install the software on their own computer. Another important development has been the rise of open source technology, which makes many ICT applications more affordable and is allowing Africans to develop and maintain their own ICT capacities. Many ARC-AII initiatives are based on open source technology - all our genetic evaluations as well as our pig recording and improvement database and web systems run on Linux. Also, investments in additional infrastructure, and mobile phone networks in particular, will allow livestock farmers and businesses in rural areas to gain faster and more efficient access to resources that could improve their livelihoods. mailto:japie@irene. agric. za Dr Japie van der Westhuizen is ARC-AII deputy director.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of the municipal water supply in Walkerton, Ontario with E. coli and the resulting human tragedy shocked the public. While {{we may never know}} the source of the contamination, an anxious public is looking for answers and livestock agriculture is a leading suspect. In particular, "factory farms" are coming under increased scrutiny. What is <b>livestock's</b> <b>record</b> of safety and accountability with respect to manure runoff and water contamination, {{and what can be done}} to ensure that livestock operations are both safe and efficient? Little hard evidence exists on these topics- this paper raises questions and discusses the following issues: * What are the sources of water contamination in rural areas, and how significant is livestock agriculture's contribution to the problem? * Are "factory farms" responsible for water quality problems? * What steps must be taken to ensure that livestock agriculture does not degrade water quality and remains competitive? Commercial livestock facilities in Canada have received increased public scrutiny recently. For example, Maclean's cover story for June 12 th, 20001 asserts that "there are dangerous consequences of factory farming that are being felt across the country".

40|$|Development of the {{livestock}} industry {{and its role}} in poverty alleviation in developing countries depends on how adaptive the production systems are to changing global environmental and economic trends. This paper characterizes dairy production systems in India, Tanzania, Kenya and Nicaragua, and describes the genetic and breeding technologies that hold promise for the advancement of global development goals. The dairy value chain has been prioritized for development under the CGIAR research programme on Livestock and Fish in Tanzania (East Africa), India (South Asia) and Nicaragua (Latin America), while ILRI is involved in research on dairy development in Kenya. In all the countries, a large number of smallholder farmers operating mixed crop–livestock production systems {{play a significant role in}} dairy production. In Tanzania, Kenya and Nicaragua, milk is predominantly produced by cattle of genotypes that differ both across countries and among production systems within the same country. In India, buffaloes contribute to a larger proportion of the national milk than cattle. Information on productivity per animal and on optimal genotypes to utilize within the smallholder production systems of all the countries is however limited. Crossbreeding and artificial insemination were identified as the most widely utilized breeding and reproductive technologies. Only in Kenya is there a national organization conducting <b>livestock</b> <b>recording</b> and monitoring productivity, however, the proportion of the dairy cattle population enrolled in the recording system is small (< 2. 5 percent). In all the countries, enhanced and adequately planned use of breeding and reproductive technologies, complemented with the relevant infrastructure, is needed to sustainably increase dairy productivity.
