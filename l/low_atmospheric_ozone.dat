We {{would also like to thank}} the Kari Palmer and Gre-gory Pratt of the Minnesota Pollution Control agency for providing ozone data and relevant information. Additionally, we are grateful to Wei-Hsin Fu for help with ArcGIS. We model and attempt to forcast <b>low</b> level <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration across Min-nesota in a Bayesian setting. Our data include 2007 ozone measurements from the Min-nesota Pollution Control Agency as well as meteorological data. Our model, based on McMillan et al., is hierarchical and incorporates nearest neighbor spatial and time series parameters. We compute the posterior distributions using Gibbs sampling and slice sam-pling, implemented with WinBUGS. We provide an overview of Bayesian hierarchical mod-eling and our data, and discuss the rationale for the model. Our results indicate that ozone concentration is primarily dependent on the previous day’s ozone concentration in the same location and the concentration to the west, with temperature and pressure also significant factors. Our predictions are, at least for two days into the future, fairly accurate but mis...|$|R

40|$|The {{average amount}} of ozone {{measured}} in the cabins of two B- 747 airliners varied from 40 percent to 80 percent of the atmospheric concentrations without special ozone destruction systems. A charcoal filter in the cabin air inlet system of one B- 747 reduced the ozone to about 5 percent of the atmospheric concentration. A Learjet 23 was also instrumented with monitors to measure simultaneously the <b>atmospheric</b> and <b>ozone</b> concentrations. Results indicate that {{a significant portion of}} the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is not destroyed in the pressurization system and remains in the aircraft cabin of the Learjet.

40|$|Abstract. For the 27 -year period 1933 - 1959 inclusive, highly {{significant}} negative correlation is {{found between the}} relative sunspot number and the worldwide average of total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Peak correlation {{with respect to the}} present-day 10 -year sunspot cycle is found at a lag of 1 •/ • to 2 years of the sunspots relative to ozone. The peak correlation of total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> with the mean latitudinal distance from the solar equator of the total area of sunspots is almost identical in magnitude to that with sunspot number. Itowever, the peak correlation with sunspot latitude is found at a lag of less than 6 months of the ozone relative to sunspot latitude, in the opposite direction to that with sunspot number. This phase difference of the negative correlation suggests that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is much more sensitive to sunspot latitude than to sunspot number. INTRODUCTORY P•EMARKS The author's longtime interest in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> as a possible link between solar activity and climate was increased by the implications of a recent paper by Kraus [1961].

40|$|Recently, {{passengers}} and crew members on long-distance commercial flights have filed complaints after suffering symptoms of ozone sickness. Studies were conducted to determine the frequency and concentration of ozone in commercial jet transports. The airliner problem with ozone prompted NASA to determine the ozone concentrations that might be encountered in the cabin of a small business jet. Simultaneous measurements of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels and ozone levels in the cabins of jet aircraft were necessary because of the wide and rapid variability of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> in flight. It {{was found that the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations in the case of B- 747 airliners vary widely during a flight. A constant difference, or ratio, between ozone concentrations outside and inside the cabin does not exist...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. The role of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> {{to protect}} the living {{organism}} from the ul-traviolet radiation is well known. It saves the earth from the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun. Some stable chlorine gases released by the human activities going above the earth eat up the ozone layer. Depletion {{of the ozone layer}} is a great threat to the human society. In this paper, we discuss the lethal effects of the ozone depletion and compute the upper and lower β content confidence limits for an extreme value distribution and show that this can be used to calculate the upper and lower tolerance limits to the level of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. The technique is explained by a data set. 1...|$|R
