40|$|Development of a Network ofBaltic German Agricultural SocietiesThe first {{agricultural}} {{society in the}} Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire was the Livonian Public Welfare and Economic Society (LS) established in 1792 in Riga (approved by the Empress in 1794 and started operating in 1796). Having been transferred from Riga to Tartu in 1813, the society operated here until 1939. In accordance with diversifying economic activities {{as well as the}} agrotechnical innovation of agriculture that started in the 1820 s, the LS endeavoured to extend the scope of its field of activities. On the one hand, it purportedto coordinate the activities of the analogous societies in thethree Baltic provinces, or, indeed, to be their umbrella organisation. On the other hand, it was attempted to create branch societies with an unlimited membership, and, thereafter, sub-institutions for performing specific tasks. Thus, a merino sheep purchase boom facilitated the establishment of the Livonian Sheep Breeders’ Association in 1825, which cooperated with a similar association in Estonia. In the late 1830 s the first pan-governorate agricultural societies were established also in the neighbouring provinces. On 31 st October 1839 the Emperor approved the articles of association of three agricultural societies (Courland, Kuldīga, and Estonia). Since the administration hindered the establishment of pan-governorate affiliate societies untilthe last decades of the 19 th century, the Courland Economic Society and Estonian Agricultural Society (Estländische Landwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft) subsequently needed to perform the functions of an umbrella organisation in their provinces, similarly to the Society in Livonia. Differently from the LS which included only a limited numberof members, the societies in Courland and all the three provinces were open, i. e., accepted an unlimited number of members. They accepted people interested in the subject from all classes and admitted them by voting during general assemblies. Upon the initiative of LS several agricultural societies were created in Livonia in the early 1840 s; they were established as branches or affiliates of the Society. The Livonian Society of Agriculture and Promotion of Trade (LSAPT, Livländischer Verein zur Beförderung der Landwirtschaft und des Gewerbfleisses), the articles of association ofwhich were approved in 1844, was the most important affiliate of LS and its direct extension. The most extensive undertakings of LSAPT were the organisation of annual exhibitions in Tartu as of 1876, and the publication of the weekly newspaper Baltische Wochenschrift für Landwirtschaft, Gewerbefleiss und Handel (1863 – 1915) intended for the readership of the three Baltic governorates in cooperation with the Society. The Agricultural Societies of Pärnu–Viljandi and Kuressaare were approved only as late as 1845. Since the sphere of activity of LSAPT first and foremost enveloped the vicinity of Tartu and Northern Livonia in terms of its location and membership, the estate owners in the <b>Latvian</b> <b>section</b> of Livonia established their own society in early 1848. At first it bore the name of the Agricultural Society of Võnnu–Volmari–Valka; as of 1866, however, it was changed to the SouthernLivonian Public Welfare and Agricultural Society and the hub of its activities transferred to Riga. The last of the LS County affiliates to be established in 1877 was the Agricultural Society of Võru. In {{the last quarter of the}} 19 th century and the early 20 th century a number of LS’s affiliates were established as pan-governorate specialty societies (some also as societies functioning in all the Baltic governorates) : Baltic Foresters’ Society (Verein baltischer Forstwirte) in 1867; Baltic Cattle Breeders’ Society (Verband Baltischer Rindviehzüchter) in 1885 —this was divided into the Baltic Angler Breeders’ Society (Verband baltischer Anglerviehzüchter) in 1904 / 2 and the Livonian Dutch Friesian Cattle Breeders’ Society (Verband livländischer Holländer-Friesenviehzüchter) in 1904; Livonian Society for the Promotion of Horse Breeding (Verein zur Förderung der livländischen Pferdezucht) 1897; Livonian Society for the Promotion of Women’s Works (Livländischer Verein zur Förderung der Frauenarbeit) in 1897; Livonian Seed Producers’ Society in 1900; Livonian Gardening Society in 1901; Baltic Swamp Land Improvement Society (Baltischer Moorverein) in 1908; Baltic Association of Cold-Blooded Horse Breeders (Baltischer Verein von Züchter kaltblütiger Pferde) in 1912. Agricultural Societies were also established in parishes; in the <b>Latvian</b> <b>section</b> of Livonia: Ruhja in 1877; Salatsi in 1884; Pociemsi in 1888; Smiltene–Palsmane–Aumeisteri–Gaujiena in 1884; Vendzava in 1897 and Limbaži-Suntaži-Allaži in 1904; in the Estonian section, the Agricultural Societies of Vändra in 1895, Kodavere in 1896, Räpina in 1898; and Laiuse in 1900; while Kanepi–Antsla Agricultural Society was established in 1891. The membership of the former consisted nearly exclusively of Baltic German estateowners and scientists in the specialised field concerned; while the latter, LS’s affiliates in the parishes were so-called mixed societies, which also included Estonian or Latvian farmers besides the estate owners and officials, who occupied the dominant positions. Most of the Estonian and Latvian farmers’ societies were independent from the start, while the leadership of the aforementioned mixed societies transferred to small farmers at the beginning of the 20 th century. As at 1915 the status of Society affiliates had been granted to 26 societies on the basis of the articles of association; six of those housed their headquarters in the facilities of the Society in Tartu, Lossi 1 - 3. Compared to the active and close-knit network of societies in Livonia the establishment of societies was slower in the governorate of Estonia; there were also considerably fewer societies—both those of Baltic German great landowners as well as of Estonian small farmers. In the first thirty years of the 19 th century the large scale farmers were united only by the Estonian Agricultural Society. The most fundamental changes in reorganising the Estonian agriculture took place in the 1860 s and 1870 s, while the county affiliates of Estonian Agricultural Society in Virumaa (1869) and Läänemaa (1872) were also founded then. The specialty societies that functioned with a fluctuating degree of activity were a hunting society (Estländische Wildschutzverein) and gardening society. After the establishment of the Courland Economic Society (CES) and the Kuldiga AS (1839), the following 4 ASs were founded considerably later—in Tukums in 1867, Dobele in 1871, Jaunjelgava in 1877, Talsi 1878. Since a sufficient number of members there were already members of the CES, the representatives of the aforementioned local societies declared CES the central society and themselves as branch societies. The most close-knit, varied and active network of Baltic German agricultural societies developed owing tothe LS specifically in Livonia...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Biostratigraphically {{significant}} finds of {{two important}} species of Nemagraptus in the Middle and Upper Ordovician car-bonate sections of Baltoscandia are reviewed. Nemagraptus subtilis {{is found in}} {{the lower part of the}} Uhaku Regional Stage, which is correlated with the Hustedograptus teretiusculus graptolite zone. Nemagraptus gracilis is restricted to the upper part of the Kukruse Stage in the Central and South Estonian and western <b>Latvian</b> <b>sections.</b> This level correlates with the Nemagraptus gracilis graptolite Zone. The vertical distribution of these taxa is similar to, although less complete than, their ranges in the classic black shale succession in Scania, southern Sweden. The first three-dimensionally preserved specimens of N. subtilis are illustrated and described. Nemagraptus subtilis can be differentiated from N. gracilis by its lack of cladial branches, more slender stipes, shorter sicula, and upward orientation of the first two thecae.

25|$|The Law on Electronic Media prescribes that {{national}} and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in <b>Latvian</b> language (<b>section</b> 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: The {{contributors}} to this volume come from countries in Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia and the U. S. A. to offer insights into selected themes of applied linguistics organized under the letter ‘P’: Policies, Practices, Proficiencies, Parity, Presence and Prosperity. The major theme underlying the volume {{is the question}} of how effective national language policies are and whether language-in-education policy is possible (Robert Kaplan. The volume poses further questions: How can language proficiency achieved and assessed more effectively? How can language communities maintain their linguistic and cultural heritage? Richard Lambert (USA) provides a succinct overview of language policy across the globe, Colin Power (Australia) considers the linguistic needs in an increasingly globalised world. Some other papers focus on language policy issues in the European Union, (see e. g. Guus Extra, The Netherlands) and the English Only Policy in the United States (see Zeynep Beykont). Other contexts include the Fiji Islands (Francis Mangubhai) and Senegal (Ibrahima Diallo). The second section of the book addresses the issues of language teaching practices. Some of the main themes include intercultural language teaching (Tony Liddicoat, Australia and Svetlana Ter-Minasova (Russia), leaner independence (Terry Lamb, U. K and Hayo Reinders, New Zealand). An interesting addition to the volume is the theme of peace education through language education (Reinhold Freudenstein, Germany) cooperative learning and teacher professional development (Indra Odina, Latvia), a case study of an Internet-facilitated exchange program (Shirley O’Neill, Australia Chen Nian-Shing, (Taiwan) Li Min-Lee,(Taiwan) Mokoto Kageto (Japan), computer assisted language learning (Laurence Quinlivan and Denis Cunningham (Australia)) and the concept of communicative competence (Indra Karapetjana, Latvia). The third section deals with language proficiencies. Sabine Doff and Jan Franz (Germany) analyse the Common European Framework of Reference (CEF). Ieva Zuicena (Latvia) considers developments and the evolution of the language proficiency levels in learning <b>Latvian.</b> The fourth <b>section</b> of the volume titled “Parity, Presence and Prosperity” deals with the retention of linguistic diversity. Contributors to this section identify solutions for the maintenance of linguistic diversity in the world and in various ethnolinguistic communities. Alan Hedley (Canada) uses a web analysis of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Anikó Hatoss (Australia) reports on a sociolinguistic study of the Hungarian community of Queensland. Marie-Claire Patron (Australia) discusses language maintenance the context of Franco-Mauritians in Australia. Francisco Gomes de Matos, (Brazil), discusses linguistic rights and peace linguistics. ...|$|R
