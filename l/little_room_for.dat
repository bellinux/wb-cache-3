5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> further expansion.|$|E
5|$|The Down Relief {{line between}} Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion. According to the Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy, in the December 2007 timetable period, the line through Parson Street was running at over 75% capacity in the morning peak between 8 and 9am. It was predicted that by 2019, trains working the line would be completely full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> growth. Parson Street Junction will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E
5|$|When {{serialization}} began, Kishimoto {{decided the}} ending would feature {{a fight between}} two characters: Naruto and Sasuke, which would end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from {{the early stages of}} the manga, since Hinata had always respected Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his wife because she wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno, but Kishimoto viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a love triangle among the three characters, but because he decided that fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> romantic plotlines.|$|E

5|$|Within Mississauga, {{the freeway}} {{encounters}} its narrowest right-of-way, sandwiched between residential subdivisions {{on either side}} that prevent further expansion. It crosses the Credit River Valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but, like the previous section, there is <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway427 at a large sprawling interchange. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the Humber River; this section was downloaded from provincial to municipal ownership on April1, 1997, and {{became part of the}} Gardiner Expressway.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series of {{personal}} and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

25|$|Two-family {{houses were}} village residences either {{originally}} built or later modified to house an owner and tenant. They are generally {{similar to that}} form, except for some turn-of-the-century designs where architects {{took advantage of the}} larger size to scale the form up. Some were divided vertically to look like two row houses. They are usually two stories in height, taking up most of the larger lots they occupy, leaving <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> yards.|$|E
25|$|The Second Malaysia Plan also {{hoped to}} {{increase}} the availability of vocational and technical training. Despite some attempts, little progress was made in improving the curriculum, which focused on providing a general education and made <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> vocational or technical training. Several new technical and vocational schools were built under the Second Malaysia Plan, with seven institutions alone completed in 1975. It was hoped this would alleviate the problem of unemployment, especially among the youth.|$|E

25|$|Such an all-encompassing love often leaves <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> other affections. Hephaestion was {{the best}} friend of Alexander, his king and his {{commanding}} officer, {{so it is not}} surprising that we only hear of several other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he was anything but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions who had grown up together, and worked well together for so many years.|$|E

Consequently, he has also an excellent economy rate in this format of the game.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{instruments}} tend {{to work in}} sections, {{with groups}} of trombones or flutes or whatever alternating or overlapping in tone blocks that are displaced from each other rhythmically, ultimately to a heavy effect that leaves <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> luminosity. Indeed, rhythm was the score’s strong suit, and sometimes it injected considerable momentum. By the end, though, it did not sustain a score of this length on its own, unassisted as it was by concomitant strength in harmonic direction or, most regrettably, melodic contour.|$|E

However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, profits are only very rarely high enough. 80% of {{national}} income is wages, and only about 6% is profits after tax, providing very <b>little</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> higher wages, even if profits could be totally used up. Moreover, profits are invested leading {{to an increase in}} capital: which raises the value of labor, increasing wages. If profits were totally removed, this source of wage increase would be removed.|$|E
