25|$|This {{term has}} no {{generally}} accepted meaning. Originally it {{referred to a}} gearing arrangement which had one especially <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> (for climbing Alpine passes); this <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> often had a larger than average jump to the next lowest gear. In the 1960s the term was used by salespeople to refer to then current 10-speed bicycles (2 chainrings, 5-sprocket cogset), without any regard to its original meaning. The nearest current equivalent to the original meaning {{can be found in}} the Shimano Megarange cogsets, where most of the sprockets have roughly a 15% relative difference, except for the largest sprocket which has roughly a 30% difference; this provides a much lower gear than normal at the cost of a large gearing jump.|$|E
25|$|At the March 2013 hearing, Ellerbe {{also accused}} his department's {{mechanics}} and rank-and-file firefighters of purposefully sabotaging equipment. He cited the D.C. Inspector General's report of February 2013, which {{said there had}} been allegations of sabotage (including driving vehicles in <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> to damage transmissions, slashing tires, and tampering with air conditioners). The following month, Ellerbe claimed he had complete confidence in the repair personnel at DCFEMS.|$|E
25|$|Rambler's {{emphasis}} on economy over performance {{can be observed}} through the example of automatic transmission use in a Rambler American where the 1959 owner's handbook describes leaving the gear selector in the D-2 position (1.47:1 gear ratio) blocks access to <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> (2.40 ratio) when starting out from a stop; therefore, given the car's 3.31 axle, this yields an initial 4.86:1 final drive ratio reducing crankshaft revolutions for maximum fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|Some {{motoring}} {{journalists were}} critical of untamed torque steer in <b>low</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gear inches is one {{of several}} {{relative}} measures of bicycle gearing, giving an indication of the mechanical advantage of different gears. Values for 'gear inches' typically range from 20 (very <b>low</b> <b>gearing)</b> via 70 (medium gearing) to 125 (very high gearing); as in a car, <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> is for going up hills and high gearing is for going fast.|$|R
50|$|The IGR, hub {{revolutions}} per sprocket {{revolution of}} the Speedhub, lies between 0.279 and 1.467 depending on the gear chosen. The Speedhub has a 526&thinsp;% range between the highest and <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> Gear 11, with a ratio of 1.0, is called the neutral gear.|$|R
25|$|Different {{gears and}} ranges of gears are {{appropriate}} for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|The Model T's {{transmission}} {{was controlled}} with three foot pedals and a lever mounted {{to the road}} side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever on the steering wheel. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered <b>low</b> <b>gear.</b> When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up {{as far as the}} central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.|$|E
500|$|Merlin X with Stanley Hooker re-designed {{supercharger}} incorporating re-designed inlet {{and improved}} guide vanes on impeller with revised blower gear ratios; 8:15:1 for <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> 9:49:1 for high gear. New larger SU twin choke updraught carburettor. Engine interchangeable with Merlin X. Rated at 1,240-horsepower (924kW) at 2,850rpm in <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> at 10,000 feet and +9lb boost; 1,175-horsepower (876kW) at 2,850rpm in high gear at 17,500 feet at +9lb boost.

Engine used in Bristol Beaufighter II, Boulton Paul Defiant II, Handley Page Halifax II and V, Hawker Hurricane II and IV, and Avro Lancaster I and III. First Merlin produced by Packard Motor Car Company as V-1650-1 and designated by Rolls-Royce as Merlin 28.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{diesel engines}} in {{locomotives}} and some watercraft use diesel-electric drive. This eliminates {{the complexities of}} extremely <b>low</b> <b>gearing,</b> as described below.|$|R
60|$|They {{had passed}} the steepest pitch of the hill, but Aynsley threw in the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> and turned quietly to his father.|$|R
5|$|The T-26 mod. 1939 with appliqué armour weighed , {{which caused}} an {{overload}} of the chassis, transmission, and {{engine of the}} light tank. Drivers were advised to use <b>low</b> <b>gears</b> only.|$|R
500|$|First Merlin with {{two-speed}} supercharger, 1,145-horsepower (853kW) in <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> at 5,250 feet, 1,010-horsepower (754kW) in {{high gear}} at 17,750 feet.

500|$|Powered turret {{traverse}} {{was provided}} by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6º/second in <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> independent of engine rpm, at 19º/second — the same as with the Tiger I — [...] with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually turn the turret at one-half a degree per 360º turn.|$|E
2500|$|On some bicycles, {{there is}} only one gear and the gear ratio is fixed. Many {{contemporary}} bicycles have multiple gears and thus multiple gear ratios. A shifting mechanism allows selection of the appropriate gear ratio for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances: for example, it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> when cycling uphill. [...] Different gear ratios and gear ranges are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling.|$|E
50|$|The Mazda Scrum uses a 660 cc DOHC three-cylinder {{engine and}} is {{available}} with 4WD or 2WD. The 4WD version can also be switched between 4WD and 2WD and has high and <b>low</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
25|$|McLaren Automotive {{introduced}} a seven speed dual clutch on MP4-12C made in Italy by Oerlikon Graziano. The design {{comes with a}} feature called Pre-Cog that lets the driver preselect the next highest or <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> decreasing shift times.|$|R
25|$|French Presidents from Georges Pompidou to Jacques Chirac {{have enjoyed}} touring Paris {{in the two}} 4-door {{convertible}} Citroën SM présidentielle models, sharing them with such notables as Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II. These manual transmission cars have special <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> suitable for parade use.|$|R
2500|$|Rambler {{also was}} an early pioneer in {{offering}} an automatic shift indicator sequence (P R N D2 D1 L, where if one selected [...] "D2", the car started in second gear, while [...] "1" [...] started in first gear) on its [...] "Flash-O-Matic" [...] transmission {{which is similar to}} today's [...] "PRNODSL", made mandatory for the 1968 model year cars, which required a neutral position between reverse and drive, while General Motors still offered a shift selector that had reverse immediately next to <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> (PNDSLR) well into the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Various safety {{measures}} were {{implemented by the}} New York State Department of Public Works (NYSDPW) {{in response to the}} frequent accidents. Northbound truck drivers were forced to travel in <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> and three runaway truck ramps were constructed at the tight curves along the highway for trucks whose brakes had failed. Additionally, the existing signage along the road was supplemented by new warning signs. More substantial changes to the road were suggested as early as March 1958 when several local grange halls petitioned then-Governor W. Averell Harriman to eliminate the curves altogether by straightening the road. In 1964, NYSDPW unveiled plans for a new bypass that would avoid the accident-prone route and meet NY5S at an interchange west of Sprakers. The contract for the $2.4million project (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was let in January 1967, and the highway took about two years to construct. Sprakers Hill Road is now maintained by Montgomery County as CR108.|$|E
2500|$|Some road {{racing and}} club cyclists use a fixed-gear bicycle for {{training}} {{during the winter}} months, generally using a relatively <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, believed to help develop a good pedalling style. In the UK until the 1950s it was common for riders to use fixed-gear bicycles for time trials. [...] The 1959 British 25 mile time trial championship was won by Alf Engers with a competition record of 55 minutes 11 seconds, riding an 84inch fixed-gear bicycle. The fixed-gear was also commonly used, {{and continues to be}} used in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn. [...] A typical club men's fixed-gear machine would have been a [...] "road/path" [...] or [...] "road/track" [...] cycle. In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same bike when stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time trials and track racing, and when fitted with mudguards (fenders) and a bag, it was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the 1960s, multi-gear derailleurs had become the norm and riding fixed-gear bicycles on the road declined over the next few decades. Recent years have seen renewed interest and increased popularity of fixed-gear cycling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} was a Warner T93 5-speed with {{a direct}} 4th gear and overdrive 5th gear. The transfer case had high and <b>low</b> <b>gears,</b> and engaged the front axle. Originally all axles were a Timken split type, later trucks also used GM [...] "banjo" [...] types.|$|R
50|$|A bicycle with a 26-inch wheel, a 48-tooth chainring, and a {{cassette}} with gears ranging from 11 to 34 teeth has a <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> of 26 &times; 48 / 34 = 37 gear inches and a highest gear of 26 &times; 48 / 11 = 113 gear inches.|$|R
50|$|Unlike class 306, {{the eight}} class 506s {{remained}} solely equipped for 1,500V DC operation for their entire lives. This made them unable {{to operate on}} any lines other than the Woodhead route — although they rarely operated east of Hadfield due to <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> {{and the risk of}} overheating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{this is some}} climb, believe me!" [...] cried Roger, as {{they made}} another turn, and Dave found it {{advisable}} {{to come down to}} <b>low</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{keep her}} in <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> Dave," [...] said Dunston Porter, as the car struck a rather steep incline. [...] "The engine will help hold her back." ...|$|E
60|$|Tom nodded {{but said}} not a word. He had thrown the motive {{power to the}} <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> and thus the engine was doing {{something}} towards holding the car back.|$|E
50|$|The crawl {{ratio is}} aptly named because when a vehicle is driven using the <b>lowest</b> <b>gear</b> (i.e. first gear), it moves the slowest (i.e. crawl speed) {{at a given}} engine rpm, and thus {{produces}} the highest output torque (i.e. crawl torque) at the road wheels due to conservation of power.|$|R
50|$|High inertia is {{encountered}} {{when starting}} {{to move a}} heavy load. To overcome this, ballast tractors tend to have high powered, <b>low</b> <b>geared</b> engines that provide substantial torque, especially at low speeds. Additionally, ballast tractors are often fitted with heavy duty hub reduction axles, a combination resulting in exceptionally low maximum speeds.|$|R
50|$|In {{service the}} {{locomotives}} were {{used throughout the}} PO system where electrified; the initial specifications of the design, matching those used for the tunnel shuttle service on the Baltimore Belt Line were too <b>low</b> <b>geared</b> for the general network, and in 1904 seven locomotives were upgeared and the top speed raised to 100 km/h.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we'll make it--don't worry," [...] was the answer. [...] "I threw into <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> {{just for}} safety's sake. This road twists so a fellow can't see fifty feet ahead of him." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{driver was}} already {{in his seat and}} the motor was humming loudly. He threw in the <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> and off the touring car started slowly. After it clattered Dick and Tom, still a hundred feet in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll try to," [...] {{answered}} Dave, {{and then}} he threw in the clutch on <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> and the big touring car moved gently away, out of {{the grounds of the}} Wadsworth mansion and into the main highway leading from Crumville to Shady Glen Falls. The second car speedily followed.|$|E
50|$|Notice that {{in every}} case the force on the pedals {{is greater than the}} force driving the bicycle forward (in the {{illustration}} above, the corresponding backward-directed reaction force on the ground is indicated). This low mechanical advantage keeps the pedal crank speed low relative to the speed of the drive wheel, even in <b>low</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rohloff Speedhub is an {{epicyclic}} internal {{hub gear}} for bicycles, developed and patented by Rohloff AG. It has been manufactured and marketed by that company since 1998. The Speedhub 500/14 has 14 equally spaced sequential non-overlapping gear ratios {{operated by a}} single twistgrip. The overall gear range is 526%, meaning the highest gear is 5.26 times {{as high as the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> Individual gear shifts when shifting up give an increase of about 13.6% (equivalent to a decrease of about 12.0% when shifting down).|$|R
