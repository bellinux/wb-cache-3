60|$|As to {{the origin}} of this song--whether it came in its actual state from the brain of a single rhapsodist, or was {{gradually}} perfected by a school or succession of rhapsodists, I am ignorant. There is a stamp of unity, of individual genius upon it, which inclines me to the former hypothesis, though I am not blind to the consideration that this unity may rather have arisen from that consensus of many minds which was a condition of primitive thought, foreign to our modern consciousness. Some will perhaps think that they detect in the first quatrain an indication of a <b>lost</b> <b>line,</b> which later rhapsodists, failing in imaginative vigour, have supplied by the feeble device of iteration. Others, however, may rather maintain that this very iteration is an original felicity, to which none but the most prosaic minds can be insensible.|$|E

Now and then a man dropped his rifle {{and the rest of}} us set our teeth. It wasn't a spectacular fight, and we kept it up in a very informal way; two or three commissioned officers, dismounted troopers, and a few <b>lost</b> <b>line</b> Tommies, firing as they got a chance. The man I wanted had gone to earth beside a big flat stone, and I dropped the bullets close about it; a hundred yards I made it and the light good. I suppose I was so keen on my shooting that I didn't pay much attention when somebody said they were flanking us; and the next thing I knew a Boer had put a bullet in my leg. Anyhow, I couldn't get up, and when I looked round there was no one about. Then I must have shouted, for Tom came running back, with the sand spirting all round. Carnally was behind him. It looked like certain death, but Tom got hold of me, and dragged me a few yards before Carnally came up. Then we all dropped behind a big stone, and I'm not clear about the rest. Somebody had heard the firing and detached a squadron with a gun. But I can still picture Tom, running with his face set through the spirting sand--one doesn't forget things like that." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} as cytoplasmic RNA of integrated human adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) DNA in transformed and tumor cell lines and in revertants was investigated. The transformed and tumor cells contained multiple {{copies of the}} viral genome, 3 to 22 copies per cell in different cell lines. The integrated Ad 12 DNA molecules persisted intact or nearly intact {{and in most cases}} colinear with the virion DNA. In the revertant cell lines, which were derived from cell line T 637 (22 copies of Ad 12 DNA per cell), all of the Ad 12 DNA molecules were <b>lost</b> (<b>line</b> F 10) or only one copy and {{a fraction of a second}} copy persisted (line TR 12). The size classes and map locations of Ad 12 -specific cytoplasmic RNAs in three Ad 12 -transformed hamster cell lines (T 637, HA 12 / 7, and A 2497 - 3), in two revertant lines (F 10 and TR 12), in one Ad 12 -induced hamster (CLAC 3), and in one rat brain tumor line (RBT 12 / 3) were determined. Cytoplasmic RNA from uninfected B 3 hamster cells and from human KB cells productively infected with Ad 12 served as controls. In the latter control experiments, the RNA was isolated early or late postinfection. With respect to the amounts of Ad 12 -specific RNAs detected in cytoplasmic RNA from various Ad 12 -transformed or Ad 12 -induced tumor cell lines, we could not establish any correlations to the number of Ad 12 genome copies integrated into the cellular DNAs. Thus, the expression of the integrated viral genomes in these lines was regulated by mechanisms more complicated than simple gene dosage effects. Using cloned fragments of Ad 12 DNA as hybridization probes, we analyzed the cytoplasmic RNAs from the cell lines mentioned by electrophoresis on agarose gels, blotting, and DNA-RNA hybridization. For each transformed and tumor cell line, except for the revertants, several size classes of Ad 12 -specific cytoplasmic RNA were detected for the early E 1, E 2, and E 4 regions of Ad 12 DNA. Some of these size classes were similar but not identical to those observed in cytoplasmic RNA isolated early from human KB cells productively infected with Ad 12. Only cell lines A 2497 - 3, T 637, and RBT 12 / 3 contained several size classes of cytoplasmic RNA homologous to the E 3 region of Ad 12 DNA. Weak homologies to the E 1 region of Ad 12 DNA were also detected in the revertant lines F 10 and TR 12. Late regions of Ad 12 DNA were expressed as cytoplasmic RNA in cell lines CLAC 3 and RBT 12 / 3. Weak homologies were detected between certain segments of the Ad 12 genome (the EcoRI-B, -C, and -D fragments) and the cytoplasmic RNA from uninfected hamster cells. These homologies had no apparent counterpart at the level of DNA, perhaps because these homologies could be detected only due to an overrepresentation of RNA sequences. In preliminary experiments, we failed to detect the {{expression as}} cytoplasmic RNA of the so-called virus-associated RNA in transformed and tumor cell lines. Virus-associated RNA represents a population of low-molecular-weight RNAs that map at around 30 fractional length units on the viral genome...|$|E
