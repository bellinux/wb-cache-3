40|$|The {{idea for}} our senior design project {{stemmed from a}} list of {{potential}} design projects presented at the first E 90 meeting. Since we did not have a particular project in mind at the time we chose the resistor sorter. It appealed to us because we felt it would give us a chance to incorporate several different fields of engineering: mechanical, electrical and computer. The mechanical aspect was designing the system and building it in the shop; the electrical component consisted of designing a circuit to determine resistance which we then needed to program with specific outputs for each resistance. When we began designing the resistor sorter, we hoped its main purpose would be keeping the electronics <b>laboratory</b> <b>cleaner</b> and providing an easy and efficient method of sorting resistors. Looking at the electronics lab, there are a plethora of resistors scattered over the benches, {{and the only way to}} determine their values is by their unique color patterns. Our project aims to eliminate this tedious method. As we progressed we realized that our project could be used as a way of targeting younger students and getting them interested in engineering. Consequently, one of the new goals of our project became making it aesthetically pleasing...|$|E

We surveyed fields in three distinct areas of Texas and found that weevils can be present in large numbers in cotton fields that have been defoliated and desiccated in preparation for harvest, both as free adults and as immatures inside unopened bolls.

Marked weevils were forced through a <b>laboratory</b> field <b>cleaner</b> (bur extractor) commonly mounted on stripper-harvesters, and 14 % were recovered alive in the seed cotton fraction and lived at least to 24 h. Survival of weevils placed inside modules declined over time up to 7 d, but the magnitude of the decline varied with experimental conditions. In one experiment, 91 % of the weevils survived to 7 d, whereas under harsher environmental conditions, only 11 % survived that long. Together, our results indicate that when cotton is harvested in an infested area, boll weevils likely will be packed alive into cotton modules, and many will still be alive by the time the module is fed into the gin, at least up to 7 d after the module’s construction...|$|R

40|$|Compliance of {{different}} healthcare workers (HCWs) (nurses, physicians, <b>laboratory</b> technicians and <b>cleaners)</b> with protocols to prevent exposure to blood and body fluids (BBF) was studied. Questionnaires {{were used to}} assess perception of risks, familiarity with protocols, motivation and actual behaviour. Performance of the protocols in practice was also tested. The practical test provided more reliable results than the questionnaire. HCWs overestimated their knowledge and skills, and compliance was influenced by risk perception. HCWs encountered problems with comprehension, acceptability and applicability of protocols, especially for post-exposure precautions. Protocols are not tailored to the differences in knowledge, risk perception and practical needs {{of different}} professional groups, probably because HCWs have rarely been involved in writing them and they are governed more by legal considerations than applicability. Most HCWs experienced a lack of organizational support to aid compliance. To improve compliance, we recommend information and training on risk management and individual responsibilities regarding the safety of coworkers and patients, participation of HCWs in protocol development, and support of management to avoid reversion to previous habitual behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Sharps {{injuries}} {{are a major}} cause of transmission of hepatitis B and C viruses and human immunodeficiency virus in health-care workers. To determine the yearly incidence and causes of sharps injuries in health-care workers in Taiwan, we conducted a questionnaire survey in a total of 8645 health care workers, including physicians, nurses, <b>laboratory</b> technicians, and <b>cleaners,</b> from teaching hospitals of various sizes. The reported incidence of needlestick and other sharps injuries was 1. 30 and 1. 21 per person in the past 12 months, respectively. Of most recent episodes of needlestick/sharps injury, 52. 0 % were caused by ordinary syringe needles, usually in the patient units. The most frequently reported circumstances of needlestick were recapping of needles, and those of sharps injuries were opening of ampoules/vials. Of needles which stuck the health-care workers, 54. 8 % had been used in patients, 8. 2 % of whom were known to have hepatitis B or C, syphilis, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Sharps injuries in health-care workers in Taiwan occur more frequently than generally thought and risks of contracting blood-borne infectious diseases as a result are very high...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accidental {{exposure}} to blood and body secretions is frequent among {{health care workers}} (HCWs). They {{are at risk of}} acquiring blood-borne diseases. In this study, we have investigated the prevalence and risk factors of occupational exposure among the HCWs of the Emergency Departments (ED) at three teaching hospitals in Tehran. Materials and Methods: We conducted this observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study using a self-reporting 25 -question survey, related to occupational exposures, in February 2010. It was carried out among 200 HCWs (specialist physicians, residents, medical interns, nurses, <b>laboratory</b> personnel, housekeepers, <b>cleaners,</b> and others), who were working in the EDs of the three teaching hospitals of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The age, sex, and job category of the HCWs suffering from the injury were determined, as also the risk factors responsible for the exposure of the HCWs. Results: One hundred and fifteen (57. 5 %) of the 200 HCWs had had at least one episode of blood or body fluid exposure in their professional life. Hollow-bore needles accounted for the highest amount of injuries, with 41. 5 %, followed by suture needles (18. 5 %). The most prevalent procedures associated with injuries were suturing (17. 5 %) and recapping used syringes (16. 5 %), respectively. All the specialist doctors in this study reported at least one exposure. The percentage of exposure in the other participants of our study was 74. 3 % for ED residents, 61. 1 % for laboratory technicians, 51. 9 % for nurses, and 51 % for medical interns. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender, recapping needles, and job profession were independently associated with {{exposure to}} blood or body fluids. Conclusion: High prevalence of occupational exposure in this study emphasized the importance of promoting awareness, training, and education for the HCWs, for preventive strategies, and also reporting of occupational exposure to blood and body secretions...|$|R
5000|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average. However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. However men have a greater variability in intelligence and except in tests of reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals. Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains. Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which [...] "men {{are more likely to be}} cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. for women they are more likely to be secretaries, <b>laboratory</b> technicians, office <b>cleaners,</b> nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers".

40|$|Abstract Background Sex hormones closely {{regulate}} {{development of}} the male genital organs during fetal life. The hypothesis that xenobiotics may disrupt endogenous hormonal signalling has received considerable scientific attention, but human evidence is scarce. Objectives We analyse occurrence of hypospadias and cryptorchidism according to maternal and paternal occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals. Methods We conducted a follow-up study of 45, 341 male singleton deliveries in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1997 - 2009. Information on work during pregnancy was obtained by telephone interviews around gestational week 16. Parents' job titles were classified according to DISCO- 88. A job exposure matrix for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was implemented to assess occupational exposures. The Medical Birth and National Hospital Register provided data on congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth or during follow-up, which ended in 2009. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were obtained from Cox regression models. Results Among all pregnancies, 6. 3 % were classified as possibly or probably exposed to EDCs. The most prevalent occupations conferring possible exposure were <b>cleaners,</b> <b>laboratory</b> technicians, hairdressers and agricultural workers (58 % of all potentially exposed). The final cumulative incidence of cryptorchidism in boys was 2. 2 % (1002 cases), and of hypospadias 0. 6 % (262 cases). The occurrence of hypospadias increased when mothers were probably [HRa = 1. 8 (95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 6) ] or possibly exposed {{to one or more}} EDCs [HRa = 2. 6 (95 % CI 1. 8 - 3. 4). Possible paternal exposure to heavy metals increased the risk of hypospadias [HRa 2. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 0 - 3. 4) ] and cryptorchidism [HRa 1. 9 (95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 7) ]. None of the exposure groups reached statistical significance. Conclusion The study provides some but limited evidence that occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy increases the risk of hypospadias. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} U. S. natural gas reserves are subquality {{due to the}} presence of acid gases and nitrogen; 13 % of existing reserves (19 trillion cubic feed) may be contaminated with hydrogen sulfide. For natural gas to be useful as fuel and feedstock, this hydrogen sulfide has to be removed to the pipeline specification of 4 ppm. The technology used to achieve these specifications has been amine, or similar chemical or physical solvent, absorption. Although mature and widely used in the gas industry, absorption processes are capital and energy-intensive and require constant supervision for proper operation. This makes these processes unsuitable for treating gas at low throughput, in remote locations, or with a high concentration of acid gases. The U. S. Department of Energy, recognizes that exploitation of smaller, more sub-quality resources will be necessary to meet demand as the large gas fields in the U. S. are depleted. In response to this need, Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR) has developed membranes and a membrane process for removing hydrogen sulfide from natural gas. During this project, high-performance polymeric thin-film composite membranes were brought from the research stage to field testing. The membranes have hydrogen sulfide/methane selectivities in the range 35 to 60, depending on the feed conditions, and have been scaled up to commercial-scale production. A large number of spiral-wound modules were manufactured, tested and optimized during this project, which culminated in a field test at a Shell facility in East Texas. The short field test showed that membrane module performance on an actual natural gas stream was close to that observed in the <b>laboratory</b> tests with <b>cleaner</b> streams. An extensive technical and economic analysis was performed to determine the best applications for the membrane process. Two areas were identified: the low-flow-rate, high-hydrogen-sulfide-content region and the high-flow-rate, high-hydrogen-sulfide-content region. In both regions the MTR membrane process will be combined with another process to provide the necessary hydrogen sulfide removal from the natural gas. In the first region the membrane process will be combined with the SulfaTreat fixed-bed absorption process, and in the second region the membrane process will be combined with a conventional absorption process. Economic analyses indicate that these hybrid processes provide 20 - 40 % cost savings over stand-alone absorption technologies...|$|R
40|$|Cleaning by shrimp {{has been}} {{documented}} many times with reports being based mainly on anecdotal or descriptive reports of their associations with fish. This large number of reports suggests that cleaner shrimp may {{play an important role}} in marine ecosystems. This thesis combines observations and collections of cleaner shrimp in the wild at Lizard Island Australia and Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea with laboratory experiments that were designed to quantitatively examine the relationships between cleaner shrimp and their clients. Furthermore, biological market theory has been successfully used as a theoretical paradigm to explain the relationship between cleaner fish and their clients and is likely, therefore, to be applicable to the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes. The theory is based on four assumptions all of which were tested for in the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes. The first aim of this study was to determine whether cleaner shrimp remove and eat ectoparasites and other material from the body surface of animals that visit them. Gut content analyses of wild caught cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c and Periclimenes holthuisi revealed partially digested, crustacean ectoparasites. This shows, surprisingly for the first time, that cleaner shrimp in the wild do clean. The cleaner shrimp Perclimenes holthuisi significantly reduced monogenean loads on captive surgeon fish Ctenochaetus striatus in the laboratory. Such large reductions in parasite loads are likely to benefit individual fish. To determine whether cleaner shrimp base their choice of client fish on food patch quality (i. e., client fish ectoparasite load), the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c was offered a choice of parasitised and unparasitised rock cods Cephalopholis cyanostigma. To determine whether cleaner shrimp hunger levels influenced cleaning time, hunger levels in Urocaridella sp. c were manipulated and their behaviour towards parasitised rock cods was examined. Cleaner shrimp preferred parasitised to unparasitised rock cods and food-deprived cleaner shrimp cleaned parasitised rock cods for longer periods of time than satiated cleaner shrimp did. Therefore, variations in client fish ectoparasite load and cleaner shrimp hunger level are two factors that may affect the balance in the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes on coral reefs. These results satisfy the market assumption that partner choice is based on the value of the commodity on offer and that supply and demand control commodity value. Marine cleaners are known for stereotyped behaviours that likely serve as signals to advertise their cleaning services to clients. Cleaner shrimp are cryptic in comparison to cleaner fish, so signals are probably essential for cleaner shrimp to attract clients. Field observations revealed that the yellowbeaked cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c uses a stereotypical side-to-side movement, or rocking dance, while approaching potential client fish in the water column. This dance was followed by a cleaning interaction with the client 100 % of the time. In the <b>laboratory,</b> hungry <b>cleaner</b> shrimp spent more time rocking and in closer proximity to clients Cephalopholis cyanostigma than satiated ones, and when given a choice, clients preferred hungry, rocking cleaner shrimp. The rocking dance therefore influenced client behaviour, and thus appears to function as a signal to advertise the presence of cleaner shrimp to potential clients satisfying the third biological market assumption that the commodities on offer can be advertised. The fourth biological market assumption is that there is competition, via outbidding, among the more common trader for to the less common trader. Whether client fish outbid each other by being better cooperators, or physically compete to gain access to cleaner shrimp, was tested. Potential competitive behaviours were identified in the wild. In the laboratory there was no difference in the time client fish spent co-operating with cleaner shrimp when a potential competitor was present compared to when there was no potential competitor, thus there was no outbidding. Client fish, suprisingly, were significantly more aggressive towards the treatment client fish when there was no cleaner shrimp compared to when a cleaner shrimp was present. In a second experiment, dominant fish received significantly more cleaning time than subordinate individuals and there was negative relationship between aggression and cleaning time. These findings suggest that contest competition overrides market choice and this is likely to be due to the fact that cleaner shrimp, unlike cleaner fish, do not move far from their cleaning stations and thus can be monopolized by client fish. Therefore, there does not seem to be a pure biological market operating. Cleaning interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes were compared between two distant locations: Lizard Island, Australia and Kimbe Bay, West New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Overall, six species of cleaner shrimp were observed interacting with species of fishes from 23 different families. All cleaner shrimp performed a dance which appeared to facilitate the attraction of potential clients, suggesting there may be co-evolution of signaling among cleaners. Each species of cleaner shrimp had a different client assemblage with respect to family, dietary preference and activity patterns. All cleaner shrimp, except for P. holthuisi interacted more with resident client fish than with highly mobile client fish whereas the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimiatus is known to give preference to mobile choosy clients. This difference is likely to be due to differences in mobility between cleaner shrimp and cleaner fish. The interactions between cleaner shrimp and their clients are widespread and likely to be ecologically important. Whilst there may not be a pure biological market operating in the interactions between cleaner shrimp and fishes these relationships demonstrate some of the basic properties of biological markets. Given that cleaner shrimp often reside in close proximity to cleaner fish, which do operate under pure market conditions, future research should examine whether there is partitioning of resources among these cleaners. Such a study may determine the extent of niche overlap for cleaning species living in the same area, which would also help to determine the ecological role of cleaners...|$|R
