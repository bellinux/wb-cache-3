50|$|The name Chuj is an exonym {{first used}} by the Spanish. According to folk tradition, the term was coined by Tzeltal conscripts of the Spanish, for whom it meant the <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> overgarment {{traditionally}} worn by Chuj men. The Chuj themselves use an autonym based on their town of origin, i.e. ajSan Matéyo (from San Mateo Ixtatán), ajSan Sabastyán (from San Sebastián Coatán), or ajNenton (from Nentón).|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{silicate}} {{is a type}} of {{fibrous material}} made of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide, (such materials are also called aluminosilicate fibres). These are glassy solid solutions rather than chemical compounds. The compositions are often described in terms of % weight of alumina, Al2O3 and silica, SiO2. Temperature resistance increases as the % alumina increases. These fibrous materials can be encountered as <b>loose</b> <b>wool,</b> blanket, felt, paper or boards.|$|E

Analysis of the design process uses the IDEF- 0 modelling method, {{with the objective of}} investigating the factors that influence design decisions. The building is currently intensively monitored for thermal and moisture aspects. The house studied has been designed by the client/occupant. Important aspects considered within the design process were embodied energy and heating energy demands, which led to the use of local timber, straw bale, <b>loose</b> sheep’s <b>wool,</b> lime renders and clay paints for the walls...|$|R
5000|$|The Angora rabbit (Ankara tavşanı) is {{a variety}} of {{domestic}} rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora {{is one of the}} oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the Angora cat and Angora goat. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long Angora wool, which may be removed by shearing, combing, or plucking (gently pulling <b>loose</b> <b>wool.)</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Of sheep, he says, the ram {{must have}} a large, long body, {{forehead}} broad, round, and well rising, eyes cheerful and large, nostrils short and straight. The ewe must have the neck large and upright, bending like a horse's, back broad, buttocks round, tail thick, legs small and short, clean, and nimble, wool thick and deep, covering all the body; gums must be red, teeth white and even, brisket skinned, eye-strings ruddy, felt <b>loose,</b> <b>wool</b> fast, breath sweet, the feet not hot. Fat pastures are said to produce straight tall sheep, and hills and short pastures breed square ones; woods and mountains yield small and slender sheep. The observations are very judicious on the breeding and management of sheep, and differ little from the modern practice. It appears that many sheep were then rotted.|$|E
40|$|Felting of wool is {{unwanted}} in {{raw wool}} scouring, wet treatments of most yarns {{and in the}} finished garment. It is desirable in some other uses and essential in the felt industries. The accepted method of testing <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting is the Aachen felting test but it is laborious and relatively expensive. There is no generally accepted method for testing yarn shrinkage. For these trials new techniques using a household tumble dryer were developed for testing <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting and yarn shrinkage. Analysis indicated that successful techniques had been developed for measuring <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting and yarn shrinkage. Results with the <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting technique {{were found to be}} highly correlated with those of the Aachen felting method (r = 0. 93). The effects of fibre characteristics on both <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting and yarn shrinkage were investigated for straight-bred Romneys and for <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting in ¼Merino ¾Romney (QM) crosses. <b>Loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting was most highly correlated with bulk (r = - 0. 65 for Romneys and - 0. 73. for QM's), crimp frequency (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 41 respectively) and lustre (- 0. 30 and - 0. 40 respectively). <b>Loose</b> <b>wool</b> bulk (r = - 0. 25) and greasy fleece weight (r = - 0. 40) were the most highly correlated to yarn shrinkage. The greasy fleece weight relationship is thought to be environmental in origin. Micron and staple length were found to play only minor roles in <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting and yarn shrinkage. Cotting was found not to be significantly correlated to either <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting or yarn shrinkage. <b>Loose</b> <b>wool</b> feltability was highly correlated (r = 0. 65) to yarn shrinkage. A large percentage of yarn shrinkage variation was left unexplained. Part of this is probably due to variation in yarn characteristics and {{there is a need for}} a method of producing short-lengths of yarn of constant structure from very small wool samples. The sire effect was significant (P< 0. 05) and controlled 6. 5 % of the variation in <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting and 12 % in yarn shrinkage. This indicates that selection for either increased or decreased <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> felting or yarn shrinkage would induce changes in a flock. Further investigation into the effect of scale height is warranted to enhance understanding of variation in felting...|$|E
25|$|Mulesing is {{different}} from crutching. Crutching is the mechanical removal of wool around the tail, anus (and vulva in ewes) in breeds of sheep with woolly points where this is necessary. Mulesing is the removal of skin to provide permanent resistance to breech strike in Merino sheep. Other breeds tend to have less <b>loose</b> skin, and <b>wool,</b> {{so close to the}} tail and may have less dense wool.|$|R

50|$|Wool {{from the}} {{mountain}} goat and Salish Wool Dog, now extinct, were used to craft wool woven mats, blankets, clothing, and robes. The wool would be taken from the animals and then mixed with a diatomaceous earth removing oils and adding a white colour. After wetting, the wool would be twisted between the palm and thigh to create a loose strand, after which was spun. Whorls {{were placed on the}} shafts of wood spindles, and the <b>loose</b> strands of <b>wool</b> were spun. Some of the circular spindle whorls were plain, but others had elaborate designs and beings depicted.|$|R
5000|$|Nuno felting is {{a fabric}} felting {{technique}} developed by Polly Stirling, a fiber artist from New South Wales, Australia, around 1992. The name {{is derived from}} the Japanese word [...] "nuno" [...] meaning cloth. The technique bonds <b>loose</b> fibre, usually <b>wool,</b> into a sheer fabric such as silk gauze, creating a lightweight felt. The fibres can completely cover the background fabric, or they may be used as a decorative design that allows the backing fabric to show. Nuno felting often incorporates several layers of loose fibres combined to build up colour, texture, and/or design elements in the finished fabric.|$|R
50|$|Sheep's wool, or mah-too-EHL-kel, is {{the most}} common {{material}} used for modern Salish weaving. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go through most of the traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and carded wool directly from a commercial carding mill. The fleece is lightly washed in a tub of tepid water and then hung outside to dry. It is then teased or picked apart with fingers to remove any matted areas and <b>loose</b> dirt. The <b>wool</b> is then carded, leaving the wool in soft batts, where the fibers lie lengthwise. Taken to the spinning machine, the wool is deftly hand fed into the axle of the spindle. This separates sections of the batt of wool and allows the desired amount of spinning to take place before the tension is eased to wind the wool onto the spindle. When the spindle has filled, the wool is unwound and stored in balls or skeins.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{inheritance}} and interrelationships between wool, growth and carcass traits was carried out {{as part of the}} development of a large lean white-faced sire breed. Cross-bred progeny, from three sire breeds (Romney, Dorset, and Border Leicester) mated to Romney ewes, provided information on carcass fatness and composition, liveweight, ultra-sonic backfat depth, fleeceweight and objective measures of fleece characteristics. An overall total a total of 28 sires and 765 progeny were used to collect this information. The analysis of half-sib records was carried out under an assumption of positive assortive mating on ultra-sonic backfat depth. It was considered that any bias, relative to random mating, was minimal due to incomplete assortment, dominance, epistasis and crossbreeding influences. It was assumed that the progeny were only half-sibs in relation to breed, and thus the between-breed component only estimated one-quarter of the between-breed variance. Further, the sires were nested within their respective breeds. The data corrected for the significant non-genetic effects before the variance and covariance components were estimated. In general, the estimates of the Within-breed heritability for the wool and growth traits ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 6 and were similar to literature values. The carcass estimates were higher than literature values in most cases. The incorporation of the between-breed component resulted in the between-breed heritability being larger in magnitude. This was may of been due to non-additive genetic effects, such as heterosis, in the between-breed component. The ratio of the between-breed genetic variance to the total genetic variance indicated that there was large between-breed variation in liveweight and wool traits and sma 1 l variation in the carcass traits. The total genetic and total phenotypic correlations presented here suggest that selection for lean growth and wool production can be accomplished by the joint selection of liveweight and greasy fleeceweight. Expected correlated responses in the other traits would include: a) increase liveweight and fleeceweight at all ages, increase ultra-sonic fat depth, GR measurerment, lean content, clean fleeceweight, staple length, mean fibre diameter, clean scoured yield, and b) decrease the carcass C measurement, decrease bone and fat contents, and <b>loose</b> <b>wool</b> bulk. Selection against ultra-sonic backfat depth would result in leaner animals at a constant weight. But the moderately positive correlations with liveweight and fleeceweight would appear to negate the associated advantage of a reduction in carcass fatness...|$|E
60|$|Curly had {{satisfied}} the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel, {{so he was}} neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer. He zigzagged {{his way to the}} first wagon that his eyesight distinguished in the semi-darkness under the shed. It was a two-horse wagon with a top of white canvas. The wagon was half filled with <b>loose</b> piles of <b>wool</b> sacks, two or three great bundles of grey blankets, and a number of bales, bundles, and boxes. A reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies, bound on the morrow for some outlying hacienda. But to the drowsy intelligence of Curly they represented only warmth and softness and protection against the cold humidity of the night. After several unlucky efforts, at last he conquered gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and pitch forward upon the best and warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day. Then he became instinctively a burrowing animal, and dug his way like a prairie-dog down among the sacks and blankets, hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his den. For three nights sleep had visited Curly only in broken and shivering doses. So now, when Morpheus condescended to pay him a call, Curly got such a strangle hold on the mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder that anyone else in the whole world got a wink of sleep that night.|$|R
