The Rangers also faced off against the New York Islanders on January 29, 2014, under the deep cold outdoor weather. The Rangers won both matches 7-3 and 2-1 respectively. Both games drew a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50,000 spectators, almost the full {{capacity}} of the stadium. The Devils and Islanders never played an outdoor game before this series.|$|E

In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and {{you have got to}} use your brain a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> in League One. It's developed me as a player because you {{need to learn how to}} perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E
500|$|During {{a feature}} on what storylines were working and {{not working for}} the show, a Soap World {{columnist}} praised the character, saying [...] "Naomi Canning has been perhaps the best new character {{of the last few}} years. Her cougar/cub sex fling with Josh is pure hotness and tends towards the controversial, thus providing good watercooler moments for fans." [...] The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best". During his review of the show in 2014, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised O'Reilly's addition to the cast, saying [...] "Naomi has also been {{a breath of fresh air}} as a character who will push the boundaries just that <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> many of her neighbours!" ...|$|E

500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E

2500|$|Dev's electro {{style and}} [...] "sing-talk" [...] vocal style have been {{compared}} to fellow pop singer Kesha. Dev responded to this, saying, [...] "I'm confident enough in what I do that people will see me for who I am ... I get why people compare us but once people see me live they won't connect us as much." [...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give you a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E

Although they praise the men for being well proportioned, the women they found ugly, ill-shaped with breasts hanging down to their bellies as empty satchels.
