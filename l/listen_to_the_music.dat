500|$|The filming {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical challenges, with the producer Adam Tandy explaining that the simultaneous singing and conversing made production particularly difficult: [...] "To record it all 'clean' and have options in the edit, that was technically hard on everybody." [...] Typically, karaoke scenes in television will see characters sing only the opening lines, {{but because of the}} format of Inside No. 9, the characters in [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] sing the whole song. Each character sang a song, with the vocals recorded live. The actors wore an earpiece to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> while singing; Howlett's, used so that she could feel the beat, was taped under her wig, and she was counted in by Outhwaite. Filming took a week, with days focussed on particular songs.|$|E

500|$|John Kosik of the Associated Press criticized its price, stating: [...] "For $200, casual fans {{may want}} to steer clear." [...] Kosik also said that what it [...] "offers the hard-core {{listener}} goes beyond the distinct romance of vinyl's warm, earthy sound." [...] Bob Gendron of TONEAudio wrote that the box set was a [...] "godsend" [...] and also {{said that they were}} [...] "amazingly produced LPs that bring to life several of the greatest metal records ever made…" [...] Guitar World praised the box set for its mastering, saying the benefits of the treatment [...] "are immediately clear when you drop the needle onto one of these babies. Basically all the songs Slayer fans lose their mind over are here, sounding heavier, livelier and more brutal than ever." [...] He also said that the remastering made a listener want to thoroughly <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mark Iraheta of Complex {{magazine}} called [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] a [...] "soon-to-be smash" [...] that will see Brown making [...] "substantial {{damage on the}} Top 100 charts". Robbie Daw of Idolator described the song as [...] "energetic" [...] and wrote that it follows {{in the footsteps of}} Brown's past hits [...] "Forever" [...] (2008) and [...] "Yeah 3x", [...] "but with more dancefloor urgency". Daw concluded by writing that the song [...] "should please the same crowd" [...] that <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of LMFAO, Kesha and Lady Gaga. Melinda Newman of HitFix described [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] as a cousin to LMFAO's [...] "Party Rock Anthem" [...] (2011), and called it [...] "an absolute smash". Scott Shelter of PopCrush awarded the song three and a half stars out of four, and noted its similarities to the work of David Guetta and LMFAO. Shetler also commented that the production was lacking originality and the song [...] "isn't going to blow anyone away from a lyrical perspective". Andrew Martin of Prefix magazine was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a left over track from Guetta's album Nothing but the Beat (2011). At the 2012 BET Awards, [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] was nominated for the Viewer's Choice Award.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "...Fate dealt us this card, and I don't think we've done particularly badly with it. Music today seems so very worthy, so very dull. Nobody wants to stick their neck out any more, and I think that is a great pity. We did, and we left our mark." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the solo}} for [...] "St. Thomas", Rollins uses {{repetition}} of a rhythmic pattern, and variations of that pattern, covering {{only a few}} tones in a tight range, and employing staccato and semi-detached notes. This is interrupted by a sudden flourish, utilizing a much wider range {{before returning to the}} former pattern. (<b>Listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> sample.) [...] In his book The Jazz Style of Sonny Rollins, David N. Baker explains that Rollins [...] "very often uses rhythm for its own sake. He will sometimes improvise on a rhythmic pattern instead of on the melody or changes." [...] Ever since recording [...] "St. Thomas", Rollins's use of calypso rhythms has been one of his signature contributions to jazz; he often performs traditional Caribbean tunes such as [...] "Hold 'Em Joe" [...] and [...] "Don't Stop the Carnival," [...] and he has written many original calypso-influenced compositions, such as [...] "Duke of Iron," [...] "The Everywhere Calypso," [...] and [...] "Global Warming." ...|$|E
2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally turned to him and snapped, [...] "You may be {{surprised}} to hear that I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E
