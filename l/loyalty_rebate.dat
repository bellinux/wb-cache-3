In three experiments, we investigate the influence of loyalty rebates on consumers based on the alternative Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), both theoretically and experimentally. CPT predicts that loyalty rebates could harm consumers by impeding rational switching from an incumbent to an outside option (e. g., a market entrant). In a repeated trading task, participants decided {{whether or not to}} enter a <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebate</b> scheme and to continue buying within that scheme. Meeting the condition triggering the rebate was uncertain. Loyalty rebates considerably reduced the likelihood that participants switched to a higher-payoff outside option later. We conclude that loyalty rebates may inflict substantial harm on consumers and may have an underestimated potential to foreclose consumer markets. ...|$|E

In this essay, I review the pro- competitive and anticompetitive motives for <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates.</b> Several conclusions emerge.

There is therefore little basis for a per se prohibition, even restricted to a particular category of suspicious-looking schemes. Second, dominant firms willing to engage into an exclusionary strategy may find that cleverly fine-tuned pricing schemes involving <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates</b> possess several advantages over simple predatory pricing strategies: they can achieve exclusion at a lower cost, be more credible, and erect a permanent barrier to entry without any need for a recoupment period. <b>Loyalty</b> <b>rebates</b> thus deserve the scrutiny with {{which they have been}} gratified lately.

In a bilateral monopoly, contracting is (generally) efficient, i. e. the manufacturer will produce the joint-profit-maximizing output.

It observes that economists 2 ̆ 7 traditional concern with aggregate welfare has not, until recently, been accompanied by a similar concern by lawyers. Until {{the late twentieth century}} lawyers tended to focus on 2 ̆ 2 fairness 2 ̆ 2 instead. These different concerns have impeded mutual understanding, as have the various meanings that lawyers and economists have attributed to such basic terms as 2 ̆ 2 monopoly power, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 market power 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 competition 2 ̆ 2 in the price discrimination context. The paper {{examines the}} principal laws of the United States and the European Union that deal with price discrimination, focusing especially on the Robinson-Patman Act and Article 82 (c) of the Treaty Establishing the European Union. The paper compares the operation of these two provisions, finding superficial resemblances but significant differences in practice. While the Robinson-Patman Act was designed to prevent powerful buyers from forcing price concessions from often weak producers to the detriment of small buyers, enforcement of Article 82 (c) is directed differently. Although the language of Article 82 (c) suggests that it is designed to protect purchasers-for-resale from discrimination by their suppliers, the European Commission employs Article 82 (c) to protect competitors from aggressive pricing by dominant (generally producer) firms. The paper also examines the developing law on <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates</b> {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, again finding that the approaches of the two jurisdictions differ significantly, at least as exemplified by the most recent cases. It distinguishes between <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates</b> offered by the seller of a single product and those offered by a multi-product seller.

40|$|Numerous {{commentators}} have characterized the Roberts Court’s antitrust decisions as radical departures that betray a pro-business, anticonsumer bias. That characterization is inaccurate. Although {{some of the}} decisions do represent significant changes from past practice, the “pro-business/anti-consumer” characterization fails to appreciate the fundamental limits of antitrust, a body of law that requires judges and juries to make fine distinctions between procompetitive and anticompetitive behaviors that frequently resemble each other. Although false acquittals of anticompetitive conduct may harm consumers, so may false convictions of procompetitive actions. And efforts to eliminate errors in liability judgments are themselves costly. Optimal antitrust rules will aim to minimize the sum of decision costs (the costs of reaching a liability decision) and expected error costs (the social losses from false convictions and false acquittals).

40|$|Antitrust {{authorities}} typically try {{to establish}} exclusivity and the anticompetitiveness of <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates</b> through pricing, but do not address the strategic use of advertising and, more generally, marketing campaigns. In this paper we focus on non-price anticompetitive behavior arising from marketing. Speci…cally, we examine whether Intel’s choice of processor marketing via PC …rms is consistent with predatory behavior. There is suggestive evidence that Intel used it’s “Intel Inside ” marketing campaign for predatory purposes. First, PC …rms were given funds to use in advertising their Intel-based computers. Second, under the “Intel Inside ” program …rms were generously reimbursed for marketing expenditures. However, the funds and rebates were given if PC …rms restricted sales of Intel’s main rival’s chips, where rebates amounted to $ 1. 5 billion in 2001.

The TAP test is based on a structural approach and allows us to disentangle the potential positive impact of the marketing program from the anticompetitive predatory e¤ect.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the principles under Article 82 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community concerning anticompetitive or exclusionary abuses involving pricing issues. This Article is structured as follows. Part I outlines the basic economic thinking behind price discrimination and identifies the principal legal situations under Article 82 {{in which it}} arises. Discriminatory pricing should only be prohibited (and therefore needs to be justified) in {{a small number of}} situations. Parts II-III discuss the specific situations under Community competition law in which price discrimination and the legality of pricing practices may be relevant. Part II discusses rebate and discounting practices, including target (or sales growth) <b>rebates,</b> fidelity or <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates,</b> and rebates in return for exclusivity. Part III discusses price discrimination that gives rise to distortions of competition between customers. This concerns Article 82 (c), a provision that has some parallels with the Robinson-Patman Act under U. S. law. In practice, it will be rare that a profit-maximizing firm will have the ability or incentive to charge different prices to comparable customers {{to such an extent that}} competition between those customers will be significantly distorted. Part IV discusses predatory pricing. It is important that prices that remain above average variable cost should nearly always be treated as legal, since rivals will usually be able, and should be encouraged, to compete in that scenario. Community competition law should only treat pricing above average variable cost as unlawful where there is evidence of other abusive behavior linked to that low pricing, in other words a clear plan to eliminate a rival by using a range of illicit practices. Part V discusses a specific instance of predatory pricing [...] cross-subsidization. Cross-subsidy cases are in essence cases in which the abuse, if there is one, is predatory pricing.

40|$|In the paper, the {{fundamental}} question is under what conditions <b>loyalty</b> discounts and <b>rebates</b> adopted by a dominant firm cause anti-competitive effects. Fidelity schemes, al-though extremely frequent in the market, if applied by a dominant firm, {{are likely to be}} judged as illegal per se, as demonstrated by the EU case-law delivered so far and the se-vere scrutiny reserved by the national competition authorities.

40|$|AbstractMost {{businesses}} such as {{retail business}} implemented loyalty program {{to increase their}} customer's satisfaction and deter their customer from defecting to their competitors. However, {{the success of this}} program is not substantiated. The problem appears that supermarket chain loyalty programs are not successfully creating loyalty.

These loyalty mechanisms are not creating ultimate loyalty to one supermarket because customers belong to more than one supermarket loyalty program in order to get special price and promotions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the law and}} economics of loyalty discounts. While there have been recent advances in the economic analysis of loyalty discounts, this literature is still relatively recent and sparse. Though some of these papers provide tests that would serve to identify either deviations from short run profit maximization or, {{in the case of}} bundled discounts, a reduction in consumer welfare or the exclusion of a hypothetically equally efficient competitor, these tests have several shortcomings. As a result, the economic literature currently does not provide a reliable way to gauge whether the potential harm from the use of loyalty discounts would outweigh any demonstrable benefits from their use. A review of the major cases involving loyalty and other volume discounts suggests the following general observations. In the single product case, courts have consistently applied the “not easy to establish” two part test for predatory pricing set out by the Supreme Court in its Brooke Group decision. As a result, the courts have generally ruled that above-cost volume discounts, including those that use market share discounts and near exclusive thresholds, are lawful and do not violate the antitrust laws. In cases involving multimarket or bundled rebates, however, courts have not generally followed the Brooke Group Court’s presumption that above cost bundled discounts are presumptively legal. However, they have generally followed the Brooke Group Court’s focus on the actual facts or realities of the marketplace rather than on hypotheticals. Thus, while the lower courts have considered the theories and tests contained in the recent theoretical literature on loyalty discounts, they have generally refused to find liability absent sufficient proof that the conditions required by these tests apply, and that the underlying tests reflect market realities. This approach is consistent with the federal courts’ generally cautious approach to expanding Section 2 liability, and the recognition of the underdeveloped and untested state of the academic literature. Moreover, there are significant flaws in the two cases where courts have found use of bundled <b>loyalty</b> <b>rebates</b> to be unlawful. In SmithKline, the court did focus on data and concluded that an equally efficient competitor would have been excluded by the bundled discounts evaluated in the case. However, economic theory suggests that the court may have used a flawed standard, and should have instead focused on the fact that changes to the bundled rebate programs served to increase rather than decrease prices. And the court’s decision in LePage’s not only suggested use of the same flawed standard, it found liability without requiring sufficient proof that the standard even applied to the facts of the case...|$|R
