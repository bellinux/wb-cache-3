MÉTODOS: estudo de corte transversal, no qual foram selecionadas 110 mulheres com citologia e/ou biópsia com diagnóstico de NIC. Todas foram submetidas à coleta de nova citologia oncológica, captura híbrida II (CH II), colposcopia e conização pela cirurgia de alta freqüência com alça. RESULTADOS: a taxa global de detecção do HPV de alto risco oncogênico na população estudada foi de 77, 3 %. À avaliação histopatológica, 81 (73, 7 %) mulheres apresentavam NIC e, nestas mulheres, a taxa de detecção do DNA-HPV foi de 87, 6 %, sendo de 85, 9 % nas mulheres com NIC 2 ou 3. A CH II apresentou sensibilidade de 87, 7 %, especificidade de 56 %, valor preditivo positivo de 86, 6 % e valor preditivo negativo de 58, 3 %, com {{odds ratio}} (OR) de 7, 76 (2, 47 PURPOSE: {{to evaluate the}} high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) detection rate of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), checking the association between high-risk HPV, viral load and severity of the lesion, {{as well as the}} best viral <b>load</b> <b>cutoff</b> to predict lesion severity. METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study. One hundred and ten patients were selected by cytology and/or biopsy with CIN diagnosis. All of them were submitted to a new oncologic cytology, hybrid capture II (HC II), colposcopy, and loop electrosurgical excision and fulguration procedures (LEEP). RESULTS: the global detection rate of high-risk oncogenic HPV in these women was 77. 3 %. Eighty-one women (73. 7 %) had CIN with a detection rate of HPV-DNA of 87. 6 %. In women with CIN 2 or 3 the detection rate was 85. 9 %. HC II had a sensitivity of 87. 8 %, specificity of 56. 0 %, predictive positive value of 86. 6 % and predictive negative value of 58. 3 %, with an odds ratio of 7. 76 (2. 47 < OR < 25. 15) for CIN 2 or 3 diagnosis.

40|$|Post-transplant {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder (PTLD) is a severe complication of immunosuppressive therapy following solid-organ or stem cell transplantation. In patients after pediatric heart transplantation the prevalence is 9 % after 10 years and 17 % after 15 years. The 5 -year survival rates range from 50 - 70 %. In children > 80 % {{of the cases}} are associated with Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV). EBV is known to latently infect B-Lymphocytes, promote growth and affect apoptosis. It is being hypothesized that {{in the face of}} impaired T-cell control of viral infection and tumor growth due to immunosuppression, the malignant transformation of these B-cells is facilitated. Accordingly, the following risk-factors for PTLD have been described: An intensive immunosuppression, a primary EBV-infection under immunosuppressive medication or EBV-mismatch (donor positive/recipient negative), and chronically elevated EBV viral loads after transplantation. 	We screened 34 patients who had received a pediatric heart transplantation for their EBV viral load via real-time PCR and their EBV-specific CD 8 + T-cell response using the Interferon-γ EliSpot. Additionally, clinical data and laboratory results were obtained from the patients’ files. 9 / 34 patients (26, 5 %) had a history of PTLD. We observed a stronger immune response to stimulation with lytic antigens in patients with high viral <b>load</b> (<b>cutoff</b> 2000 copies/ml: p= 0, 06; cutoff 16000 copies/ml: p= 0, 16). When analyzing only patients without history of PTLD there was a significantly stronger response to lytic antigens in patients with high viral <b>load</b> (<b>cutoff</b> 16000 copies/ml: p= 0, 03). Patients with a history of PTLD showed higher viral loads (p= 0, 001) while lacking a stronger immune response to lytic antigens. When analyzing only patients with viral loads greater than 16000 copies/ml, patients with a history of PTLD had a weaker response to lytic antigens (p= 0, 18). In serial measurements we saw a marked increase in the response to lytic antigens in case of increasing viral loads in 6 / 9 patients. In one patient with a history of PTLD this relation was inverted. 	The data presented here leads to the hypothesis, that patients with a history of PTLD have an impaired EBV-specific T-cell-immunity. Further, preferably multicentric studies are needed to elucidate, whether such findings in the EliSpot assay allow the early identification of patients at greater risk of PTLD...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{etiologic}} inference {{of identifying}} a pathogen {{in the upper}} respiratory tract (URT) of children with pneumonia is unclear. To determine if viral load could provide evidence of causality of pneumonia, we compared viral load in the URT of children with World Health Organization 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cdefined severe and very severe pneumonia and age-matched community controls. Methods. In the 9 developing country sites, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with and without pneumonia were tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for 17 viruses. The association of viral load with case status was evaluated using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine optimal discriminatory viral load cutoffs. Viral load density distributions were plotted. Results. The mean viral load was higher in cases than controls for 7 viruses. However, there was substantial overlap in viral load distribution of cases and controls for all viruses. ROC curves to determine the optimal viral <b>load</b> <b>cutoff</b> produced an area under the curve of < 0. 80 for all viruses, suggesting poor to fair discrimination between cases and controls. Fatal and very severe pneumonia cases did not have higher viral load than less severe cases for most viruses. Conclusions. Although we found higher viral loads among pneumonia cases than controls for some viruses, the utility in using viral load of URT specimens to define viral pneumonia was equivocal. Our analysis was limited by lack of a gold standard for viral pneumonia. 2017 - 05 - 29 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 28575373 PMC 544784...|$|E

40|$|Multiple human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) genotypes often coexist within cervical epithelia and are frequently detected together in smears of different grades of cervical neoplasia. Describing the association betweenmultiple infections and cervical disease {{is important in}} generating hypotheses regarding its pathogenesis. We analyzed the prevalence of multiple HPV infections and their attribution to cervical disease in a screening population of 999 consecutive BD SurePath liquid-based cervical cytology samples enriched with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) (n 100), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (n 100), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) (n 97). HPV genotyping was performed only on cytology specimens using a broad-spectrumGP 5 / 6 -PCR/multiplex HPV genotyping (BSGP 5 / 6 -PCR/MPG) assay that detects and quantifies 51 HPV genotypes and 3 subtypes. Using a recently defined high viral <b>load</b> <b>cutoff,</b> the quantitative data were scored as high or low viral load. In the 36 -month follow-up, 79 histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN 2) cases were identified. In the screening population, there was a trend of having more multiple infec-tions at a younger age. Multiple HPV infections were common. Multiple HPV types were most prevalent in LSIL (75. 9 % of HPV positives), followed by HSIL (65. 5 %), ASCUS (64. 6 %), and negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) (36. 8 %). On average, 3. 2 and 2. 5 HPV types were detected per LSIL and HSIL sample, respectively.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{an improved}} mathematical model for analyzing investment portfolios of electricity generation assets to meet long-term future demand for power. Results from such analysis will provide diversified mixes of fuels and generation technologies that achieve {{a balance between}} reduced cost and reduced risk where risk {{is measured by the}} variability of fuel costs. Fuel Diversification (FD) is important in managing the cost of electricity generation. Past studies have modeled the FD problem using the Mean-Variance (M-V) portfolio approach without explicit considerations of the load duration curve (LDC). ^ Most extant formulations of the M-V approach to the FD problem focus on minimizing the mean construction and other improvements, operating and maintenance costs plus a factor times the variance of the operating and maintenance costs for a representative year. Construction and other improvements are typically levelized to obtain an annuity payment {{over the life of the}} plant. In order to levelize the costs, each generating plant requires an assumed capacity factor (CF); therefore, unit costs representing technologies are evaluated in the portfolio assuming a fixed load factor (LF). The M-V portfolio method as seen in the literature fails to capture a significant aspect of the underlying problem—the levelized costs change with the load factor. The upshot is that results from models that ignore the load curve are unreasonably specialized and viewed by practitioners as naïve and inappropriate. This situation can be remedied by classifying loads (e. g. base, peaking, and cycling) and dedicating different technology mixes to serving the different load classes. Using this approach, the LDC is partitioned into contiguous segments. Unlike the standard M-V portfolio method where costs representing technologies ignore load variation, the method proposed in this research can accommodate multiple load types. Separate LFs for each load class are taken into account in balancing the mix of the available fuel/technology candidates. As a result, generating units are evaluated by how they are utilized over the load profile, and thus, the fuel mixes of generation assets are optimized for serving the varying loads. ^ Use of the method was demonstrated with an analysis for the state of Indiana (Gotham et al. (2009)) and the results were assessed to be much more credible than those obtained when the LDC is ignored. However, their approach treated load cutoffs for the LDC as predetermined, exogenous levels. Here, load cutoffs are endogenously chosen in an optimal manner. This formulation called the endogenous-cutoff model is used to show that optimal cutoffs are sensitive to the level of risk aversion and to observe the rate at which solutions improve as the number of endogenous cutoffs increases. This analysis will provide insight into what constitutes a good set of cutoff levels and how many cutoffs are sufficient when considering how to break up the LDC for managing FD. Analysis of this problem leads to an alternative formulation that allows the nonlinearities to be confined to a small number of variables where the cutoffs are exogenous. Instead of solving for optimal <b>load</b> <b>cutoff</b> levels, the LDC is segmented into a large number of equally spaced <b>load</b> <b>cutoff</b> levels. This equally spaced cutoff model is an approximation to the theoretical continuous-cutoff model; hence it is called the continuous model approximation. ^ Numerical results for the state of Indiana are presented via a series of case studies. These include analyses of the impact of the addition of carbon costs, simulating implementation of cap and trade legislation, and zero availability of nuclear power, simulating the situation where the public becomes adamantly opposed to nuclear technology. Sensitivity analyses with respect to problem data (e. g. expected technology cost and variance/covariance of technology cost) are also performed. ...|$|E

Cross-sectional. Colposcopy Clinic in a University hospital. A series of 119 women referred because of atypical squamous cells or LSIL between August 2000 and April 2001 were included. All women were subjected to a new cervical smear, HPV testing for the high-risk types using hybrid capture II (HCII), viral load measurement in relative light units (RLU) and colposcopy, with cervical biopsies (n = 97). Cervical lesions were graded using the CIN classification. Cervical biopsies revealed CIN 2 or CIN 3 in 11 % of the cases, equally among women referred because of atypical squamous cells or LSIL. The HCII test was positive in 16 % of women with atypical squamous cells and 52 % of those with LSIL (OR = 5. 8; 95 % CI 1. 4 to 26. 7).

40|$|The role of {{externally}} imposed sediment supplies on {{the evolution}} of meandering rivers and their floodplains is poorly understood, despite analytical advances in our physical understanding of river meandering 1, 2. The Amazon river basin hosts tributaries that are largely unaffected by engineering controls and hold a range of sediment loads, allowing us to explore the influence that sediment supply has on river evolution. Here we calculate average annual rates of meander migration within 20 reaches in the Amazon Basin from Landsat imagery spanning 1985 – 2013. We find that rivers with high sediment loads experience annual migration rates that are higher than those of rivers with lower sediment <b>loads.</b> Meander <b>cutoff</b> also occurs more frequently along rivers with higher sediment loads. Differences in meander migration and cutoff rates between the study reaches are not explained by differences in channel slope or river discharge.

Coreceptor antagonists are {{a family}} of antiretroviral drugs that are used with the prior knowledge of patients HIV- 1 tropism. Viral RNA-based tropism detection requires a plasma viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL, while proviral DNA-based detection can be performed regardless of plasma viral load. This test is useful in patients with low or undetectable viral loads and would benefit with a proper therapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the correlation between HIV RNA and proviral genotypic DNA tropism tests. Findings: Forty three Chilean patients were examined using population-based V 3 sequencing, and a geno 2 pheno false-positive rate (FPR) cutoff values of 5, 5. 75, 10 and 20 %. With cutoff 5. 75 % a concordance of 88. 4 % in tropism prediction was found after a simultaneous comparison between HIV tropism assessment by RNA and DNA. In total, five discrepancies (11. 6 %) were found, 3 patients were RNA-R 5 /DNA-X 4 and two were RNA-X 4 /DNA-R 5. Proviral DNA enabled the prediction of tropism in patients with a low or undetectable viral <b>load.</b> For <b>cutoff</b> 5 and 5. 75 % genotypic testing using proviral DNA showed a similar sensitivity for X 4 as RNA.

Results: We found negative and significant correlation between the domain “degree of compliance to antiviral therapy” assessed by CEAT-HBV and the Morisky test (r = − 0. 62, P < 0. 001) and between the domain “barriers to adherence” and HBV viral load (r = − 0. 42, P < 0. 001).

We will particularly focus on the shaking resulting from such <b>load</b> case. The <b>cutoff</b> frequency {{for this type of}} loading is typically within the to range, which would be refered to as the medium frequency range [1]. The determination of the shaking induced by an aircraft impact on an industrial structure requires dynamic simulation. The response, especially during the transient stage, cannot be completely described using classical finite element method associated with explicit numerical schemes. Indeed, the medium frequency range is often ignored unless the calculation is carried out with a very refined mesh and consequently, a refined time discretization. This could lead to prohibitive computation times. The linear behaviour is not questioned outside the impact area, however, the non-linearity of the portion of the impacted structure can have a significant influence. The method consists in an initial FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of the signal loading. The VTCR then ensures an efficient calculation of the response of the structure. The obtained signals are then processed by inverse FFT (IFFT) to reconstruct a time signal and a response spectrum.

The aim is to develop a robust method to get mid-frequency spectra generated by an aircraft impact on a simplified containment [4].
