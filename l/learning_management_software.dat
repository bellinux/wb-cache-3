To reduce the number of products to test, sampling techniques such as combinatorial interaction testing have been proposed.

Prioritization {{can also be used to}} sort/generate such lists, optimizing coverage criteria or weights assigned to features. However, current sampling/prioritization techniques barely take product behaviour into account. We explore how ideas of statistical testing, based on a usage model (a Markov chain), can be used to extract configurations of interest according to the likelihood of their executions. These executions are gathered in featured transition systems, compact representation of SPL behaviour.

While many adult learners have a variety of learning needs and wants, the educational system in many countries has been slow in changing. However, with the onset of virtual (online) learning, many {{educational institutions}} have realized that educational needs for students, business, industry, as well as cultural factors have changed. In today’s learning environment, learners have an immediate need for education, but they also need to plan for their educational goals beyond the completion of the course or program of study. Thus, this paper will address the changes in the learning environment, changes for the adult learner and industry, and changes in overall educational goals and those involved in the educational process.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of higher {{education}} institutions and businesses are examining web−based learning environments (WLE) as a system to support knowledge construction for its students or employees. A WLE {{can be defined as}} an on−line system to facilitate learning via a web−browser (client−server architecture) by providing a content delivery mechanism, participant tracking, access to digital resources (i. e. − data and/or communication tools), formative feedback, self−peer assessment and summative assessment. Mason (1999) suggests three models for these web−based <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>software</b> systems: 1. Content and Support: Web−based text supported by on−line frequently asked questions (FAQ). 2. The Wrap−around Model: Learning through reflection and discussion of many small on−line groups. 3. Integrated Model: Learner−centred environment for active collaborative work using web−based resources for critical self/peer assessment. A learning system model which can take a student from a traditional delivery methodology to a supported autonomous model is needed. This paper explores the development of a WLE from a Behaviourist design to a Web−Constructivist system of communication. It examines how a didactic approach to content presentation can mature to a flexible content design for collaboration in a WLE. Th...|$|E

That report can be found online at: [[URL] reportVirtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>software</b> systems that synthesize the functionality of computer-mediated communications software and online methods of delivering course materials. This report focuses on how to evaluate the properties, capabilities and orientation of different systems from an educational perspective, and how {{to determine whether the}} new technology can be embedded into the teaching and learning context of an institution. Two different models are explored [...] one from education, the other from systems modeling [...] as a basis for constructing a pedagogical evaluation methodology for VLEs. The report concludes that among factors slowing the integration of VLEs in higher education institutions is the lack of a coherent framework within which to evaluate both the pedagogical benefits and the organizational changes required to effectively implement it. Another factor includes the extent to which VLEs can currently interact with other existing systems. VLEs are inevitably designed with a pedagogical model in mind that is not usually made explicit. The evaluative strategies in this report are intended to reveal these implicit characteristics, to help educators choose a software system that reflects the way they wish to teach.

40|$|BACKGROUND Hydrology and Erosion Management, {{part of the}} Bachelor of Engineering Technology (BEngTech) Degree, {{is taught}} {{flexibly}} within New Zealand. Flexible, by the BEngTech definition, refers to flexible space but fixed time; hence web conferencing is used to provide real time contact with students based at other tertiary institutes. Delivering a traditional lecture via web link exaggerates the weaknesses of the lecture format. Limited personal interaction with the tutor and with fellow students makes it challenging for students to stay engaged. Shifting the class focus to online activities, and requiring the students to do these within “web conferencing class time”, created a virtual classroom where all students could be treated equally. The web conferencing tool therefore became secondary and was used to support the online activities through short periods of information and clarification. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this study}} is to produce a model of a successful flexible classroom that actively engages students with the learning outcomes, the tutor and each other and produces a positive learning experience for the students. DESIGN A questionnaire was developed in 2012 to ascertain how the teaching model suited the students and what improvements could be made. This small sample produced quantitative data on the students’ perceptions of the web conferencing class. In 2013 the modified questionnaire was more qualitative and targeted, asking how the balance of activities, web conferencing and online work each aided the student to learn the course material. Feedback from questionnaires was analysed in conjunction with student participation with the learning management system activities and the student results. The quality of students’ answers to tutor-directed online activities reflected the depth of their learning. Initial conclusions were drawn between traditional styled lectures, traditionally styled web conference classes and this flexible classroom model based on the multiple data sets described above. RESULTS In 2012, anecdotal evidence showed students were positive about this model of learning experience, reducing common fears of how challenging learning in this type of environment might be. The feedback from 2013 ’s cohort showed an improvement in engagement levels. This is likely to be as a result of increased tutor confidence and competence in using web conferencing and <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>software</b> in conjunction with each other. Further, with experience, learning activity instructions have been improved to clarify expectations to suit the changed teaching environment. The learning environment has now transformed from a web conference direct transmission classroom into a virtual classroom through a learning management system with live support. SUMMARY With the removal of many of the barriers found in traditional web conferencing classrooms the students have expressed their appreciation of learning in this type of environment. As the online environment was a base for all sessions, the web conferencing aspect became of secondary focus allowing students the freedom to more easily interact online with the content, their peers and with the tutor. ...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Mathematics at Iowa State University {{teaches a}} freshman-level Discrete Mathematics course with total {{enrollment}} of about 1, 800 students per year. The traditional format includes large lectures, with about 150 students each, taught by faculty and temporary instructors in two class sessions per week and recitation sections, with about 35 students each, taught once per week by a teaching assistant. In this format, the course experienced the standard academic {{problems associated with}} the multi-section large lecture format: over 30 % D/F/Withdraw rates; lack of uniformity and inconsistency in course objectives, delivery, and testing; low student morale and performance; and insufficient individualized feedback from instructors. In addition, students failed to see the connection of the material to subsequent courses and real world problems; spent great effort on repetitive calculations and little or none on computing; lacked skills in analyzing problems, data presentation, and graphical analysis; and often had substantial gaps in basic algebra skills that were not addressed properly by course content. Discrete Mathematics was redesigned to address these challenges with a Web-based, self-paced model. The Web-based environment integrates WebCT as <b>learning</b> <b>management</b> <b>software,</b> MapleTA as an online testing program, and textbook and related materials by Barnett, Ziegler, and Byleen (Prentice-describes Hall) as the content basis. The redesigned course includes weekly small recitation sections, additional office hours, availability of the Math Help Room, and peer-mentoring through study groups and Supplemental Instruction. Integrated and proactive student support includes Web-based feedback through online office hours, a Web-bulletin board for each class, and Web-published individual current scores and class standing. The redesigned course syllabus is divided into manageable modules, with clearly communicated learning outcomes and objectives. Expansion of learning and understanding through the application of technology are achieved through incorporating Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheets for instantaneous graphics and simplification of extensive repetitive calculations. The Web environment also includes a new fourth main course topic of basic algebra skills early in the material as preparation for the other sections. Assessment of the course redesign was performed by the Research Institute for Studies in Education (RISE), in the College of Education, at Iowa State University. The general assessment strategy included a pretest-posttest control group design and longterm study of academic success. Student performance data were used to determine which differences in learning outcomes may be attributable to specific course components. Students in the Web-based sections performed no worse, and usually performed better, than did classroom-based students. These results are based on student performance on learning outcomes in Fall 2002, Spring 2003, and Fall 2003. In a straight comparison, the design sections did significantly better than the control sections on eleven out of thirteen exams compared, with comparable results on the remaining two exams. This difference exists despite significantly higher cumulative GPAs for students in the control sections for two semesters and insignificant differences in the third semester. This suggests that the Web-based course design is able to enhance the performance, and hence the chances for retention, of even less-highly achieving students (as determined by their lower GPAs). A longer-term study of academic success has tracked students through subsequent courses for which Discrete Mathematics is a prerequisite. These results are also positive, though less conclusive. The traditional course used 12 faculty and 15 teaching assistants to deliver the course at a cost of $ 129 per student. The redesigned course is staffed with 3 faculty and 9 teaching assistants. The redesign costs $ 77 per student, resulting in savings of $ 93, 600 per year...|$|E
