40|$|We {{report on}} the {{analysis}} of B band imaging data of 57 low-redshift QSOs and Seyfert 1 galaxies selected from the Hamburg/ESO-Survey, for which host galaxy dependent selection biases are greatly reduced compared to other optical surveys. Only one object in the sample {{is known to be}} radio-loud. We adopted a procedure to remove the AGN contribution by subtracting a scaled point spread functions from each QSO image. To reclaim the integrated host galaxy flux we correct for oversubtraction based on simulations. This method shows to be quite insensitive to the host galaxy morphological type, which we can unambiguously established for 15 of the 57 objects. The quasar host galaxies are detected in all cases. The hosts are very <b>luminous,</b> <b>ranging</b> in absolute magnitude M_B from - 19. 0 to - 23. 8, with an average of M_B,gal = - 21. 5, considerably above L* for field galaxies. For the luminous QSO subsample with M_B < - 23 the average host absolute magnitude is M_B,gal = - 23. 0, while for the complementary low-luminosity AGN we get M_B,gal = - 21. 2, roughly equal to L*. The luminous host galaxies in the sample are typically approx. 1 mag brighter than expected when inferring B band luminosities from studies of similar objects at longer wavebands. We argue that this mismatch {{is not likely to be}} explained by selection effects, but favor host galaxy colours significanlty bluer than those of inactive galaxies. Although published B band data are scant, this result and the findings of other authors are in good agreement. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
50|$|The Lighthouse of Sigri {{is located}} on the island of Nisiopi, in front of Sigri's harbour, near the western tip of the Greek island of Lesbos. It is a {{circular}} tower which is 12 meters tall and contains a lighthouse keeper house. The light was first exhibited at 1860 with oil as its energy source. The petroleum lantern was replaced by an electric light in 1989. It emits a distinctive white flash every 30 seconds in a <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> of21n.m.|$|E
50|$|Plaka (Πλάκα) is {{a village}} in the northeasternmost {{part of the island}} of Lemnos, Greece. It is part of the {{municipal}} unit of Moudros. In 2011 its population was 310 people. The island of Imbros in Turkey is just 24 km northeast. It is situated somewhere {{in the middle of the}} straight line between Troy and Mount Athos. Some believe that it is the Ermaion lepas of the ancient, through which was transmitted with fire the news of the sack of Troy to Argos and Mycenae. Although the edge has an elevation of just 70 m, the cape comes deep into the sea and it is easily seen from those two areas.

40|$|Long-range visual marine aids to {{navigation}} are {{not required}} for current marine navigational practices. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to develop a minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> for major lighthouses that are still in existence to sustain the operation of the lighthouses in the future. Two steps were involved in the determination of the minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range,</b> namely the modification of the existing geographical range formula, and the finding of a strong linear correlation between the light intensity and the <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> with the lowest gradient possible in a graph. The application of the minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> would eliminate the loom of light beyond the geographical range of the lighthouse. This approach was applied to seven major lighthouses in Peninsular Malaysia, which resulted in a minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> of between 12  nm to 14  nm, which was a reduction from the existing range of 18  nm to 25  nm. The validation of the minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> was performed in two ways; using a Full Mission Ship Simulator (FMSS), and matching the proposed minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> with the lighting system available. The results of the validation by using the FMSS between the <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> of 25  nm and 14  nm showed that the light could be sighted and identified at 58. 7  nm and 58. 6  nm, respectively, which was, therefore, not significant. The validation by matching with the lighting equipment available in the market showed that the eight-tier VLB- 44, which has replaced the rotating lighting system in the US since 2008, was highly matched with the proposed minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range.</b> This further validated the minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range.</b> The minimum <b>luminous</b> <b>range</b> is sufficient for current navigational uses and may reduce the costs for procuring and maintaining lighting systems, and will be able to sustain the operations of lighthouses in this GNSS age...|$|E

The host galaxy of PHL 909 is an elliptical galaxy (E 4) {{and the host}} of PG 0052 + 251 is a spiral (Sb). Both host galaxies are several tenths of a magnitude brighter than L, the characteristic Schechter luminosity of field galaxies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the most plausible stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) {{and the main}} origin of the tilt of the Fundamental Plane (FP) for old, massive early-type galaxies. We consider a sample of 13 bright galaxies of the Coma cluster and combine our results with those obtained from a sample of 57 lens galaxies in the same <b>luminous</b> mass <b>range.</b> We estimate the luminous mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio values of the sample galaxies by fitting their SDSS multi-band photometry with composite stellar population models computed with different dust-free, solar-metallicity templates and IMFs. We compare these measurements and those derived from two-component orbit-based dynamical modelling. The photometric and dynamical luminous mass estimates of the galaxies in our sample are consistent, within the errors, if a Salpeter IMF is adopted. On the contrary, with a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF the two luminous mass diagnostics differ at a more than 4 σ level. For the massive Coma galaxies, their stellar mass-to-light ratio scales with luminous mass as the corresponding effective quantities are observed to scale on the FP. This indicates that the tilt of the FP is primarily caused by stellar population properties. We conclude that old, massive lens and non-lens early-type galaxies obey the same luminous and dynamical scaling relations, favour a Salpeter IMF, and suggest a stellar population origin for the tilt of the FP. The validity of these results for samples of early-type galaxies with different age and mass properties still remains to be tested. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R

This is the first survey of [C II] emission, an important tracer of star formation, at a redshift range where the star formation rate density of the universe increases rapidly. We detect strong [C II] 158 μm line emission from over 80 % of the sample. We find that the [C II] line is <b>luminous,</b> in the <b>range</b> (0. 8 - 4) × 10 ^(– 3) of the far-infrared continuum luminosity of our sources, and appears to arise from photodissociation regions {{on the surface of}} molecular clouds.

40|$|The HST ACS Coma Cluster Treasury Survey {{is a deep}} two {{passband}} imaging {{survey of}} the nearest very rich cluster of galaxies, covering a range of galaxy density environments. The imaging is complemented by a recent wide field redshift survey of the cluster conducted with Hectospec on the 6. 5 m MMT. Among the many scientific applications for this data are the search for compact galaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite <b>luminous)</b> stellar systems, <b>ranging</b> from M 32 -like galaxies down to ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) /dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs). We find that all seven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and have measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical early-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis we conclude {{that three of the}} sample should be classified as compact ellipticals or M 32 -like galaxies, the remaining four being less extreme systems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity weighted ages (> 12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (- 0. 6 0. 25). Our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as the formation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here. We speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as the progenitor of compact galaxies in clusters. Comment: 23 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS.

The multi-petal flower PQR laser is also very superior in near-vertical lasing, <b>luminous</b> efficiency, dynamic <b>range</b> and color purity, leading to superior Gaussian beam profiles converted from initial Laguerre-Gaussian beams within 50 to 100 microns ranges.

However, typical LED printers use selfoc-lens arrays (SLAs) to concentrate and guide individual light, but the expensive SLA technology is complicated and monopolized by a Japanese co. On the other hand, we have developed a micro-collimator for non-parallel to parallel beam guiding to replace the SLA technology. The micro-collimator can be fabricated through a few processing steps, once its ray optics design is optimized for light microguiding with right focal lengths. In order to fabricate the micro-collimator we use a photoresist reflow method and soft molding. A photoresist layer is patterned by conventional photolithography {{and an array of}} dots reflow into multi- lens shape. We then transfer the photoresist microstructure to a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by a casting method. The PDMS is spin coated where the coating revolutions per minute (rpm) should be adjusted for proper thickness. Details of the design, its fabrication, and the results will be described...|$|R

The removal efficiency for ammonia was 44. 3 and 76. 7 % with effluent from the UASB and LA, respectively. The efficiency of phosphorus removal of the culture with UASB reached 89. 6 %, in contrast with the LA was 76. 5 % after 96 h of phycoremediation. The efficiency of phosphorus removal of the culture with UASB reached 89. 6 %, in contrast with the LA was 76. 5 % after 96 h of phycoremediation. The harvested biomass from the UASB effluent showed 56. 1, 34. 4 and 1. 1 % protein, carbohydrates and lipids, respectively. Comparatively, the cellular composition of cultivated microalgae with LA effluent had decreased in protein (44 %) but the carbohydrate content was higher (41. 9 %) and no difference in lipid content (2 %).
