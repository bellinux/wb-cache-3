25|$|Jaina Island is a pre-Columbian Maya {{archaeological site}} in the present-day Mexican state of Campeche. A small <b>limestone</b> <b>island</b> on the Yucatán Peninsula's Gulf coast with only a tidal inlet {{separating}} it from the mainland, Jaina served as an elite Maya burial site, and is notable for {{the high number of}} fine ceramic figurines excavated there.|$|E
25|$|Heavy sea {{conditions}} saw {{at least}} 10 men drown {{at the first}} attempt to launch a boat. After one week a long boat was launched. Later, {{most of the remaining}} crew was ferried on the long boat to what would be later known as Gun Island; a flat, rocky, 800 by 350m <b>limestone</b> <b>island</b> located 4km off the reef. From Gun and surrounding islands, the critical commodity of fresh water was available, as well as vegetables, birds and seals that were combined with the ship's goods to sustain the survivors.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, eight iguanas {{were moved}} from Anegada to Guana Island, British Virgin Islands, {{to start a}} second {{population}} in part of the species' former range. Guana Island is not a <b>limestone</b> <b>island,</b> and does not provide as many natural retreats as Anegada does. The iguanas appear to be doing well and reproducing in areas free of feral sheep, which is its only competitor for vegetation. Approximately 20 adult iguanas are estimated to inhabit Guana and offspring have been seen each year since 1987. Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep, which may improve the habitat for iguanas.|$|E
30|$|<b>Limestone</b> <b>islands</b> {{are found}} only in places where uplift has been {{occurring}} for prolonged periods. These include intraplate locations where there are localized oceanic-lithospheric swells, such as the South Pacific Superswell which accounts for the elevation of atoll islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia) (McNutt and Fischer 1987). The other major intraplate location in which <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> are found is where their underpinning plates are flexing, typically because they are moving toward ocean trenches faster than {{the rate at which}} they can be accommodated there; good examples are the Loyalty islands (New Caledonia) (Dickinson 2013). <b>Limestone</b> <b>islands</b> also rise from forearc zones along convergent plate boundaries. In Fig.  4, these are visible in Tonga and Vanuatu; the Lau island group (eastern Fiji), which consists mostly of <b>limestone</b> <b>islands,</b> is a remnant forearc isolated from proximal convergence by opening of the back-arc Lau Basin (Nunn 1998 a).|$|R

30|$|<b>Limestone</b> low <b>islands</b> {{are those}} which are {{composed}} of at least 80  % calcareous rock types and rise to a maximum elevation of less than 30  m above mean sea level. In the Pacific, these island types are common where high <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> are found (see above), the distinction often being largely attributable {{to the degree of}} net uplift that particular islands have experienced. Low <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> are also found in many places (not tectonically active) where reef islands are found (see below) and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two types. The low <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> tend to be significantly older and typically formed (in part at least) from reefs that were living around 6  m above present sea level during the Last Interglacial period, around 125, 000  years ago and sometimes during earlier Quaternary interglacial periods.|$|R

500|$|Most of Dorset's {{coastline}} {{is part of}} the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site, which stretches for [...] between Studland and Exmouth in Devon. This coast {{documents the}} entire Mesozoic era, from Triassic to Cretaceous and is noted for its geological landforms. The Dorset section has yielded important fossils, including Jurassic trees and the first complete Ichthyosaur, discovered near Lyme Regis in 1811 by Mary Anning. The county features some notable coastal landforms, including examples of a cove (Lulworth Cove), a natural arch (Durdle Door) and chalk stacks (Old Harry Rocks). Jutting out into the English Channel at roughly the midpoint of the Dorset coastline is the Isle of Portland, a <b>limestone</b> <b>island</b> that is connected to the mainland by Chesil Beach, a [...] long shingle barrier beach protecting Britain's largest tidal lagoon.|$|E

5000|$|The Loyalty Islands, {{a hundred}} {{kilometers}} to the east, are coral and <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> built {{on top of}} ancient collapsed volcanoes originating due to subduction at the Vanuatu trench.|$|R
30|$|Tectonism {{also plays}} a role in the {{formation}} of large islands, particularly along island forearcs adjoining convergent plate boundaries where successive upthrusting of reefs and shallow-water sediments can create large <b>limestone</b> <b>islands.</b> Islands like Espiritu Santo (3885  km 2) in Vanuatu and Vava’u (260  km 2) in Tonga were created in this fashion (Greene and Wong 1988; Nunn 1998 b).|$|R
500|$|The Carboniferous <b>Limestone</b> <b>island</b> {{rises to}} about [...] {{and serves as}} a wind and wave break, {{sheltering}} {{the upper reaches of the}} Bristol Channel. The island is now uninhabited, with the exception of the wardens. It is protected as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with a large bird population and plants including wild peonies. There was a signal station or watchtower on the island in Roman times, but there may have been human habitation as early as the Iron Age. In the 6th century it was home to St Gildas and to a small Augustinian priory in the 12th and 13th centuries. An inn was built in 1832 and used for holidays in the 19th century. A bird sanctuary was established in 1931 and since 1951 has been leased to charitable trusts. It is now owned by the Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust.|$|E
2500|$|Mona is a mainly flat plateau {{surrounded}} by sea cliffs. It {{is composed of}} dolomite and limestone with many caves found throughout. [...] With an arid climate and untouched by human development, many endemic species inhabit the island, such as the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). Its topography, ecology, and modern history are {{similar to that of}} Navassa Island, a small <b>limestone</b> <b>island</b> located in the Jamaica Channel, between Jamaica and Haiti.|$|E
50|$|The Limestone Islands are two islands, North <b>Limestone</b> <b>Island</b> and South <b>Limestone</b> <b>Island,</b> in Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada, 14 miles km west of Parry Sound.|$|E
30|$|<b>Limestone</b> high <b>islands</b> appear {{proportionally}} {{more numerous}} along convergent plate boundaries, reflecting perhaps the long-term uplift they have experienced. <b>Limestone</b> low <b>islands</b> in such locations {{tend to be}} either outliers of larger (higher) islands and/or farther from places where uplift rates are highest. One example of the latter situation {{is found in the}} Loyalty Islands group (New Caledonia) which is rising obliquely across a lithospheric flexure; <b>limestone</b> high <b>islands</b> like Maré are near the crest of the flexure, <b>limestone</b> low <b>islands</b> like Beautemps-Beaupré are just beginning to rise up its flank (Dickinson 2013). Another example comes from the (limestone) forearc in Tonga which adjoins the Tonga-Kermadec Trench, at one point of which the (submerged) Louisville Ridge is being subducted, resulting in anomalous forearc uplift above (Dupont and Herzer 1985); <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> like Tongatapu rising from the forearc above the Louisville Ridge are high, while others like most in the Ha’apai group are lower because they are not so affected (Nunn 1998 b).|$|R
50|$|Another {{specific}} {{feature of}} Halong Bay is {{the abundance of}} lakes inside the <b>limestone</b> <b>islands.</b> For example, Dau Be island has six enclosed lakes. All these island lakes occupy drowned dolines within fengcong karst.|$|R
50|$|The Palau ground dove is {{endemic to}} Palau. It {{is one of}} two species of {{terrestrial}} pigeons in Palau, the other being the larger Nicobar pigeon. It lives in dense forest and woodlands, preferring <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> to volcanic islands.|$|R

50|$|Limestone Island/Goose Island (35°29'30.29"S 138°49'56.99"E) {{is a small}} island, {{which is}} located in the Game Reserve. It is located 970 m off the {{northern}} coast line of the island. It has a population of 0, and it was named <b>Limestone</b> <b>Island</b> because there is limestone rock formations on the island. The island is rarely set foot on by humans, and it has been known to flood in the middle of winter, making the island fully submerged in water. <b>Limestone</b> <b>Island</b> can be viewed very easily from Goolwa north because it is only 700 m away.|$|E

30|$|Contrary to the {{situation}} with volcanic <b>islands</b> (see above), <b>limestone</b> low <b>islands</b> are more numerous (10  %) than <b>limestone</b> high <b>islands</b> (7  %) in the Pacific (Fig.  6). This can be explained in two ways. First, uplift processes are generally unable to raise <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> more than 30  m, something {{that is consistent with}} the stop-start nature of uplift in many situations; examples where over long time periods bursts of coseismic subsidence are separated by interseismic subsidence have been described from Fiji and Vanuatu (Calmant et al. 1999; Nunn 1995). Second, the form of most limestone islands—characterized by flat (former reef) surfaces rather than peaks—means that it may be less common to find any part of them elevated above the 30 -m threshold.|$|R

50|$|The {{climate of}} the {{ecoregion}} is tropical, and varies from humid to arid. Geology and topography also vary, with larger mountainous islands of continental rock, volcanic islands, and low-lying coral and <b>limestone</b> <b>islands.</b> The bioregion includes tropical moist forests, tropical dry forests, tropical pine forests, flooded grasslands and savannas, xeric shrublands, and mangroves.|$|R
50|$|They {{are very}} unusual islands in many respects, for their {{geography}} {{is quite different}} from that of the other 30,000 islands in Georgian bay, for most of those islands are made up of granitic bedrock, where as the <b>Limestone</b> <b>Islands</b> are made up of, as their name reflects, completely of <b>limestone.</b> The south <b>island</b> displays a flat terrain inhabited by low vegetation, which is reportedly much more friendly that its sister <b>island,</b> the North <b>Limestone,</b> which is infested with poison ivy.|$|R

30|$|It is also {{possible}} that the majority of <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> in the high and low sub-categories have different origins, the former being largely the product of uplift while the latter are mostly a result of sea-level fall. Examination of the distribution of limestone high and low islands (Fig.  6) suggests this may indeed be the case. <b>Limestone</b> low <b>islands</b> in intraplate situations are not generally found near the high ones. Most of the former appear to be relict reef surfaces from pre-Holocene interglaciations; examples come from parts of the Line islands [eastern Kiribati—Schlanger et al. (1984)]. Only a few <b>limestone</b> high <b>islands</b> are found in intraplate situations; they include the islands of Nauru and Niue, which evolved because of lithospheric flexure attributable, respectively, to volcano loading and plate convergence (Hill and Jacobson 1989; Nunn and Britton 2004).|$|R
30|$|<b>Limestone</b> high <b>islands</b> {{are those}} which are {{composed}} of at least 80  % calcareous rock types and rise to a maximum elevation of at least 30  m above mean sea level. In the Pacific, these island types are commonest in those places where (tectonic) uplift has been occurring for several 100, 000  years, most commonly {{as a result of}} one (oceanic) plate being pushed up over another as is usual along convergent plate boundaries. High <b>limestone</b> <b>islands</b> commonly develop along such forearcs. Elsewhere collision/compression of lithospheric plates may cause uplift of islands in places where subduction is not taking place.|$|R
