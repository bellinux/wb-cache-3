40|$|In {{this paper}} we claim that {{location}} and <b>locatum</b> verbs are grammatically different, contrary to some recent analyses (Mateu 2001; 2008; Harley 2005). While aspectual tests {{are known to}} distinguish both classes, we adduce new evidence from degree quantification tests pointing in the same direction. In particular, location verbs seem to be change-of-state verbs, and <b>locatum</b> verbs behave rather like degree achievements and unergative verbs of variable telicity. We claim that these differences must be accounted for in the syntactic representation of locative verbs. While location verbs involve an abstract bounded path, articulated through {{the combination of a}} Path preposition and a Place preposition, <b>locatum</b> verbs involve an abstract predicative preposition that allows for degree quantification of the root and contextually determined (a) telicity...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer {{a study on}} the {{interpretation}} of plural definites in discourse (‘the tank engines’) and their interaction with spatial adpositions (‘to’ and ‘at’). The novel empirical findings in the paper support the following assumptions on the contribu-tion of spatial adpositions to the interpretation of plural definites. First, the interpre-tation of plural definites can be influenced by the lexical aspect type of adpositions. While ‘to’ as ‘telic’ predicate can license both a ‘collective’ and a ‘distributive’ reading for plural definites, ‘at’ as an ‘atelic’ predicate only licenses a ‘collective’ reading. Second, the precise lexical content of adpositions determines which interpretation is accessed. It is claimed that ‘at’ denotes a ‘general location’ relation between <b>locatum</b> and landmark object, and thus licenses a collective reading for plural definites...|$|E
40|$|Argument/oblique alternations have {{received}} considerable attention {{for what they}} may reveal about the structure of lexical semantic representations. I argue that alternations are derived not from lexical semantic structure but rather from subtle variations in thematic role assignments. Consider the locative alternation: (1) (a) John loaded the hay onto the wagon. (b) John loaded the wagon with the hay. Previous approaches (see Levin and Rappaport 1988, inter alia) have claimed that the two variants of load represent two distinct event types (change-of-location vs. change-of-state), each of which makes a different participant (the <b>locatum</b> or location) more prominent in the underlying lexical semantic representation, determining the choice of direct object. However, little previous work has spelled out explicitly how structural prominence explains certain differences in the entailments of each variant. In (1) the direct objects are holistically affected, i. e. the hay is all moved in (1 a) and the wagon totally loaded in (1 b), but the oblique participants are underspecified for holistic affectedness (Anderson 1971, Dowty 1991), as shown in (2). (2) (a) i. John loaded the hay onto the wagon, filling the entire wagon. ii. John loaded the hay onto the wagon, and still had room for the grain. iii. #John loaded the hay onto the wagon, and still had two bales left over...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I outline a {{semantic}} analysis of argument/oblique alternations. I argue that when such alternations exhibit semantic contrasts {{it is always}} {{in terms of the}} relative number of entailments associated with the alternating participant. I sketch a framework for capturing these contrasts in HPSG, using the locative alternation as a case study: 1 (1) a. John loaded the hay onto the wagon. b. John loaded the wagon with the hay. In (1 a) the <b>locatum</b> is realized as a direct argument and in (1 b) as an oblique, and vice versa for the location participant. The classic semantic observation (Anderson 1971) is that whichever participant is realized as direct object receives a “holistically affected” interpretation (all moved or all loaded up) : (2) a. John loaded the hay onto the wagon, leaving enough space for the grain. b. #John loaded the wagon with the hay, leaving enough space for the grain. (3) a. John loaded the wagon with the hay, with enough left over to fill the pick-up. b. #John loaded the hay onto the wagon, with enough left over to fill the pick-up. Only the oblique realizations are acceptable in a context where they are not holistically affected. 1 This {{is part of a larger}} study based on a theory of thematic roles as sets of entailments, following primarily Dowty (1991). I use the term “entailment ” in the sense of Dowty’s (1989) “lexical entailments”, i. e. properties a verb ascribes to an argument due to its role in the event, ignoring their ontological status as e. g. entailments vs. implicatures. See Beavers (to appear) for more details on the English data motivating this analysis and previous literature on the semantic basis of alternations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study on the acquisition of telicity by Spanish and English native speakers. In addition to the study of acquisition, it investigates the syntactic and semantic properties of <b>locatum</b> constructions (e. g., the water filled the bucket), which are sentences that contain two internal arguments and whose subject is non-agentive. This dissertation explores the syntactic and semantic properties of elements of the verb phrase that had not been previously considered in the interpretation of telicity, such as the role of non-agentive subjects and the type of movement that takes place in the checking of the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features. ^ Contrary to the assumption that only the direct internal argument of the verb can delimit an event, I argue that objects generated in the lower verb phrase, by virtue of being an internal argument of the verb can delimit an event. An object delimits an event by checking the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features in spec-AspP, either by covert or overt movement. If a predicate contains one internal argument (e. g., the boy filled the bucket) the checking of the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features takes place via covert movement. That is, only the NPs specific quantification features move covertly to check the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features in spec-AspP. However, if the predicate contains two internal arguments (e. g., fill the bucket with water), the surfaced subject (e. g., the water filled the bucket) by virtue of being an internal argument of the verb, checks the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features as the category and its features move overtly to subject position. ^ The study shows that young children understand telicity when the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features are checked via overt movement, but have difficulties understanding telicity when the verb 2 ̆ 7 s telic features are checked via covert movement. I propose that predicates whose telicity involves overt movement should be acquired earlier than predicates whose telicity involves covert movement because overt movement is an operation that happens between D-structure and S-structure before the sentence is pronounced. Predicates whose telicity involves covert movement might be acquired at a later age of development because covert movement happens between S-structure and LF after the sentence is pronounced. ...|$|E
