Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely <b>loving.</b> <b>The</b> only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, VH1 {{broadcast}} a ten-part series entitled I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s. The series {{was adapted from}} a BBC series, first broadcast in 2000, in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s, coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from 2003's I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s, to further variants like I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s Strikes Back, I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s, and I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s: Part Deux. More recently, VH1 premiered I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s 3-D and I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s: Volume 2. So eager was the network {{to capitalize on the}} trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, {{despite the fact that the}} decade had not yet ended (I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> New Millennium, broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000-2007). This was thought to be final installment of the series until 2014, when I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> 2000s continued the format.|$|R

25|$|The Parable of the Prodigal Son {{is also a}} {{recurring}} theme {{in the works of}} Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted the parable in a different way to the conventional reading. His version of the parable was not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family; the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In <b>loving</b> <b>the</b> family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned.|$|E
25|$|JR Chandler and Babe Carey are fictional {{characters}} of the JR and Babe or Jabe couple from the American daytime drama All My Children. JR Chandler was portrayed by Jacob Young. Babe Carey was portrayed by actress Alexa Havins, and then by Amanda Baker. Written as volatile and yet <b>loving,</b> <b>the</b> up-and-down romance tells of a young star-crossed couple who met one captivating night {{at the end of}} a fog-covered dock and from there are faced with much interference, significantly but unintentionally caused by each other, in their struggle for true happiness.|$|E
25|$|According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance {{critic of}} The Times Literary Supplement and chief theatre {{critic of the}} Financial Times, now chief dance critic for The New York Times), the Ondine myth {{is said to be}} an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of {{repressed}} virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human protagonist, in <b>loving</b> <b>the</b> nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love-in-death that the man desires most.|$|E

25|$|Dove {{was born}} to a wealthy family in Canandaigua, New York. His parents, William George and Anna Elizabeth, were of English ancestry. William Dove was {{interested}} in politics and named his son Arthur Garfield, after the Republican candidates for President and Vice-President in the 1880 election, James Garfield and Chester Arthur, who ultimately won the vote. Arthur Dove grew up <b>loving</b> <b>the</b> outdoors on a farm; however, {{his father was a}} very successful businessman who owned a brickyard (along with city real estate) and expected his son to become wealthy. Dove's childhood interests included playing the piano, painting lessons, and being a pitcher on a high school baseball team. As a child, he was befriended by a neighbor, Newton Weatherby, a naturalist who helped form Dove's appreciation of nature. Weatherby was also an amateur painter who gave Dove pieces of leftover canvas to work with.|$|E

25|$|Bunthorne, heartbroken by Patience's rejection, {{has chosen}} to raffle himself off among his lady {{followers}} ("Let the merry cymbals sound"), the proceeds going to charity. The Dragoons interrupt the proceedings, and, led by the Duke, attempt to reason with the ladies ("Your maiden hearts, ah, do not steel"), but the ladies are too busy clamouring for tickets to the raffle to listen ("Come walk up"). Just as Bunthorne is handing the bag to the unattractive Jane, ready for the worst, Patience interrupts the proceedings and proposes to unselfishly sacrifice herself by <b>loving</b> <b>the</b> poet ("True Love must single-hearted be"). A delighted Bunthorne accepts immediately, and his followers, their idol lost, return to the Dragoons to whom they are engaged ("I hear the soft note of the echoing voice"). All seems resolved until Grosvenor enters and the ladies, finding him poetic, aesthetic, and far more attractive than Bunthorne, become his partisans instead ("Oh, list while we a love confess"), much {{to the dismay of}} the Dragoons, Patience, Bunthorne and especially Grosvenor himself.|$|E

500|$|During the 1990s, to be a [...] "rockist" [...] {{was defined}} as {{demanding}} a perception of authenticity in pop music despite whatever artifice is needed. Seattle Weeklys Douglas Wolk acknowledged the loose definition of rockism and proposed: [...] "Rockism, let's say, is treating rock as normative. In the rockist view, rock is the standard state of popular music: the kind to which everything else is compared, explicitly or implicitly." [...] In 2004, music critic Kelefa Sanneh offered a definition of rockists: [...] "omeone who reduces rock 'n' roll to a caricature, then uses that caricature as a weapon. Rockism means idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star; lionizing punk while barely tolerating disco; <b>loving</b> <b>the</b> live show and hating the music video; extolling the growling performer while hating the lip-syncher.". He further accuses rockists of projecting a sexist, racist, and homophobic point of view.|$|E
