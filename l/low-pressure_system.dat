5|$|June 9, 2015: Just {{four days}} after Andres brought record-breaking rain to the Desert Southwest, another <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> {{containing}} the remnants of Hurricane Blanca brought more record-breaking rainfall to many Arizona cities, including Tucson and Yuma.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 1. It steadily organized as it moved westward, and resembled a tropical depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics, and remained simply a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system.</b> The wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had tropical storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to Tropical Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8.|$|E
5|$|The area of {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} would soon become Chantal began in a large envelope of low pressure {{on the morning of}} September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central north Atlantic Ocean. This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system.</b> On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30mph (50km/h) and a 1010millibar (29.83inHg) pressure reading. This reading indicated the system developed into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season.|$|E
50|$|Often, people mistake nor'easters for {{tropical}} cyclones {{and do not}} {{differentiate between}} the two weather systems. Nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> meaning that they thrive on cold air. Tropical cyclones are warm-core <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> which means they thrive on warm temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{precipitation}} distribution {{associated with}} a surface temperature rise in the late 1980 s, which accompanied a climatic regime shift, are investigated using Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) data of the Japan Meteorological Agency, and their relations with the variability of surface pressure patterns are revealed. After the temperature rise, the frequency of winter monsoon pressure patterns did not decrease. According to the classification of pressure patterns, long-term variations of surface pressure pattern frequencies showed negative relations between the winter monsoon and high-pressure patterns before 1992, which subsequently changed to the negative relations between the winter monsoon and traveling <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems.</b> After the temperature rise, in years when low-pressure patterns prevailed, precipitation increases were observed in western Japan due to <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> traveling over the Pacific coast, and in wider areas from central Japan to Kyusyu areas due to <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> traveling over the Sea of Japan. Recently, the frequency of stationary front patterns has been increasing with precipitation increasing in the Setouchi area of western Japan. In years with a warm winter, precipitation increased in wider areas of the Pacific coast to inland areas of central Japan. In cold winters, <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> traveling over the Pacific coast decreased precipitation in central to western Japan. However, after a temperature rise, <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> traveling over the Sea of Japan decreased precipitation at {{the coast of the}} sea of Japan from central Japan to Hokkaido...|$|R
40|$|Choosing an {{operating}} pressure {{is a critical}} decision that defines many characteristics of the fuel cell system. High stack power density is the main selling point of high-pressure systems. On the contrary, <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> have a benefit of low parasitic loss on air flow devices. Here, {{we look at the}} dynamic characteristics of both high-pressure and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems.</b> The model of a <b>low-pressure</b> air supply <b>system</b> with low-speed blowers is developed. We then perform a dynamical analysis comparing the low pressure system with the highpressure system equipped with a high-speed compressor. The differences in the transient behavior of the two systems are investigated and their sensitivity to the flow device inertia and the supply manifold volume are explored. ...|$|R
5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{was related}} to a large <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> across the central United States that intensified on February28 while over Kansas, and a cold front moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow the storms to develop. In addition, a surge of very moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm temperatures across {{the south side of}} the storm helped feed the storms. Temperatures were in the 70s°F (low 20s°C) in some areas to the south, while the mercury was below freezing on the north side. The dewpoints were in the 60°F (16°C) range as far north as southeastern Kansas, which provided extra fuel.|$|E
5|$|By September 2, the storm's {{convective}} thunderstorms warmed slightly, indicating weakening to {{just below}} Category5. An eyewall replacement cycle took place, and two eye structures formed as gradual weakening continued. By September 2, {{the storm was}} downgraded to Category3 just before it turned slightly to the west. The storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further. As the storm entered cooler waters, winds decreased to 100mph (160km/h), below major hurricane intensity. Soon Hernan was downgraded to Category1, and the eye became cloud-filled. On September 5, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds rapidly weakened to 45mph (72km/h) despite developing a new band of convection. That same day, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it began to lose tropical characteristics. Strong wind shear developed, further dissipating the depression. On September 6, the system degenerated into a remnant <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> which spawned a remnant plume of moisture that meandered {{off the coast of}} California, producing light showers.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{knowledge}} of the ozone depletion potential of chlorine in refrigerants and other possible harmful effects on the environment, trichlorofluoromethane was sometimes used as a cleaning/rinsing agent for <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Rossby {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} to Coriolis forces. A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number indicates {{a system in which}} inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{ice-free}} Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> postponing winter, {{with the long}} nights often staying above freezing {{in the south of}} the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.|$|R
5|$|When a {{tropical}} cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis, normally through {{a break in}} the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the Westerlies, its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun recurvature, entering the Westerlies. A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of Japan to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> passing over China or Siberia. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner, which move from west to east {{to the north of the}} subtropical ridge. An example of {{a tropical}} cyclone in recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.|$|E
5|$|However, shortly thereafter, Marco {{began to}} move into a less {{favorable}} environment with strong upper-level westerly winds. As a result, it weakened back to a tropical storm later on November20, after being a hurricane for only twelve hours. Despite the lesser favorable environment, Marco began to re-strengthen starting on the following day. By November22, it nearly re-gained hurricane status, with winds remaining at 70mph (110km/h). However, Marco subsequently weakened to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on November23 while south of Jamaica. A mid-level ridge rebuilt over the Bahamas and Florida, which forced Marco westward, and then northwestward. The cyclone re-organized and thus re-intensified into a tropical storm on November24. Tropical Storm Marco reached a third peak intensity with winds at 60mph (100km/h) on November25 at 1200UTC, before it weakened again. The storm maintained tropical storm status until 1200UTC on November26, when it weakened to a tropical depression once again. Marco then interacted with a cold front, causing it to degenerate into a remnant <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> at 1800UTC on November26. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on Marco, stating that the storm was merely a low-level swirl devoid of deep convection. After dissipating, the remnants of Marco drifted southward and produced heavy rainfall over Belize and Honduras.|$|E
5|$|In November2011, {{the first}} officially {{designated}} Mediterranean tropical cyclone by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed, christened as 01M by the Satellite Analysis Branch {{and given the}} name Rolf by the Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin), {{despite the fact that}} no agency is officially responsible for monitoring tropical cyclone activity in the Mediterranean. On 4November 2011, a frontal system associated with another low-pressure area monitored by FU Berlin, designated Quinn, spawned a second <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> inland near Marseille, which was subsequently named Rolf by the university. An upper-level trough on the European mainland stalled as it approached the Pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as Rolf. Heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern France and northwestern Italy, resulting in widespread landslides and flooding. On 5November, Rolf slowed while stationed above the Massif Central, maintaining a pressure of 1000mbar (29.53inHg). A stationary front, stationed between Madrid and Lisbon, approached Rolf the same day, with the cold front later encountering and become associated with Rolf, which would continue for several days.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a low-pressure area, as seen from above, depends on the hemisphere. High-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern Hemisphere; <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|The Marin is next in {{frequency}} and {{importance to the}} mistral, the cold, dry northwest wind in Provence. It is caused by <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> which enter the Gulf of Lion from the west or southwest after traversing southern France and northern Spain.|$|R
40|$|Backtrack {{simulation}} analysis indicates that wind-blown mosquitoes could have traveled from New Guinea to Australia, potentially introducing Japanese encephalitis virus. Large incursions {{of the virus}} in 1995 and 1998 were linked with <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> that sustained strong northerly winds from New Guinea to the Cape York Peninsula...|$|R
5|$|Mediterranean {{cyclones}} {{have been}} compared to polar lows—cyclonic storms which typically develop in the far regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres—for their similarly small size and heat-related instability; however, while medicanes nearly always feature warm-core lows, polar lows are primarily cold-core. The prolonged life of medicanes and similarity to polar lows is caused primarily by origins as synoptic-scale surface lows and heat-related instability. Heavy precipitation and convection within a developing Mediterranean tropical cyclone are usually incited by the approach of an upper-level trough—an elongated area of low air pressures—bringing downstream cold air, encircling an existing <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system.</b> After this occurs, however, a considerable reduction in rainfall rates occurs despite further organization, coinciding with a decrease in previously high lightning activity as well. Although troughs will often accompany medicanes along their track, separation eventually occurs, usually in the later part of a Mediterranean tropical cyclone's life cycle. At the same time, moist air, saturated and cooled while rising into the atmosphere, then encounters the medicane and permits further development and evolution into a tropical cyclone. Many of these characteristics are also evident in polar lows.|$|E
5|$|On July24, 2001, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa, and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Little cyclonic development occurred until July28, when convection began to increase along the wave. The wave moved into the eastern Caribbean on July29, and its convection continued to increase while it tracked west-northwest over the subsequent few days. The disturbance emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August1, with rainfall noted over southern Florida and the western tip of Cuba. That same day, a broad <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> developed along the wave near the Dry Tortugas {{at the end of the}} Florida Keys, which began to intensify as it moved northwestward. At around 1800UTC on August2, an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the system discovered that the low had organized into {{a tropical}} storm, which received the name Barry. Post-hurricane season reanalysis, however, revealed that the low had become a tropical depression six hours earlier. There is uncertainty as to whether Barry actually held tropical characteristics at the time of designation, because of an upper-level low that was situated over the cyclone's surface center.|$|E
25|$|A <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} {{across the}} southwestern United States on November 30 and brought significant rainfall for {{portions of the}} Desert Southwest as well as portions of southern California from Los Angeles to the Mexico border, where destructive fires took place in October 2007 near San Diego and Los Angeles.|$|E
40|$|On April 15 and 19, 1998, two intense {{dust storms}} were {{generated}} over the Gobi desert by springtime <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> descending from the northwest. The windblown dust was detected and its evolution followed by its yellow color on SeaWiFS satellite images, routine surface-based monitoring, and through serendipitous observations...|$|R
50|$|The 2017 Visayas and Mindanao floods was {{an event}} that caused extreme {{flooding}} within parts of the Philippines, caused by several <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems.</b> In mid-January 2017, several parts of Visayas and Mindanao experienced flooding {{as a result of}} a low-pressure area, combined with the tail-end of a cold front.|$|R
5000|$|The Free University of Berlin names <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> {{affecting}} Europe {{and gave}} the name Friedhelm to this storm.

25|$|After regaining {{strength}} {{over the}} Atlantic, she made landfall again over southeastern New York on June 22 and moved westward {{in an arc}} over southern New York into north-central Pennsylvania. She became nearly stationary over Pennsylvania by morning of June 23, but was soon absorbed by a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> that slowly drifted northeastward from Pennsylvania into New York.|$|E
25|$|Heavy rainfall, severe thunderstorms, {{and flash}} {{flooding}} occurred across several Midwest states in April 2013. Heavy rain fell after moist air surged {{ahead of a}} strong cold front and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system,</b> leaving many rivers swollen. As much as 8 inches of rainfall fell in some places. Flood warnings were in effect from Michigan to northern Arkansas and Tennessee. As of April 22, more than 200 gauges were in flood stage along rivers in the upper Midwest, including 43 in “major” flood stage. The floods {{have been responsible for}} five fatalities.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July, a deep <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> {{started to}} spread towards the British Isles. The system struck around 1 p.m. on 7 July, with the Environment Agency issuing flood alerts & {{warnings}} throughout the United Kingdom. South Yorkshire experienced heavy rainfall, and 52 people were evacuated from a care home in Thurnscoe {{due to a}} flood warning being issued in the area. An emergency command centre {{was set up by}} South Yorkshire Police in Sheffield over fears of flooding in the city, and authorities advised people to avoid the Meadowhall area because of high water levels on the River Don. Severe flooding occurred in the city's Graves Park which led to the collapse of a pedestrian footbridge along the Lower Valley Walk.|$|E
50|$|A Pineapple Express {{is driven}} by a strong, {{southern}} branch of the polar jet stream and is marked {{by the presence of}} a surface frontal boundary which is typically either slow or stationary, with waves of low pressure traveling along its axis.

500|$|A {{pressure}} {{system is a}} relative peak or lull in the sea level pressure distribution. [...] The surface pressure at sea level varies minimally, with the lowest value measured [...] and the highest recorded [...] [...] High- and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> evolve due to interactions of temperature differentials in the atmosphere, temperature differences between the atmosphere and water within oceans and lakes, the influence of upper-level disturbances, {{as well as the}} amount of solar heating or radiationized cooling an area receives.

500|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was {{the strongest}} {{off-season}} Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the United States. The second tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed on May26 from a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>system</b> offshore North Carolina. Initially subtropical, the storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics as it tracked across warmer sea surface temperatures and within an environment of decreasing vertical wind shear. Late on May27, Beryl transitioned into a tropical cyclone less than [...] from North Florida. Early the following day, the storm moved ashore near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, dropping heavy rainfall while moving slowly across the southeastern United States. A cold front turned Beryl to the northeast, and the storm became extratropical on May30.|$|E
