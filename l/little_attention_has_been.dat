25|$|The Dome of the Rock {{with its}} {{inscriptions}} are interesting in the dating of the text. These inscriptions {{have been known}} to scholars {{for more than a century}} and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, yet <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> paid to the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.|$|E

These did not pass unremarked; Hans von Bülow, for example, gave a laudatory review of the Op.35 Études in the Neue Berliner Musikzeitung in 1857, the year in which they were published in Berlin, commenting that [...] "Alkan is unquestionably the most eminent representative of the modern piano school at Paris. The virtuoso's disinclination to travel, and his firm reputation as a teacher, explain why, at present, so <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> given to his work in Germany." ...|$|E

Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to {{automobile}} accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person. At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a [...] "cushioning effect." ...|$|E

60|$|While, however, {{agreeing on}} the whole with Scrope and Lyell, as to the {{explosive}} origin of ordinary volcanic craters, Darwin clearly saw that, in some cases, great craters might be formed or enlarged, by the subsidence of the floors after eruptions. The importance of this agency, to which too <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> directed by geologists, has recently been shown by Professor Dana, in his admirable work on Kilauea and the other great volcanoes of the Hawaiian Archipelago.|$|E

This may answer why he granted Hertzman and the Brecks their franchise in 1921.

60|$|Before {{explaining}} how atoll-formed reefs acquire their peculiar structure, we must {{turn to the}} second great class, namely, Barrier-reefs. These either extend in straight lines {{in front of the}} shores of a continent or of a large island, or they encircle smaller islands; in both cases, being separated from the land by a broad and rather deep channel of water, analogous to the lagoon within an atoll. It is remarkable how <b>little</b> <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> paid to encircling barrier-reefs; yet they are truly wonderful structures. The sketch (Plate 94) represents part of the barrier encircling the island of Bolabola in the Pacific, as seen from one of the central peaks. In this instance the whole line of reef has been converted into land; but usually a snow-white line of great breakers, with only here and there a single low islet crowned with cocoa-nut trees, divides the dark heaving waters of the ocean from the light green expanse of the lagoon-channel. And the quiet waters of this channel generally bathe a fringe of low alluvial soil, loaded with the most beautiful productions of the tropics, and lying {{at the foot of the}} wild, abrupt, central mountains.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to building collections {{of works by}} international artists, the Al-Thani family is committed to developing Arab contemporary art and supporting regional artists.
