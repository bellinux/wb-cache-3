40|$|We address {{recently}} proposed chromatic {{versions of}} the classic Art Gallery Problem. Assume a simple polygon P is guarded by a finite set of point guards and each guard is assigned one of t colors. Such a chromatic guarding {{is said to be}} conflict-free if each point p∈ P sees at least one guard with a unique color among all guards visible from p. The goal is to establish bounds on the function χ_cf(n) of the number of colors sufficient to guarantee the existence of a conflict-free chromatic guarding for any n-vertex polygon. Bärtschi and Suri showed χ_cf(n) ∈ O(n) (Algorithmica, 2014) for simple orthogonal polygons and the same bound applies to general simple polygons (Bärtschi et al., SoCG 2014). In this paper, we assume the r-visibility model instead of standard <b>line</b> <b>visibility.</b> Points p and q in an orthogonal polygon are r-visible to each other if the rectangle spanned by the points is contained in P. For this model we show χ_cf(n) ∈ O(n) and χ_cf(n) ∈Ω(n / n). Most interestingly, we can show that the lower bound proof extends to guards with <b>line</b> <b>visibility.</b> To this end we introduce and utilize a novel discrete combinatorial structure called multicolor tableau. This is the first non-trivial lower bound for this problem setting. Furthermore, for the strong chromatic version of the problem, where all guards r-visible from a point must have distinct colors, we prove a Θ(n) -bound. Our results can be interpreted as coloring results for special geometric hypergraphs. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a prototype correction algorithm to reduce metal artefacts in flat detector computed tomography (FDCT) of scaphoid fixation screws. FDCT has gained interest in imaging small anatomic structures of the appendicular skeleton. Angiographic C-arm systems with flat detectors allow fluoroscopy and FDCT imaging in a one-stop procedure emphasizing their role as an ideal intraoperative imaging tool. However, FDCT imaging can be significantly impaired by artefacts induced by fixation screws. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Following ethical board approval, commercially available scaphoid fixation screws were inserted into six cadaveric specimens in order to fix artificially induced scaphoid fractures. FDCT images corrected with the algorithm were compared to uncorrected images both quantitatively and qualitatively by two independent radiologists in terms of artefacts, screw contour, fracture <b>line</b> <b>visibility,</b> bone visibility, and soft tissue definition. Normal distribution of variables was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In case of normal distribution, quantitative variables were compared using paired Student's t tests. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for quantitative variables without normal distribution and all qualitative variables. A p value of[*]<[*] 0. 05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences. RESULTS:Metal artefacts were significantly reduced by the correction algorithm (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and the fracture line was more clearly defined (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The inter-observer reliability was "almost perfect" (intra-class correlation coefficient 0. 85, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS:The prototype correction algorithm in FDCT for metal artefacts induced by scaphoid fixation screws may facilitate intra- and postoperative follow-up imaging.

With Interferometric Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) it is also possible to get the height information. The achieved accuracy of DEMs based on space images is mainly depending upon the image resolution, the height-to-base-relation and the image contrast.

40|$|Using the {{high-level}} Balmer {{lines and}} continuum, we trace the density structure of two magnetospheric disk {{segments of the}} prototypical Bp star sigma Ori E (B 2 p) as these segments occult portions of the star during the rotational cycle. High-resolution spectra of the Balmer lines >H 9 and Balmer edge were obtained on seven nights in January-February 2007 at an average sampling of 0. 01 cycles. We measured equivalent width variations due to the star occultations by two disk segments 0. 4 cycles apart and constructed differential spectra of the migrations of the corresponding absorptions across the Balmer line profiles. We first estimated the rotational and magnetic obliquity angles. We then simulated the observed Balmer jump variation using the model atmosphere codes synspec/circus and evaluated the disk geometry and gas thermodynamics. We find that the two occultations are caused by two disk segments. The first of these transits quickly, indicating that the segment resides {{in a range of}} distances, perhaps 2. 5 - 6 R_star, from the star. The second consists of a more slowly moving segment situated closer to the surface and causing two semi-resolved absorbing maxima. During its transit this segment brushes across the star's "lower" limb. Judging from the <b>line</b> <b>visibility</b> up to H 23 -H 24 during the occultations, both disk segments have mean densities near 10 ^{ 12 } cm^{- 3 } and are opaque in the lines and continuum. They have semiheights less than 1 / 2 of a stellar radius, and their temperatures are near 10500 K and 12000 K, respectively. In all, the disks of Bp stars have a much more complicated geometry than has been anticipated, as evidenced by their (sometimes) non-coplanarity, de-centerness, and from star to star, differences in disk height.

We present AMBER/VLTI high spectral resolution (R = 12000) interferometric observations across the Brγ line, accompanied by UVES high-resolution spectroscopy and SINFONI-AO assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopic data. To interpret our observations, we develop a magneto-centrifugally driven disc-wind model. Our analysis of the UVES spectrum shows that HD 98922 is a young (5 x 10 ^ 5 yr) Herbig Be star (SpT=B 9 V), located {{at a distance of}} 440 (+ 60 - 50) pc, with a mass accretion rate of 9 +/- 3 x 10 ^(- 7) M_sun yr^(- 1). SINFONI K-band AO-assisted imaging shows a spatially resolved circumstellar disc-like region (140 AU in diameter) with asymmetric brightness distribution. Our AMBER/VLTI UT observations indicate that the Brγ emitting region (radius 0. 31 +/- 0. 04 AU) is smaller than the continuum emitting region (inner dust radius 0. 7 +/- 0. 2 AU), showing significant non-zero V-shaped differential phases (i. e. non S-shaped, as expected for a rotating disc). The value of the continuum-corrected pure Brγ <b>line</b> <b>visibility</b> at the longest baseline (89 m) is 0. 8 +/- 0. 1, i. e. the Brγ emitting region is partially resolved. Our modelling suggests that the observed Brγ line-emitting region mainly originates from a disc wind with a half opening angle of 30 deg, and with a mass-loss rate of 2 x 10 (- 7) M_sun yr^(- 1). The observed V-shaped differential phases are reliably reproduced by combining a simple asymmetric continuum disc model with our Brγ disc-wind model. The Brγ emission of HD 98922 can be modelled with a disc wind that is able to approximately reproduce all interferometric observations if we assume that the intensity distribution of the dust continuum disc is asymmetric.

40|$|Abstract. This expository paper {{discusses}} some conjectures {{related to}} visibility and blockers for sets of {{points in the}} plane. 1. Visibility Graphs Let P be a finite set of points in the plane. Two distinct points v and w in the plane are visible with respect to P if no point in P is in the open line segment vw. The visibility graph V(P) of P has vertex set P, where two distinct points v, w ∈ P are adjacent {{if and only if}} they are visible with respect to P. So V(P) is obtained by drawing lines through each pair of points in P, where two points are adjacent if they are consecutive on a such a <b>line.</b> <b>Visibility</b> graphs have many interesting properties. For example, they have diameter at most 2 (assuming P is not collinear). Consider the following Ramsey-theoretic conjecture by Kára et al. [18], which has recently received considerable attention [1, 2, 21]. Conjecture 1 (Big-Line-Big-Clique Conjecture [18]). For all positive integers k and ` there is an integer n such that for every finite set P of at least n points in the plane: • P contains ` collinear points, or • P contains k pairwise visible points (that is, V(P) contains a k-clique). Conjecture 1 is true for k ≤ 5 or ` ≤ 3 [1, 2, 18], and is open for k = 6 or ` = 4. Note that the natural approach for attacking the Big-Line-Big-Clique Conjecture using extremal graph theory fails. Turán [35] proved that every n-vertex graph with more edges than the Turán graph Tn,k contains Kk+ 1 as a subgraph 1. Thus the Big-Line-Big-Clique Conjecture would be proved if every sufficiently large visibility graph with no ` collinear points has more edges than Tn,k− 1. However, Burr et al. [5] and Füredi and Palásti [15] constructed sets P of n points with no four collinear, such that P determines n 2 6 −O(n) lines each containing three points. Thus V(P) has n 23 + O(n) edges, which is less than the number of edges in Tn,k− 1 for all k ≥ 5 and large n.

Design/methodology/approach – In elaborating on the many key differences between goods and services highlighted in the literature, {{it has been argued}} that postponement strategies developed in manufacturing have a potential for improving service performance.

Its benefits include reducing costs and shortening service delivery time. Postponement can also assist service providers in re-locating the <b>line</b> of <b>visibility</b> to develop a more effective service operation.

We will discuss the relationship between rectangle and bar visibility graphs in this presentation along with their relationships to other types of well-known graph families. We will also explore different ways to construct layouts for these graphs...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{procedure for}} generating shaded images of curved surfaces is to approximate each surface element by {{a mosaic of}} polygons and to then apply one of several established polygon display algorithms. The method described here produces an excellent approximation of bi-cubic parametric surfaces in scan line order. Each surface patch is {{described in terms of}} edge curves which are intersected by successive scanning planes to form endpoints of scan <b>line</b> segments. <b>Visibility</b> is calculated for each segment by a hybrid priority/zbuffer scheme. Shading is computed using Phong's illumination model with interpolated surface normal values. CR Categories: 8. 2...|$|R
