5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would <b>look</b> <b>better.</b> The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173 which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000. This is based on claims by Dave Meltzer upon receiving information from the events promoter Zane Bresloff, and that wrestling promoters (including Vince McMahon) were known to regularly inflate attendance figures to make things <b>look</b> <b>better.</b> While the WWE and Silverdome management have always maintained that the 93,173 figure is correct, debate continues among wrestling fans {{as to what the}} true attendance was on the day. Also, Meltzer claimed that the 1992 SummerSlam at Wembley did 79,127, more than WrestleMania III. The record would be decisively broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because they {{make it easier for}} players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game <b>look</b> <b>better</b> than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E

5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would <b>look</b> <b>better</b> for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E

25|$|Changes to the plumage are variable; {{many have}} been {{selected}} to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred as they <b>look</b> <b>better</b> plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous. From {{the time of the}} Romans, white geese have been held in great esteem.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to adopt {{different}} types of fake dreadlocks that may make the hair look as real as possible. This process is called synthetic dreadlocks. There are {{two different types of}} synthetic dreadlocks. The first is dread extensions, in which other hair can be infused with the wearer's own hair. The second is dreadfalls, in which one dread is tied into another with either elastic or lace. Both of these methods are used to make dreads <b>look</b> <b>better</b> and more appealing, and to achieve the desired effect of longer hair.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves <b>look</b> <b>better</b> than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} less consistent, although he qualified for all tournaments except the Malta Cup, {{and his best}} result was a quarter-final loss to Ding Junhui at the China Open. He finished the season ranked 25, falling seven places. The 2005/2006 season did not <b>look</b> <b>better</b> either, a series of first round defeats saw him provisionally {{drop out of the}} top 32. However, he had a good run at the 2006 World Championship, beating three seeded players – Alan McManus 10–3, Stephen Maguire 13–4, and Ken Doherty 13–10 – to reach the semi-finals, where he lost to world no.7 and 2002 World Champion Peter Ebdon 16–17. In that match, Fu was 9–15 down with only one session left to play, but won seven out of the next eight frames to send the match into the deciding frame, which Ebdon eventually won. Fu's success in this tournament can be largely attributed to working with coach Terry Griffiths. Fu had used Griffiths for a short while some years ago – but did not commit to the necessary changes in technique. This run enable him to stay in the world top 32 for next season, ranked 22.|$|E

Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it <b>look</b> <b>better,</b> but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment."

500|$|The {{characters}} of Final Fantasy VIII have received praise by reviewers.

Game Revolution cited similar praise, agreeing that the change [...] "really makes the graphics impressive". Jeff Lundigran of IGN commented that the [...] "low-polygon {{characters of}} Final Fantasy VII are gone, replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high-polygon models that only <b>look</b> <b>better</b> the closer they get".
