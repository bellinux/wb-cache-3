He {{attended}} the 1984 Salomon Brothers training program (the year before Michael Lewis did as described in Liar's Poker and was hired into the Municipal Finance Department, and was based in San Francisco. Salomon Brothers was the <b>leading</b> <b>underwriter</b> of Municipal Bonds nationally as was the Firms West Coast office, {{under the leadership of}} Terry Atkinson. Luczo financed a wide variety of municipal projects including those for the Irvine Ranch Water District, the LA Department of Water and Power ("LADWOP"), the Metropolitan Water District of LA, the Orange County ("John Wayne") Airport, the University of Arizona, the Central Arizona Water Project, the Sisters of Providence Health Care System, and the Santa Clara Water District.

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} passing of the 1982 Act, {{evidence}} came to light and internal disciplinary proceedings were commenced against a number of individual underwriters who had allegedly siphoned sums from their businesses to their own accounts. These individuals included a deputy chairman of Lloyd's and of its <b>leading</b> <b>underwriters.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1945, SBC {{acquired}} the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), {{which was one}} of the largest banks in Switzerland, but became insolvent by the end of the war. SBC remained among the Swiss government's <b>leading</b> <b>underwriters</b> of debt in the post-war years. SBC, which had entered the 1950s with 31 branch offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to CHF 4billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again in the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF 10billion by 1965.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years, the firm focused on {{underwriting}} municipal bonds in New Jersey and grew relatively slowly. In 1966, John J. Ryan & Co. was named co-manager of the $179-million bond {{issue for the}} New Jersey Turnpike which established the firm {{as one of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>underwriters</b> of municipal bonds in New Jersey. Also, in the 1960s, the firm began to shift its focus toward financial services companies, particularly banks. In 1963, the firm formed a bank-stock trading and research subsidiary. In 1969, the company established a mergers and acquisitions department, which quickly earned a mandate to advise on the merger of the Bank of Sussex County into National Community Bank (later acquired by Bank of New York).|$|R
50|$|Daewoo Securities, one of {{the largest}} and most {{successful}} brokerage firms in Korea, became a subsidiary of KDB in May 2000. Since then, Daewoo Securities has managed to maintain a stellar amount of growth, generally exceeding analyst expectations. Even during the recent credit crisis, Daewoo Securities has managed to come out much less damaged than its peers due to solid risk mitigation procedures. It has approximately 3,000 employees throughout the world and is listed on the KOSPI with a market capitalization of about 3.5 trillion won, making it {{one of the}} top 50 largest firms in South Korea. Recently, its investment banking arm has performed very well, and is currently the <b>leading</b> <b>underwriter</b> for IPOs. Furthermore, after the privatization of KDB, significant amounts of potential synergy between the two companies is expected; the expertise and information network of Daewoo Securities combined with the extensive assets and M&A know-how of KDB will indisputably result in the first Korean bank that may be able to compete with global financial companies.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd's {{losses from}} the {{earthquake}} and fires were substantial, even {{though at the}} time the placement of insurance business overseas was viewed with some wariness. One of Lloyd's <b>leading</b> <b>underwriters,</b> Cuthbert Heath, famously instructed his agent in San Francisco to [...] "pay all of our policyholders in full, irrespective of the terms of their policies". The prompt and full payment of all claims arising out of the disaster helped to cement Lloyd's reputation for reliable claims payment and as an important trading partner for US brokers and policyholders. It was estimated that around 90 per cent of the damage to the city was caused by the resultant fires. Since 1906, fire following earthquake has generally been an insured peril under most policies.|$|R
5|$|By the 1980s, {{the bank}} had {{undertaken}} a major push into the securities business internationally. The bank established a position as a <b>leading</b> European <b>underwriter</b> of Eurobonds and pulled off a major coup in 1985 by pricing a large bond offering for Nestlé, Rockwell, IBM, and Mobil at below market rates.|$|R
5000|$|Swiss Bank Corporation {{found itself}} in {{relatively}} strong financial condition {{at the end of}} World War II, with CHF1.8 billion of assets. [...] By contrast, the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), founded in 1862 and one of the largest banks in Switzerland, was insolvent {{at the end of the}} war and was consequently acquired by SBC in 1945. SBC remained among the Swiss government's <b>leading</b> <b>underwriters</b> of debt in the post-war years. However, by 1947 SBC was shifting its focus back to its traditional business of lending money principally to private companies as part of the postwar rebuilding of Europe. [...] Meanwhile, the firm continued its expansion to international markets, particularly the United States where SBC focused primarily on commercial banking for corporate clients. Within Switzerland, SBC remained a full-service bank with a domestic retail banking network and an asset management business.|$|R

50|$|Collins {{constructed}} {{the building in}} 1830 and it was later owned by Pickford and Black (1876). The firm of Pickford & Black, a Nova Scotia shipping firm, was established by partners Robert Pickford (1841-1914) and William Anderson Black (1847-1934) in 1876. Pickford & Black were ship chandlers and grocers of Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1877, the firm purchased Seeton's Wharf at 51 Water's Street. By 1887, they had expanded into the steamship line, purchasing the Cunard ships Alpha and Beta, and establishing a shipping service between Halifax, Cuba, and Bermuda (1889). Pickford and Kirke also operated steamers in the Atlantic provinces. Pickford & Black acted as agents for several <b>leading</b> marine insurance <b>underwriters,</b> including Lloyd's of London, and for several European steamship lines. Robert Pickford retired in 1911 and the company became Pickford & Black Ltd. Following the death of W.A. Black (1936), the company was involved in several mergers. In 1946, Pickford & Black Ltd. managed the Maritime Stevedoring Company, and the Pickford & Black Agency, a customs brokerage. In 1975 Pickford and Black Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of McLean Kennedy Limited, and in 2002, a branch of F. K. Warren.|$|R
40|$|From {{the late}} 1990 s through 2008, the United States {{experienced}} the largest boom-and- bust cycle in its securities and housing markets since the “Roaring Twenties” and the Great Depression. Scholars {{have studied the}} {{events that led to}} the recent financial crisis and have compared those events to the causes of the Great Depression. In particular, analysts have considered whether “universal banks” – financial conglomerates that control deposit-taking banks as well as securities broker-dealers – played central roles in both crises. Congress responded to the Great Depression by adopting the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which outlawed first-generation universal banks and established a wall of separation between commercial banks and securities firms. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, regulators and courts steadily undermined Glass-Steagall, and Congress finally repealed the statute in 1999. Is it more than a coincidence that the demise of Glass-Steagall was followed by the most spectacular economic boom since the 1920 s and the most serious financial and economic crisis since the 1930 s? This article {{is part of a larger}} project in which I plan to examine the rise and fall of first-generation universal banks during the 1920 s and 1930 s and to compare their experience with the performance of second-generation universal banks during the 1990 s and 2000 s. As described in this article, first-generation universal banks became <b>leading</b> <b>underwriters</b> and distributors of securities in the United States during the 1920 s. The preeminent universal banks of the 1920 s were the two largest U. S. commercial banks – National City Bank (National City) and Chase National Bank (Chase). National City and Chase and their securities affiliates earned huge profits during the economic boom of the 1920 s but suffered massive losses during the Great Depression. Both banks received bailouts from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in December 1933. The Pecora Committee’s investigation in 1933 revealed that National City and Chase used deceptive and manipulative techniques to sell massive volumes of foreign bonds and other high-risk securities to ordinary investors and smaller financial institutions. Both banks made unsound loans to support the activities of their securities affiliates. Both banks organized trading pools to pump up the prices of their own stocks as well as the stocks of favored clients. Insiders took advantage of both banks’ securities operations to reap extraordinary financial gains. Revelations of both banks’ securities abuses and their top executives’ self-dealing triggered widespread public outrage and generated public support for enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act as well as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The abuses and conflicts of interest that occurred at National City and Chase illustrated the potential dangers of allowing commercial banks to affiliate with securities broker-dealers. The evidence produced by the Pecora Committee supported Glass-Steagall’s fundamental premise that universal banks created intolerable hazards that could not be resolved without dismantling the universal banking model. National City and Chase mobilized their deposits, lending resources, and retail branches to underwrite and sell high-risk securities to unsophisticated investors who trusted in both banks’ presumed soundness and investment expertise. National City and Chase exhibited pervasive conflicts of interest that caused both banks to make unsound loans to their securities affiliates, to investors who purchased securities from their affiliates, and to companies that issued securities underwritten by their affiliates. The disastrous experiences of National City and Chase demonstrated the clear dangers of allowing commercial banks to use their deposits and lending resources to promote speculative underwriting and trading operations. The near-collapse and bailouts of both banks also highlighted the systemic risks that arise when major banks establish close links with the securities markets. The hazards of universal banking became manifest again in the 1990 s and 2000 s. Second-generation universal banks played leading roles in securitizing and marketing high-risk, asset-backed securities (and related derivatives) that helped to precipitate the greatest worldwide boom and crash since the Great Depression. To prevent a collapse of global financial markets, government officials in the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe rescued troubled universal banks and supported not only their banking units but also their securities and other nonbanking subsidiaries. U. S. regulators arranged emergency deals that (1) converted two leading securities firms (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) into universal banks and (2) enabled existing universal banks (JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America) to become even larger by acquiring troubled securities firms. The foregoing government measures confirmed the existence of a “too-big-to-fail” (TBTF) policy that embraced the banking system as well as major segments of the securities and insurance markets. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 promised to end TBTF. However, many analysts believe that goal is a long way from being accomplished. As policymakers evaluate the desirability of further reforms to end TBTF, they should reconsider the lessons of the Great Depression as well as the wisdom of Glass-Steagall’s regime of structural separation between the banking industry and the securities markets...|$|R
