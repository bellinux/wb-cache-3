40|$|Graduation date: 1980 A <b>log</b> <b>step</b> {{develops}} when large woody debris extends {{across the}} active channel, creating {{a change in}} the water surface elevation as the stream spills over the <b>log</b> <b>step.</b> By forming a series of vertical falls, <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> reduce the amount of potential energy available for conversion to kinetic energy used for water and sediment routing. By trapping sediment supplied from upstream and adjacent hillslopes, <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> introduce an additional storage component into the sediment budget for forest streams. Simply reporting the percent of potential energy dissipated by <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> fails to reveal the significance of this function to equilibrium conditions. Forest management related addition and removal of <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> and stream adjacent trees have occurred without appreciation for the consequences to equilibrium conditions and associated trends in sediment production. Collection and analysis of data is undertaken for 13 study basins in the central Oregon Coast Range, including field surveys of 102 miles (164 km) of streams. The basins are divided into four landtypes using lithology and cluster analysis of seven morphometric variables which reflect the hydrologic and erosional regimes. Analogies between thermodynamic systems and stream systems enable derivation of equilibrium criteria which account for potential energy dissipation by falls and <b>log</b> <b>steps.</b> Calculations using the chi-square (x²) test statistic produce a quantitative measurement of the proximity to equilibrium of the stream network. A morphometric erosion factor is used to estimate mean annual sediment yield for each basin. The estimated mean annual sediment yield is then expressed as a percent of the sediment volume stored by <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> in all third, fourth, and fifth order streams. The dissipation of potential energy by <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> amounts to 6, 09 percent, approximately equal to that of falls. Landtypes do not account for the spatial variation of <b>log</b> <b>step</b> development among the study basins. However, differences in the percent of potential energy dissipated by <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> between second, third, fourth, and fifth order streams are found to be statistically significant. Silvicultural activities account for only 20 percent of all <b>log</b> <b>steps,</b> in direct proportion to the percent area clearcut (25 percent) in the 13 study basins. The mean height of <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> created by silvicultural activities is 4. 2 feet (1. 3 m), one and one-half times as great as the mean height of <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> created by natural processes. The sum of mean annual sediment yield estimates for the 13 study basins amounts to 82 percent of the total volume estimated in storage by <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> in third, fourth, and fifth order streams. Statistical analyses indicate that falls and/or <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> do not cause a significant differences in the proximity to equilibrium of the stream network. Because of the long duration time of instream large woody debris, the accumulation of <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> over time with future silvicultural activities may lead to significant impacts on equilibrium conditions which now depend more on structural controls (e. g. uplift, faulting, and lithology) imposed over geologic time. In any case, the equilibrium criteria and sedimentation impacts described provide only two standards by which to manage instream large woody debris. The geomorphic functions of instream large woody debris not incorporated as <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> and the biological functions of instream large woody debris must also be addressed in forest management decisions...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>log</b> and clast <b>steps</b> was {{studied in}} 53 step-pool reaches in 32 streams in northwestern Montana. In each reach, 20 {{consecutive}} steps were sampled. Drainage areas ranged from 0. 5 to 11. 5 km 2. Mean step spacing {{was found to}} be proportional to channel gradient, width of the bankfull channel, and drainage area; mean step height was proportional to the width of the channel. No significant difference exists between clast and <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> with regard to step spacing and step height. This suggested either that (1) woody debris is mobile in even the smallest channels in the study area, or (2) channel flows arrange clast steps around immobile woody debris. Calculations of theoretical entrainment and transport of sediment suggest that the coarse clasts forming steps are capable of being entrained at bankfull discharge in most channels. The presence of immobile <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> (composed of living roots) in the upstream reaches, an increase in the percentage of <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> with gradient, and a decrease in this percentage with the width of the bankfull channel and drainage area, imply that woody debris is mobile primarily in the downstream reaches. Calculations of flow resistance suggest that most steps serve to maximize flow resistance. These results support the second hypothesis, that the height and spacing of clast steps are adjusted around immobile <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> to maintain consistent step characteristics...|$|R

In {{contrast to}} the ephemeral streams, Tony Bear Creek is thus judged to be in dynamic equilibrium. Proportion of <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> to total steps (gravel bars plus logs) was much smaller in Tony Bear Creek (about 16 %) than in five other mountain streams (about 50 %).

However, problems with engagement and retention of participants in these programs prevent long-term behavior change. New ways of accessing online content (eg, via smartphones) may enhance engagement in these interventions, which in turn may improve {{the effectiveness of the}} programs. Objective: To measure the potential of a newly developed smartphone application to improve health behaviors in existing members of a website-delivered {{physical activity}} program (10, 000 Steps, Australia). The aims of the study were to (1) examine the effect of the smartphone application on self-monitoring and self-reported physical activity levels, (2) measure the perceived usefulness and usability of the application, and (3) examine the relationship between the perceived usefulness and usability of the application and its actual use. Methods: All participants were existing members of the 10, 000 Steps program. We recruited the intervention group (n = 50) via email and instructed them to install the application on their smartphone and use it for 3 months. Participants in this group were able to <b>log</b> their <b>steps</b> by using either the smartphone application or the 10, 000 Steps website. Following the study, the intervention group completed an online questionnaire assessing perceived usability and usefulness of the smartphone application. We selected control group participants (n = 150), matched for age, gender, level of self-monitoring, preintervention physical activity level, and length of membership in the 10, 000 Steps program, after the intervention was completed. We collected website and smartphone usage statistics during the entire intervention period. Results: Over the study period (90 days), the intervention group <b>logged</b> <b>steps</b> on an average of 62 days, compared with 41 days in the matched group. Intervention participants used the application 71. 22 % (2210 / 3103) of the time to <b>log</b> their <b>steps.</b> Logistic regression analyses revealed that use of the application was associated with an increased likelihood to <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> daily during the intervention period compared with those not using the application (odds ratio 3. 56, 95 % confidence interval 1. 72 – 7. 39). Additionally, use of the application was associated with an increased likelihood to log greater than 10, 000 steps on each entry (odds ratio 20. 64, 95 % confidence interval 9. 19 – 46. 39). Linear regression analysis revealed a nonsignificant relationship between perceived usability(r =. 216, P =. 21) and usefulness (r =. 229, P =. 17) of the application and frequency of <b>logging</b> <b>steps</b> in the intervention group. Conclusion: Using a smartphone application as an additional delivery method to a website-delivered physical activity interventionmay assist in maintaining participant engagement and behavior change. However, due to study design limitations, these outcomes should be interpreted with caution. More research, using larger samples and longer follow-up periods, is needed to replicate the findings of this study...|$|R

Although this question is of central importance to olfactory neuroscience, it can only be answered in model systems where neural representations can be measured and discrimination thresholds between odors can be character-ized. Here, we establish these thresholds for a panel of odors using a Pavlovian paradigm in the moth Manduca sexta. Moths were differentially conditioned to respond to one odor (CS+) but not another (CS) using undiluted odorants to minimize salience-dependent learning effects. At 24 and 48 h postconditioning, moths were tested for the presence of a conditioned response (CR) with a blank, then the CS+ and CS (pseudorandomly) across a 5 -log step series of increasing concentration. Results identified discrimination thresholds and established that differential CRs to the CS+ and CS increased with stimulus concentration. Next, 3 separate groups of moths were differentially conditioned at either one-log step below, at, or one <b>log</b> <b>step</b> above the identified discrimination threshold. At 24 and 48 h postconditioning, moths were tested sequentially with a blank, the concentration used for conditioning, and then undiluted odor. Conditioning at one <b>log</b> <b>step</b> below the discrimination threshold established a CR, indicating both stimulus detection and learning, but was insufficient to establish evidence of discrimination.

40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that {{determine}} successful salmonid embryo incubation in the many structurally modified river systems of the Northern Hemisphere is crucial for maintaining healthy salmonid populations. In this context, the joint impact of fine sediment accumulation together with anthropogenic river modifications on salmonid embryo survival has been rarely investigated. We investigated brown trout embryo survival to hatch (STH) together with ten physicochemical, hydraulic and morphological parameters in artificial brown trout redds in a heavily modified stream (i. e. channelized, artificial <b>log</b> <b>steps)</b> in central Switzerland. We were interested to understand whether (i) STH is {{more sensitive to the}} timing and duration of low oxygen rather than a mean oxygen concentration, (ii) STH was negatively affected by increased fine sediment deposition decreasing redd gravel permeability, (iii) higher water levels, causing fine sediment resuspension, benefit STH, (iv) STH was negatively affected by organic content in the redds and especially (v) hydraulic gradients related to redd scale bed-form and/or the artificial step structure benefit embryo STH, and hence could mitigate the negative impact of fine sediment and/or organic content. Up to 50 %, brown trout embryos survived with interstitial oxygen exceeding 3  mg L− 1. Embryos endured up to 6  days ≤ 1  mg L− 1 but were more sensitive to oxygen depletion close to hatch. Therefore, timing and duration of low oxygen were important for embryo STH, and hence, oxygen dynamics need to be considered when assessing in redd conditions for salmonid STH. Partial least squares regression identified the horizontal hydraulic gradient, Fredle index, distance to artificial <b>log</b> <b>steps</b> upstream and amount of accumulated fine sediment as influential predictors for embryo STH. The water level above the redd and total organic carbon content in the redd were not influential. Among the identified influential predictors, 70. 9 % of the variation in STH could be explained by a logistic regression model containing redd distance to the next upstream step (26. 4 %, P = 0. 004), Fredle index (27. 2 %,P = 0. 003) and horizontal hydraulic gradient (10. 1 %, P = 0. 04). In the logistic regression, the amount of accumulated fine sediment (P = 0. 75), field seasons (P = 0. 93) and field sites (P = 0. 66) was non-significant. In summary, brown trout STH was sensitive to redd gravel permeability, which was measured as Fredle index and affected by fine sediment deposition. At the same time, hydraulic gradients related to artificial <b>log</b> <b>steps,</b> which enhanced hyporheic exchange, benefited embryo STH, and hence mitigated fine sediment impact. This result can be probably transferred to other surface water-dominated river systems with good hyporheic water quality. To what extent it can be transferred to river systems with other hydraulic boundary conditions remains to be evaluated. Altogether, our results clearly indicate that the impact of fine sediment on salmonid incubation success needs to be understood in the hydrological and morphological context of the particular river system...|$|R
