This networking project’s focus is to provide a hub of knowledge particularly relating to the practical methods of vegetation establishment and restoration as well as sustainable land management in arid and dryland areas. The aim of the Action is to coordinate experts in many fields (hydrology, soils, ecology, agronomy, landscape planning, etc.) to accumulate traditional and scientific knowledge as well to innovate through collaborations. Education and training are {{a key part of the}} Action, and post-graduate students have the opportunity to undertake short-term scientific missions and training schools. The Action will continue for 4 years and provide an important source of information on the combat of desertification and arid and dry <b>lands</b> <b>restoration</b> for all stakeholder groups...|$|R

40|$|Experiences {{worldwide}} {{reveal that}} degraded <b>lands</b> <b>restoration</b> projects achieve little success or fail. Hence, understanding the underlining causes and accordingly, devising appropriate restoration mechanisms is crucial. In doing so, the ever-increasing aspiration and global commitments in degraded <b>lands</b> <b>restoration</b> could be realized. Here we explain that Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) biotechnology {{is a potential}} mechanism to significantly improve the restoration success of degraded lands. There are abundant scientific evidences to demonstrate that AMF significantly improve soil attributes, increase above and belowground biodiversity, significantly improve tree/shrub seedlings survival, growth and establishment on moisture and nutrient stressed soils. AMF have {{also been shown to}} drive plant succession and may prevent invasion by alien species. The very few conditions where infective AMF are low in abundance and diversity is when the soil erodes, is disturbed and is devoid of vegetation cover. These are all common features of degraded lands. Meanwhile, degraded lands harbor low levels of infective AMF abundance and diversity. Therefore, the successful restoration of infective AMF can potentially improve the restoration success of degraded lands. Better AMF inoculation effects result when inocula are composed of native fungi instead of exotics, early seral instead of late seral fungi, and are consortia instead of few or single species. Future research efforts should focus on AMF effect on plant community primary productivity and plant competition. Further investigation focusing on forest ecosystems and carried out at the field condition is highly recommended. Devising cheap and ethically widely accepted inocula production methods and better ways of AMF in-situ management for effective <b>restoration</b> of degraded <b>lands</b> will also remain to be important research areas.

The objectives of this study were, in severely burnt plantations two to four years post-fire, to examine the: (1) temporal patterns of succession within and among structural layers and influence of site conditions on these patterns, (2) effects of restoration treatments on composition and succession of early-seral vegetation, including terrestrial cryptogams, on moderate and harsh aspects, and (3) the role of microsites and bryophytes in germination and establishment of vascular plants. Structural layers established rapidly after wildfire in plantations following an initial floristics model of succession. Succession within and among structural layers occurred simultaneously but at different rates and with different drivers. Successional starting points differed based on fire severity, site history, species life history traits, topography and pre-disturbance plant community.
