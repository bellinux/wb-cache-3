Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.Driven by the needs of the fishing and commercial sailing industry, in 1795 Arbroath-based sailmaker Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> to <b>flax</b> sails, creating an <b>oiled</b> <b>flax.</b> This developed in the late-19th century into waxed cotton, which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre, until the early 1970s manufacturing began to decline.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute - Animal Science & IndustryKelly J. K. GettyFats {{and oils}} are an {{important}} topic in the margarine and spreads industry. The selection of these ingredients can be based on many factors including flavor, functionality, cost, and health aspects. In general, fat {{is an important component}} of a healthy diet. Fat or oil provides nine calories per gram of energy, transports essential vitamins, and is necessary in cellular structure. Major shifts in consumption of fats and oils through history have been driven by consumer demand. An example is the decline in animal fat consumption due to consumers’ concern over saturated fats. Also, consumers’ concern over the obesity epidemic and coronary heart disease has driven demand for new, lower calorie, nutrient-rich spreads products. Fats and oils can be separated into many different subgroups. “Fats” generally refer to lipids that are solid at room temperature while “oils” refer to those that are liquid. Fatty acids can be either saturated or unsaturated. If they are unsaturated, they can be either mono-, di-, or poly-unsaturated. Also, unsaturated bonds can be in the cis or trans conformation. A triglyceride, which is three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone, can have any combination of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Triglycerides are the primary components of animal and vegetable fats and oils. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in these fats and oils has a great impact on their functionality. Common fats and oils include butterfat, beef tallow, fish oils, soybean oil, rapeseed (canola) oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm kernel <b>oil,</b> coconut <b>oil,</b> <b>linseed</b> (<b>flax)</b> <b>oil,</b> and safflower oil. Typical fat and oil modification techniques include hydrogenation, interesterification, alternative hydrogenation, fractionation, blending, farm/field practices and genetic modification, and the use of fat replacers. There are many processing techniques that can be utilized in margarine and spreads production. The process can be optimized for each margarine or spreads product. There are many fats and oils in margarine and spreads formulations. Familiarity with commonly used fats and oils in regards to availability, cost, nutrition, chemistry, and functionality are important when creating a cost-effective, functional margarine or spreads product...|$|R

40|$|Several {{varieties}} of <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> are commercially available, {{and they have}} been used for many applications especially in decorative furniture finishing and as an oil painting medium. The addition of metallic driers to the <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> is a common practice, as it improves the drying rate of the paint. Several cases of fires have been reported, often involving rags soaked with <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> which have not been disposed of properly, and it is generally agreed that metal salts in the <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> {{play an important role in}} the spontaneous ignition of the oil. This paper investigates several types of <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> sold in the market and their tendency to cause self-heating of cotton which has been impregnated with <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> obtained from various sources. Experiments were performed in two reactors; a plug flow reactor for measurement of gaseous oxidation products and in a batch system for the determination of metal composition in the oil. Both plug flow and batch systems employ fifty percent of oxygen and nitrogen mixtures for several hours in each experiment. Emission of gaseous products during the reaction was quantified by micro gas chromatography (μGC), and identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Oil samples from batch system were digested using microwave and the metal composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Boiled <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> is the most reactive oil studied, followed by raw <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> and refined <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> which display similar reactivity, while the least reactive is stand <b>linseed</b> <b>oil.</b> ICP analysis confirmed the presence of cobalt in the boiled <b>linseed</b> <b>oil,</b> which enhances the rate of oxidation reaction. For boiled <b>linseed</b> <b>oil,</b> the cobalt in the oil enhances the decomposition of peroxide resulting in the formation of various radicals which oxidize the oil and the cotton wool, therefore the emission of gaseous products is higher during oxidation on the cotton wool support compared to glass wool and thus boiled <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> has the highest tendency to self heat, especially if soaked on the cotton or rags. A kinetic model of peroxide formation and decomposition has been developed based on the experimental data. The reaction rate constant of the decomposition of peroxide has been found to be higher in the reaction using cobalt compared to that of without cobalt, confirming the role of cobalt in catalysing the peroxide decomposition reaction. Abstraction reactions by the radicals during oxidation lead to subsequent reactions which are generally very exothermic. Accumulation of sufficient heat, can ultimately lead to the temperature reaching the ignition point of the oil and causing the self- heating and even ignition of the oil...|$|R

Methods: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 110 older adults randomized in two groups: placebo and <b>linseed</b> <b>oil.</b> The <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> group received supplementation with 3 g of <b>linseed</b> <b>oil.</b> Both groups received nutritional guidance and were supplemented for 90 days with monthly blood collection for biochemical analysis.
