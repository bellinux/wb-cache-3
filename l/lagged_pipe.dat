40|$|Pipelines of noisy air or {{steam flow}} systems are often lagged {{on the outside}} with an acoustically absorptive, highly porous {{material}} {{which in turn is}} covered with a thin impervious (metallic) jacket. Prediction of transverse insertion loss (reduction in break-out noise) due to this composite lagging is the subject of the present paper. A transfer matrix for the porous absorptive layer is derived for cylindrical waves in the radial direction. Making use of an impedance model, radial velocities of the bare pipe and the outer jacket for the <b>lagged</b> <b>pipe</b> are calculated. These are then combined with respective radiation impedances to calculate insertion loss due to the composite lagging as well as the bare (unconstrained) lagging. Predicted values of insertion loss are compared with the measured values from literature. Finally results of parametric studies are presented...|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} cooling system, {{which enables}} components to be cooled below the ambient temperature, but which obviates {{the requirement for}} antifreeze and <b>lagged</b> <b>pipes,</b> is to place a thermoelectric device (commonly {{referred to as a}} 'Peltier junction' or 'pelt' after Jean Peltier, who documented the effect) between the heat-generating component and the water block. Because the only sub-ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat-generating component itself, insulation is required only in that localized area. The disadvantage of such a system is a higher power dissipation.|$|R
40|$|Pipe laggings {{are used}} {{as a means of}} {{inhibiting}} the transmission of sound radiated from pipes. They are usually formed of porous jackets such as fibreglass or rockwool blankets and impervious jackets such as cladding sheets. Sometimes air spaces are used to separate these jackets from the pipe and each other. Papers in the readily available literature relating to the acoustic performance of pipe laggings are generally concerned with presenting experimental results such as frequency dependent insertion losses. The authors have developed a model to calculate the insertion losses produced by such laggings when the <b>lagged</b> <b>pipes</b> are vibrating in their low order structural modes. The results of the model indicate that negative insertion lossess are not unexpected with conventional pipe laggings, particularly at low frequencies...|$|R

50|$|Wood lagging is {{a method}} of banding wooden slats around {{pipelines}} to protect against impact, abrasion, and corrosion. Wooden lagging acts as a sheath, protecting the pipeline from damage, and is especially useful in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and other rough terrain. Boiler lagging is akin to <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging,</b> but is used to protect steam boilers.|$|R

50|$|The Do 217 was a shoulder-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Its two-spar wing {{was built}} in three sections: the centre section, incorporating part of the fuselage, and two outer wing sections with very little taper on the leading and trailing edges, leading out {{to a pair of}} broad, semi-circular wing tips. The stress bearing skin was riveted to spars and ribs. Owing to its future use as a dive-bomber, stressed skin construction was employed with the use of Z-section frames and stringers. Slotted ailerons were fitted to the outer wing sections. The inner split flaps were electrically operated and had a maximum flap angle of 55Â°. The ailerons were linked to the flap system to permit partial operation as flaperons, meaning if the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped down.The design of the rear and front spar attachments revealed the flanges of the spar were flushed with the wing surface making the most efficient structure. The outer wing leading edges were double-skinned. In the wing space, a hot air feed was fitted, using heat pumped through <b>lagged</b> <b>pipes</b> from the engines to warm up and de-ice the wings. The ducts were located just forward of the front spar flanges and in between the main spars where they could escape into the wing. The hot air could escape through the apertures at the aileron hinges. A diversion pipe was also installed in the engine nacelle, which could shut down the hot air flow to the ducts and divert the air out through bottom end of the nacelle if de-icing was not required.The fuel and oil tanks were located in the wing and centre section. The two outer fuel tanks were located next to the outer side of the engine nacelle. The outermost fuel tank contained a 160 L fuel capacity, while the tank closest to the engine could accommodate 44 imp gal of oil. Both were sandwiched in between the main and rear main spar. Between the fuselage and inner side of the engine nacelle, the 795 L main tanks were located. In the centre section a 1050 L fuel tank was installed forward of the bomb bay.|$|R

40|$|The {{glove bag}} control {{techniques}} used {{to contain the}} emission of asbestos (1332214) fibers during the removal of asbestos containing <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> were evaluated. The data were obtained during week long surveys in each of four public school buildings. Reports detailing the specific conditions and operations observed were generated for each <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> removal site. Exposure measurements determined from personal samples indicated short term exposures as high as 9. 0 fibers/cubic centimeter (f/cc) and time weighted average exposures of 0. 3 f/cc occurring during asbestos removal operations. Airborne asbestos contamination was determined in the work area before and after removal. Aggressive and nonaggressive sampling techniques were used for collecting area samples both before removal and after removal and subsequent cleaning. The results of the analyses indicated that glove bags as used at these four schools did not completely contain the asbestos being removed. In {{three of the four}} facilities workers were exposed to airborne asbestos concentrations above the OSHA permissible exposure limit (2 f/cc {{at the time of this}} study). The authors conclude that the use of glove bags results in unpredictable exposure levels that may present an exposure hazard to workers and contamination of the work site. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Bruce A.

5000|$|Acre Mill was an {{asbestos}} {{factory in}} the hilltop settlement of Old Town, owned by Cape Insulation Ltd. It was opened in 1939 {{to meet the demand}} for gas mask filters made from blue asbestos during the Second World War, and diversified into the production of other asbestos products, including rope, <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> and textile, after the war. In 1970, the company closed the mill and moved to Westmorland.

40|$|Lagging formed of jackets of porous {{materials}} such as glasswool and of impervious {{materials such as}} metal sheets are widely used to attenuate the sound radiated from pipes. A procedure is described for calculating the insertion lossess produced by such lagging. The procedure yields the insertion lossess corresponding {{to each of the}} low order mode types of the pipe. These are breathing, bending and ovalling mode types. Impedance and pressure transfer formulae for the various jacket types are given in terms of the fundamental properties of the jackets. The porous jacket, for example, is defined by its inner and outer diameters and the flow resitivity of the porous material. These formulae enable the frequency dependent insertion loss produced by an arbitrary <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging</b> to be determined.

50|$|Dedicated overclockers {{occasionally}} use vapor-compression refrigeration or thermoelectric coolers {{in place}} of more common standard heat exchangers. Water cooling systems in which water is cooled directly by the evaporator coil of a phase change system are able to chill the circulating coolant below the ambient air temperature (impossible with a standard heat exchanger) and, as a result, generally provide superior cooling of the computer's heat-generating components. The downside of phase-change or thermoelectric cooling is that it uses much more electricity, and antifreeze must be added due to the low temperature. Additionally, insulation, usually {{in the form of}} <b>lagging</b> around water <b>pipes</b> and neoprene pads around the components to be cooled, must be used in order to prevent damage caused by condensation of water vapour from the air on chilled surfaces. Common places from which to borrow the required phase transition systems are a household dehumidifier or air conditioner.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mathematical foundations {{for a simple}} theory for investigating the phenomenon of ignition of flammable fluids in lagging material that are used for insulation of hot pipework, for transport of heat transfer fluids, or other similar situations. Experiments with porous material impregnated with a flammable fluid have simulated the self-heating known to occur when combustible liquids leak from a hot <b>pipe</b> into <b>lagging</b> surrounding the <b>pipe</b> or are split from another source on to the lagging. A theory to explain these findings is presented which shows {{that there is a}} watershed temperature beyond which substantial self-heating will take place. Although the theory does not take account of diffusion, it simulates the main physics of the phenomenonâthat is, combustible fluid, which normally in the open air would evaporate and not be a hazard, can, within a porous medium, remain dispersed within the porous structure long enough for the exothermic oxidation to develop into ignition. 1...|$|R
50|$|The LSMs {{were built}} for {{short-term}} use landing supplies in the Pacific during World War II. As such the facilities {{for the crew}} were extremely basic.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [44]- 45) This study set out {{to quantify}} differences in concentrations of airborne asbestos {{as a function of}} wetting methods {{associated with the use of}} the mechanical chipper. In addition, it sought to evaluate two analytical methods, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and phase-contrast microscopy (PCM), used to identify airborne concentration of asbestos. Friable asbestos (<b>pipe</b> <b>lagging)</b> and non-friable asbestos (floor tile) air samples were also collected and compared. Air samples were collected and analyzed by PCM in accordance with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Manual of Analytical Methods. NIOSH 7400 and by TEM in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's AHERA protocol. It was concluded that one should consider not using PCM to make decisions in determining proper respiratory protection levels, final "clean" air levels, and levels outside containment during the abatement process. TEM should be utilized during the abatement of all non-friable asbestos materials. Heavy wetting of the floor and allowing water to stand for several minutes (10 or more) are recommended wherever feasible during floor tile abatement using a mechanical chipper. Feasibility, however, infers that one does not create a spillage problem to a lower level. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|DOE sites {{contain a}} broad {{spectrum}} of asbestos materials (cloth, <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging,</b> sprayed insulation and other substances) which are contaminated with a combination of hazardous and radioactive wastes due to its use during the development of the US nuclear weapons complex. These wastes consist of cutting oils, lubricants, solvents, PCBs, heavy metals and radioactive contaminants. The radioactive contaminants are the activation, decay, and fission products of DOE operations. To allow disposal, the asbestos must be converted chemically, followed by removing and separating the hazardous and radioactive materials to prevent the formation of mixed wastes and to allow for both sanitary disposal and effective decontamination. Currently, no technology exists that can meet these sanitary and other objectives. An attempt was made to apply techniques that have already proved successful in the mining, oil, and metals processing industries {{to the development of a}} multi-stage process to remove and separate hazardous chemical radioactive materials from asbestos. This process uses three methods: ABCOV chemicals which converts the asbestos to a sanitary waste; dielectric heating to volatilize the organic materials; and electrochemical processing for the removal of heavy metals, RCRA wastes and radionuclides. This process will result in the destruction of over 99 % of the asbestos; limit radioactive metal contamination to 0. 2 Bq alpha per gram and 1 Bq beta and gamma per gram; reduce hazardous organics to levels compatible with current EPA policy for RCRA delisting; and achieve TCLP limits for all solidified waste...|$|R
40|$|AbstractâIn the {{chemical}} industry, asbestos gaskets {{have been used}} extensively to prevent leakage between solid surfaces. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the potential personal exposure to asbestos fibres during gasket removal and thus to determine what is reasonably required in terms of protective regime and work method. Two groups were studied: group A, who only removed gaskets if they could be removed easily and without breaking; and group B, who removed gaskets which were left by the first group. For both groups, the gasket was first made wet before removal. The samples were analysed using phase-contrast microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The average exposure to fibres for group A, averaged over the work period, was 0. 04 - 0. 242 fibres ml"' as determined by phase-contrast microscopy. On further analysis with transmission electron microscopy it was found that only four of the 11 samples contained asbestos in very low concentrations and that most of the fibres, which were identified using phase-contrast microscopy, probably originated from the glass fibre <b>lagging</b> around the <b>pipes.</b> For group B the average fibre concentration, averaged over the work period, as determined by phase-contrast microscopy, ranged between below'the detection limit and 0. 02 fibres ml" 1. The subsequent transmission electron microscopyiinalysis shows that the exposure to asbestos fibres ranged between below the limit of "detectronto 0. 004 fibres ml" 1. This study shows that the exposure to asbestos fibres during gasket removal activities was well within the 8 -h average exposure limit of 0. 3 fibres ml" 1.

5000|$|As of 2016 {{most of the}} {{hospital}} buildings on the Storthes Hall site {{have been reduced to}} rubble. Of the original buildings remaining, the former administration building is surrounded by fencing and barbed wire, whilst [...] "the Arboretum" [...] acts as the refectory and bar serving the student village and one of the blocks serves as the main entrance foyer and offices. The hospital's mortuary is still intact, as are several other smaller buildings. In 1998 the 46 wards and various non-residential blocks on the site were all still standing, and nearly all of these buildings were originally linked the site main boiler block via a system of interconnected subways and service ducts, through which various services including steam pipes for heating, electrical supplies and a main cold water main passed. The cold water main was fed from and underground reservoir which remains under a field at the top of Storthes Hall Lane, and a water treatment block remains on the south corner in the same area. The original borehole for the sites water supply is further up on Farnley Moor to the north of Greenside Road and is marked by a brick built square folly. Bore hole No.2 replaced this and this still remains at the lower part of Storthes Hall Road on the north side accessed by a track. Prior to demolition of the site the University of Huddersfield commissioned an asbestos survey which was carried out during 1991 / 1992. The asbestos survey was to the entire site and was carried out by Simon Farrar PCS Asbestos Consultants Limited as lead surveyor for Bradley Environmental Consultants Ltd. During the asbestos survey all buildings were inspected and photographs taken, which were probably the last visual record of the site prior to the programme of asbestos removal and then demolition {{of the majority of the}} structures. Asbestos <b>lagging</b> to <b>pipes</b> of up to 14 inch diameter fed steam and hot water from the main boiler room via the service tunnels and subways which then in turn fed heating the various blocks. Heating pipes ran mainly under the floors in voids to cast iron radiators and via rising ducts to the first floors where heating pipes were mainly surface mounted. Following closure of the site in 1991 the asbestos lagging quickly deteriorated once the steam had been turned off. The Acute Hospital Wards 1 to 10 at the lower part of the site were closed several years before and contamination spread within the ducts, subways and floor voids throughout the site. Asbestos removal works took 18 months with up to 50 operatives on site; the asbestos removal project was also managed through to completion by Simon Farrar. The asbestos removal works were carried out by LAR Ltd of Stockport.|$|R
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of small leaks from the primary system of a Nuclear Pressurised Water Reactor. Leak rates of 12 g/s are invariably difficult to detect and locate. The typical leak indicators in a nuclear reactor control room are a drop in pressure and level from the pressuriser, and the air sampler detecting particulate matter. However, {{in both cases the}} leak is normally quite substantial by the time any parameters or values are obviously outside the normal operating conditions. Therefore, a small leak could go undetected for a significant amount of time. As part of the reactor safety studies, {{it is important to have}} more information about small leaks. Due to the lack of small leak data, the solution was to construct a high pressure water rig producing temperatures and pressures close to those experienced in the primary circuit, these being 200 ÂºC and 100 bar respectively. Pressure is maintained by a vane water pump and heating is achieved by passing a high current through a small diameter, thin walled pipe. To reproduce different size cracks, various size carburettor jets are used. The water on exiting this crack, flashes to steam and immediately meets metallic <b>pipe</b> <b>lagging,</b> which is typical of most primary systems. With the typical crack scenario recreated it is now important to add sensors that will detect conditions associated with a small leak. These sensors are either mounted on or around the lagging material. The parameters that are monitored include vibrations, acoustics, thermal variations, moisture change, air flow and pressure adjustment leaving a predetermined outlet. The sensor outputs are pre-processed and the nonlinear data are applied to an artificial neural network, whereas the other data are applied to a digital logic system. The results showed that with 13 different leak rates, separated by only 1. 4 g/s the ANN was able to correctly differentiate and identify different leak sizes with a certainty of over 97 %. The results from all the analysis are further presented graphically through an Operator Advisory System. This informs the operator of the predicted leak size and location. All of the available sensor data relevant to the leak can be viewed and location of the leak is presented by a three dimensional model of the reactor system.
