40|$|Three {{science and}} {{engineering}} problems of recent interests -index coding, <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage, and guessing games on graphs- are discussed and the connection between their optimal solutions is elucidated. By generalizing recent results by Shanmugam and Dimakis and by Mazumdar on the complementarity between the optimal broadcast rate of an index coding problem on a directed graph and the normalized rate of a <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage problem on the same graph, it is shown that the capacity region and the optimal rate region of these two problems are complementary. The main ingredients in establishing this result are the notion of confusion graph introduced by Alon et al. (2008), the vertex transitivity of a confusion graph, the characterization of the index coding capacity region via the fractional chromatic number of confusion graphs, and the characterization of the optimal rate region of the <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage via the independence number of confusion graphs. As {{the third and final}} facet of the complementarity, guessing games on graphs by Riis are discussed as special cases of the <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> distributed storage problem, and it is shown that the winning probability of the optimal strategy for a guessing game and the ratio between the winning probabilities of the optimal strategy and a random guess can be characterized, respectively, by the capacity region for index coding and the optimal rate region for distributed storage.

Unlike the usual local recovery model of codes for distributed storage, this model accounts for the fact that each server or storage node in a network is connectible to only some, and not all other, nodes. This may happen for reasons such as physical separation, inhomogeneity in storage platforms etc. We estimate the storage capacity of both undirected and directed networks under this model and propose some constructive schemes. From a coding theory point of view, we show that this model is approximately dual of the well-studied index coding problem.

A two-phase method is used to get solutions to the stock level constrained optimization problem. The outcome of this paper {{can be applied to}} lower level of logistics units (e. g.

An [n,k] code {{is said to be}} a <b>locally</b> <b>recoverable</b> code with sequential recovery from t erasures, if for any set of s ≤ t erasures, there is an s-step sequential recovery process, in which at each step, a single erased symbol is recovered by accessing at most r other code symbols. This is equivalent to the requirement that for any set of s ≤ t erasures, the dual code contain a codeword whose support contains the coordinate of precisely one of the s erased symbols. In this paper, a tight upper bound on the rate of such a code, for any value of number of erasures t and any value r ≥ 3, of the locality parameter is derived. This bound proves an earlier conjecture due to Song, Cai and Yuen. While the bound is valid irrespective of the field over which the code is defined, a matching construction of binary codes that are rate-optimal is also provided, again for any value of t and any value r≥ 3.
