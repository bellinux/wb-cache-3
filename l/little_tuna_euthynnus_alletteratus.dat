40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the differences in morphometric characteristics among specimens of Atlantic juvenile bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus [12. 2 - 46. 5  cm fork length (FL) ] and juvenile <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> <b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus</b> (14. 1 - 26. 4  cm FL). A total of 353 bluefin tuna (young of the year) and 288 little tuna (young of the year) were collected from the commercial hand line fisheries in the eastern Mediterranean Sea between July and October of 2011 - 2013 with three round-bent hook sizes (numbers 10, 12 and 14; Mustad 2315 S). By using univariate and multivariate analysis, 11 morphometric characters were investigated. anova revealed highly significant differences (P <  0. 001) for all morphometric parameters among the two species. The principal component analysis showed that the difference between the species resulted mainly from preanal length (LA), caudal fin hight (CC), snout length (SnL), eye diameter (ED) and postorbital length (PO). The stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that juveniles of the two tuna species were correctly classified, with a percentage of 99. 2 %.

40|$|Atlantic <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (<b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} small tuna species in the Mediterranean Sea. This species are commercially exploited in the Spanish coast by traditional fisheries, mainly tuna traps, but also is target by recreational coastal trawl fishery. The aim of this paper is to update biological information about this species in the Western Mediterranean and to show possible differences between these gear catches. Size and weight data were collected from a Spanish Mediterranean trap (la Azohia, Murcia) (100 specimens) and from recreational coastal fisheries (339). Data were collected along 2006 in order to determine size-weight relationships and size distributions of the population. The Atlantic litle tuna collected in Traps ranging from 61 to 85 cm. in fork length (FL) and the specimens caught by the recreational fisheries from 36 to 46 cm. FL. Significative differences were found between both size distributions. The recreational fisheries target mainly juveniles and the traps mainly mature fishes. The size distribution of trawl catches showed a unique modal value (39. 5 cm) suggesting that all specimens correspond to age class 1. The reproductive stock is mainly made of 4 age classes (2 to 5 +). Our data indicates that age class 4 is totally recruited to the trap fishery and constitutes the main age class in the stock reproductive biomass. This and other biological aspects will be discussed in this paper...|$|E

In this study we define the spawning grounds of tuna fishes in Tunisian waters and relate the tuna larvae spatial distribution to the hydrographic features and other environmental parameters. A total of 282 larvae of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, Linnaeus, 1758), 902 of bullet tuna (Auxis rochei, Risso, 1810) and 19 of <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (<b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus,</b> Raf, 1810), were identified. High larval concentrations of bluefin tuna were located offshore (mean = 200 ± 18 m), at sea surface temperatures ranging between 23. 7 to 25. 3 °C, whereas the highest concentrations of bullet and little tuna were located in shallower waters (mean = 135 ± 75 m), at sea surface temperature ranging between 25. 1 to 25. 9 °C. According to their preference for waters with surface salinities ranging between 37. 1 and 37. 8, spawning of these species seems to occur mainly in mixed waters. Stations where tuna larvae were collected showed oxygen concentrations between 6. 55 and 6. 85 mg l- 1, as well as low turbidity and chlorophyll a values, from 0. 2 to 0. 5 NTU a d less than 1 mg m- 3, respectively.

40|$|Authentication of fish {{as fresh}} or frozenthawed is {{compulsory}} {{because of the}} widespread fraudulent practice of retailing fish products as fresh, when they have actually been frozen. Moreover, according to EC Regulations 853 / 2004 and 1276 / 2011, fish intended for raw consumption has to be deepfrozen before usage, to protect consumers against Anisakiasis. In this study, a food business operator set an example of good quality control by collaborating with health authorities and an official laboratory in charge of food control, to evaluate the feasibility of a further integrated regional plan on fish safety. Furthermore, differences in microscopic patterns related to freezing time complying (24 h) and not complying (12 h) with legislation in force were evaluated. Ten samples obtained from red and white-meat fish, and based on real production of the food business, were identified to evaluate the histological method performance in correctly classifying fish as fresh/frozen {{as well as the}} microbiological and chemical safety issues possibly related to fishery products. For two samples, species identification was needed. Based on the histological method, one out of ten fish was not fresh, though the supplier claimed all fish to be fresh; the others, after freezing, could be characterised microscopically as frozen and a borderline P-value was found between different freezing times.

50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (<b>Euthynnus</b> affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|R

Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the oceanic stage and ocean sunfish (Mola mola) also primarily relied on gelatinous zooplankton. In contrast, stable isotope ratios ruled out any relevant consumption of gelatinous plankton by bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), blue shark (Prionace glauca), leerfish (Lichia amia), bonito (Sarda sarda), striped dolphin (Stenella caerueloalba) and loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the neritic stage, all of which primarily relied on fish and squid. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were confirmed as crustacean consumers. The ratios of stable isotopes in albacore (Thunnus alalunga), amberjack (Seriola dumerili), blue butterfish (Stromaeus fiatola), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were consistent with mixed diets revealed by stomach content analysis, including nekton and crustaceans, but the consumption of gelatinous plankton could not be ruled out completely.

40|$|A {{process for}} the {{utilization}} of <b>tuna</b> (<b>Euthynnus</b> affiis) meat {{in the form of}} a functional protein concentrate was developed. Mechanically separated mince was washed first with water, then with 2 % (wIv) aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate and finally with water to remove pigments, lipids, colour and odour-bearing compounds. Homogenization of the washed meat in water followed by acidification of the dispersion with acetic acid produced a weak gel which was diluted and spray dried to get a light yellow powder having a faint fishy odour. The spray dried protein powder contained 5 % moisture, 1. 2 % lipid and 89. 5 % protein and had good functional properties. Packed in 300 gauge polyesterlpolythene laminate pouch, it did not undergo significant browning for 3 months during storage at ambient temperature...|$|R
40|$|Four hilminth larvae from {{different}} fish hosts caught from Emirati coasts are described. Two are metacercariae related to genus Stephanostomum, type (I) and (II). Type (I) was found encycsted in body cavities of the Indian halibut Psettodes erumei and the areolate grouper Epinephelus areolatus, and type (II) {{in the golden}} stripped goatfish Mulloides flavolineatus. The third larva is related to Acanthocephala and identified as Serrasentis sagittifer. It was collected from the body cavity of the spotted lizard fish Saurida undosquamis. The fourth larva belongs to the didymozoid trematodes, and was found infecting the kidneys of different hosts, such as Saurida undosquamis, the Jack pomfret Parastromateus niger and the mackerel <b>tuna</b> <b>Euthynnus</b> affinis.

40|$|Between 2008 and 2011, {{the head}} of 150 <b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus</b> (Osteichthyes: Scombridae) caught inshore off the southeastern Iberian coast (western Mediterranean Sea) were {{examined}} for parasites. Two monogeneans, four didymozoid trematodes and four copepods were found. Parasite abundance showed a positive relationship with the annual sea surface temperature, except for Pseudocycnus appendiculatus, but negative with the sea depth (Capsala manteri, Neonematobothrium cf. kawakawa and Caligus bonito). Prevalences and mean abundances differed significantly among sampling areas, except for C. manteri, Oesophagocystis sp. 2 and Ceratocolax euthynni, and sampling years (Melanocystis cf. kawakawa, N. cf. kawakawa, P. appendiculatus and Unicolax collateralis). Results indicate that the parasite abundances of E. alletteratus in the western Mediterranean Sea depend mainly on regional environmental variables, which can show interannual variations. The presence of pelagic parasites, i. e. didymozoids and P. appendiculatus, could indicate that E. alletteratus migrates between inshore and offshore pelagic domains. The different parasite faunas reported in E. alletteratus populations from the western Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea appear {{to point out the}} geographical host isolation. These results suggest that E. alletteratus inhabiting the western Mediterranean Sea performs inshore-offshore small-scale migrations, and not transoceanic migrations between the western Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean SeaVersión del edito...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Atlantic little tunny, <b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus,</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in temperate and tropical {{waters of the}} Atlantic Ocean, Black and Mediterranean Seas. In this study, wild-caught little tunny from Egypt, {{were found to be}} naturally infected with trypanorhyncha metacestodes, and the overall prevalence rate of infection was 38. 7 %. The blastocysts were either loosely attached to the mesentery of infected fish, or firmly attached and deeply embedded within the hepatic parenchyma. These encysted plerocerci are identified as Callitetrarhynchus gracilis (Trypanorhyncha, Lacistorhynchidae) based on its morphological and molecular characterization. The morphological characteristics of C. gracilis including scolex shape; the bothridia groove; the presence of frontal glands; the length of post-larval (appendix); metabasal armature; the existence of ‘Chainette’ and satellite hooks of different size were studied and described by Light and Scanning electron microscope. The phylogenetic analysis of lsrDNA gene of plerocerci confirmed the identification of the species to be deeply embedded in genus Callitetrarhynchus. The histopathological examination revealed severe pathological changes in the affected organs, including necrosis, inflammatory reactions, fibrosis and migratory tracts of the parasitic larvae together with marked visceral organs adhesions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of C. gracilis in little tunny collected from the Abu Qir landing site in Alexandria, Egypt...|$|R
40|$|Fishes {{within the}} family Scombridae (i. e., tunas, {{mackerels}} and bonitos) are of high economic and ecological value in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), as they are heavily targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries. In coastal and open-ocean environments, adult tunas are top predators, while larval and juvenile tunas serve as prey for numerous species. Much {{is known about the}} distribution and abundance of adult tunas, but high taxonomic uncertainty and limited knowledge regarding the distributional patterns of larval and juvenile tunas have led to an “operational taxonomic unit” gap in our understanding of tuna ecology. This analysis examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of larval and juvenile scombrids collected across a wide swath of the northern GoM from April to September, 2011, as part of the NOAA-supported Offshore Nekton Sampling and Analysis Program. The distribution and relative abundance of several key tuna species (Thunnus thynnus, T. atlanticus, Auxis thazard and <b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus)</b> collected from the surface to 1500 m depth are characterized across the oceanic GoM (Louisiana to Florida) with respect to depth, time of year, and in relation to mesoscale oceanographic features. Integrating aspects of scombrid ecology in neritic and oceanic environments will improve management and conservation efforts for this highly important taxon...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted on some fishing and population parameters of little tunny (<b>Euthynnus</b> <b>alletteratus)</b> caught by common purse seines in the northeastern Mediterranean (Iskenderun Bay) during the pelagic fishing season of 1998 - 1999. According to the findings, catch per unit effort for these species caught by sardine purse seines between October-May {{was estimated to be}} 0. 2 kg/HP/day. During the fishing season, the highest value of catch amount per month was estimated as 19. 0 kg/HP/month for spring (April) and 4. 6 kg/HP/month for autumn (November). The fishing effort in the study area generally characterized by coastal fisheries and in terms of landed catch the medium and large scale fishing fleet is not profitable. The length distribution of the population was found to be monomodal in the autumn and bimodal in the spring. A year-class group in autumn (October-November) was found approximately 35 - 40 cm TL. A year-class group in the spring (March-April-May) dominated with young population of 35 - 40 cm and mature population of 60 - 65 cm TL. According to the equation of length-weight relationship for total individuals, a-value, b-value and R 2 were estimated 0. 0323, 2. 7457 and 0. 9382, respectively. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of mackerel <b>tuna</b> (<b>Euthynnus</b> affinis) and yeast bread on the growth rate of Brachionus plicatilis. Research was conducted at Laboratory of Brackish water Aquaculture Development Center, Ujung Batee on August 2016. This study was carried out experimentally using a completely randomized design (CRD) with five treatments and four replications. The treatments were A (Nannochloropsis sp.), B (Nannochloropsis sp. + Euthynnus affinis 3 g + 0. 15 g yeast bread), C (Nannochloropsis sp. + Euthynnus affinis 3 g + 0. 30 g yeast bread), D (Nannochloropsis sp. + Euthynnus affinis 3 g + 0. 45 g yeast bread), and E (Nannochloropsis sp. + Euthynnus affinis 3 g + 0. 60 g yeast bread).

40|$|In the {{fisheries}} of Vizhingam seven {{different types of}} tuna are distinguished. They are Auxis thazard (Lacepede), Auxis thynnoides Bleeker, Sarda orientalis (Temminck and Schlegel), Kishinoella tonggol (Bleeker), Neothunnus macropterus (Temminck and Schlegel), Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus) and Euthynnus afinis afJinis (Cantor). A comprehensive account on their identification is given by Jones and Silas (1960). The little tunny or mackerel <b>tuna</b> (<b>Euthynnus</b> afinis affinis) is commercially {{one of the most}} important species at Vizhingam. The fisheries of the little tunny have assumed importance in recent years owing to the great demand for dried tuna in India and abroad. Research on the biology and fishery of the little tunny has been but meagre and practically no information is available on these subjects. In this paper some aspects of its biology are dealt with based on material from Vizhingam...|$|R
