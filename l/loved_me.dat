5|$|In 1977, the Eon Productions film The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me</b> was {{released}} and, {{due to the}} radical differences between the film and the original novel of the same name, Eon productions authorised a novelization, James Bond, The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me.</b> The 1979 film Moonraker, which other than the villain's name also substantially diverged from the original source novel, was also produced in novel form, as James Bond and Moonraker; both books were written by screenwriter Christopher Wood.|$|E
5|$|It {{was shot}} on {{location}} in Egypt (Cairo and Luxor) and Italy (Costa Smeralda, Sardinia), with underwater scenes filmed at the Bahamas (Nassau), and a new soundstage built at Pinewood Studios for a massive set which depicted {{the interior of a}} supertanker. The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me</b> was well-received by critics. The soundtrack composed by Marvin Hamlisch also met with success. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as James Bond, The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Ian Fleming {{sold the}} film {{rights to the}} James Bond novels to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, he gave {{permission}} only for the title The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me</b> to be used. Since the screenplay for the film {{had nothing to do}} with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised a novelisation based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since Colonel Sun nearly a decade earlier. Christopher Wood, who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled James Bond, The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

In 1977, the title {{was used for the}} tenth film in the Eon Productions series. It was the third to star Roger Moore as Bond, and used no plot elements from the novel.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Michael G. Wilson joined Albert R. Broccoli as co-producer at Eon. Wilson {{had first}} {{worked on a}} Bond {{production}} in February 1964 with the filming of Goldfinger.

5|$|Broccoli {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} writers {{to work on the}} script, including Stirling Silliphant, John Landis, Ronald Hardy, Anthony Burgess, and Derek Marlowe. In the second volume of his autobiography, Burgess claims to have worked on an early treatment for the movie. The British television producer Gerry Anderson also stated that he provided a film treatment (although originally planned to be Moonraker) much similar to what ended up as The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} in Japan, it was {{announced}} that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me</b> and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore.|$|E
5|$|Following The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, {{in which he had}} invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me,</b> the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker {{was noted}} for its high {{production}} cost of $34million, almost twice {{as much money as}} predecessor The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me,</b> and it received mixed reviews. However, the film's visuals were praised with Derek Meddings being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and it eventually became the highest-grossing film of the series with $210,300,000 worldwide, a record that stood until 1995's GoldenEye.|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me</b> {{opened with}} a Royal Premiere {{attended}} by Princess Anne at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 7 July 1977.

5|$|The film reunites Bond {{with the}} car maker Aston Martin. Following Bond's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the filmmakers {{then turned to the}} brand new Lotus Esprit in 1977's The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me,</b> which reappeared four years later in For Your Eyes Only. Despite the iconic status of the {{submersible}} Lotus however, Bond's Aston Martin DB5 is recognised as the most famous of his vehicles. As a consequence, Aston Martin returned with their V8 Vantage.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{occasionally}} supplements his {{alcohol consumption}} {{with the use}} of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{then decided}} to start {{production}} on The Man with the Golden Gun after Live and Let Die. This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who <b>Loved</b> <b>Me,</b> for three years.|$|E
