40|$|<b>Long</b> <b>service</b> leave is an {{employment}} condition that provides paid leave to employees who serve an employer {{over a long}} period of time without a break in service. A common feature of <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave is continuous service with an employer, which then entitles an employee to paid leave as a reward for their service. This means that in most jurisdictions the leave is generally not portable and is lost when transferring between employers. This paper will explore the <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave entitlements for national system employees that currently exist in state and territory <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave legislation in Australia and in selected key pre-reform instruments that have broad application in the various jurisdictions. The paper will not examine the situation relating to non-national system employees. In particular, it will not discuss the non-national system employees in Western Australia as a result of the Western Australian government not referring the relevant powers to the Commonwealth government. The current <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave entitlements vary in Australia because there are eight legislative frameworks relating to <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave operating across the various states and territories. This makes the existing <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave provisions in Australia highly complex and prescriptive for non-lawyers such as employers and employees. This paper will contend that a nationally consistent <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave minimum standard would be a desirable outcome in Australia as it will ensure that all employees are rewarded for <b>long</b> term <b>service</b> with an employer and will provide employees with a paid break from work while maintaining job tenure. The various options for the national standard are examined in detail within the current <b>long</b> <b>service</b> leave environment...|$|R
