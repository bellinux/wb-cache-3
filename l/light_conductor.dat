Bozzini thought that the instrument could be incorporated into Austrian military hospitals. This required a device to be sent to Wien, and also the performance of an expertise by health authorities. An investigating committee subjected the instrument to various tests, starting with examination in corpses of the bladder, rectum, vagina, and peritoneal cavity through small laparotomies.

After Bozzini's device received negative results from live humans trials, it had to be discontinued. However, Maximilian Nitze and Joseph Leiter used the invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison to make a more refined device similar to modern day endoscopes. This iteration was used for urological procedures, and eventually otolaryngologists began to use Nitze and Leiter's device for eustachian tube manipulation and removal of foreign bodies.

Materials and methods: For the making of the optical sensor, we used samples of 48 to 56 micrometers inner diameter micro-structured optic fiber with a solid silica covered hollow center; and we selected dimethilformamide as the <b>light</b> <b>conductor</b> fluid. The fiber was filled with pressure; the connectrorization of the fiber was made with the fussion, the high-temperature afhesive, and the mechanical processes.

Results: Profiles of the refractive index vs. temperature in cooling and heating cycles were obtained, as well as the punctual measures of the refractive index in five fixed thermodynamic points tested; the calculation for the theoretical refractive index for these points was obtained, and was compared with the experimental ones. The percentage of error of the experimental refractive index was estimated between 0. 016 % and 0. 03 %.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} {{attachment to the}} Lambda 9 spectrometer for in situ reflectance measurements of catalysts at temperatures up to 623 K M. Thiede and J. Melsheimer Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faradayweg 4 - 6, 14195 Berlin, Germany Abstract The spectroscopic investigation of catalyst powders under reaction conditions is generally possible only in reflectance. Two problems occur: 1. Low signal level Normally the sample is positioned directly at the integrating sphere and all diffusely scattered light from the sample is reflected back into the integrating sphere. A hot reactor cell cannot be attached directly, it must be positioned {{as far as possible}} from the integrating sphere to avoid its heating. If the reactor cell is attached at some distance from the measurement window of the integrating sphere only a portion of the diffusely scattered light will be reflected back into the sphere. At a distance of 12 mm, for example, this will only be 20 %. In a first setup we bridged the distance with highly reflecting ceramics, to increase the part of light reflected into the sphere (Fig. 1). 2. Thermal radiation The thermal radiation of the hot reactor cell also enters the integrating sphere. At higher temperatures it is significantly stronger than the measurement light from the spectrometer itself. This leads to increased noise and saturation of the detector. In the {{newly developed}} setup we tried a. 	to make the distance between integrating sphere and reactor cell with oven as large as possible; b. 	to increase the signal level c. 	to decrease the surface which causes the thermal radiation, and d. 	to bring reactor cell and oven into a vertical position which facilitates the work with powder samples. These requirements could be fulfilled by the application of a specially formed <b>light</b> <b>conductor</b> made of quartz, in which the light is conducted to the sample and back into the integrating sphere by total reflectance. At the same time, the surface which causes the thermal radiation was reduced (Fig. 2). In this way, we succeeded in improving the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 4 - 5 compared with the first setup...|$|E
40|$|Molybdenum oxide based {{catalysts}} {{are suitable}} candidates for many selective oxidation reactions [1]. Such catalysts containing only Mo and O {{have been successfully}} prepared by controlled adjustment of precursor concentration, temperature or nature of counter cation. The obtained materials, namely orthorhombic and hexagonal MoO 3, a supramolecular Mo 36 and a trimolybdate compound were thoroughly analysed by XRD, TEM, TG, TPRS and Raman spectroscopy [2]. As such materials undergo electronic changes during catalytic reactions we will present an in situ UV/Vis/NIR study on the different families of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) catalysts. Experimental A commercial UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer (Lambda 9, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a BaSO 4 coated integrating sphere was supplemented with a new construction (specially formed <b>light</b> <b>conductor</b> in vertical position) to measure in situ diffuse reflectance spectra of different MoOx from room temperature (RT) to 673 K [3]. The spectra were recorded both from 250 to 2500 nm (scan speed of 240 nmmin- 1, slit 1 nm) and 250 to 800 nm (scan speed 60 nmmin- 1, slit 0. 2 nm) with Spectralon (Labsphere) as a white standard in the reference position. Powder samples (ca. 0. 6 g) were charged in the home-made microreactor and fed with a flow of air, pure He or 21 % oxygen in helium. The MoOx samples were prepared using precipitation method (0. 28 up to 2 mol/L AHM, Na 2 MoO 4, K 2 MoO 4, Li 2 MoO 4 dissolved in bi-distilled water and 1 mol/L up to 5 mol/L HNO 3) from 30 oC to 70 oC. Results and discussion MoOx spectra show NIR bands with different intensities, distinguishable LMCT bands and band gap energies (Eg) at RT. Based on the exact determination of such spectroscopic characteristics the following LMCT bands (nm) (I) and Eg’s (eV) (II) are attributed to the above mentioned MoOx families: (I) 322 (NH 4 +), 314 (K+); (II) 3. 48 (NH 4 +), 3. 44 (K+) to supramolecular Mo 36; (I) 313 (NH 4 +), 319 (K+), 327 (Na+); (II) 3. 35 (NH 4 +); 3. 30 (K+), 3. 27 (Na+) to hexagonal MoO 3; (I) 296 (Li+); (II) 3. 44 (Li+) to orthorhombic MoO 3 and (I) 284 (K+); (II) 3. 77 (K+) to trimolybdate MoOx. From a blue shift of the LMCT band in the series supramolecular/hexagonal  orthorhombic  trimolybdate and a decreasing broadening of this band it may be concluded that the cluster size decreases. All MoOx samples evolved NIR bands at 1435, 1940, and 2040 nm. They are assignable to an overtone mode of the OH stretching vibration and a combination mode of the OH stretching and bending vibration, respectively. Other NIR bands, e. g., those detected in MoOx samples prepared from AHM at 1570 and 2150 are caused by ammonia. Initial experiments in dependence on temperature show that the bands at 1440, 1940 and 2030 nm initially decrease at higher temperature and then disappear. In addition, by increasing the temperature the band at 2150 nm begins to disappear at 553 K and the band at 1570 nm dimi- nished around 633 K (not shown). In Vis range a new band at 660 / 670 nm develops at 553 K which decreases in presence of He and increases in presence of O 2 in He with increasing temperature (Fig. 1). This band is assigned to a d-d transition. In He this band suffers a blue shift to about 570 nm at 673 K. The appearance of the new Vis band can be correlate with TG/DSC data. At 553 K ammonia as counter ion de- composes to NOx and reduces the Mo matrix; ammonia is completely removed from the sample at around 693 K...|$|E
