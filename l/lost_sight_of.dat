5|$|At 00:16, Scott {{ordered his}} ships {{to turn to}} a heading of 330° {{in an attempt to}} pursue the fleeing Japanese ships. Scott's ships, however, quickly <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Gotō's ships, and all firing ceased by 00:20. The American {{formation}} was beginning to scatter, so Scott ordered a turn to 205° to disengage.|$|E
5|$|Tallon had {{difficulty}} with the English conditions {{early in the season}} as he sustained a bruised right finger when he <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during a tour match against Surrey at The Oval and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. As a result of the injury, Tallon was rested for the following three matches.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the fact that the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon {{in the first half of}} the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E

5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> what happened next.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged {{the day before and}} now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
50|$|Lord William Lennox, MP for King's Lynn 1831-34, who <b>lost</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> one eye in a horse riding {{accident}} in 1815.|$|R
6000|$|By this I gained his {{strength}} and height [...] Without his rivalry. But in my triumph I <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> [...] <b>Of</b> afterhaps. Soon he, Being bark-bound, flagged, snapped, fell outright, [...] And in his fall felled me! ...|$|R
50|$|Woore {{served as}} a private in the Leicestershire Regiment in World War I and <b>lost</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> one eye. He was {{received}} the British War Medal, Victory Medal and the Silver War Badge following his injury.|$|R
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese column as it headed northeast along {{the eastern shore of}} Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes {{in the general direction of}} the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the Run to the North, after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships slowly moved out of range and rendezvoused with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. Beatty {{gradually}} turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre. By 18:35 Beatty was following the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° turn and Beatty <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> them in the haze. Beatty then turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast to search for Hipper's ships.|$|E
50|$|Having preached for {{the last}} time on 5 February, Gould died of {{erysipelas}} on 13 February 1882, and was buried on 16 February at the Rosary Cemetery, Norwich. He <b>lost</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> his left eye in 1873.|$|R
2500|$|... 10 October: a nail-bomb blast at Ebury Bridge Road, Chelsea, London, near Chelsea Barracks {{killed two}} people (John Patrick Breslin and Nora Fields) and injured 40, {{including}} 23 soldiers, two children, and one guardsman who <b>lost</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> one eye.|$|R

5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E
5|$|Making {{her second}} cruise against the British with President, Congress sailed from Boston on 8 October. On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue , which was escorting two {{merchant}} ships. Galatea and her charges were chased {{for about three}} hours, during which Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. In the meantime, President kept after Galatea but <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her as darkness fell. Congress and President remained together during November {{but they did not}} find a single ship to capture. On their return to the United States they passed north of Bermuda, proceeded towards the Virginia capes, and arrived back in Boston on 31 December. During their entire time at sea, the two frigates captured nine prizes.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Johnson gained {{his first}} air victory. On 26 June Johnson participated in Circus 24. Crossing the coast near Gravelines, Bader warned of 24 Bf 109s nearby, southeast, {{in front of}} the Wing. The Bf 109s saw the British and turned to attack the lower No. 610 Squadron from the rear. While {{watching}} three Bf 109s above him dive to port, Johnson <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> his wing commander at 15,000 feet. Immediately a Bf 109E flew {{in front of him and}} turned slightly to port at a range of 150 yards. After receiving hits, the Bf 109's hood was jettisoned and the pilot baled out. Several No. 145 Squadron pilots witnessed the victory. He had expended 278 rounds from P7837's guns. The Bf 109 was one of five lost by Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2) that day.|$|E
50|$|A few medieval {{writings}} on the aqueduct <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> completely <b>of</b> the original {{purpose of the}} construction. Some say that it carried not water, but wine to the city, for example, the Gesta Treverorum written from the 12th century, and the Hymn to Saint Anno of the 11th century.|$|R
60|$|With {{this the}} Ork started {{out again and}} this time sank {{downward}} more slowly. Down, down, down it went, till the candle was a mere spark, and then it headed away {{to the left and}} Trot and Cap'n Bill <b>lost</b> all <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|No {{one seemed}} to be {{attending}} to anything else, when Dolores ventured to cast a glance around and endeavour to count heads as she sat between her uncle and aunt. Two boys and a girl were opposite. Harry, {{who had come to}} meet them last night, was {{at one end of the}} table, a tall girl, but still a schoolroom girl, was at the other, and Mysie had been <b>lost</b> <b>sights</b> <b>of</b> on her own side of the table; also there was a very tiny girl on a high chair on the other side of her mamma. 'Seven,' thought Dolores with sinking heart. 'Eight oppressors!' ...|$|R
5|$|Tallon {{was then}} rested and Saggers {{took his place}} for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested {{for the next two}} matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted {{steadily}} with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained a bruised right finger when he <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in {{with the}} score at 6/553, and held up his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific weather proved {{favourable}} but by August the {{two ships}} had <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> {{each other and}} continued their voyage separately. On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio. Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority. Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were too ill to leave their bunks. When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were too sick to bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, Hayes <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> in one <b>of</b> {{his eyes}} after {{a piece of}} cinder {{hit him in the}} eye during a 10-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs. He later <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> in both eyes. Hayes died at age 76 in Birmingham, Alabama, and was interred at Clanton's cemetery.|$|R
50|$|He {{learned the}} shoemaker's trade, but accidentally injured an eye and <b>lost</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> it at age 18. He then studied law, first in Canaan with Judge Whiting, then in Troy with John Woodworth at the Albany Law School. Cady was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1795, and commenced practice in Florida, Montgomery County.|$|R
25|$|On the 50th {{anniversary of}} the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, clashes between protesters and the police were reported. Mounted police charges, tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons were used to force back the crowd. Rubber bullets were {{frequently}} aimed head-high, causing {{a large number of}} injuries; a man <b>lost</b> the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> one eye due to a rubber bullet.|$|R
5|$|The {{blockade}} squadron off Lorient {{comprised the}} ships {{of the line}} HMS Theseus, HMS Triumph and HMS Valiant under Commodore John Poo Beresford, watching three ships in the harbour under Contre-amiral Amable Troude. At 15:15 Paget, who had <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the French, reached the waters off Lorient and signaled a warning to Beresford. At 16:30, Beresford's squadron sighted Willaumez's fleet, tacking to the southeast. Willaumez ordered his second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon to drive Beresford away and Gourdoun brought four ships around to chase the British squadron, with {{the remainder of the}} French fleet following more distantly. Beresford turned away to the northwest, thus clearing the route to Lorient. His objective achieved, Gourdan rejoined Willaumez and the fleet sailed inshore, anchoring near the island of Groix.|$|E
5|$|This {{navigation}} {{plan was}} abandoned when both Prince of Wales and Borrowdale <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Alexander and Friendship during a severe storm in late July, and found themselves alone and off course {{by the time}} the weather cleared. The two lost ships anchored while their masters, John Mason in Prince of Wales and Hobson Reed in Borrowdale, consulted. Neither considered it likely they could reach the Lord Howe Island rendezvous. They were also reluctant to hazard the voyage to Batavia through the Great Barrier Reef without Alexander in the lead. Instead, they agreed to turn their ships southeast into the open ocean and to return to England by sailing the other way around the world, via Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro and then northeast across the Atlantic to Europe.|$|E
5|$|After some refitting, President, {{still under}} Rodgers' command, sailed on 8October with Congress, United States, and Argus. On 12October, United States and Argus parted from the {{squadron}} {{for their own}} patrols. On 10October, President chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17October President captured the British packet ship Swallow, which carried {{a large amount of}} currency on board. On 31October, President and Congress began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, and in that time Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. Meanwhile, President kept after Galatea and drew very close, but <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her in the night. Congress and President remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the Virginia capes; they arrived in Boston on 31December, having taken nine prizes. President and Congress found themselves blockaded there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.|$|E
50|$|Reise <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> in one <b>of</b> {{his eyes}} as a youngster, yet he {{continued}} to play hockey. The loss did not come {{as a result of}} an injury but rather as the result of an optical nerve that simply died.|$|R
50|$|Janice Burton MBE (born 11 April 1958) is {{a retired}} British Paralympic swimmer. Burton competed in B1 events having {{completely}} <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> in both <b>of</b> her eyes. She won a total of 23 Paralympic medals during a career that spanned four Games.|$|R
50|$|Aaron {{had many}} love affairs with women, {{but the only}} woman he truly loved was Shosha, his {{childhood}} friend.
