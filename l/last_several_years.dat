5|$|Over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> HPMI {{has proven}} {{a number of}} {{technology}} concepts that {{have the potential to}} narrow the gap between research and practical applications of nanotube-based materials. These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of nanotube membranes or buckypapers, production of nanotube composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation. HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).|$|E
5|$|The general {{phases of}} Zappa's music have been {{variously}} categorized under experimental rock, jazz, classical, avant-pop, experimental pop, comedy rock, doo-wop, jazz fusion, progressive rock, electronic, proto-prog, avant-jazz, and psychedelic rock. He generally {{did not have}} discrete periods where he performed one style or another but blended them together and reverted back as it interested him but his last studio album—1986's Jazz from Hell—marked a shift toward live orchestral performance for the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years</b> of his life.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships {{is in a state}} of flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E

5|$|Perry and Whitford {{returned}} to Aerosmith in 1984 {{and the band}} signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It {{was not until the}} band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described {{as one of the most}} remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year, except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour that will likely <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 3D version opened Friday, August 25, 2017, across 371 theaters (or 463 3D auditoriums), earning $552,773 in {{its opening}} weekend, {{averaging}} $1,490 per screen; this {{was considered an}} amount lower than what other '80's and '90's re-releases earned in their respective opening weekends such as Top Gun ($1.9 million, which also played in IMAX), Raiders of the Lost Ark ($1.6 million), {{as well as more}} high-profile reissues of Titanic, The Lion King and Jurassic Park over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> During its opening weekend, Titanic 3D grossed $17.3 million in 2,674 theaters, averaging $6,464 in April 2012. While not major contributing factors, the release performance of the film is thought to have suffered from coinciding with Hurricane Harvey, which eased moviegoing admissions {{in many parts of the}} country, the much anticipated boxing fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor, the season 7 finale of Game of Thrones, and by Cameron's decision to release his original 1991 theatrical cut instead of the widely popular extended edition, and his controversial comments regarding the Wonder Woman film.|$|E
