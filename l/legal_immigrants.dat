5|$|On immigration, Moran {{supported}} a pathway to citizenship {{for illegal immigrants}} and did not support decreasing the number of <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> allowed into the country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police. He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 (H.R.4321), which the House did not pass. He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA. The American Immigration Lawyers Association scored him as having voted 31 times for the organization's position and 7 times against the organization's position.|$|E
5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese {{citizens}} who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was {{a citizen of the}} United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1930s most <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> were male. By the 1990s women {{accounted}} for {{just over half}} of all <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants.</b> Contemporary immigrants tend to be younger than the native population of the United States, with people {{between the ages of}} 15 and 34 substantially overrepresented. Immigrants {{are also more likely to}} be married and less likely to be divorced than native-born Americans of the same age.|$|E

Since 2000, <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> to the United States number approximately 1,000,000 per year, of whom about 600,000 are Change of Status who already are in the U.S. <b>Legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> to the United States now are at their highest level ever, at just over 37,000,000 <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants.</b> Illegal immigration may {{be as high as}} 1,500,000 per year with a net of at least 700,000 illegal immigrants arriving every year. Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born population from 1990 to 2000.|$|E

25|$|Bachmann {{believes}} that strengthened enforcement of immigration laws {{is required for}} the growth of the American job market.

She voted against the DREAM Act. She has also stated that the current law does not need modification but proper enforcement.|$|E
25|$|John Doolittle {{voted against}} the first House bill, which passed along party lines.

5000|$|These {{numbers are}} {{separate}} from illegal immigration, which peaked at probably over 1 {{million per year}} around the year 2000 and has probably declined to about 500,000 per year by 2009, which seems comparable or perhaps less than the outflow returning to their native countries.

Most non-pregnant, childless adults were excluded, as were most <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> and all illegal immigrants. Doolittle voted against the bill.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2006, Governor Romney {{signed the}} health legislation. He vetoed eight {{sections}} {{of the health care}} legislation, including the controversial employer assessment.

The legislature promptly overrode six of the eight gubernatorial section vetoes, on May 4, 2006, and by mid-June 2006 had overridden the remaining two.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{there were}} 7,105 <b>legal</b> <b>immigrants</b> living in Madeira Islands.

The latest figures available (2015) detail another slight drop to 5,745, {{the majority of}} which are from the United Kingdom (818), Brazil (752) and Venezuela (581).

5000|$|The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is {{a federal}} bill that would permit states to {{determine}} state residency for higher education or military purposes. This bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1, 2001, and was most recently re-introduced in Congress on March 26, 2009. A Senate filibuster blocked it on December 18, 2010. [...] It would provide a mechanism for undocumented students of good moral character to become legal permanent residents. The DREAM Act initially allowed beneficiaries to qualify for federal student aid but was changed in the 2010 version of the bill. In order to be eligible, individuals must {{have come to the}} U.S. as children (under the age of 16), graduated from a U.S. high school and be a long-term resident (at least 5 years). An age cap of 35 was also set. The latest version of the DREAM Act does not grant <b>legal</b> <b>immigrant</b> status to anyone for at least two years. Previous versions of the Act would have immediately granted <b>legal</b> <b>immigrant</b> status to eligible individuals. Many other limitations were also included in this latest version, among them the removal of access to healthcare benefits and limits to chain migration.|$|R

A quarter of all immigrants who have arrived in recently before 2012 have at least some college education.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} how {{a change}} in immigration law can affect the marriage behavior of <b>immigrants.</b> The <b>Legal</b> Immigration and Family Equity (LIFE) Act of 2000 provided a 4 -month period in which certain undocumented immigrants could complete the legalization process without having {{to return to their}} countries of origin. Marriage to a US citizen or <b>legal</b> <b>immigrant</b> is one way undocumented immigrants can qualify for the immigration benefit provided by the LIFE Act of 2000. Examining marriage behavior before, during, and after the law change indicates that the immigration law change affected the marital decisions of immigrants. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} about the welfare of less skilled immigrants is the topic of this paper. This paper departs from previous work on immigrant cohorts and instead examines young native and <b>legal</b> <b>immigrant</b> adults (unskilled) {{who came to the}} U. S. with their parents. This paper will argue that for this sample, unskilled immigrants start off with very low wages compared to natives, but eventually pick up after acquiring U. S. -specific skills. This is probably due to positive selection of immigrants and other factors discussed later in the paper. Therefore, {{it can be argued that}} unskilled immigrants are not a drain on the economy...|$|R
