5|$|July 21, 1994– Tropical Depression Two {{degenerates into}} a remnant <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> near Charlotte, {{dropping}} light rainfall along its path.|$|E
5|$|A <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{previously}} {{associated with}} a frontal system developed into a tropical depression near Bermuda on September22. The depression had sustained winds of 30mph (45km/h) and failed to strengthen further. It became extratropical on September23.|$|E
5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion developed into a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area.</b> The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E
5000|$|Occluded fronts usually form around mature <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas.</b> There are {{two types}} of occlusion, warm and cold: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{those cases}} where salt layers {{do not have}} the {{conditions}} necessary to develop passive salt structures, the salt may still move into relatively <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> around developing folds and faults. Such structures are described as reactive.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> {{are formed}} in the oceanic {{circulation}} near the Polar regions were sea water is much warmer than the land. Such centers are the Icelandic Low, the Aleutian Low and numerous lows near the coast of Antarctica.|$|R
5|$|Late on December8, Epsilon transitioned into {{a remnant}} <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area.</b> The remnant {{circulation}} elongated {{in advance of}} a frontal zone, and it dissipated late on December9. The front absorbed the remnants the next day.|$|E
5|$|Nilofar {{originated}} from a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> between India and the Arabian Peninsula. It {{developed into a}} depression on October25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October26. Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October28. At the time, Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> on October31 off the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 2015, {{during the}} annual cyclone season, a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{consolidated}} into a depression and slowly intensified {{into a deep}} depression before crossing the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following day. Because of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November. The system brought very heavy rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 15 November, well-marked <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 24‑hour totals peaking at 370mm in Ponneri. Chennai International Airport recorded 266mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28–29 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490mm of rainfall at Tambaram in 24 hours starting 8:30 am on 1 December. Very heavy rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to Cuddalore.|$|E
50|$|The higher contact {{pressures}} {{along the}} base of the ribs and the voids or <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> in the system limit deformations of soil due to moisture variation to the void spaces, reducing the impact of the soil's volume change on the on-grade mat slabs.|$|R
5000|$|Spring {{and summer}} {{flooding}} in Central Europe is {{commonly associated with}} the so-called [...] "Zugstrasse Vb" [...] track of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> which bring <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> and moist air from the Mediterranean Sea over Central Europe, and have led to severe flooding in the affected region before. Though later analysis found this flooding did not fit into this type.|$|R
50|$|The season officially {{started with}} the {{formation}} of Cyclone Roanu over in the Bay of Bengal on 17 May. The beginning of June witnessed no storms, although a lot of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> formed over Bay of Bengal, but none of these intensified into a depression due to a very strong southwest monsoon. At the end of June, Depression ARB 01 formed but weakened within two days. July witnessed no storms until a deep depression formed in August under the influence of an upper air cyclonic circulation over Gangetic West Bengal. However, multiple <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> occurred on the Bay of Bengal, with Cyclonic Storm Kyant forming in October and Cyclonic Storm Nada in November. Due to warm sea surface temperatures Very Severe Cyclone Vardah formed in December.|$|R
5|$|Widespread {{rainfall}} occurred throughout Central America {{in early}} October 2008 {{due to the}} passage of a tropical wave through the region. Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which was believed to have left the west coast of Africa on September17. The wave developed a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> on October10 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection. On October13, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America, and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization. At that time, there was another <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on August17, the NHC {{anticipated}} that a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> would form within {{five days to}} the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the potential for development to 60%. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection, developing a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> on August19. Conditions were favorable for further development, and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August20. After an increase in rainbands and outflow around the well-defined center, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August22 about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. A strong ridge over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|By noon on Sunday, weather {{conditions}} on lower Lake Huron {{were close to}} normal for a November gale. Barometric pressures in some areas began to rise, bringing hope of {{an end to the}} storm. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> that had moved across Lake Superior was moving northeast, away from the lakes.|$|E
5000|$|On July 6, 3 <b>low</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>areas</b> moved towards {{and settled}} near the Black Sea {{after a week}} a high pressure in the region’s jet stream far northward in its trek through Europe. [...] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's GFS numerical model predicted the same weather for the following week.|$|R
40|$|This {{activity}} {{will aid}} {{in the understanding of}} high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> behavior, vacuums, and molecular structure. Students play the roles of "air molecules" to simulate high and <b>low</b> <b>pressures,</b> and use balloons to simulate clouds. They should be able to describe high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> identify a front, and explain why <b>areas</b> of high <b>pressure</b> seek <b>areas</b> of <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> There is also a suggestion for a follow-up activity in which students use their new understanding of air pressure to help them read weather maps. Educational levels: Intermediate elementary, Middle school...|$|R
50|$|Yet another {{variation}} {{occurs when}} the upper air becomes turbulent. Turbulence above the marine layer inversion can, depending on its severity, break up the marine layer. The most common causes of such turbulence are strong upper level <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> or the monsoon which occasionally extends northwestward from the desert areas of the U.S.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the {{eleventh}} tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{in the third}} week of September. As a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area,</b> it moved slowly across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping torrential rains across those islands.|$|E
5|$|Snow clouds usually {{occur in}} the context of larger weather systems, the most {{important}} of which is the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area,</b> which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation. Two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake-effect (also sea-effect) storms and elevation effects, especially in mountains.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 2008, {{computer}} hurricane models {{forecast the}} development of a broad <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> to the southwest of Central America. On May 26, a large trough extended from the southwestern Caribbean Sea across Costa Rica into the eastern Pacific Ocean, forming a broad <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> across the region. A scattered area of strong convection developed, partially in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Located within an area of weak steering currents, the disturbance remained nearly stationary, and on May 27 its shower activity increased in organization. Initially the system consisted of several cyclonic swirls, of which the most pronounced one was located about 340miles (550km) west-southwest of San José, Costa Rica. The system gradually became better organized, and with a sufficiently well-developed circulation and convective structure, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression One-E at 0300UTC on May 29, about 105miles (165km) west-northwest of Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica.|$|E
50|$|All <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> {{that affect}} Europe are {{named by the}} Free University of Berlin. On some occasions, storms that affect Norway are named by the Norwegian Weather Service. The Free University of Berlin have six lists of names which they use each year. Every odd year they use male names, while every even year they use female names.|$|R
50|$|The wind-induced surface heat {{exchange}} (WISHE) {{is a positive}} feedback mechanism between the ocean and atmosphere in which a stronger ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux results in a stronger atmospheric circulation, which results in a strong heat flux. It has been hypothesized {{that this is the}} mechanism by which <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> in the tropics develop into tropical cyclones.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "weather bomb" [...] is popularly used in New Zealand to {{describe}} dramatic and/or destructive weather events. Only very rarely are these actually instances of explosive cyclogenesis, as the rapid deepening of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> is rare around New Zealand. This use of [...] "bomb" [...] {{may lead to}} confusion with the more strictly defined meteorological term.|$|R
5|$|A <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> that {{developed}} in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an {{area of low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|A <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> {{that had}} {{developed}} over the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into a depression early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast. After landfall the storm continued {{to move to the}} northwest, weakening to a depression again on July 2 over northeast Madhya Pradesh. It degenerated into a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong low {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C). Dewpoints in the mid 60s°F were recorded {{as far north as}} Memphis. A strong cold front trailing the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> approached the region from the west.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> [...] "Frederik" [...] and [...] "Günther" [...] formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Adriatic and tracked north towards central Europe. The high pressure [...] "Sabine" [...] and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> brought an airflow {{from the north}} across Germany, which brought the water-laden air from the north east. The air mass was pushed to the south west by the northerly flow, where it was lifted as it moved south from the North European Plain over the Thuringian Forest, Ore Mountains, and Bohemian Forest. The air was then lifted along {{the north side of}} the Alps in Austria as the air masses were pushed into the Alps by the northerly flow, which led to intense orographic precipitation. Heavy rain was reported in the Austrian states of Vorarlberg and Tyrol and the area of Salzburg, and to the mountains of Upper Austria and Lower Austria and Upper Styria in a short time.|$|R
25|$|Pressure {{detection}} {{uses the}} organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in {{shape of the}} gas bladder to the middle ear. It {{can be used to}} regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the weather fish and other loaches are also known to respond to <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> but they lack a swim bladder.|$|R
50|$|Each MAFOR {{broadcast}} {{is followed by}} a brief technical synopsis of the current weather map in plain language. The synopsis gives the location of the centers of significant high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> and their forecast motion (direction and speed). Reference is occasionally made to marked wind shift lines, giving the anticipated time at which the wind shift will occur at key points.|$|R
5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E is monitored by Meteo France's La Reunion {{tropical cyclone}} centre (MFR, RSMC La Reunion). Within the region a tropical disturbance is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area,</b> originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation {{with the average}} wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots (50km/h)).|$|E
5|$|As Carlos moved inland, {{it turned}} to the {{northwest}} {{in response to the}} anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status. By 12hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery. Late on June27, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> near Acapulco. The circulation {{turned to the}} southwest and emerged into the Pacific Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E
5|$|Convection shifted {{towards the}} eastern {{semicircle}} of the circulation, while the still-exposed center became malformed and elongated. On September14, the poorly organized cyclone crossed southeastern Louisiana, turned towards the north-northeast {{and made a}} second landfall close to the AlabamaMississippi border at 1500UTC that day, still at its peak strength. The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> moved into Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E

50|$|This season, 9 {{depressions}} developed out of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> {{with six}} intensifying further into deep depressions, two deep depressions have developed into cyclonic storms, and one cyclonic storm intensified into a severe cyclonic storm. The first {{depression of the}} season developed on February 2 about 300 km (190 mi) {{to the east of}} Colombo, Sri Lanka. The depression brought isolated rainfall to parts of Sri Lanka, while remaining near stationary before weakening into an <b>area</b> of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> early the next day.|$|R
50|$|After {{the final}} {{warnings}} on Cyclone Tui were issued a weak circulation {{remained in the}} vicinity of Samoa for several days, before a westerly surge from the monsoon resulted in a tropical cyclone developing during February 1. However, due to uncertainties in the continuation of Tui after several other weak <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> had formed, RSMC Nadi decided to treat the cyclone as a separate system and named it Wes.|$|R
