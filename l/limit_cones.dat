40|$|AbstractA functor G:C→D {{is said to}} {{preserve}} limits of a diagram D:I→C if it sends any <b>limiting</b> <b>cone</b> from x to D to a <b>limiting</b> <b>cone</b> from G(x) to G∘D. When G preserves limits of a diagram D this entails directly {{that there is an}} isomorphism G(lim←ID) ≅lim←I(G∘D) between objects. In general, such an isomorphism alone is not sufficient to ensure that G preserves limits. This paper shows how, with minor side conditions, the existence of an isomorphism natural in the diagram D does ensure that limits are preserved. In particular, naturality in the diagram alone is sufficient to yield the preservation of connected limits. At the other extreme, once terminal objects are preserved, naturality in the diagram is sufficient to give the preservation of products. General limits, which factor into a product of connected limits, are treated by combining these results. In particular, it is shown that a functor G:C→D between complete categories is continuous if there is an isomorphism G(lim←ID) ≅lim←I(G∘D) natural in D∈[I,C], for any small category I. It is indicated how a little calculus of ends, in which the judgements are natural isomorphisms between functors, is useful in establishing continuity properties of functors...|$|R

In the second patient, a 62 -year-old man, the SBC was a fortuitous finding, because this patient was referred for dental implant therapy.

The latter topic focuses on two significant families of concrete categories over an arbitrary category. Beck categories are defined by preservance properties while newly introduced l-algebraic categories are described by limits of categories of functor algebras. The latter family is shown to be rather natural. The well known Beck's theorem states that the monadic categories are precisely the Beck categories with free objects. We strengthen this theorem by weakening the assumptions of the existence of free objects and we replace it by existence of some Kan extensions, namely the pointwise codensity monads. Moreover, using the result on Kan extensions of cones we show that for l-algebraic categories even weaker assumption fits...|$|R

40|$|Multiple scattering, induced {{radiative}} {{energy loss}} and modified fragmentation functions {{of a heavy}} quark in nuclear matter are studied {{within the framework of}} generalized factorization in perturbative QCD. Modified heavy quark fragmentation functions and energy loss are derived in detail with illustration of the mass dependencies of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal interference effects and heavy quark energy loss. Due to the quark mass dependence of the gluon formation time, the nuclear size dependencies of nuclear modification of the heavy quark fragmentation function and heavy quark energy loss are found to change from a linear to a quadratic form when the initial energy and momentum scale are increased relative to the quark mass. The radiative energy loss of the heavy quark is also significantly suppressed due to <b>limited</b> <b>cone</b> of gluon radiation imposed by the mass.

Materials and Methods: The study included 25 patients with a confirmed histopathologic diagnosis of NPDC. Standardized measurements of NPDC dimensions were performed on sagittal, coronal, and axial CBCT sections. Maximas, minimas, mean, standard error of mean, and confidence intervals (95 %) of all measurements were performed. The Kruskal-Wallis {{test was used to}} analyze group differences and to assess any association between measurements and preoperative symptoms or postoperative complications. Results: The patients' mean age was 49. 5 years, and a male-to-female ratio of 2. 1 : 1 was assessed. Mean cyst dimensions for men and for patients less than 50 years old tended to be higher, without statistical significance. The cyst dimensions had no statistically significant correlation to preoperative symptoms. Initial symptoms were present in all cases with a nasal defect, however. Most of the standardized cyst dimensions exhibited a statistically significant correlation to postoperative complications. Conclusions: The presence or the absence of symptoms does not correlate with {{the dimensions of}} an NPDC. With progressive size of the cyst, the risk for minor postsurgical complications increases. © 2011 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a diagram}} of quasi-categories that admit and functors that {{preserve}} limits or colimits of a fixed shape. We show that any weighted limit whose weight is a projective cofibrant simplicial functor is again a quasi-category admitting these (co) limits {{and that they}} are preserved by the functors in the <b>limit</b> <b>cone.</b> In particular, the Bousfield-Kan homotopy limit of a diagram of quasi-categories admit any limits or colimits existing in and preserved by the functors in that diagram. In previous work, we demonstrated that the quasi-category of algebras for a homotopy coherent monad could be described as a weighted limit with projective cofibrant weight, so these results immediately provide us with important (co) completeness results for quasi-categories of algebras. These generalise most of the classical categorical results, except for a well known theorem which shows that limits lift to the category of algebras for any monad, regardless of whether its functor part preserves those limits. The second half of this paper establishes this more general result in the quasi-categorical setting: showing that the monadic forgetful functor of the quasi-category of algebras for a homotopy coherent monad creates all limits that exist in the base quasi-category, without further assumption on the monad. This proof relies upon a more delicate and explicit analysis of the particular weight used to define quasi-categories of algebras. Content...|$|R
