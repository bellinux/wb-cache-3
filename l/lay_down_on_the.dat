5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield {{so that she would}} have to step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which {{split from}} the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, {{inherited}} the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier {{participated in the}} anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation for changing {{the name of a}} town – Dalmiapuram – to Kallakudi. They claimed that the town's name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July 1953, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in Dalmiapuram railway station's name board and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tracks. In the altercation with the Police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and Kannadhasan were arrested.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, San Jose State College {{witnessed}} {{a rise in}} political activism and civic awareness among its student body, including major student protests against the Vietnam War. One of the largest campus protests took place in 1967 when Dow Chemical Company — a major manufacturer of napalm used in the war — came to campus to conduct job recruiting. An estimated 3,000 students and bystanders surrounded the Seventh Street administration building, and more than 200 students and teachers <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ground in front of}} the recruiters.|$|E

25|$|The brawl {{began when}} Artest fouled Pistons center Ben Wallace as Wallace was {{putting up a}} shot. Wallace, upset at being fouled hard when the game was {{effectively}} over (the Pacers led 97–82 with less than 50 seconds to go), responded by shoving Artest, leading to an altercation near the scorer's table. Artest walked to the sideline and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scorer's table. Reacting to Wallace throwing something at Artest, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him. Artest jumped into the front-row seats and confronted a man he incorrectly believed to be responsible, which in turn erupted into a brawl between Pistons fans {{and several of the}} Pacers. Artest returned to the basketball court, and punched Pistons fan A.J. Shackleford, who was apparently taunting Artest verbally. This fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. Artest's teammates Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson were suspended indefinitely the day after the game, along with Wallace.|$|E
500|$|There {{was another}} {{significant}} incident {{at the bottom}} of the first climb. This involved Sérgio Paulinho (Tinkoff-Saxo): he collided with a race motorbike, causing significant cuts to his leg. Paulinho first attempted to continue riding; he was then treated by the race doctor, who put staples in his leg. He <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road for treatment. Although he attempted to continue riding, he was forced to withdraw from the race just before the summit of the climb; he then went to hospital and received seventeen stitches. Paulinho's teammate Peter Sagan had also been hit by a motorbike on stage 8 and the team had issued a statement calling for an apology from the race organisers and measures to prevent such incidents. Following Paulinho's incident, Oleg Tinkov, the team's owner, suggested on Twitter that the team may withdraw from the race; a statement from the team after the stage said, [...] "the team will consider whether it is safe to continue racing under the current arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Cosima {{sat with}} Wagner's body {{for more than}} 24 hours, refusing all {{refreshment}} or respite. During the embalming process, which occupied the next two days, Cosima sat with the body as often as possible, {{to the dismay of}} her children. She also asked her daughters to cut her hair, which was then sewn into a cushion and placed on Wagner's breast. On 16 February the journey back to Bayreuth began, and on Sunday 18 February the cortège processed to Wahnfried, where, following a brief service, Wagner was buried in the garden. Cosima remained in the house until the ceremonies were over; according to her daughter Daniela she then went to the grave [...] "and for a long time <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coffin until Fidi (Siegfried) went to fetch her". Afterwards she went into seclusion for many months, barely even seeing her children, with whom she communicated mainly through written notes. Among many messages, she received a telegram from Bülow: [...] "Soeur il faut vivre" [...] ("Sister, it is necessary to live").|$|E

500|$|In the Confessions Tour, {{the song}} was the second {{performance}} of the evening and {{was part of the}} equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. She opened her hat from the previous performance of [...] "Future Lovers", as the background changed from the video of the horses to a red, geometric patterned kaleidoscope shot by Steven Klein. Madonna started singing the song. Two male backup dancers appeared behind her wearing horse reins around their heads to convey the feeling of oppression. The song continued in their choreographed performance, with Madonna sometimes pulling the harness around her dancers as if they were horses. During the intermediate musical interlude, Madonna moved {{to the front of the}} stage and <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen attached to it. As she continued singing the music increased and she started to twirl in the center of the stage. The performance continued with Madonna and her dancers moving to the back of the stage singing the words [...] "get together" [...] repeatedly. It ended with the music of the next song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] starting.|$|E
500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very concerned, because {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E

For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that {{it felt as if}} boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.|$|E
2500|$|One {{technique}} that he innovated was the [...] "strike in reverse" [...] (working without pay), which initiated unauthorized {{public works projects}} for the poor. This earned him his first notoriety in 1956, when he gathered some 150 unemployed men to mend a public road. The police called it obstruction; his helpers walked away; he <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road and was arrested. Skilfully, he drummed up publicity. Famous lawyers such as Piero Calamandrei offered to defend him for free. Famous writers, such as Ignazio Silone, Alberto Moravia, Carlo Levi, among others, protested. The Palermo court acquitted Dolci and his two dozen co-defendants of resisting and insulting the police, but sentenced them to 50 days' imprisonment (time they had already served) and a 20,000 lire (US$32) fine for [...] "having invaded ground {{that belonged to the}} government." [...] On his release he resumed the campaign for the dam on the Iato river and work would eventually start in February 1963.|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} the ethical demands that a cosmopolitan approach to ethics <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{media in the}} Western world in covering distant suffering. By examining a number of newspaper articles from danish media regarding a humanitarian crisis in the African Sahel area using theories about distant suffering, and discussing the findings by applying {{a number of different}} normative ethical theories, it delivers a view on what such ethical demands might be. It concludes that a politics of pity has some difficulties dealing in time with disasters about to happen, because of its reliance on mediation of suffering...|$|R
