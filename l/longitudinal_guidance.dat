40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} {{guidance}} algorithm for the hypersonic phase of a lifting-body vehicle. The guidance strategy is based on a particular kind of nonlinear dynamic inversion, the so-called flatness approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guidance</b> law is in-flight self-adaptive to any feasible hypersonic trajectory and can be written in analytical form with a small set of design parameters. Therefore, the required on-board computational resources are limited, and a reduced off-line design effort is needed for the change of vehicle parameters. Moreover, the closed-loop <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guidance</b> commands are computed on-board in a coupled way without relying on an explicit deceleration profile. Consequently, the approach leads to an efficient management of the degree of freedom associated with the angle-of-attack. PID controllers are then designed based on the longitudinal flat model in order to circumvent uncertainties and parameters dispersions. The crossrange is controlled by a series of bank reversals determined by an azimuth error deadband. The robustness and performance of the proposed guidance law are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs with various sets of dispersions...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growth}} of civil {{aviation}} traffic capacity, safety and environmental considerations urge today {{for the development of}} guidance systems with improved accuracy for spatial and temporal trajectory tracking. This should induce increased capacity by allowing safe operations at minimum separation standards. Also, at take-off and landing, trajectory dispersion should be reduced resulting in controlled noise impacts on airport surrounding communities. Current civil aviation guidance systems operate with real time corrective actions to maintain the aircraft trajectory {{as close as possible to}} the planned trajectory. In this paper, we consider the problems of designing new <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guidance</b> control laws for an autopilot so that accurate vertical tracking and overfly time are better insured. Instead of using time as the independent variable to describe the guidance dynamics of the aircraft, we adopt distance to land, which can be considered today to be available online with acceptable accuracy and availability. A new representation of aircraft <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guidance</b> dynamics is developed according to this spatial variable. Then a nonlinear inverse control law based-on this new proposed spatial representation of guidance dynamics is established to make the aircraft follow accurately a vertical profile and a desired airspeed. The desired airspeed is then regulated to make the aircraft overfly different waypoints according to a planned time-table. Then simulations experiments with different wind conditions are performed for a transportation aircraft performing a general descent approach for landing. These simulation results are compared with those obtained from a classical time-based guidance control law...|$|E
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} about molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance along the antero-posterior axis {{in contrast to}} the dorso-ventral axis of the developing nervous system is very limited. During the past two years in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that morphogens have a role in <b>longitudinal</b> axon <b>guidance.</b> Morphogens are secreted proteins that act in a concentration-dependent manner on susceptible groups of precursor cells and induce their differentiation to a specific cell fate. Thus, gradients of morphogens are responsible for the appropriate patterning of the nervous system during early phases of neural development.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} evaluation of an entry guidance algorithm for future space transportation vehicles is presented. The guidance concept is {{to plan and}} track aerodynamic acceleration. This concept, on which the <b>longitudinal</b> entry <b>guidance</b> for the Space Shuttle Orbiter is based, is extended to integrated <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>guidance.</b> With integrated <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>guidance,</b> more extreme points in the landing footprint can be reached accurately; in particular, the cross-range capability is extended. The guidance algorithm consists of two components: a trajectory planner and a trajectory tracking law. The planner generates reference drag acceleration and heading angle profiles, along with reference state and bank angle profiles. The planner executes onboard and is capable of generating updates as the entry evolves. The tracking law, based on feedback linearization, commands the angles of bank and attack required to follow the reference drag and heading angle profiles. The planner and tracking law are described, along with additional higher level logic included in the algorithm. Extensive simulations {{for a set of}} return-from-orbit entries, including ones requiring large cross range, demonstrate that this algorithm consistently achieves the desired target conditions within allowable tolerances and satisfies all other entry constraints.

In vivo, Slit is proteolytically cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments, but the biological significance of this is unknown. Analysis in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord of a slit allele (slit-UC) that cannot be cleaved revealed that midline repulsion is still present but <b>longitudinal</b> axon <b>guidance</b> is disrupted, particularly across segment boundaries. Double mutants for the Slit receptors Dscam 1 and robo 1 strongly resemble the slit-UC phenotype, suggesting they cooperate in <b>longitudinal</b> axon <b>guidance,</b> and through biochemical approaches, we found that Dscam 1 and Robo 1 form a complex dependent on Slit-N. In contrast, Robo 1 binding alone shows a preference for full-length Slit, whereas Dscam 1 only binds Slit-N. Using a variety of transgenes, we demonstrated that Dscam 1 appears to modify the output of Robo/Slit complexes so that signaling is no longer repulsive. Our {{data suggest that the}} complex is promoting longitudinal axon growth across the segment boundary.

5000|$|The Slit-Robo cell {{signaling}} pathway {{plays an important}} role in guiding pioneer axons, especially pioneer longitudinal axons. These axons, which function to connect major parts of the CNS, are mainly present during embryonic development. The Slit family mainly functions as a repellent towards longitudinal axons, guiding them away from the ventral midline. The loss of Slit in Drosophila caused the presence of longitudinal axons in the midline. In conjunction with the Robo receptor, Slit signaling played a role in determining tract positions parallel to the midline for longitudinal axons to follow during development. The loss of either Slit or Robo caused dysfunction in the development of longitudinal pioneer neurons in the midbrain and hindbrain of Drosophila. Furthermore, it has been shown that Robo plays a diversified role in pioneer axon guidance in different areas of the brain during embryonic development. Primarily, Robo 1 is crucial towards pioneer <b>longitudinal</b> axon <b>guidance</b> in the ventral tract, while Robo 2 is important in the dorsal tract.|$|R

While many of the molecular interactions driving commissural pathway formation have been deciphered, the mechanisms underlying the development of longitudinal tracts remain unclear. We have identified here a role for the Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance receptors in the positioning of longitudinally projecting axons along the dorsoventral axis in the embryonic zebrafish forebrain. Using a loss-of-function approach, we established that Robo family members exhibit complementary functions in the tract of the postoptic commissure (TPOC), the major longitudinal tract in the forebrain. Robo 2 acted initially to split the TPOC into discrete fascicles upon entering a broad domain of Slit 1 a expression in the ventrocaudal diencephalon. In contrast, Robo 1 and Robo 3 restricted the extent of defasciculation of the TPOC. In this way, the complementary roles of Robo family members balance levels of fasciculation and defasciculation along this trajectory.

Two receptors, Robo 1 and Robo 2, are critical for <b>longitudinal</b> axon <b>guidance</b> by the Slit family of chemorepellents. Previous studies showed that Robo 1 −/−; 2 −/− double mutant mouse embryos have disruptions in both ventral and dorsal longitudinal tracts. However, the role of each Robo isoform remained unclear, because Robo 1 or 2 single mutants have mild or no errors. Here we utilized a more sensitive genetic strategy to reduce Robo levels for determining any separate functions of the Robo 1 and 2 isoforms. We found that Robo 1 is the predominant receptor for guiding axons in ventral tracts and prevents midline crossing. In contrast, Robo 2 is the main receptor for directing axons within dorsal tracts. Robo 2 also has a distinct function in repelling neuron cell bodies from the floor plate. Therefore, while Robo 1 and 2 have some genetic overlap to cooperate in guiding longitudinal axons, each isoform has distinct functions in specific longitudinal axon populations...|$|R

The nematode C. elegans has one Robo receptor (SAX- 3) and one Slit protein (SLT- 1), which direct ventral axon guidance and guidance at the midline.

Here, we show that patterning molecules, notably the ventralizing signalling molecule Shh, are involved in the formation of medial longitudinal fascicle neurons and in medial <b>longitudinal</b> fascicle axon <b>guidance.</b> Downstream of Shh, several homeobox genes are expressed in the tegmentum. We describe the expression patterns of Sax 1, Emx 2, Six 3, Nkx 2. 2 and Pax 6 in the mesencephalon and pretectum in detail. Furthermore, we review the evidence of their molecular interactions, and their involvement in neuronal fate specification. In particular, Sax 1 {{plays a major role in}} fate determination of medial longitudinal fascicle neurons. Finally, we discuss the available data on axon guidance mechanisms for the medial longitudinal fascicle, which suggest that different guidance molecules such as class 3 Semaphorins, Slits and Netrins act to determine the caudal and ventral course of the medial longitudinal fascicle axons...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The Japanese {{blood glucose}} {{monitoring}} guidance for patients receiving second-generation antipsychotics has been newly developed. We aimed {{to report a}} cross-sectional study using a baseline data of the Japanese monitoring guidance to find undiagnosed hyperglycemia systematically as a routine clinical practice and to quantify the frequency of glucose abnormalities in schizophrenia patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics. Methods: Data for 537 patients with schizophrenia {{who had not been}} diagnosed as diabetes prior to baseline screening and started the monitoring between June 2008 and January 2009, were collected from medical records in 25 hospitals. Blood glucose (fasting or casual), hemoglobin_[A 1 c], serum lipids, height/weight, clinical diabetic symptoms, and family history of diabetes were assessed. Patients were classified into normal, pre-diabetic or probable diabetic type based on their values of blood glucose or hemoglobin_[A 1 c], and various background characteristics and serum lipid values were compared among the three types. Results: Out of 537 patients, 13 (2. 4 %) met criteria for probable diabetic type, 51 (9. 5 %) for pre-diabetic type, and 473 (88. 1 %) for normal type. Individuals categorized as probable diabetic type had a higher body mass index and higher frequency of family history of diabetes mellitus than those within normal type. Conclusion: Glucose abnormalities were newly detected in 11. 9 % of schizophrenia patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics by the baseline monitoring. To assess the detective power and usefulness of the <b>guidance,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> investigations are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{in vitro}} studies using cGMP or cAMP {{revealed}} a cross-talk between signaling mechanisms activated by axonal guidance receptors. However, the molecular elements modulated by cyclic nucleotides in growth cones are not well understood. cGMP is a second messenger with several distinct targets including cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI). Our studies indicated that the α isoform of cGKI is predominantly expressed by sensory axons during developmental stages, whereas most spinal cord neurons are negative for cGKI. Analysis of the trajectories of axons within the spinal cord showed a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guidance</b> defect of sensory axons within the developing dorsal root entry zone {{in the absence of}} cGKI. Consequently, in cGKI-deficient mice, fewer axons grow within the dorsal funiculus of the spinal cord, and lamina-specific innervation, especially by nociceptive sensory neurons, is strongly reduced as deduced from anti-trkA staining. These axon guidance defects in cGKI-deficient mice lead to a substantial impairment in nociceptive flexion reflexes, shown using electrophysiology. In vitro studies revealed that activation of cGKI in embryonic dorsal root ganglia counteracts semaphorin 3 A–induced growth cone collapse. Our studies therefore reveal that cGMP signaling is important for axonal growth in vivo and in vitro...|$|E
