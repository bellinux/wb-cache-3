50|$|Prior to the {{collapse}} of the Grand Banks (and other) stocks due to overfishing, salt cod was derived exclusively from Atlantic cod. Since then products sold as salt cod may be derived from other whitefish, such as pollock, haddock, blue whiting, <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stockfish is {{unsalted}} fish, especially cod, dried by {{cold air}} and wind on wooden racks on the foreshore. The drying racks {{are known as}} fish flakes.

5000|$|The yoal was {{the main}} vessel used for haaf (open water within sight of land, up to 10 miles from shore) fishing for cod, <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk</b> until the fish shoals moved further {{offshore}} {{at the end of}} the 17th century, probably due to climatic change. [...] Although yoals were not designed for the far haaf, Shetland fishermen continued to use them for relatively deep sea fishing with attendant accidents and loss of life until the introduction in the mid 18th century of the larger, heavier and deeper sixareen designed for fishing further offshore. Although there were some variations in size the yoal was generally 21ft 5in overall, 15ft keel, 21in inside depth amidships and 5ft 5in beam.|$|E
40|$|The burbot (Lota lota Linnaeus, 1758) is {{the only}} {{freshwater}} species from the cod family. Various taxonomic hypotheses were tested against molecular data by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome b locus of 120 burbot from 41 populations together with the related species Molva molva (<b>ling)</b> <b>and</b> Brosme brosme (<b>tusk),</b> which represented the other Lotinae genera. Within the genus Lota two distinct phylogroups were observed: one in North America south of the Great Slave Lakes (Lota Iota maculosa) and one in Eurasia and {{the remainder of the}} Nearctic region (Lota Iota Iota). The burbot lineage separated 10 Myr BP from the other Lotinae, while the genetic variation within burbot appeared to be approximately I Myr old. However, fossil evidence suggested that burbot already existed in the Early Pliocene in Europe, from were it probably colonized North America in the Early Pleistocene. While Nearctic burbot survived climatic oscillations and diverged in several refugia, the Eurasian form became extinct or was reduced to a very small population. In the Late Pleistocene the species recolonized the Palearctic region to establish its present distribution range. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{stocks of}} ling Molva molva L., blue ling Molva dipterygia (Pennant, 1784) and tusk Brosme brosme L. {{in the northeastern}} Atlantic support {{significant}} coastal and offshore bank and slope fisheries in several countries. In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings. This manual summarises results of efforts made for two of the species, <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk,</b> in the period 1993 - 1996. The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk</b> are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g. Williams and Bedford 1974). This manual aims at assisting age readers who are inexperienced with the reading of <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk</b> otoliths. It should be used as an initial guideline and reference only. In order to achieve precise and stable age determination, {{there is a need for}} inter-calibrations of readings by different readers, and repeated reading by the same reader...|$|E
40|$|The term {{deepwater}} {{refers to}} fishing in waters greater than 400 m depth. The main species taken in these deepwater fisheries are roundnose grenadier, black scabbard, orange roughy, greenland halibut, tusk and deepwater sharks. The fisheries {{take place in}} depths between 800 m and 1200 m {{on the slopes of}} the Porcupine Bank and in the Rockall Trough to the West of Ireland. France was the first country to take an interest in deepwater stocks in the late 1980 s. Since then Spain, UK Norway, Faroes and Ireland have developed deepwater fisheries. On the slopes west of Donegal, Norwegian long-liners fish for <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk</b> on the shelf edge.

40|$|Author for correspondence) Key words: fish distribution, deep-sea coral reefs, stomach content, habitat {{differences}} Experimental {{fishing with}} long-lines and gillnets {{was conducted on}} the continental shelf off southwestern Norway between 150 and 350 m depth. Abundance and distribution of redfish (Sebastes marinus L., 1758), ling (Molva molva L., 1758), and tusk (Brosme brosme Ascanius, 1772) were quantified in Lophelia pertusa (L., 1758) coral reefs and in non-coral habitats. The largest catches of redfish were made with long-line fleets set in coral reef habitats. <b>Ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk</b> were also most numerous in coral habitats, although not statistically significant. Fish caught in coral habitats tended to be larger in size than in non-coral habitats. The diet of redfish, tusk and ling included the same prey groups in all habitats, but they differed at the species level. Lophelia-reefs may provide a profitable feeding place for tusk. For the planktivorous Sebastes, on the other hand, their affinity to the reefs seems primarily {{to be related to the}} physical structure offered by the reefs...|$|E

40|$|The {{longline}} fisheries for ling (Molva molva) and tusk (Brosme brosme) {{have long}} traditions in Norway. Blue ling (Molva dipterygia) {{was always a}} by-catch in Norwegian slope waters but about 15 years ago this species became {{the target of a}} deep-water gill-net fishery. In recent years 5 - 10 % of the firsthand value of Norwegian landings was attributed to these species. This report provides an overview of the fisheries and population biology of the three species, with emphasis on aspects of relevance to future stock assessments, based on results from Norwegian investigations in 1993 - 95 and literature reviews. The Norwegian fleets which target ling, tusk and blue ling are the high-seas autoline vessels which operate in waters to the west and north of the British Isles, in the North Sea and at the Faroes and Iceland, and longline and gill-net vessels of various sizes fishing in home waters along the Norwegian slope. Exploitation occurs {{in all parts of the}} distribution area of the species. It is still unclear whether separate stocks occur in different sub-areas. Spawning areas are wide-spread, also the distribution of eggs and larvae. Very little is known about migrations. The age and size structure of the catches in various fishing areas show only minor variation. New studies by electrophoresis of tissue enzymes and hemoglobins indicate that tusk from all areas sampled in the northeastern Atlantic belong to the same gene pool, where the results for ling and blue ling are inconclusive. Estimates of mortality show that exploitation rates are high, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) analyses of <b>ling</b> <b>and</b> <b>tusk</b> based on both private and official logbooks from the longliners indicate a considerable decline in the population sizes since the 1970 s. The catch per unit of effort may have declined by about 70 %. Strategies and requirements for future monitoring by improved CPUE measures and age-based assessement models are discussed. NORSK SAMMENDRAG:Linefisket etter lange og brosme har lange tradisjoner i Norge. Blålange har alltid vært tatt som bifangst i fisket på Eggakanten, men for rundt 15 år siden startet et direkte garnfiske etter denne arten på dypt vann. De sener år har disse artene gitt 5 - 10 % av førstehåndsverdien i norske landinger. Denne rapporten gir en oversikt over fisket og bestandsbiologien til disse tre artene med spesiell vekt på ting som er relevante for framtidige bestandsberegninger basert på resultat fra norske undersøkelser fra 1993 - 95 og relevant litteratur. Lange, brosme og blålange fiskes av den havgående autolineflåten i områdene vest og nord av de Britiske øyer, i Nordsjøen og ved Færøyane og Island.

5000|$|Ivory is a hard, white {{material}} from the <b>tusks</b> (traditionally elephant's) <b>and</b> teeth of animals, {{that can be used}} in art or manufacturing. It consists mainly of dentine (inorganic formula Ca10(PO4)6(CO3)·H2O)), one of the physical structures of teeth <b>and</b> <b>tusks.</b> The chemical structure of the teeth <b>and</b> <b>tusks</b> of mammals is the same, regardless of the species of origin. The trade in certain teeth <b>and</b> <b>tusks</b> other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, [...] "ivory" [...] can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed. It has been valued since ancient times for making a range of items, from ivory carvings to false teeth, fans, dominoes and joint tubes. Elephant ivory is the most important source, but ivory from mammoth, walrus, hippopotamus, sperm whale, killer whale, narwhal and wart hog are used as well. [...] Elk also have two ivory teeth, which are believed to be the remnants of tusks from their ancestors.|$|R
