25|$|According to an {{unconfirmed}} 19th-century source, in {{the late}} 17th century the Vatican librarian Leo Allatius wrote an unpublished treatise entitled De Praeputio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba (A Discussion of the Foreskin of Our Lord Jesus Christ), claiming that the Holy Prepuce ascended, <b>like</b> <b>Jesus</b> himself, and was transformed into the rings of Saturn.|$|E
25|$|While {{most western}} scholars, Jews, and Christians believe Jesus died, {{orthodox}} Muslim theology teaches he ascended to Heaven without {{being put on}} the cross and God transformed another person, Simon of Cyrene, to appear exactly <b>like</b> <b>Jesus</b> who was crucified instead of Jesus (cf. Irenaeus' description of the heresy of Basilides, Book I, ch. XXIV, 4.).|$|E

25|$|Disciples of the Cao Đài {{religion}} {{worship the}} Buddha {{as a major}} religious teacher. His image {{can be found in}} both their Holy See and on the home altar.

25|$|In the Bahá'í Faith, the Báb, {{founder of}} the Bábí Faith, is {{believed}} to be the return of Elijah and John the Baptist. Both Elijah and John the Baptist are considered to be Lesser Prophets, whose stations are below that of a Manifestation of God <b>like</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, Buddha, Muhammad, the Báb or Bahá'u'lláh. The Báb is buried on Mount Carmel, where Elijah had his confrontation with the prophets of Baal.|$|E
25|$|In various respects, {{the history}} of Mirza Ali Mohammed, surnamed the Báb, {{presents}} startling resemblance {{to that of the}} Savior. Claiming descent from an ancient prophet king, he was yet, <b>like</b> <b>Jesus,</b> born in a lowly station; still he was regarded by his followers as the sovereign of his nation and of mankind, whose advent had been long foretold and ardently expected. After leading a life of purity, and uttering words of wisdom, he was put to death, through the hostility of his own government, but by the hands of foreign soldiers; and, before his execution, he was denied by some of his most prominent followers; nay, the very form of contumely with which thy were compelled to treat him, was the same which had been used towards the Savior in the hall of the high priest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first line}} of the song {{contains}} the lyrics [...] "I cant say that I love Jesus", attracting some controversy. Peter Buck clarified the matter to Q magazines Tom Doyle in 1996: [...] "Its written {{from the perspective of}} a character that Michael saw on TV on a talk show. But are people going to think Michaels talking about himself not <b>liking</b> <b>Jesus?</b> I dont think that people will take us that seriously. Its not like were tearing up a picture of the Pope on television." [...] He was referring to Sinéad OConnors 1992 Saturday Night Live incident.|$|R

25|$|Stories of heavenly ascents {{were fairly}} {{common in the}} time of Jesus, {{signifying}} the means whereby a prophet could attain access to divine secrets, or divine approval granted to an exceptionally righteous individual, or the deification of an exceptional man. Figures familiar to Jews would have included Enoch (from the Book of Genesis and a popular non-Biblical work called 1 Enoch); the 5th century sage Ezra; Baruch the companion of the prophet Jeremiah (from a work called 2 Baruch, in which Baruch is promised he will ascend to heaven after 40 days); Levi the ancestor of priests; the Teacher of Righteousness from the Qumran community; the prophet Elijah (from 2 Kings); Moses, who was deified on entering heaven; and the children of Job, who according to the Testament of Job ascended heaven following their resurrection from the dead. Non-Jewish readers would have been familiar with the case of the emperor Augustus, whose ascent was witnessed by Senators; Romulus the founder of Rome, who, <b>like</b> <b>Jesus,</b> was taken to heaven in a cloud; the Greek hero Heracles (Hercules); and others.|$|E
500|$|Wiesel {{wrote in}} 1979 {{that he kept}} his story to himself for ten years.

He writes: [...] "The problem was that [...] {{was in love with}} Jesus. He was the most decent person I ever met in that field... and {{he was in love with}} Jesus.... Whatever I would ask– Jesus. Finally, I said, 'What about Mendès-France?' He said that Mendès-France, <b>like</b> <b>Jesus,</b> was suffering..." ...|$|E
500|$|Pierson {{included}} in his draft explicit religious symbolism. The film contains several elements based on Christian themes, including {{the concept of}} Luke as a Saint who wins over the crowds and is ultimately sacrificed. Newman's character of Luke is portrayed as a [...] "Jesus-like redeemer figure." [...] After [...] winning the egg-eating bet, Luke lies exhausted {{on the table in}} the position of Jesus as depicted on his crucifixion. After learning about the death of his mother, Luke sings [...] "Plastic Jesus." [...] Greg Garrett also compares Luke to Jesus, in that <b>like</b> <b>Jesus,</b> he was not physically threatening to society because of his actions, and like Jesus' crucifixion, his punishment was [...] "out of all proportion." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{have stated}} that Man of Steel is a {{religious}} allegory, especially since Warner Bros. set up a website www.manofsteelresources.com that contains [...] "a nine-page pamphlet entitled Jesus – The Original Superhero". Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the passion of Christ, stating that [...] "Kal-El is {{more than willing to}} sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth. Originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to the world, Supes decides to turn himself over to Zod to save humanity from annihilation." [...] Craig also states that there is an allegory to the Trinity within Man of Steel: [...] "Jor-El returns to Kal-El on Earth as a ghost, guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation. Before Jor-El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses-style, he tells his wife that, <b>like</b> <b>Jesus,</b> 'He’ll be a god to them.'" [...] Paul Asay of The Washington Post writes that [...] "Superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross," [...] a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film. The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks [...] "counsel at a church." [...] Writing for The Huffington Post, Colin Liotta compared Zod to Adolf Hitler, citing, [...] "He feels his vision for a pure Krypton (i.e. a society like the one Hitler envisioned with his eugenics program) is the only answer for survival." ...|$|E
500|$|Cho {{was born}} on January 18, 1984, {{in the city of}} Asan, in South Korea's South Chungcheong Province. Cho and his family lived in a {{basement}} apartment in the South Korean capital of Seoul {{for a couple of years}} before immigrating to the United States. Cho's father was self-employed as a bookstore owner, but made minimum wages from the venture. Seeking better education and opportunities for his children, [...] Cho's father immigrated to the United States in September 1992 with his wife and three children. Cho was eight years old at the time. The family first lived in Detroit, then moved to the Washington metropolitan area after learning that it had one of the largest South Korean expatriate communities in the U.S., particularly in Northern Virginia. Cho's family settled in Centreville, an unincorporated community in western Fairfax County, Virginia about [...] west of Washington, D.C. Cho's father and mother opened a dry-cleaning business in Centreville. After the family moved to Centreville, Cho and his family became permanent residents of the United States as South Korean nationals. His parents became members of a local Christian church, and Cho himself was raised as a member of the religion, although he [...] "hated his parents' strong Christian faith." [...] According to one report, Cho had left a note in his dormitory which contained a rant referencing Christianity and denigrating [...] "rich kids". In a video that Cho mailed to the NBC headquarters in New York he stated, [...] "Thanks to you I die <b>like</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, to inspire generations of the weak and defenseless people." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his twenties, Sundar Singh's Gospel work widened greatly, {{and long}} before he was thirty, his name and picture were {{familiar}} all over the Christian world. He described a struggle with Satan to retain his humility, but people described him as always human, approachable and humble, {{with a sense of}} fun and a love of nature. This character, with his illustrations from ordinary life, gave his addresses great impact. Many people said, [...] "He not only looks <b>like</b> <b>Jesus,</b> he talks <b>like</b> <b>Jesus</b> must have talked." [...] His talks and his personal speech were informed by his habitual early morning meditation, especially on the gospels.
