5|$|Advanced COPD <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> an increase in moisture and significant vertical motion.

5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E

5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
50|$|Memory errors often <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> {{the belief}} of new memories, which are problematic.

5|$|This {{inflammatory}} cascade typically <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> {{the formation}} of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause {{the formation of}} deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> hypothyroidism (lack {{of production}} of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E

5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
