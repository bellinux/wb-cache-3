5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{receiver}} {{was otherwise}} {{identical to the}} range version, and fed into the CRT in the same fashion. A slower time base generator was used, triggered by the same signal as the first, but set to scan much more slowly. In this case the time base {{was not used to}} measure range, and the horizontal location of the blip was not important. Instead, the time base was used simply to help ensure the bearing operator was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> target as the range operator - the signal of interest would be somewhere close to centred.|$|E

25|$|As was {{the case}} with {{black-and-white}} television, an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like Baird's. The obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional Iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an RGB signal. Using three separate tubes each <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames, so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes. Each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems.|$|E
25|$|In Europe {{where the}} {{threshold}} for thyroid surgery {{is lower than}} in the United States, an elaborate strategy that incorporates serum calcitonin measurements and stimulatory tests for calcitonin has been incorporated into the decision to perform a thyroidectomy; thyroid experts in the United States, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> data sets have, for the most part, not incorporated calcitonin testing as a routine part of their evaluation, thereby eliminating {{a large number of}} thyroidectomies and the consequent morbidity. The European thyroid community has focused on prevention of metastasis from small medullary thyroid carcinomas; the North American thyroid community has focused more on prevention of complications associated with thyroidectomy (see American Thyroid Association guidelines below). It is not clear at this time who is correct.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between {{interior and exterior}} - and between structure and image - was to be developed very purposefully in the Renaissance and beyond, especially once the dome became reinstated in the Western tradition as {{a key element in}} church design. Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by Giacomo della Porta, for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. Baltasar Neumann, in his baroque churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames. These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, were perfectly suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In St Paul's Cathedral in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults. The dome that one sees from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible - and for its age highly original - catenary vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that one sees from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, one can easily assume that one is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> vault that one sees from the outside.|$|E

500|$|Other {{significant}} obstacles for {{law enforcement}} were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features, and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance almost at will. Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him. In person, [...] "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure you were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., {{the judge in the}} DaRonch trial. [...] "He [...] really a changeling." [...] Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary. He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters. Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.|$|E
500|$|NHK {{announced}} a seven-episode live-action television drama adaptation on March 30, 2009, produced {{in cooperation with}} the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the country's national aerospace agency. Sixteen-year-old actress Nanami Sakuraba was cast for the role of Asumi Kamogawa, and filming for the series began on April 2. The drama was scheduled to air on June 11 but was eventually postponed by one week until June 18. Its airing coincided with the celebration of the International Year of Astronomy. Screenplay for the series was written by Shūko Arai and Daigo Matsui. While writing the script, Arai found himself encouraged by the characters who must overcome various struggles in order to achieve their dreams. He also specified hopes and dreams as central themes in the story. Among the changes made in this adaptation is the removal of Lion-san as a central character. Yaginuma did not make any restrictions for Arai and Matsui as he believed they knew the television audience best. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "I think the little Asumi I know and the Asumi portrayed by Ms. Nanami are both <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sky." [...] A three-disc DVD compilation box set of the adaptation was released by Geneon Universal Entertainment on December 23, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Neurologists {{have focused}} objectively on organic nervous system pathology, {{especially}} of the brain, whereas psychiatrists have laid claim to illnesses of the mind. This [...] distinction between brain and mind as two different entities has characterized many {{of the differences between}} the two specialties. However, it has been argued that this division is fictional; evidence from the last century of research has shown that our mental life has its roots in the brain. Brain and mind have been argued not to be discrete entities but just different ways of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> system (Marr, 1982). It has been argued that embracing this mind/brain monism may be useful for several reasons. First, rejecting dualism implies that all mentation is biological, which provides a common research framework in which understanding and treatment of mental disorders can be advanced. Second, it mitigates widespread confusion about the legitimacy of mental illness by suggesting that all disorders should have a footprint in the brain.|$|E

5000|$|RDI {{is based}} on the idea that [...] "dynamic intelligence" [...] must be {{enhanced}} for autistic children to develop typical behaviors.

The director explained, [...] "It's almost like tentacles that grow out of the film and lead, also, to the ideas in the film. And there's this weird way where you can go see the movie and it's one experience... But there's also this other place where you can get engaged where there's this other sort of aspect for all those people who are into that. All the stories kind of bounce off one another and inform each other. But, {{at the end of the}} day, this movie stands on its own to be a movie.... The Internet sort of stories and connections and clues are, in a way, a prism and they're another way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing.
