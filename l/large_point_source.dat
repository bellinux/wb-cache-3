The experiment which was of particular interest with regards to ozone photochemistry involved horizontal zig-zag flight patterns (ZIPPER) over an area from the eastern Ohio River valley to the Adirondacks of New York. Model simulations by both the standard resolution RADM (delta x = 80 km) and the nested grid RADM (delta x = 26. 7 km) compare well to measurements in the low emission regions in central Pennsylvania and upstate New York, but underestimate in the high emission upper Ohio River valley. The nested simulation does considerably better, however, than the coarse grid simulation in terms of horizontal pattern and concentration magnitudes. Analysis of NO(x) and HO(x) concentrations and photochemical products rates of ozone show that the model's response to <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> emissions is very unsystematic both spatially and temporally.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Geologic CO₂ {{sequestration}} is {{a climate}} change mitigation strategy that prevents CO₂ emissions to the atmosphere by capturing CO₂ gasses from <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> emissions streams and then pressurizing and pumping the supercritical-state CO₂ into underground geologic storage reservoirs. Once underground, CO₂ is prevented from buoyant migration to the surface by various trapping mechanisms, {{one of which is}} capillary trapping. Capillary trapping is a secure trapping mechanism that immobilizes CO₂ on relatively short timescales; accurate prediction and optimization of capillary trapping of CO₂ is crucial to ensure the safety and success of a sequestration operation. The research comprising this dissertation utilizes x-ray computed microtomography (x-ray CMT) to allow for three-dimensional (3 D) investigation of the main factors influencing nonwetting phase capillary trapping from a pore-scale in-situ perspective. Results from ambient- and supercritical-condition experiments are presented that provide insight as to the controls on capillary trapping during multiphase flow in porous media. The presented findings may be used to help design injection strategies that optimize capillary trapping of CO₂ during sequestration operations and to help develop more accurate predictive transport models...|$|E

Over the last 5 years, the Internet, public “right to know”, and environmental justice programs have greatly increased the visibility {{and use of}} emission inventory data.

In relative terms, the problem of HazMat pipeline risk assessment does not come with hazard analysis, or the estimation of failure frequency, but with the calculation of the consequences. In this paper, we consider the peculiar case of oxygen instantaneous or continuous releases from a pipeline and consequent evolving scenarios. A novel modelling approach to risk evaluation is elaborated starting from the rather common situation of a pipe-way where several gas/liquid lines are localized, in a rather congested industrial area. As an applicative case-study, it is considered a downstream oil industry where the possibility of replacing the air feeding to Claus plant with oxygen enriched line is investigated, {{with the aim of}} enhancing sulphur recovery yield.

40|$|Geological {{storage of}} CO 2 {{that has been}} {{captured}} at <b>large,</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> emitters represents a key potential method for reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. However, this technology will only be viable {{if it can be}} guaranteed that injected CO 2 will remain trapped in the subsurface for thousands of years or more. A signi?cant issue for storage security is the geomechanical response of the reservoir. Concerns have been raised that geomechanical deformation induced by CO 2 injection will create or reactivate fracture networks in the sealing caprocks, providing a pathway for CO 2 leakage. In this paper, we examine three large-scale sites where CO 2 is injected at rates of ab. 1 megatonne/y or more: Sleipner, Weyburn, and In Salah. We compare and contrast the observed geomechanical behavior of each site, with particular focus on the risks to storage security posed by geomechanical deformation. At Sleipner, the large, high-permeability storage aquifer has experienced little pore pressure increase over 15 y of injection, implying little possibility of geomechanical deformation. At Weyburn, 45 y of oil production has depleted pore pressures before increases associated with CO 2 injection. The long history of the ?eld has led to complicated, sometimes nonintuitive geomechanical deformation. At In Salah, injection into the water leg of a gas reservoir has increased pore pressures, leading to uplift and substantial microseismic activity. The differences in the geomechanical responses of these sites emphasize the need for systematic geomechanical appraisal before injection in any potential storage site...|$|E

Known Hg emission sources within the airshed of the monitoring sites include: 1) a 1114 megawatt (MW) coal-fired electric utility generating station; 2) a Hg-bed chlor-alkali plant; and 3) a smaller (465 MW) coal-burning electric utility. Monitoring sites, showing sporadic elevation of RGM, Hg&deg; and Hg-PM 2. 5 , were positioned at distances of 25, 50 and 100 km northward {{of the larger}} electric utility. A series of RGM events were recorded at each site.

Delmas (Delmas, 1992; Delmas, 1994) has noted that “information recorded in polar ice cores over the last several hundred millennia is invaluable to studies aimed at understanding the pre-industrial environmental system and anticipating the future evolution of the climate and the atmosphere. ” For example, the isotopic composition of the ice (H_ 2 O) matrix is a reliable paleothermometer. From the analysis of deep Antarctic and Greenland ice cores the ice age environmental conditions appeared to correspond to about 6 °C cooler temperatures and atmospheric CO_ 2 and CH_ 4 levels lower by factors of nearly 2 and 4, respectively. The biogeochemical cycles of S and N also appear to be affected by climatic changes that result in modifications in the source intensity and the transport of gaseous precursors. Even though atmospheric sulfate is derived principally from marine biogenic sources (i. e., dimethyl sulfide emission), cataclysmic volcanic eruptions can contribute sporadically to the atmospheric sulfur budget through <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> emissions of SO_ 2.

Nitrate, which is the next most abundant anion found in polar snowfall, exhibits concentration changes that are poorly understood, but which could be linked with the polar ozone hole formation. In addition to ions derived primarily from gas-to-particle conversions, continental dust and sea-spray aerosol components are also present in the ice at much higher concentrations during ice ages than during interglacial periods due to an intensification of their production and long range transport under glacial climatic conditions...|$|E

The region where photochemistry is active, based on horizontal plume traverses, is small compared {{to the rest of the}} plume which is either already chemically mature or not yet chemically active. New data can be used to examine the relationship between photochemically active regions in the plume and changes in particle volume. Also, the effect of turbulent eddies of less than plume-scale on chemical species concentrations (segregation) and, thus, on rapid chemical reaction rates can be examined using the relationship between O 3, NO, and NO 2.

CCS technology includes carbon dioxide capture on the <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> transport of captured carbon dioxide stream and storage of carbon into safe geological formations. Among the CCS processes, capture side is developing with many demonstration projects, focusing on the efficiency improvement of wet and dry absorbents, material improvement for membrane, construction cost down, etc. But in transport side, the technology is in the initial stage. In Korea, site surveys are mainly focused and operated on the offshore saline aquifers in the east sea of Korea and rather few surveys are processed in the on land side. For the offshore carbon dioxide geological storage, there are two options for transportation, using pipeline or ship. To utilize the offshore pipeline {{it is possible to}} use high chrome steel alloy to response to seawater corrosion, though the cost for construction might take huge budget for installation mainly cause of material cost. Otherwise, we considered {{it might be possible to}} apply the anti-corrosion coating outside of the carbon steel pipeline to mitigate seawater corrosion and to reduce the cost, so to secure steady and robust operation of offshore carbon dioxide transportation with little concern of corrosion issue. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using carbon steel pipeline with internal phosphate coating and external thermal spray coating as candidate for the offshore carbon dioxide transportation pipeline material. The base material for this study is carbon steel. The pipe internal corrosion test was conducted with fluids of CO 2 mixture with additives of water and SO 2 gas, and the external corrosion was carried out with 3. 5 %w NaCl solution. In the case of internal corrosion, all the specimens resulted in corroded surface with rust covered when SO 2 was injected over 175 ppmv. In the case of external corrosion, zinc thermal spray with epoxy coating showed that more epoxy sealer is remained than aluminum thermal spray coating.

A Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) colony (40, 000 pairs) at Goldcrest Point is a <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> of NH 3 {{on the island and}} a measurement transect of 23 m, 36 m, 70 m, 143 m and 338 m was set up downwind from the colony. Atmospheric NH 3 concentrations measured by passive diffusion samplers declined from 23 μg m− 3 close to the colony to less than 1 μg m− 3 338 m downwind. As increased nitrogen (N) deposition can affect soil carbon (C) and N cycling, it can therefore potentially influence GHG and nitric oxide (NO) emission rates. However, in this study, a clear correlation between surface GHG fluxes and atmospheric NH 3 concentrations could not be established. Average fluxes for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) over the entire transect and the eight week study period ranged from 7 to 23 μg N 2 O–N m− 2 h− 1, − 5. 5 – 245 μg CH 4 m− 2 h− 1, and CO 2 respiration rates averaged 2. 2 μmol m− 2 s− 1. Laboratory studies using intact soil cores from the transect also did not show any significant correlation between atmospheric NH 3 concentrations and N 2 O, NO, CH 4 emissions or CO 2 respiration rates. Overall, fluxes measured in the laboratory study reflected the high variability measured in the field. Large changes in soil depth along the transect, due to the topography of the island, possibly influenced fluxes more than NH 3 concentration and seabirds appeared to have a more localised input (e. g. ground nesting birds). However, warmer temperatures might have a large potential to increase GHG fluxes in this ecosystem. This study confirms that GHG fluxes do occur in these ornithogenic ecosystems, however, the scale of the impact remains largely unquantified due to high uncertainties and high spatial variability...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring urban–industrial {{emissions}} {{is often}} challenging because observations are scarce and regional atmospheric transport models are too coarse {{to represent the}} high spatiotemporal variability in the resulting concentrations. In this paper we apply a new combination of an Eulerian model (Weather Research and Forecast, WRF, with chemistry) and a Gaussian plume model (Operational Priority Substances – OPS). The modelled mixing ratios are compared to observed CO 2 and CO mole fractions at four sites along a transect from an urban–industrial complex (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) towards rural conditions for October–December 2014. Urban plumes are well-mixed at our semi-urban location, making this location suited for an integrated emission estimate over the whole study area. The signals at our urban measurement site (with average enhancements of 11  ppm CO 2 and 40  ppb CO over the baseline) are highly variable due {{to the presence of}} distinct source areas dominated by road traffic/residential heating emissions or industrial activities. This causes different emission signatures that are translated into a large variability in observed ΔCO : ΔCO 2 ratios, which can be used to identify dominant source types. We find that WRF-Chem is able to represent synoptic variability in CO 2 and CO (e. g. the median CO 2 mixing ratio is 9. 7  ppm, observed, against 8. 8  ppm, modelled), but it fails to reproduce the hourly variability of daytime urban plumes at the urban site (R 2 up to 0. 05). For the urban site, adding a plume model to the model framework is beneficial to adequately represent plume transport especially from stack emissions. The explained variance in hourly, daytime CO 2 enhancements from point source emissions increases from 30  % with WRF-Chem to 52  % with WRF-Chem in combination with the most detailed OPS simulation. The simulated variability in ΔCO :  ΔCO 2 ratios decreases drastically from 1. 5 to 0. 6  ppb ppm − 1, which agrees better with the observed standard deviation of 0. 4  ppb ppm − 1. This is partly due to improved wind fields (increase in R 2 of 0. 10) but also due to improved point source representation (increase in R 2 of 0. 05) and dilution (increase in R 2 of 0. 07). Based on our analysis we conclude that a plume model with detailed and accurate dispersion parameters adds substantially to top–down monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments with <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> contributions within a [*]∼[*]  10  km radius from the observation sites...|$|E
40|$|Many {{applications}} in atmospheric science involve ill-posed inverse problems. A crucial component of many inverse problems {{is the proper}} formulation of a priori knowledge about the unknown parameters. In most cases, this knowledge is expressed as a Gaussian prior. This formulation often performs well at capturing smoothed, large-scale processes but is often ill equipped to capture localized structures like <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> or localized hot spots. Over the last decade, scientists from a diverse array of applied mathematics and engineering fields have developed sparse reconstruction techniques to identify localized structures. In this study, we present a new regularization approach for ill-posed inverse problems in atmospheric science. It is based on Tikhonov regularization with sparsity constraint and allows bounds on the parameters. We enforce sparsity using a dictionary representation system. We analyze its performance in an atmospheric inverse modeling scenario by estimating anthropogenic US methane (CH 4) emissions from simulated atmospheric measurements. Different measures indicate that our sparse reconstruction approach is better able to capture <b>large</b> <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> or localized hot spots than other methods commonly used in atmospheric inversions. It captures the overall signal equally well but adds details on the grid scale. This feature can be of value for any inverse problem with point or spatially discrete sources. We show an example for source estimation of synthetic methane emissions from the Barnett shale formation...|$|R
