40|$|Several {{initiatives}} {{aimed at reducing}} trade barriers for <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries have been proposed recently. These include the EU decision to provide duty-free and quota-free access on an autonomous basis for all products except arms when imported from the <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries, and a proposal from the WTO General Director to bind all tariffs on imports from <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries at zero rates in the World Trade Organisation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the economic impacts for the <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries of duty-free and quota-free access in their export markets. The main focus is on the QUAD markets (Canada, the EU, Japan, and the USA). The report documents the significance of existing trade barriers and evaluates the economic consequences of removing these barriers. The impact of supply capacity constraints in <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries on their ability to utilise preferential trade arrangements is also investigated. Moreover, the report evaluates the significance for <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries of certain crucial aspects of preferential trading arrangements, such as the extent of product coverage, the question of binding tariffs and procedures, the use of safeguard measures in importing countries, graduation procedures and rules of origin...|$|R

According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), this number is {{expected}} to increase until 2070. Much of the increase has derived from the <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries who have experienced rapid and large growth in their youth populations. Within <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries’ populations roughly 60% are under 24 years old.

Facebook {{is one of the}} most significant social media tools, which has been used worldwide. This study investigates the adoption and performance of Facebook fan pages among global airline companies in <b>developed,</b> <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> and developing countries. The Diffusion of Innovations theory has been applied as the underlying theory in this study. Using content analysis technique the data was collected from official FFP of global airlines. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Chi Square were used to test hypotheses. The result shows no significant difference among the global airline companies in <b>developed,</b> <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> and developing countries in FFP adoption. However, the results shows significant difference in terms of performance and timing of adoption of FFP between the <b>developed,</b> <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> and developing countries. Airlines from developed countries adopted FFP three years earlier than developing countries and performed better than airlines from <b>developing</b> and <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries. Academically, this study adds on internet and technology implementation literature. For industry, investigating the performance of FFP should make it clear for global airline companies how to implement FFP successfull...|$|R
40|$|The changes {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} EU Common Market Organization for sugar will interact with preferential imports from <b>developing</b> countries and <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries that enjoy preferential treatment for exports to the EU, {{as well as by}} trade and adjustment costs. This paper focuses on the impact of the EU Commissions sugar policy reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the <b>Least</b> <b>Developed</b> Countries. Simulations are run with an empirical model structure comprising a partial equilibrium model for the world sugar market and a gravity model to replicate <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries bilateral trade with Europe. Particularly, the gravity approach is employed to model the abolition of import tariffs for sugar originating in <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries, subject to trade costs, while the partial equilibrium approach is employed to assess the effects of EU Commissions sugar policy reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on world markets. Results suggest that the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will experience significant reduction in their export revenue, whilst the initial impact on <b>least</b> <b>developed</b> countries may be limited but increasing in the medium run.
