5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in <b>lighting</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to its {{rebranding}} {{and full}} move onto eighth-generation consoles, Final Fantasy XV (then called Final Fantasy Versus XIII) used <b>lighting</b> <b>technology</b> from Luminous {{along with a}} purpose-built proprietary gameplay engine. For its E3 2013 re-reveal under its new title, the company used a specially-created engine environment named Ebony. In July 2014, Hashimoto left the company, citing personal reasons. While still working as an advisor for Luminous Studio, his position as project leader was filled by Remi Driancourt, a senior engineer {{who had worked with}} games featuring Luminous technology. The version of XV shown off at Tokyo Game Show and Jump Festa that year ran on Luminous 1.4, which combined Luminous with components created for Ebony.

40|$|Throughout the United States, {{in every}} sector and {{building}} type, lighting {{is a significant}} electrical end-use. Based on the many and varied studies of <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies,</b> and experience with programs that promote lighting energy-efficiency, {{there is a significant}} amount of cost-effective energy savings to be achieved in the lighting end use. Because of such potential savings, and because consumers most often do not adopt cost-effective <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> on their own, programs and policies are needed to promote their adoption. Characteristics of lighting energy use, as well as the attributes of the lighting marketplace, can significantly affect the national pattern of lighting equipment choice and ownership. Consequently, policy makers who wish to promote energy-efficient <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> and practices must understand the <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> that people use, {{the ways in which they}} use them, and marketplace characteristics such as key actors, product mix and availability, price spectrum, and product distribution channels.

5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the <b>lighting</b> <b>technology</b> of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} development, Versus XIII used Crystal Tools, a {{proprietary}} game engine created by Square Enix for seventh-generation gaming hardware {{that would be}} used throughout the company for multiple games, including XIII and Final Fantasy XIV. Later, Tabata described the Crystal Tools hardware {{as an extension of the}} technology of the previous gaming generation. During 2010, Nomura revealed that the team were using read world-based physical calculations to determine weather and cloud behavior in-game. By 2011, Nomura announced that the game was no longer using Crystal Tools, and instead used a specially designed proprietary gameplay engine combined by <b>lighting</b> <b>technology</b> from Luminous Studio, an engine built for eighth-generation gaming hardware. The focus on realism influenced the decision to incorporate the more advanced <b>lighting</b> <b>technology,</b> while the specially designed engine had a limited area of use. The planned scale of the open world increased so much that the older technology eventually became obsolete as it was restricting the developers. The need to create new technology to cope with these problems further added to initial development difficulties. The original plan was to have interactive real-time event scenes. Nomura felt that regular storytelling cutscenes in other games interrupted gameplay and caused players to skip them. Furthermore, the development frame could theoretically be shortened as there was no need to create cutscenes-exclusive high-polygon character models. However, seamless transitions of these events into the gameplay were hard to achieve and instead increased the time that had to be invested by the team. After the full shift onto eighth-generation platforms, multiple planned elements were influenced by the new Luminous technology: the in-game cutscene camera was optimized to work similarly to the one used in pre-rendered movies, and more environmental and gameplay elements could be included such as an increased number of destructible environments and the player character's warping to faraway spots on the game maps. It also enabled Nomura to start experimenting with higher facial detail for enemies such as behemoths.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in using new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> such as <b>light</b> emitting diode (LED), induction, and plasma light sources in roadway lighting. The most commonly claimed benefits of the new lighting systems include increased reliability, improved efficiency, and reduced maintenance costs. While Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is also {{getting a lot of}} interest from vendors pushing the new light sources for roadway lighting applications, none of these new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> has been used in the state highway systems by INDOT. Before adopting the new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies,</b> INDOT would like to determine if the new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> meet required <b>light</b> output and if they are cost effective. Moreover, it is necessary for INDOT to establish standardized guidelines for evaluating the new lighting systems prior to the formal adoption. This study first conducted literature reviews on the new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies.</b> Surveys were also conducted to identify the perceptions of state highway agencies and local cities towards the new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies</b> including LED, induction, and plasma, and their experiences in use of these new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies.</b> Various luminaires, including HPS, LED, plasma, and induction luminaires from different manufacturers were installed and evaluated for both conventional and high mast lightings at a test site over a period of 12 months. Illuminance measurements were made to determine the light levels and illuminance uniformities produced by those LED, plasma and induction luminaires with the existing lighting infrastructures. Comparisons were also made between the light performances produced by different luminaires. Electric currents were measured to determine the energy consumptions by different luminaires. Life cycle cost analysis was also conducted to determine if the new lighting sources are cost-effective compared to the corresponding HPS lighting sources and assess the possible return or payback periods for the LED, plasma, and induction luminaires evaluated in this study. Illuminance measurements were also made for two urban street lightings to map the light performances of LED and plasma luminaires with different lighting layouts. Main findings and recommendations were made to assist INDOT Traffic Engineering in upgrading the lighting policies and developing technical specifications for adopting the new <b>lighting</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

In one section of Calgary where they were filming, production staff replaced each sodium-lamp street light with tungsten light bulbs, creating an ambience that [...] "pulls the audience into the world when the story takes place". Also, once Hawley analyzed the 1968 thriller film The Boston Strangler, split screen effects were employed to help streamline the narrative during transitions. Gonzales said: [...] "We felt that split-screen would be an incredible way to track all these characters and locations within the episode: Where's the Gerhardt family?
