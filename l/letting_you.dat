500|$|While these {{preparations}} were underway, Fox kept wavering in {{its commitment}} to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron [...] "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," [...] so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to {{less than half of}} the film's official $237million budget. After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, [...] "I don't know if we're crazier for <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you can do this..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> know very well that he's lying, and make you love him for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
2500|$|Gable's {{marriage}} in 1939 to his third wife, actress Carole Lombard (1908–1942), was the happiest period {{of his personal}} life. They met while filming 1932's No Man of Her Own, when Lombard was still married to actor William Powell, but their romance did not take off until 1936. They became reacquainted at a party and soon were inseparable, cited in fan magazines and tabloids as an official couple. Gable thrived being around Lombard's youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating, [...] "You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't {{even know how to}} think about <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> down." [...] Lombard, for her part, seemed to gain personal stability and a contented home life that she had previously lacked. She taught herself how to hunt and fish and accompanied Gable on trips with his hunting companions.|$|E
2500|$|While {{noting that}} Lungu's Băieți de gașcă stories {{inherently}} fail to explore [...] "a more profound vision", Crețu argues: [...] "Dan Lungu [...] manages to render this shortcoming relative through irresistible comedy: {{not one of}} word play , but one of situation." [...] The volume's eponymous story thus alternates between the apparent seriousness of gang culture and the obstacles they face as individuals, with episodes such as one gang member's frustrations over his girlfriend's nymphomania. Other sections of the volume strike a different note, and include a fictionalized account {{the life of a}} young Englishwoman who decides to settle in Romania. Focusing on Lungu's ability to surprise his readers, Teodorescu commented: [...] "Once in a while, if one does not want to let himself be conquered by his tricks, one may have reactions of mistrust [...] Dan Lungu anticipates this reaction as well and builds up complicity for what he does, like a prestidigitator who, {{at the same time as}} jokingly <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> in on how he has made you believe that he was able to cut himself in two, leads you into the fog of the next trick [...] Whoever carefully reads Dan Lungu gets a free lesson in the manipulation techniques to which all those who wish to have us convinced of the truth in non-literary fiction will expose us without warning and at times successfully." [...] Cristea-Enache, who praised Băieți de gașcă for displaying [...] "natural breathing", [...] "stylistic mobility" [...] and [...] "dexterity", also argued: [...] "When the young prose author will manage to inject more substance into both his stories and novels, we shall have in him a leading exponent of this new-old literature." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising the game's [...] "pure {{over-the-top}} driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, {{and the new}} Autolog feature breathes {{new life into the}} time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends." [...] Eurogamer gave the game 9 out of 10. Reviewer Tom Bramwell said [...] "It's stuffed with content but rarely for the sake of it, and knowing Criterion it will be handsomely supported for months to come, even though it's already the best pure arcade racing game since Burnout Paradise." [...] GameTrailers also scored the game 9 out of 10. The reviewer stated Hot Pursuit was [...] "excellently crafted, <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> take the world's fastest cars across miles of stunning landscapes. Chases are exhilarating from either perspective, and the autolog feature completely changes how you compete with friends, keeping you hooked until you've wrecked all of their scores." [...] Destructoid gave the game 9.5 out of 10. Reviewer Nick Chester noted that [...] "it delivers a near-perfect competitive experience, in a way that few games - racing or otherwise - can. Hot Pursuit is not only a defining moment for the series, but for arcade-style racing, period." [...] Reviewer Randy Nelson of Joystiq was the second reviewer to give the game a perfect score of 10/10. Reviewer Chris Antista of GamesRadar also gave the game 10 out of 10. Chris stated that [...] "with so many modes and diverse rewards to uncover in Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, it almost feels like 2.5 games in one package." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Brett Bates gave the game 9.0 out of 10, which felt much the same as GamesRadar's Chris Antista, stating [...] "In effect, you're getting two games in one: What you do as a racer has no bearing on what you do as a cop." ...|$|E
