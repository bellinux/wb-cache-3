5|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 1875, gallium {{has been used}} to make alloys with <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> points. It is also used in semiconductors as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.|$|E
5|$|Those carbenes {{that have}} been {{isolated}} to date tend to be colorless solids with <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> points. These carbenes tend to sublime at low temperatures under high vacuum.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} has {{a relatively}} <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point and boils at around 315°C. The vapour {{consists of the}} dimer Fe2Cl6 (c.f. aluminium chloride) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 (D3h point group molecular symmetry) at higher temperature, in competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron(II) chloride and chlorine gas.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for bullets since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point, ductility, and relative inertness. Many metals {{are superior to}} lead {{in some of these}} aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic resins {{suitable}} for thin-wall molding should have high-flow properties, particularly <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> viscosity. In addition, {{they need to}} be robust enough to avoid degradation from the heat generated by high shear rates (high injection speeds) ...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{applications}} for this process include the spraying of internal diameters of pipes. Any conductive wire {{can be used}} as the feedstock material, including [...] "cored" [...] wire. Refractory metals as well as <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> materials are easily deposited.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of sodium in {{a ratio of}} 1:3 gives the <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> point and must be avoided. This melting point of 535 °C can cause problems on the hot spots of the engine like piston crowns, valve seats, and turbochargers.|$|R
5|$|Potassium is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point, and can be easily cut with a knife. Freshly cut {{potassium}} is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air. In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.|$|E
5|$|Though {{virtually}} unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth {{can form}} distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. It is relatively nontoxic {{and has a}} <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point just above 271°C, so crystals may be grown using a household stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab-grown crystals.|$|E
5|$|With their closed valence shells, {{the noble}} gases {{have the highest}} first {{ionization}} potentials in each of their periods, and feeble interatomic forces of attraction, with the latter property resulting in very <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> and boiling points. That is why they are all gases under standard conditions, even those with atomic masses larger than many normally solid elements.|$|E
5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> and boiling points of all the elements.|$|R

5|$|Europium is a {{ductile metal}} with a {{hardness}} {{similar to that}} of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has the second <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.|$|R
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} of <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a {{substance}} that had a nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, {{which is one of}} the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud of helium causes heliums chemical inertness (the most extreme of all the elements), and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other (producing the <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> and boiling points of all the elements).|$|R
50|$|Europium is a {{ductile metal}} with a {{hardness}} {{similar to that}} of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has the second <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{problems}} with chenille yarns is that the tufts can work loose and create bare fabric. This was resolved by using a <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> nylon in the core of the yarn and then autoclaving (steaming) the hanks of yarn to set the pile in place.|$|R
5|$|Indium wire {{is used as}} {{a vacuum}} seal and a thermal {{conductor}} in cryogenics and ultra-high-vacuum applications, in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps. Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5000|$|Melt flow index: a value roughly {{inversely}} proportional to the molecular weight of the base polymer. High melt flow index adhesives are easy to apply but have poor mechanical properties due to shorter polymer chains. <b>Low</b> <b>melt</b> flow index adhesives have better properties but {{are more difficult to}} apply.|$|R
25|$|Gschneider and Daane (1988) {{attribute}} {{the trend in}} melting point which increases across the series, (lanthanum (920°C) – lutetium (1622°C)) {{to the extent of}} hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f orbitals. The hybridisation is believed to be at its greatest for cerium, which has the <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> point of all, 795°C.|$|R
5|$|An alloy {{of sodium}} and potassium, NaK is a liquid {{used as a}} heat-transfer medium and a {{desiccant}} for producing dry and air-free solvents. It {{can also be used}} in reactive distillation. The ternary alloy of 12% Na, 47% K and 41% Cs has the <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> point of −78°C of any metallic compound.|$|R
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|Lithium fluoride, when {{highly enriched}} in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic {{constituent}} of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF2 mixtures have <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> points. In addition, 7Li, Be, and F {{are among the}} few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.Be and 19F respectively. These two, together with 7Li, as well as 2H, 11B, 15N, 209Bi, and the stable isotopes of C, and O, are the only nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross sections aside from actinides to serve as major constituents of a molten salt breeder reactor fuel.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, {{plus the}} noble gases are collectively {{referred}} to as the elemental gases. These elements are gaseous at standard temperature and pressure (STP). They are also distinguished by having the <b>lowest</b> densities, <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> and boiling points, strongest insulating properties, and highest electronegativity and ionization energy values in the periodic table.|$|R
5|$|Lithium metal is soft {{enough to}} be cut with a knife. When cut, it {{possesses}} a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray as it oxidizes to lithium oxide. While it {{has one of the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>melting</b> points among all metals (180°C), it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals.|$|R
