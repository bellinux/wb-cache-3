40|$|Calabar, {{the capital}} city of Cross River State is located on a fan shaped {{alluvial}} formation of the Niger delta region, south-south of Nigeria. It is characterized by fast growth in population, economic activities and urbanization, like most coastal cities of the world. The challenges of climate change, rapid land use changes and the fragile geomorphic state of the city were investigated to determine the spatial flooding situation and degree of susceptibility. Geographic Information system was deployed; consequently, sea level rise, increased annual precipitation, and change from pervious vegetated surfaces to impervious concrete surfaces, availability and non-availability of drainage infrastructures were captured and integrated into a common geo-referenced framework (Model). The identified flooding indicator/factors were represented as thematic layers and subsequently simulated to generate flooding susceptibility map. The apparent increase in natural water supply through the swelling ocean, increase in precipitation, expansion of impervious concrete surfaces, about 20 % of the city where drainage and waste disposal infrastructures are available and residential structures are well planned, minimal or no flooding is experienced. Floodplains were found to be highly <b>liable</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E

There was at all material times, a substantial emission of dust from the factory premises," [...] and that [...] "There was knowledge, sufficient to found reasonable foresight {{on the part of}} the Defendants, that children were particularly vulnerable to personal injury arising out of inhalation of asbestos dust... Reasonably practicable steps were not taken to reduce or prevent inhalation of emitted asbestos dust." [...] Regarding the conduct of the case, Mr Justice Holland accused T of trying to obstruct the legal action and to wear Mrs. Hancock and Mrs. Margereson down [...] "by attrition". He said they had shown [...] "a wish to contest these claims by any means possible, legitimate or otherwise" [...] and that their lawyers had [...] "remorselessly persisted in taking bad points, apparently simply to obstruct the plaintiffs' road." [...] In a press statement, T repeated their claim that they couldn't have known [...] "so many years ago of the risks to individuals such as these plaintiffs" [...] and said they believed [...] "the judge was wrong to find <b>T</b> <b>liable</b> in these cases. The factory closed almost 40 years ago." ...|$|R
