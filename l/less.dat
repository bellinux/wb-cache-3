50|$|It was {{possibly}} Gumperz who introduced Mendelssohn to Gotthold Ephraim <b>Lessing</b> in 1754, who {{became one of}} his greatest friends. The story goes {{that the first time}} Mendelssohn met <b>Lessing,</b> they played chess; therefore, in Lessing's play Nathan the Wise Nathan and the character Saladin first meet during a game of chess. <b>Lessing</b> had recently produced the drama Die Juden, whose moral was that a Jew can possess nobility of character. This notion was, in the contemporary Berlin of Frederick the Great, generally ridiculed as untrue. <b>Lessing</b> found in Mendelssohn the realization of his dream. Within a few months, the two became closely intellectually allied. <b>Lessing</b> also brought Mendelssohn to public attention for the first time: Mendelssohn had written an essay attacking Germans' neglect of their native philosophers (principally Gottfried Leibniz), and lent the manuscript to <b>Lessing.</b> Without consulting the author, <b>Lessing</b> published Mendelssohn's Philosophical Conversations (Philosophische Gespräche) anonymously in 1755. In the same year there appeared in Danzig (Gdańsk) an anonymous satire, Pope a Metaphysician (Pope ein Metaphysiker), {{which turned out to be}} the joint work of <b>Lessing</b> and Mendelssohn.|$|R

5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show <b>less</b> attention to social stimuli, smile {{and look at}} others <b>less</b> often, and respond <b>less</b> to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have <b>less</b> eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are <b>less</b> likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately <b>less</b> attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or <b>less</b> severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
