50|$|One unique {{property}} of dendrimers such as PAMAM {{is the high}} density of surface functional groups, which allow many alterations {{to be made to}} the surface of each dendrimer molecule. In putative PAMAM dendrimers, the surface is rife with primary amines, with higher generations expressing exponentially greater densities of amino groups. Although the potential to attach many things to each dendrimer is one of their greatest advantages, the presence of highly localized positive charges can be toxic to cells. Surface modification via attachment of acetyl and <b>lauroyl</b> groups help mask these positive charges, attenuating cytotoxicity and increasing permeability to cells. Thus, these types of modifications are especially beneficial for biological applications. Secondary and tertiary amino surface groups are also found to be less toxic than primary amino surface groups, suggesting it is charge shielding which has major bearing on cytotoxicity and not some secondary effect from a particular functional group. Furthermore, other studies point to a delicate balance in charge which must be achieved to obtain minimal cytotoxicity. Hydrophobic interactions can also cause cell lysis, and PAMAM dendrimers whose surfaces are saturated with nonpolar modifications such as lipids or polyethylene glycol (PEG) suffer from higher cytotoxicity than their partially substituted analogues. PAMAM dendrimers with nonpolar internal components have also been shown to induce hemolysis.|$|E

Vesicles, were made up of the cationic lipid DOTAP (1, 2 -Dioleoyl- 3 -Trimethylammonium-Propane), the zwitterionic lipid DOPE (1, 2 -Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero- 3 -Phosphoethanolamine), and the novel amphiphile <b>Lauroyl</b> Uridine. The influence of the non-ionic nucleolipid on essential liposomes properties, such as the structure and net charge was first investigated by a comparative analysis performed on the different lipoplex preparations by means of -potential and size measurements. Both structure and net charge of liposomes were shown to be not modified by the presence of the non-ionic nucleolipid. The role of the synthetic lipid inserted as anchor in the liposome bilayer in the condensation process between vesicles and the polynucleotide poly-A was then analyzed by UV–vis, Circular Dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The data presented comparative UV–vis analyses that evidenced the occurrence of staking interactions in the poly-A only in LU containing lipoplexes. CD and NMR studies indicated the presence of H-bonding interaction between <b>Lauroyl</b> Uridine containing vesicles and the polynucleotide poly-A. The results presented in this work support a role for <b>Lauroyl</b> Uridine in A-U molecular recognition, thus, suggesting that cationic liposomes doped with the non-ionic nucleolipid <b>Lauroyl</b> Uridine could represent a model system to study molecular interactions among single stranded polynucleotides and lipid anchor bearing the complementary bases...|$|E

In the presence of <b>lauroyl</b> CoA, only the microsomes from palm, but not those from maize or rapeseed, synthesized di- and tri-acyl lipids. This lack of reactivity of <b>lauroyl</b> CoA was also observed in the microsomes from maturing castor bean, peanut, and soybean. In maize seed and rapeseed, but not palm seed, the kinetics of labeling suggest that <b>lauroyl</b> and erucoyl moieties of the acyl CoAs were incorporated into lysophosphatidic acid but failed to enter into phosphatidic acid and thus the subsequent lipid products.

Removal of N-acetylglucosamine from the esterified and the nonesterified group A PS by enzyme action resulted in a significant loss of serological activity of both antigens.
