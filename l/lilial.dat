40|$|The {{incidence}} of female {{breast cancer is}} rising globally at unprecedented rates with a near doubling in many countries. Oestrogen is a main risk factor and many environmental chemicals {{have been shown to}} possess oestrogenic activity (xenoestrogens) and to enter the human breast from exposure through diet, the domestic environment or personal care products. The aims of this project were to investigate whether xenoestrogens also possess genotoxic activity. The compounds studied were three cyclosiloxanes (D 3, D 4, and D 5), butylphenylmethylpropional (<b>Lilial),</b> triclosan and aluminium salts which are used extensively in personal care products, and bisphenol-A which is used widely in the manufacture of plastics. Genotoxicity was assessed from their ability to enable growth in suspension culture, to damage DNA in a comet assay and to interfere with cellular DNA repair systems in two immortalised non-transformed human breast epithelial cell lines (MCF 10 A and MCF 10 F). The ability of non-transformed epithelial cells to grow in suspension culture is an established marker of transformation. All these compounds enabled growth of MCF 10 A and MCF 10 F cells in suspension with maximal effects observed at 10 - 10 M D 3, 10 - 5 M D 4, 10 - 5 M D 5, 10 - 5 M bisphenol A, 10 - 7 M triclosan and 10 - 5 M butylphenylmethylpropional (<b>Lilial).</b> The comet assay showed DNA damage after 1 hour exposure to 17 β-oestradiol in both cell lines as well as to 10 - 5 M D 3, 10 - 5 M D 4 or 10 - 5 M butylphenylmethylpropional (<b>Lilial).</b> Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was used to detect effects of these chemicals on mRNA levels in MCF- 10 A and MCF- 10 F cells for 14 key DNA repair proteins (BRCA 1, BRCA 2, ATM, ATR, BRIP 1, CHK 1, CHK 2, p 53, PALB 2, PARP 1, PTEN, Rad 50, Rad 51 and STK 111). Increases in mRNA for BRCA 1 were detected after both short-term (1 week) and long-term (30 weeks) exposure to 10 - 5 M D 3 and 10 - 5 M D 4, 10 - 5 M D 5 gave an increase only after shortterm exposure (1 week). Decreases in BRCA 2 mRNA were found after both short-term (1 week) and long-term (30 weeks) exposure to 10 - 5 M D 3 and 10 - 7 M triclosan: long-term exposure (30 weeks) resulted in increases after exposure to 10 - 5 M D 5, 10 - 5 M bisphenol A and 10 - 5 M butylphenylmethylpropional (<b>Lilial).</b> Western immunoblotting showed that BRCA 1 protein was reduced in line with the mRNA results, demonstrating that in this case transcription and translation followed the same pattern. A shorter study using long–term exposure (20 weeks) to aluminium based antiperspirant salts at 10 - 4 M concentrations showed reduced expression also of BRCA 1 mRNA and BRCA 1 protein together with reduced expression of other mRNAs. In summary, all these compounds showed genotoxic activity in MCF 10 A and MCF 10 F cells and points to the potential for reduction in exposure as a strategy for breast cancer preventio...|$|E

Depending on the type of odorants applied, the induced phosphorylation is completely blocked by specific inhibitors of either protein kinase A or protein kinase C. Time-course experiments indicate that the odor-induced modification of ciliary proteins is transient; the intensity of labeling decayed over time (1 - 10 sec). Separation of ciliary proteins by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography demonstrated that upon stimulation with <b>lilial,</b> a single polypeptide (50, 000 Da) was phosphorylated; the size of the modified protein is in line with the hypothesis that odorant receptors are phosphorylated subsequent to activation by specific odors...|$|E

Based on gel chromatography and CD spectroscopy analysis the recombinant OBP subtypes seem to share several structural features {{with other members of}} the lipocalin family. Approaches to elucidate whether heterologous expressed OBPs interact with odorous compounds revealed that OBP 1 specifically binds 2 -[H- 3]-isobutyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine whereas OBP 2 did not shown any specific binding to this compound. In contrast, the chromophore 1 -anilinonaphthalene 8 -sulfonic acid (1, 8 -ANS) specifically interacted with OBP 2 but not with OBP 1.

Volatile analysis revealed that rhizobacterial colonization suppressed the emission of the terpene (E) -a-bergamotene and the aromatics methyl salicylate and <b>lilial</b> in response to caterpillar feeding. Rhizobacterial colonization decreased the caterpillar-induced transcription of the terpene synthase genes TPS 03 and TPS 04.

40|$|In natural {{conditions}} cereals can be infested by pathogenic fungi. These {{can reduce the}} grain yield and quality by contamination with mycotoxins which are harmful for plants, animals and humans. To date, performed studies of the compounds profile have allowed for the distinction of individual species of fungi. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the profile of volatile compounds and trichothecenes of group B, ergosterol, adenosine triphosphate content carried out on a representative sample of 16 genotypes of related cereals: triticale, bread wheat and durum wheat. Based on an analysis of volatile compounds by means of gas chromatography mass spectrometry and with the use of an electronic nose, volatile profiles for cereals were determined. Differentiation is presented at four levels through discriminant analysis, heatmaps, principal component analysis (PCA) and electronic nose maps. The statistical model was built by subsequent incorporation of chemical groups such as trichothecenes (GC/MS), fungal biomass indicators (ergosterol (HPLC) and ATP (luminometric) and volatiles. The results of the discriminatory analyses showed that the volatile metabolites most markedly differentiated grain samples, among which were mainly: <b>lilial,</b> trichodiene, p-xylene. Electronic nose analysis made it possible to completely separate all the analyzed cereals based only on 100 ions from the 50 - 150 m/z range. The research carried out using chemometric analysis indicated significant differences in the volatile metabolites present in the grain of bread wheat, durum wheat and triticale. The end result of the performed analyses was a complete discrimination of the examined cereals based on the metabolites present in their grain...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that vertebrate olfactory signal transduction is mediated by independent multiple pathways (using cAMP and InsP 3 as second messengers). However, the dual presence of parallel pathways in the olfactory receptor cell is still controversial, {{mainly because of the}} lack of information regarding the single-cell response induced by odorants that have been shown to produce InsP 3 exclusively (but not cAMP) in the olfactory cilia. In this study, we recorded activities of transduction channels of single olfactory receptor cells to InsP 3 -producing odorants. When the membrane potential was held at − 54 mV, application of InsP 3 -producing odorants to the ciliary region caused an inward current. The reversal potential was 0 ± 7 mV (mean ± SD, n = 10). Actually, InsP 3 -producing odorants generated responses in a smaller fraction of cells (<b>lilial,</b> 3. 4 %; lyral, 1. 7 %) than the cAMP-producing odorant (cineole, 26 %). But, fundamental properties of responses were surprisingly homologous; namely, spatial distribution of the sensitivity, waveforms, I-V relation, and reversal potential, dose dependence, time integration of stimulus period, adaptation, and recovery. By applying both types of odorants alternatively to the same cell, furthermore, we observed cells to exhibit symmetrical cross-adaptation. It seems likely that even with odorants with different modalities adaptation occurs completely depending on the amount of current flow. The data will also provide evidence showing that olfactory response generation and adaptation are regulated by a uniform mechanism for a wide variety of odorants...|$|E
40|$|Although {{understanding}} of the olfactory system has progressed {{at the level of}} downstream receptor signaling and the wiring of olfactory neurons, the system remains poorly understood at the molecular level of the receptors and their interaction with and recognition of odorant ligands. The structure and functional mechanisms of these receptors still remain a tantalizing enigma, because numerous previous attempts at the large-scale production of functional olfactory receptors (ORs) have not been successful to date. To investigate the elusive biochemistry and molecular mechanisms of olfaction, we have developed a mammalian expression system for the large-scale production and purification of a functional OR protein in milligram quantities. Here, we report the study of human OR 17 - 4 (hOR 17 - 4) purified from a HEK 293 S tetracycline-inducible system. Scale-up of production yield was achieved through suspension culture in a bioreactor, which enabled the preparation of > 10 mg of monomeric hOR 17 - 4 receptor after immunoaffinity and size exclusion chromatography, with expression yields reaching 3 mg/L of culture medium. Several key post-translational modifications were identified using MS, and CD spectroscopy showed the receptor to be ≈ 50 % α-helix, similar to other recently determined G protein-coupled receptor structures. Detergent-solubilized hOR 17 - 4 specifically bound its known activating odorants <b>lilial</b> and floralozone in vitro, as measured by surface plasmon resonance. The hOR 17 - 4 also recognized specific odorants in heterologous cells as determined by calcium ion mobilization. Our system is feasible for the production of large quantities of OR necessary for structural and functional analyses and research into OR biosensor devices. ROHM Corporation, Kyoto, Japa...|$|E
40|$|Benzyl salicylate, benzyl {{benzoate}} and butylphenylmethylpropional (<b>Lilial)</b> {{are added to}} bodycare cosmetics used around the human breast. We report here that all three compounds possess oestrogenic activity in assays using the oestrogen-responsive MCF 7 human breast cancer cell line. At 3 000 000 -fold molar excess, {{they were able to}} partially displace [H- 3]oestradiol from recombinant human oestrogen receptors ER alpha and ER beta, and from cytosolic ER of MCF 7 cells. At concentrations in the range of 5 x 10 (- 5) to 5 x 10 (- 4) M, they were able to increase the expression of a stably integrated oestrogen-responsive reporter gene (ERE-CAT) and of the endogenous oestrogen-responsive pS 2 gene in MCF 7 cells, albeit to a lesser extent than with 10 (- 8) M 17 beta-oestradiol. They increased the proliferation of oestrogen-dependent MCF 7 cells over 7 days, which could be inhibited by the antioestrogen fulvestrant, suggesting an ER-mediated mechanism. Although the extent of stimulation of proliferation over 7 days was lower with these compounds than with 10 (- 8) M 17 beta-oestradiol, given a longer time period of 35 days the extent of proliferation with 10 (- 4) M benzyl salicylate, {{benzyl benzoate}} or butylphenylmethylpropional increased to the same magnitude as observed with 10 (- 8) M 17 beta-oestradiol over 14 days. This demonstrates that benzyl salicylate, benzyl benzoate and butylphenylmethylpropional are further chemical components of cosmetic products which give oestrogenic responses in a human breast cancer cell line in culture. Further research is now needed to investigate whether oestrogenic responses are detectable using in vivo models {{and the extent to which}} these compounds might be absorbed through human skin and might enter human breast tissues.

40|$|Fungi {{naturally}} {{present in}} olive trees were isolated, identified and tested for their {{potential to be}} used as biological agents against C. acutatum, the causal agent of anthracnose, {{one of the most important}} olive diseases. Antagonistic activity and effect of their secondary metabolites was evaluated through dual culture growth, agar-diffusion and volatile tests. A total of 14 isolates were identified from olive leaves, 12 belonged to genera Alternaria, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Aspergillus, Anthinium, Chaetomium, Diaporthe, Nigrospora, 1 to family Xylariaceae and 1 was unclassified. The most frequent isolates, composing half of the isolates identified, belonged to genera Alternaria, Fusarium or to species Epicoccum nigrum. All fungal isolates, when grown in dual culture, showed some inhibitory action over the growth of C. acutatum. Maximum inhibition was observed with A. niger (86. 3 %), N. oryzae (66. 7 %) and the unclassified endophyte (68. 6 %). Volatiles tests showed that all fungal isolates produced volatiles that caused similar inhibition rates of C. acutatum growth. Significant differences on C. acutatum growth inhibition were obtained when agar diffusible tests were performed, where only 5 fungal isolates caused C. acutatum growth inhibition: Alternaria sp. isolate 2 (26. 8 %), the fungus from Xylariaceae family (14. 3 %), Alternaria sp. isolate 1 (10. 7 %); Diaporthe sp. (10. 7 %), Nigrospora oryzae (3. 5 %). Volatile substances produced by these different isolates were identified through gas chromatography techniques, as phenylethyl alcohol, 4 -methylquinazoline, benzothiazole, benzyl alcohol, <b>lilial,</b> galaxolide, among others. These inhibitory volatiles could play a significant role in reduction of C. acutatum expansion in olive and their study as potential biocontrol agents should be further explored. This would be of great interest to meet one of the main concerns of public health that is the excess of chemical fungicides on crop plants.

40|$|SUMMARY Plants {{as primary}} {{producers}} in terrestrial ecosystems are under constant threat from {{a multitude of}} attackers, which include insect herbivores. In addition to interactions with detrimental organisms, plants host a diversity of beneficial organisms, which include microbes in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, the interactions between plants and several groups of root-associated microbes such as mycorrhizae, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF) can affect plant interactions with foliar insect herbivores. The beneficial root-associated microbes are able to modify plant physiology by promoting plant growth and induced systemic resistance (ISR), in which the balance between both effects will determine the final impact on the insect herbivores. Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col- 0, this thesis explores the molecular mechanisms on how plants integrate responses when simultaneously interacting with the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the generalist and the specialist leaf-chewing insects Mamestra brassicae and Pieris brassicae respectively. A literature review on the state-of-the-art {{in the field of}} microbe-plant-insect interactions (Chapter 2) explores how root-associated microbes and insect folivores can influence each other via a shared host plant. For more than a decade, both ecological and mechanistic studies mostly focused on exploring these belowground and aboveground interactions using single microbe and single herbivore species. The importance of increasing the complexity of the study system {{in order to understand the}} interactions in more natural situations is being emphasized. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of plant hormones in regulating plant growth and defense against folivores, while simultaneously being involved in associations with root-associated microbes.   Experimental evidence has shown patterns on the effects of mycorrhizal colonization on plant interactions with insect herbivores, and raises the question whether plant colonization by different groups of root-associated microbes has similar effects on particular categories of insect herbivores. In Chapter 3, plant-mediated effects of a non-pathogenic rhizobacterium on the performance of leaf-chewing insects, and the underlying mechanisms modulating the interactions, have been examined. Colonization of A. thaliana Col- 0 roots by the bacterium P. fluorescens strain WCS 417 r resulted in decreased larval weight of the generalist leaf-chewing M. brassicae, and had no effect on larval weight of the specialist leaf-chewing P. brassicae. The crucial role of jasmonic acid (JA) in regulating rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) against M. brassicae is confirmed by including plant mutants in the study. Interestingly, I also observed that rhizobacteria can induce systemic susceptibility to M. brassicae caterpillars. Comparison of M. brassicae performance and gene transcription in A. thaliana plants, grown in potting soil or a mixture of potting soil and sand in a 1 : 1 ratio, shows that in a mixture of potting soil and sand, rhizobacterial treatment had a consistently negative effect on M. brassicae, whereas the effect is more variable in potting soil. Rhizobacterial treatment primed plants grown in potting soil and sand for stronger expression of JA- and ethylene-regulated genes PDF 1. 2 and HEL, supporting stronger resistance to M. brassicae. Taken together, the results show that soil composition can be one of the factors modulating the outcome of microbe-plant-insect interactions. Chapter 4 further addresses the mechanisms underlying rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against the generalist leaf-chewing M. brassicae by integrating plant gene transcription, chemistry and performance of M. brassicae in wild type A. thaliana Col- 0 plants and mutants defective in the JA-pathway, i. e. dde 2 - 2 and myc 2, in the ET pathway, i. e. ein 2 - 1, and in the JA-/ET-pathway, i. e. ora 59. Results of this study show that rhizobacterial colonization alone or in combination with herbivore infestation induced the expression of the defense-associated genes ORA 59 and PDF 1. 2 at higher levels than activation by herbivore feeding alone, and the expression of both genes is suppressed in the knock-out mutant ora 59. Interestingly, the colonization of plant roots by rhizobacteria alters the levels of plant defense compounds, i. e. camalexin and glucosinolates (GLS), by enhancing the synthesis of constitutive and induced levels of camalexin and aliphatic GLS while suppressing the induced levels of indole GLS. The changes are associated with modulation of the JA-/ET-signaling pathways as shown by investigating mutants. Furthermore, the herbivore performance results show that functional JA- and ET-signaling pathways are required for rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against leaf-chewing insects as observed in the knock-out mutants dde 2 - 2 and ein 2 - 1. The results indicate that colonization of plant roots by rhizobacteria modulates plant-insect interactions by prioritizing the ORA 59 -branch over the MYC 2 -branch, although the transcription factor ORA 59 is not the only one responsible for the observed effects of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against leaf-chewing insects. Taking a step further in increasing the complexity of the study system, Chapter 5 investigates how co-cultivation of P. fluorescens strains WCS 417 r and SS 101 affects direct plant defense to the caterpillar M. brassicae. Inoculation of either P. fluorescens WCS 417 r or SS 101 singly at root tips or simultaneously at two different positions along the roots resulted in a similar level of rhizobacterial colonization by each strain, whereas co-cultivation of both strains at either the root tips or at two different positions along the roots resulted in a higher colonization level of strain WCS 417 r compared to colonization by SS 101. The results suggest that the site of inoculation influences the direct interactions between the two strains in the rhizosphere, as also confirmed by in vitro antagonism assays in the absence of plants. Both upon single inoculation and co-cultivation of both strains at the same or different sites along the roots, the two rhizobacterial strains induced the same strength of ISR against the caterpillar M. brassicae and the same degree of plant growth promotion. In the roots, colonization by the two strains as single or mixed culture resulted in a similar gene expression pattern of up-regulation of MYC 2, down-regulation of WRKY 70 and no effect on NPR 1 expression, genes representing JA-signaling, SA-signaling and the node of crosstalk between the two pathways, respectively. We hypothesize that both rhizobacterial strains use negative crosstalk between JA- and SA-pathways as mechanism to suppress plant immunity and establish colonization. This study shows that competitive interactions between rhizobacterial strains known to induce plant defense in systemic tissue via different signaling pathways, may interfere with synergistic effects on ISR and plant growth promotion.   While the effect of root-associated microbes on direct plant defense against insect herbivores has been studied previously, the effect of these microbes on indirect plant defense to herbivores is much less known. Chapter 6 explores how colonization by the rhizobacterium P. fluorescens strain WCS 417 r affects indirect plant defense against the generalist herbivore M. brassicae by combining behavioral, chemical and gene transcriptional approaches. The results show that rhizobacterial colonization of A. thaliana roots results in an increased attraction of the parasitoid Microplitis mediator to caterpillar-infested plants. Volatile analysis revealed that rhizobacterial colonization suppressed emission of the terpene (E) -α-bergamotene, and the aromatics methyl salicylate and <b>lilial</b> in response to caterpillar feeding. Rhizobacterial colonization decreased the caterpillar-induced transcription of the terpene synthase genes TPS 03 and TPS 04. Rhizobacteria enhanced both growth and indirect defense of plants under caterpillar attack. This study shows that rhizobacteria have a high potential to enhance the biocontrol of leaf-chewing herbivores based on enhanced attraction of parasitoids. Taken together, the research presented in this thesis has shown how single or combined applications of rhizobacteria affect interactions of plants with leaf-chewing insects in terms of direct and indirect resistance. Furthermore, results presented in this thesis have revealed some of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-mediated interactions between rhizobacteria and leaf-chewing insects that can be used in developing practical approaches by applying beneficial root-associated microbes for improving plant resistance.    ...|$|E
