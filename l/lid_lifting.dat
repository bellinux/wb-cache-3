40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether a commercial dry transfer system (DTS) could be used for loading or unloading used nuclear fuel (UNF) in L-Basin and to determine if a DTS pool adapter could be made for L-Basin Transfer Pit # 2 that could accommodate a variety of DTS casks and fuel baskets or canisters up to 24 ” diameter. [1, 2] This study outlines the technical feasibility of accommodating different vendor dry transfer systems in the L-Basin Transfer Bay with a general work scope. It identifies equipment needing development, facility modifications, and describes the needed analyses and calculations. After reviewing the L-Basin Transfer Bay area layout and information on the only DTS system currently in use for the Nuclear Assurance Corporation Legal Weight Truck cask (NAC LWT), the authors conclude that use of a dry transfer cask is feasible. AREVA was contacted and acknowledged that they currently do not have a design for a dry transfer cask for their new Transnuclear Long Cask (TN-LC) cask. Nonetheless, this study accounted for a potential future DTS from AREVA to handle fuel baskets up to 18 ” in diameter. Due to the layout of the Transfer Bay, it was determined that a DTS cask pool adapter designed specifically for spanning Pit # 2 and placed just north of the 70 Ton Cask <b>lid</b> <b>lifting</b> superstructure would be needed. The proposed pool adapter could be used to transition a fuel basket up to 24 ” in diameter and ~ 11 feet long from a dry transfer cask to the basin. The 18 ” and 24 ” applications of the pool adapter are pending vendor development of dry transfer casks that accommodate these diameters. Once a fuel basket has been lowered into Pit # 2 through a pool adapter, a basket cart could be used to move the basket out from under the pool adapter for access by the 5 Ton Crane. The cost to install a dry transfer cask handling system in L-Area capable of handling multiple vendor provided transport and dry transfer casks and baskets with different diameters and lengths would likely be on the same order of magnitude as the Basin Modifications project. The cost of a DTS capability is affected by the number of design variations of different vendor transport and dry transfer casks to be considered for design input. Some costs would be incurred for each vendor DTS to be handled. For example, separate analyses would be needed for each dry transfer cask type such as criticality, shielding, dropping a dry transfer cask and basket, handling and auxiliary equipment, procedures, operator training, readiness assessments, and operational readiness reviews. A DTS handling capability in L-Area could serve as a backup to the Shielded Transfer System (STS) for unloading long casks and could support potential future missions such as the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Exchange or transferring UNF from wet to dry storage...|$|E

50|$|The Garden Egg {{chair was}} {{designed}} by Peter Ghyczy in 1968. It was manufactured by Reuter Products. The chair was designed for both indoor and outdoor use, although as a design icon and collectable it is rarely used outdoors. The chair <b>lid</b> <b>lifts</b> and closes, and when closed is theoretically waterproof. The Egg chair was re-introduced in 2001 by Ghyczy Novo. The Garden Egg Chair is known by several names; “seftenberger ei, pod chair, l’œuf en garden(egg)chair.” Elastogran/Reuter produced the plastic polyurethane. Ghyczy's job was to start a design centre {{in order to show}} industrial customers polyurethane's potential. The Garden Egg Chair {{is one of the first}} chairs made with polyurethane. For a long time, the chair was produced by the East German company VEB-Synthese-Werk, but since 1998, it has been produced in the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|Pot pourri à vaisseau or pot pourri en navire ("{{pot-pourri}} holder as a vessel/ship") is a {{shape of}} a number of pot-pourri vases in the shape of masted ships, first produced between the late 1750s to the early 1760s by the Sèvres manufactory near Paris. The colours and details of the painted decoration vary between examples, as is typical of Sèvres porcelain, and some examples have been placed on later bases of ormolu. The openwork <b>lid</b> <b>lifts</b> off to allow refilling of the pot-pourri. The shape was eventually produced in two or three versions, at slightly different sizes. It was first designed in 1757, probably by Jean-Claude Duplessis (c. 1695-1774), the artistic director of the factory. The first surviving finished example dates to 1759. [...] Another name for them is vaisseau à mat (masted ship).|$|R

5000|$|... − In 1964, the Cascade-Spring Glen Community Club {{requested}} that the King County Library System (KCLS) start a library in their club-owned building at 11635 SE 170th Place. A lease was signed in November and the Vista Library was born. It was furnshed with an establishment grant from the Washington State Library and the collection was supplied by KCLS. KCLS purchased the Vista Library building in 1967 and the Cascade-Spring Glen Community Club donated $10,000 for remodeling costs. The remodeling began in February 1969 and was completed in April. The Vista Library reopened the remodeled 1,440-square-foot facility on May 19, 1969, complete with new landscaping donated by the Carriage Lane Garden Club. As {{a result of a}} <b>lid</b> <b>lift</b> approval in March 1980, planning for construction of a new Fairwood Library and three other KCLS buildings began. The residents of Fairwood had been so excited about the prospect of a new library that they organized a committee and helped distribute 10,000 copies of a flyer urging residents to vote “yes” on the library proposition. After the <b>lid</b> <b>lift</b> was passed, Mithun Architects was chosen to design the new Fairwood Library on 140th Avenue SE, across from the entrance to the Fairwood Golf Course. The Fairwood/Vista Library Friends generated an enormous amount of community support for the new building, including a special book fair with local authors and other special events. The new 15,000-square-foot library, with a capacity of 90,000 items, opened its door on January 21, 1986. Later that year, on October 4, 1986, an oil painting of Mount Rainier by Byron Birdsall entitled “Sentinel” was installed in honor of Harold O. Sternberg, a KCLS’ construction coordinator who was instrumental {{in the development of the}} Fairwood Library. In 1987, the Fairwood Library won an American Institute of Architects (AIA)/American Library Association (ALA) Award of Excellence for its design.The library was renovated in 2013/2014, increasing the floor area by 1/3.|$|R

He was given instructions and obeyed with caressing irony Mrs. Forsyth's order to pull out Tata's trunk first, and she found the key in a large tangle of keys, and opened it, and had the joy of seeing everything recognized by the owner: doll by doll, cook-stove, tin dishes, small brooms, wooden animals on feet and wheels, birds of various plumage, a toy piano, a dust-pan, alphabet blocks, dog's-eared linen Mother Goose books, and the rest. Tata had been allowed to put the things away herself, and she took them out with no apparent sense of the time passed since she saw them last. In the changing life of her parents all times and places were alike to her. She began to play with the things in the storage corridor as if it were yesterday when she saw them last in the flat. Her mother and father left her to them in the distraction of their own trunks.

The reactor chamber's 2000-ton <b>lid</b> was <b>lifted</b> by the steam explosion. Since the reactor was not designed with a containment building capable of containing this catastrophic explosion, the accident released large amounts of radioactive material into the environment.
