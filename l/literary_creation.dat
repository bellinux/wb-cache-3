5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free <b>literary</b> <b>creation</b> or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

In his youth Yu had been critical of Communist ideology. But his first works, with their portrait of decline and cruelty brought on by bourgeois society, were admitting of a Marxist interpretation. Thus they became very popular in 1960s Chinese society, when the ideology of Mao Zedong demanded that all <b>literary</b> <b>creation</b> serve the Communist cause.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} lyric genres, Galicia {{developed}} also a minor tradition on literary prose, {{most notably in}} translation of European popular series, as those dealing with king Arthur written by Chretien de Troyes, or those based on the war of Troy, usually paid and commissioned by noblemen who desired to read those romances in their own language. Other genres include history books (either translation of Spanish ones, or original creations like the Chronicle of St. Mary of Iria, by Rui Vasques), religious books, legal studies, and a treaty on horse breeding. Prose <b>literary</b> <b>creation</b> in Galician had stopped by the 16th century, when printing press became popular; the first complete translation of the Bible was not printed until the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|A common view {{in modern}} {{scholarship}} {{is that the}} account in the synoptic gospels is a <b>literary</b> <b>creation</b> of the gospel writers, intended to heighten the importance of {{what they saw as}} a theologically significant event. Burton Mack describes it as a fabrication by the author of the Gospel of Mark, while G. B. Caird and Joseph Fitzmyer conclude that the author did not intend the description to be taken literally. W.

40|$|This article aims to {{establish}} a paradigm shift in the way Shona traditional culture perceives death and funeral proceedings and in the manner that <b>literary</b> <b>creations</b> that were published before Zimbabwe attained political independence in 1980. perceive the same aspects. The article will also establish {{that there has been}} a paradigm shift in the manner that <b>literary</b> <b>creations</b> which were published before independence and those that were published after independence treat death and funeral proceedings. Thus, the article will establish that Shona culture perceives death and funeral proceedings as painful but not as monstrous and fearsome. Although that is the case in Shona culture, those Zimbabweans of Shona expression who created literature before independence view death and funeral proceedings as both painful and monstrous. However, some <b>literary</b> <b>creations,</b> which were published after independence, treat death and funeral proceedings as neither painful nor fearsome. In fact, there is a tendency by writers of Shona expression who published literary works after independence, to treat death and funeral proceedings as if they are natural and normal occurrences. They at times depict them as if they are lucrative life experiences and proceedings. The article has been written on the understanding that the paradigm shift in the manner death and funeral proceedings are treated in <b>literary</b> <b>creations</b> is indicative of some metamorphosis that Shona culture is undergoing as politico-economic and socio-cultural conditions and circumstances change in relation to the changing eras of Zimbabwe's history...|$|R

500|$|The {{theory of}} {{literature}} as [...] "humanics" [...] (MR: inganhak) developed by Kim Jong-il establishes that literature exists within the human domain. A key theme of humanics {{is the question}} of good and worthy life, allowing for propagandist and moralistic art. The idea of [...] (...) is also prominent in the theory of humanics. Chajusŏng is the metaphysical essence of humans struggling against oppression. Philosophically, it depends on the indeterministic view on free will in Juche. The hero of the story, in particular, embodies Chajusŏng. According to Kim, [...] "humanics literature" [...] gives emphasis to the development of truly independent individuals as called for by the Juche era. This brings about a transformation of the society as a whole. In North Korean literature, Chajusŏng is used as a justification of state control on <b>literary</b> <b>creation</b> and a nationalistic policy of socialism in one country.|$|E
500|$|How {{much of this}} {{narrative}} was Geoffrey's own invention is open to debate. Certainly, Geoffrey seems to have made use {{of the list of}} Arthur's twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, along with the battle of Camlann from the Annales Cambriae and the idea that Arthur was still alive. Arthur's personal status as the king of all Britain would also seem to be borrowed from pre-Galfridian tradition, being found in Culhwch and Olwen, the Triads, and the saints' lives. Finally, Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur's possessions, close family, and companions from the pre-Galfridian Welsh tradition, including Kaius (Cei), Beduerus (Bedwyr), Guenhuuara (Gwenhwyfar), Uther (Uthyr) and perhaps also Caliburnus (Caledfwlch), the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales. However, while names, key events, and titles may have been borrowed, Brynley Roberts has argued that [...] "the Arthurian section is Geoffrey's <b>literary</b> <b>creation</b> and it owes nothing to prior narrative." [...] So, for instance, the Welsh Medraut is made the villainous Modredus by Geoffrey, but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century. There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge this notion that the Historia Regum Britanniae is primarily Geoffrey's own work, with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh's late-12th-century comment that Geoffrey [...] "made up" [...] his narrative, perhaps through an [...] "inordinate love of lying". Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view, believing that Geoffrey's narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus, this figure being the original Arthur, although historians and Celticists have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions.|$|E

The Romanian literary critic George Călinescu drew a direct comparison between Pann and his contemporary, the Wallachian Jewish peddler Cilibi Moise, who, without producing any written works, was made famous by a series of bitter puns in which he referred to himself in the third person (such as [...] "For a few years now, Cilibi Moise has been begging Poverty to leave his house, at the very least {{for as long as it}} takes him to get dressed").|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have seen Perses as a <b>literary</b> <b>creation,</b> a foil for the moralizing that Hesiod develops in Works and Days, {{but there are}} also arguments against that theory. For example, it is quite common for works of moral instruction to have an imaginative setting, as a means of getting the audience's attention, but it could be difficult to see how Hesiod could have travelled around the countryside entertaining people with a narrative about himself if the account was known to be fictitious. Gregory Nagy, on the other hand, sees both Pérsēs ("the destroyer" [...] from , pérthō) and Hēsíodos ("he who emits the voice" [...] from , híēmi and , audḗ) as fictitious names for poetical personae.|$|E
