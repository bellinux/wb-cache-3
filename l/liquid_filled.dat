It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently <b>liquid</b> <b>filled.</b> Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

25|$|Above the SPS, and {{directly}} behind the armour belt, {{was a series of}} compartments, typically used for washrooms or storage spaces, which were designed to allow for upward venting of overpressure from a torpedo hit. This scheme was designed to protect against a 1000lb warhead, and had been tested and found effective in full-scale trials. The SPS was also a key component of the ship's damage control system, as lists resulting from flooding could be corrected by counterflooding empty void spaces, and/or draining normally <b>liquid</b> <b>filled</b> compartments. In the case of the loss of the Prince of Wales these spaces were used for counterflooding to reduce list.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{philosophical}} beliefs, René Descartes {{proposed in}} 1644 that no empty space can exist and that space must consequently {{be filled with}} matter. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with vortices. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to centrifugal force, matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater inertia—so due to {{the pressure of the}} condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed {{into the center of the}} vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, <b>liquid</b> <b>filled</b> vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.|$|E

30|$|Experiment 7, with an inert <b>liquid</b> <b>filling,</b> {{showed a}} higher maximum CO 2 {{concentration}} {{but the same}} downtime as experiment 6, without <b>liquid</b> <b>filling.</b> This {{may be due to}} both a higher concentration of CO 2, caused by the smaller gas volume in the reactor due to the <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> and the higher amount of injected CO 2, caused by the limited setting accuracy of the high-pressure pump. According to Fig.  4, the injected quantity of CO 2 and/or the filling of the reactor with an inert liquid media influenced the mean gas residence time slightly. Mean gas residence time was evaluated by linear interpolation between the measurement points. The mean gas residence time was 42  min for experiment 6 and 45  min for experiment 7.|$|R

2500|$|A {{hydrostatic}} skeleton uses [...] {{hydrostatic pressure}} generated from muscle contraction against a <b>liquid</b> <b>filled</b> cavity. [...] The <b>liquid</b> <b>filled</b> cavity is {{commonly referred to}} as the hydrostatic body. [...] The liquid within the hydrostatic body acts as an incompressible fluid and the body wall of the hydrostatic body provides a passive elastic antagonist to muscle contraction, which in turn generates a force, which in turn creates movement.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>filling</b> in {{microfluidic}} channels is {{a complex}} process that depends {{on a variety of}} geometric, operating, and material parameters such as microchannel geometry, flow velocity∕pressure, liquid surface tension, and contact angle of channel surface. Accurate analysis of the filling process can provide key insights into the filling time, air bubble trapping, and dead zone formation, and help evaluate trade-offs among the various design parameters and lead to optimal chip design. However, efficient modeling of <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> in complex microfluidic networks continues to be a significant challenge. High-fidelity computational methods, such as the volume of fluid method, are prohibitively expensive from a computational standpoint. Analytical models, on the other hand, are primarily applicable to idealized geometries and, hence, are unable to accurately capture chip level behavior of complex microfluidic systems. This paper presents a parametrized dynamic model for the system-level analysis of <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> in three-dimensional (3 D) microfluidic networks. In our approach, a complex microfluidic network is deconstructed into a set of commonly used components, such as reservoirs, microchannels, and junctions. The components are then assembled according to their spatial layout and operating rationale to achieve a rapid system-level model. A dynamic model based on the transient momentum equation is developed to track the liquid front in the microchannels. The principle of mass conservation at the junction is used to link the fluidic parameters in the microchannels emanating from the junction. Assembly of these component models yields a set of differential and algebraic equations, which upon integration provides temporal information of the <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> process, particularly <b>liquid</b> front propagation (i. e., the arrival time). The models are used to simulate the transient <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> process in a variety of microfluidic constructs and in a multiplexer, representing a complex microfluidic network. The accuracy (relative error less than 7 %) and orders-of-magnitude speedup (30 [*] 000 X– 4 [*] 000 [*] 000 X) of our system-level models are verified by comparison against 3 D high-fidelity numerical studies. Our findings clearly establish the utility of our models and simulation methodology for fast, reliable analysis of <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> to guide the design optimization of complex microfluidic networks...|$|R

The shape of the meniscus curvature in the hexagonally-packed spheres is estimated based on surface energy minimization algorithm. The estimated meniscus shape is then imported into a CFD study for numerically predicting the permeability of the packed spheres. Based on the numerical results, the effect of contact angle {{and the number of}} sphere layers are investigated. The results show that the permeability is nearly independent to the contact angle when the contact angle is larger than 10. However, the permeability significantly increases with the contact angle decreases when the contact angle is lower than 10. The permeability quasi-linearly increases as the <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> ratio increases when 1 < l* < 2, where l* is <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> ratio.
