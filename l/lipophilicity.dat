5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and <b>lipophilicity,</b> logp). For example, ionization of any compound {{will increase the}} solubility in water, but decrease the <b>lipophilicity.</b> This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low <b>lipophilicity</b> and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser <b>lipophilicity</b> than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases <b>lipophilicity</b> because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E

30|$|Liposomes are {{colloidal}} {{associations of}} amphiphilic lipids that organize themselves spontaneously in bilayer vesicles {{as a result}} of unfavorable interactions between phospholipids and water. As they have lipophilic and hydrophilic portions, liposomes can entrap substances with varying <b>lipophilicities</b> in the phospholipid bilayer, in the aqueous compartment, or at the bilayer interface [14 – 16] which can modify physicochemical properties and enhance the biological activity of the compounds [17].|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{calculated}} {{values such as}} cLogP or calculated LogD are often used instead of the measured LogP or LogD.LiPE is used to compare compounds of different potencies (pIC50s) and <b>lipophilicities</b> (LogP). High potency (high value of pIC50) is a desirable attribute in drug candidates, as it {{reduces the risk of}} non-specific, off-target pharmacology at a given concentration. When associated with low clearance, high potency also allows for low total dose, which lowers the risk of idiosyncratic drug reaction.|$|R

25|$|After {{the release}} of propranolol, {{relative}} <b>lipophilicity</b> of β-blockers as {{a significant factor in}} their varied and complex pharmacology, became an important factor. It was suspected that propranolol's centrally induced side effects could be due to its high <b>lipophilicity.</b> Thus, it was focused on synthesizing analogues with hydrophilic moieties, favourably placed to see if the side effects would decrease. Selecting para-acylamino groups as the hydrophilic moiety, scientists synthesized a group of para-acylphenoxyethanol and propanolamines, and selected practolol for clinical trials. Practolol had one property not previously seen with β-blockers, it exhibited cardioselectivity (β1 selectivity). Studies from practolol showed that moving the acylamino group to meta or ortho positions, on the benzene ring, caused a loss of selectivity but not loss of the β-blockade itself. This illustrated the significance of para-substitution for β1 selectivity of β-blockers.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a large}} group of benzenesulfonamides containing both a primary and secondary sulfonamide moiety is described. These compounds are powerful inhibitors of several isozymes of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Separate QSAR's are given for inhibition of three of these isozymes, using descriptors mainly derived from molecular orbital calculations by the semiempirical AM 1 method. Activity was found to depend on electrostatic potential-based charges on the atoms of both sulfonamide groups, HOMO and LUMO energies, dipole moments, and <b>lipophilicities.</b> These results are compared with those from other studies...|$|R

Lipophilic pyridinium ions are known to accumulate in mitochondria and this paper describes a general route for the preparation of nitrone-containing N-arylpyridinium salts having a range of <b>lipophilicities,</b> as potential therapeutic antioxidants. The compatibility of nitrones with the Zincke reaction is the key to their synthesis. Their trapping of carbon-centred radicals and the EPR spectra of the resulting nitroxides are reported...|$|R
25|$|Fentanyl {{provides}} some of the effects typical of other opioids through its agonism of the opioid receptors. Its strong potency in relation to that of morphine is largely due to its high <b>lipophilicity,</b> per the Meyer-Overton correlation.

25|$|Alkyl {{substitution}} {{at position}} 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as ethyl (C2H5) or chloromethyl (CH2Cl). These groups {{are able to}} react with the DNA {{in the presence of}} topo I which leads to more tumor activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased <b>lipophilicity</b> and consequently greater potency and stability in human plasma.|$|E
25|$|Sulbutiamine (brand name: Arcalion) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the blood–brain barrier {{more readily than}} thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan {{in an effort to}} develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the <b>lipophilicity</b> of thiamine would result in better pharmacokinetic properties.|$|E

Activity was found to depend on electrostatic potential-based charges on the atoms of sulfonamide groups, dipole moments and <b>lipophilicities.</b> The conclusion {{of the study is}} that activity is greatly modulated by electronic effects on the pyridinium ring. The most significant effects were enhancement of activity with increased positive charge on this ring, weakening of activity with increasing HOMO energy.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two beta 2 -adrenoceptor {{agonists}} with different <b>lipophilicities</b> were studied on tremor induced by L- 5 -hydroxytryptophan (L- 5 -HTP) in pargyline- and carbidopa-pretreated rats. Tremor was recorded and analysed by an objective method based on accelerometry. Clenbuterol, a lipophilic beta 2 -selective agonist, dose-dependently enhanced tremor intensity, whereas the hydrophilic beta 2 -agonist terbutaline had no effect. The clenbuterol-induced enhancement of tremor was completely abolished by the beta 2 -selective antagonist ICI 118, 551 but unchanged by the beta 1 -selective antagonist metoprolol.

Biological activity studies revealed that changing the length of the hydroxyalkyl group had marked effects on IC 50 values, with compounds having shorter arms that more closely resemble endogenous nucleosides exhibiting lower cytotoxicities.

25|$|Thiopental is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} drug for inducing unconsciousness, since it causes {{loss of consciousness}} upon a single circulation through the brain due to its high <b>lipophilicity.</b> Only a few other drugs, such as methohexital, etomidate, or propofol, {{have the capability to}} induce anesthesia so rapidly. (Narcotics such as fentanyl are inadequate as induction agents for anesthesia.) Supporters argue that since the thiopental is given at a much higher dose than for medically induced coma protocols, it is effectively impossible for the condemned to wake up.|$|E
25|$|Oral Isotretinoin is best absorbed {{when taken}} with a high-fat meal, {{because it has a}} high level of <b>lipophilicity.</b> The {{efficacy}} of isotretinoin doubles when taken after a high-fat meal compared to when taken without food. Due to Isotretinoin's molecular relationship to Vitamin A, it should not be taken with Vitamin A supplements due to the danger of toxicity through cumulative overdosing. Accutane also negatively interacts with tetracycline, another class of acne drug, and with micro-dosed ('mini-pill') progesterone preparations, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol ('OrthoNovum 7/7/7'), St. John's Wort, phenytoin, and systemic corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins were {{originally}} believed {{to leave the}} cells via passive diffusion because of their high <b>lipophilicity.</b> The discovery of the prostaglandin transporter (PGT, SLCO2A1), which mediates the cellular uptake of prostaglandin, demonstrated that diffusion alone cannot explain the penetration of prostaglandin through the cellular membrane. The release of prostaglandin has now {{also been shown to}} be mediated by a specific transporter, namely the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily. Whether MRP4 is the only transporter releasing prostaglandins from the cells is still unclear.|$|E

25|$|All statins {{have the}} same {{pharmacophore}} so the difference in their pharmacodynamic effect is mostly based on the substituents. The activity of each statin {{is dependent on the}} binding affinity of the compound for the substrate site and the length of time it binds to the site. Type 2 statins havejk unique fluorophenyl group that causes additional polar interaction between the enzyme and the statins, which results in a tighter binding to the enzyme. The newest statin, rosuvastatin has a unique polar methane sulfonamide group, which is quite hydrophilic and confers low <b>lipophilicity.</b> The sulfonamide group forms a unique polar interaction with the enzyme. As a result, rosuvastatin has superior binding affinity to the HMGR enzyme compared to the other statins, which is directly related to its efficiency to lower LDL cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|For optimal {{activity}} and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal lipophilic group is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 {{can be replaced}} by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted phenyl ring or a bulky alkoxy substituent (celecoxib). Within the hydrophilic side-pocket of COX-2, the oxygen of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) group interacts with Hist90, Arg513, and Gln192 and forms hydrogen bonds. The substituted phenyl group {{at the top of}} the channel interacts with the side-chains of amino acid residues through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Tyr385 makes for some sterical restrictions of this side of the binding site so a small substituent of the phenyl group makes for better binding. Degrees of freedom are also important for the binding. The central ring of the coxibs decides the orientation of the aromatic rings and, therefore, the binding to COX enzyme even though it often has no electrostatic interactions with any of the amino acid residues. The high <b>lipophilicity</b> of the active site does require low polarity of the central scaffold of the coxibs.|$|E
