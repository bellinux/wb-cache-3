In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania were locked out when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory {{on the morning of}} July6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.|$|E

500|$|Mystery Train {{was filmed}} in Memphis {{in the summer}} of 1988. After {{arriving}} in the city during a snowstorm to scout for shooting locations, Jarmusch drove around without direction before coming to the intersection of a disused train station, the Arcade <b>Luncheonette</b> diner, and the dilapidated Arcade Hotel that would become the film's core setting. He would later recount the experience in a March 1990 interview in Spin: [...] "Man, ... this crossroad is filled with so many ghosts. You know Robert Johnson walked down that street, you know Muddy Waters was in that train station." [...] The locale of the intersection was one of the film's primary formal elements; the effect of Jarmusch returning to the setting with different characters under different circumstances was one of the variations on a theme.|$|E

The exterior of Pete's <b>Luncheonette,</b> the restaurant in which the episode opens, was a leftover set piece from The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984). Seinfeld's stand-up routine was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, {{in front of an audience}} of paid extras, though not all of the recorded material was included in the broadcast version. Additionally, a scene was recorded featuring Jerry and George driving to the airport talking about changing lanes on the road and giving [...] "Thank you waves", but was cut before [...] broadcasting. The music used in the episode was composed by Jep Epstein; however, when the show was picked up, Epstein's tune was replaced by the trademark slap bass music by Jonathan Wolff.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the lingo is unknown, but there is {{evidence}} suggesting {{it may have been}} used by waiters as early as the 1870s and 1880s.

Diner lingo was most popular in diners and <b>luncheonettes</b> from the 1920s to the 1970s.|$|R

The most common brands of spicy hot dogs used are Sabrett's or Best's, {{both of which are}} NJ companies. A traditional Newark Style Dog (also called an Italian Hot Dog) is made by cutting a round [...] "pizza bread" [...] in half (for a double) or into quarters (for a single), cutting a pocket into it and spreading the inside with mustard. A deep-fried dog (or two if it is a double) is put in the pocket, topped with fried (or sautéed) onions and peppers, and then topped off with crisp-fried potato chunks. A quicker version of this, often simply called a double dog, can also be requested at some lunch trucks, <b>luncheonettes,</b> and pizzerias across the state. Instead of the traditional potato round, French fries are substituted and in some spots a Portuguese or sub roll replaces the traditional round bread used.|$|R

He was murdered by Dominick Cataldo and his nephews Nicholas and Joseph Cataldo Jr., the sons of Colombo crime family mafioso Joseph Cataldo.

5000|$|Black was {{originally}} called William Schwarz but {{changed his name}} in the 1940s. [...] There is also some uncertainty about his year of birth and his country of origin. He claimed to have been born in Bushwick, Brooklyn in 1904, but may have been older (b. 1898-1902?) and possibly emigrated from Russia with his family when he was 4 years old. He worked nights to pay for his education and in 1926 graduated from Columbia University in New York with a degree in engineering. He failed to find suitable employment, so with a start up fund of $250, he began selling nuts to passers-by from a stand located on Broadway and Forty-Third Street. The venture was profitable, and within six years Black had expanded his business to eighteen small stores called Chock Full o’Nuts. [...] Sales dipped during the Great Depression so Black adapted his business by converting his outlets to short-order <b>luncheonettes.</b> He sold low cost food such as nutted cheese sandwiches on whole wheat raisin bread, prepared in view of the customers. Staff were forbidden from touching the food and used tongs and spatulas to handle the ingredients. Black also opened a bakery and started to roast his own blend of coffee. This became a popular vacuum packed brand and by 1960 accounted for 60% of the company’s $30 million turnover.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{in their}} {{recording}} careers, Hall and Oates had trouble clearly defining their sound, alternating among folk, soul, rock and pop. None of their early albums - Whole Oats, Abandoned <b>Luncheonette</b> and War Babies - were very successful. Despite being produced by such big-name producers such as Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren, {{they had no}} hit singles during this time period, though Abandoned <b>Luncheonette</b> contained [...] "She's Gone". This song would be covered by Lou Rawls and Tavares before Atlantic Records re-released the Hall and Oates version in 1976. [...] "She's Gone," [...] as covered by Tavares, did go to Number One on the R&B charts in 1974. It was originally written for Hall's first wife, Bryna Lublin (Hall), and initially inspired by Oates' being stood up on a date on New Year's Eve. Another Abandoned <b>Luncheonette</b> single, [...] "Las Vegas Turnaround", was written about (and mentioned by first name) Hall's girlfriend, flight attendant and future songwriting collaborator Sara Allen. Despite the fact {{that none of the}} Atlantic albums were huge national hits, in Minneapolis-St. Paul, a number of tracks on Abandoned <b>Luncheonette</b> received significant airplay on local FM station KQRS, making it a local hit. This and the other regional success the album achieved were enough to push the album into the charts, reaching #33 and staying on the charts for 38 weeks.|$|E
