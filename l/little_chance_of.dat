5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead Johnson had over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning the election.

5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} had warned Hitler in vain, there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|As the war {{wound down}} with Germany's {{surrender}} in mid-1945, Rymkus {{decided to join}} the new Cleveland Browns of the fledgling All-America Football Conference. Paul Brown, {{the coach of the}} new team, had met Rymkus at Great Lakes, where he coached the training station's military football squad. Brown offered Rymkus a $4,000 salary ($ today), double what he made with the Redskins. George Preston Marshall, the owner of the Redskins, declined to match the offer and questioned the wisdom of joining a league that he thought had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> success competing against the more established NFL. Rymkus left his wife Betty in Nappanee, Indiana and hitchhiked to the Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E

5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and {{it was felt that}} there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction.

5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI {{stated that}} as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the ground station could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Such {{an order}} ignored {{the fact that}} the Belgian Army could not {{withdraw}} to the Yser, and there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> any Belgian Cavalry joining in the attack. The plan for the Belgian withdrawal was sound; the Yser river covered Dunkirk to the east and south, while the La Bassée Canal covered it from the west. The ring of the Yser also dramatically shorted the Belgian Army's area of operations. Such a move would have abandoned Passchendaele and Ypres and would have certainly meant the capture of Ostend while further reducing the amount of Belgian territory still free by a few square miles.|$|E

30|$|Although such {{uncertainties}} {{have much}} to do with poor prospects for improvement in home countries, they are also affected by the “ordinary” difficulties of low-skilled immigrant life at the margins of the receiving society, even when they are employed in domestic work. Over time, however, such living and working conditions can pave the way for substantial life improvements, at least in home communities. Particularly for pioneer or single migrant respondents, homeland turns out to be the main or even the only framework within which upwards aspirations are cultivated (for oneself, or at least for one’s children), against the <b>little</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> social mobility abroad.|$|R
5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible; the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes {{did not wish to}} be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> success; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated. Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy. In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantine {{forces at}} the Persian front having already {{suffered}} heavy casualties in previous confrontations, Domentziolus {{was unable to}} oppose the Sassanid raids during 605. There was also <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> further reinforcements. Phocas had concluded peace treaties with the Lombards and Avars {{in an attempt to}} secure control of his provinces in the Italian Peninsula and the Balkans. He had already stripped the Balkans of most of their military forces, reassigning them to the Persian front. But this policy had backfired with the undermanned Balkans facing a Slavic invasion, notably endangering Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1989, the Giants entered the 1990 season as a Super Bowl favorite, though most {{believed}} they stood <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> stopping the 49ers. The Giants began {{the season with a}} 27–20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, then won their next nine games before losing a rematch to Philadelphia 31–13 in Week 12. The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and to the Bills at home in the regular season before defeating both teams in playoff rematches. In the Week 15 game against Buffalo, starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot. He was replaced by Hostetler, who did not lose a game. The Giants' defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (211), and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers in the regular season. After the season, six Giants were selected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E

The situation has hardly improved for young people without a qualification higher than a general school leaving certificate [Hauptschulabschluss] and for foreigners (Authoring Group Educational Reporting 2012; Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2016). Early school leavers and young adults who have left school with a lower secondary qualification (general school diploma) have <b>little</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> a proper vocational training as well as few options to receive an apprentice position according to their interests and aptitudes (ibid, p. 109 ff.).|$|R
5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh {{was still in}} his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> further advancement where he was, Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E

Believing he had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> gaining {{a place in the}} recently established Australian Flying Corps, he applied to join the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), but was rejected. Undaunted, he travelled from Queensland to Melbourne, where he impressed Minister Without Portfolio J.A.Jensen. Jensen gave the young aspirant a letter of introduction to the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir George Reid. Dallas paid his own passage to England and, once there, applied once more to the RFC. Rejected again, he turned to the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and was accepted, topping the entrance examination over 83 other students. He was commissioned a flight sub-lieutenant and began training at Hendon in June 1915, gaining Pilot's License #1512 on 5August.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> success.|$|E
25|$|The major {{benefits}} of this tactic is that the team is in complete control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high, short passes between the players are required. This significantly narrows {{the gap between the}} attack, midfield and defence (usually, the latter is forced to push up). So if the opponent gains possession, a long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the attack and midfield that need to drop back, the team will have <b>little</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> counter-attacking even if possession is won back.|$|R
5000|$|Case 5: General buyers, 2nd-price auctions, {{complete}} information.

Therefore, it is replaced with a weak-no-overbidding assumption, which means that the no-overbidding condition holds only for the bundle that the agent finally wins (i.e, the sum of bids of the buyer to his allocated bundle is at most his value for this specific bundle).

Julio Jeldres, Sihanouk's official biographer, expressed in 1999 that Chakrapong had <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> becoming the next king due to his alleged involvement in the 1994 coup attempt.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 May both sides formed up again. Beresford's orders {{indicated}} that he would retreat if Soult advanced. All day Soult held his ground, long enough to arrange for transportation of his wounded to Seville. It was not apparent to Beresford that there was <b>little</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> Soult resuming hostilities, even when Kemmis's 1,400 strong brigade (previously stranded on the north bank of the Guadiana) joined the Allied army on the battlefield at dawn. Beresford also had the relatively unscathed Portuguese division, Alten's KGL and several Spanish battalions ready for duty; Soult, in contrast, only had Godinot's brigade and Latour-Maubourg's cavalry in a fit state to fight. News that Wellington was marching to Elvas with a further two divisions hastened the Marshal's decision to retreat, as well as persuading Beresford not to launch a premature offensive against Soult's superior artillery and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources.

30|$|To summarize, the {{detector}} in [4, 5] fails at detecting cyber-physical adversaries. The multi-watermark proposal succeeds at properly detecting such adversaries {{under the assumption}} that the watermark distributions change quite frequently. The rationale is that, the non-parametric adversary has <b>little</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> acquiring the necessary information to acquire the watermark and bypass {{the detector}}. Moreover, the detector performance loss in the multi-watermark approach is equivalent to the performance loss {{in the case of the}} single-watermark approach. We have also shown that a smarter parametric cyber-physical adversary is able to attack the system without being detected in case of detecting the correct parameters. We have detailed the strategy of this adversary in Section 4. It is worth noting that the detection ratio increases with respect to the lack of accuracy of the adversary.|$|R
