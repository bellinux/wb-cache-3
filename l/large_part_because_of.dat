5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E

Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs, their relationships were hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E

He died in 1325, leaving his eldest son Philip as heir to the counties of Anjou, Maine, and Valois.|$|R
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E
5|$|There are {{conflicting}} views whether {{improvements in}} technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling {{of economic growth}} from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.|$|E

40|$|Impacts {{of alien}} marine species on {{ecosystem}} services {{have been documented}} in numerous studies, but studies on the estimation of costs with an explicit quantification of the impact channels are lacking. We calculated costs of the invasive worm Marenzelleria in the Baltic Sea, which affects sea bottoms capacity to store nutrients. A reduced capacity implies higher costs for reaching nutrient reduction targets. Therefore, the costs were calculated by taking the difference in minimum costs of attaining nutrient targets with and without {{the presence of the}} invasive species. To this end, we developed a simple dynamic model which captures the effect of the invasive species on the decay rates of nutrient pools in different and interconnected sea basins in the Baltic Sea. Evidence and numerical estimates were found for a decrease in sequestration of phosphorus in the different sea basins caused by the occurrence of the invasive worm. The results indicated a cost of this effect that ranges between 167 billion SEK and 732 billion SEK depending on the effect of Marenzelleria on sequestration of phosphorus. This cost corresponds to 0. 02 - 0. 08 % of total gross domestic product of the nine coastal countries. However, the cost is unevenly distributed among the countries, where Poland bears the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its <b>large</b> phosphorus loads and access to low cost options...|$|R

A more immediate and serious threat to whitebark pines is an introduced fungal rust disease, White Pine Blister Rust (Cronartium ribicola), which is causing heavy mortality in the species. Occasional resistant individuals occur, but in the short to medium term, a severe population decline is expected.|$|E
