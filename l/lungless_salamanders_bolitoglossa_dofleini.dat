50|$|His name is {{associated}} with Doflein's <b>salamander,</b> <b>Bolitoglossa</b> <b>dofleini,</b> circumscribed by Franz Werner in 1903. The sea anemone genus Dofleinia also bears his name, as do taxa with the specific epithet of dofleini, an example being Enteroctopus dofleini (Giant Pacific octopus).|$|R
50|$|Doflein's <b>{{salamander}}</b> (<b>Bolitoglossa</b> <b>dofleini)</b> is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae.It is found in Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, plantations, and heavily degraded former forest. An example ecoregion of occurrence is the Belizean pine forests. The species is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{species are}} {{considered}} to be of international concern (IUCN Red List), and of the additional 22-32 species that are likely to occur in the protected area (but which have not yet been recorded there), a further four {{are considered to}} be of international concern (IUCN Red List) - the endangered Sanderson's rainfrog (Eleutherodactylus sandersoni), and the near threatened Doflein's <b>salamander</b> (<b>Bolitoglossa</b> <b>dofleini),</b> broadhead rainfrog (Craugastor laticeps), and blue-spotted Mexican tree frog (Smilisca cyanosticta). A series of expeditions in Bladen in 2011 is expected to confirm the presence of some or all of these species.|$|R
50|$|Lozano's <b>Salamander</b> (<b>Bolitoglossa</b> lozanoi) is {{a species}} of <b>lungless</b> <b>salamander</b> in the family Plethodontidae.It is endemic to Colombia.Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} banana <b>salamander</b> (<b>Bolitoglossa</b> rufescens), {{also known}} as common dwarf salamander or rufescent salamander, is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae (<b>lungless</b> <b>salamanders).</b> It {{is found in the}} Atlantic slopes of Meso-America from San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and northern Chiapas in Mexico continuing on to the southern part of Guatemala, Belize, and northern Honduras. However, its range south of Mexico is uncertain because the records may refer to other species.|$|R
50|$|Three {{different}} types of egg deposition occur. Ambystoma and Taricha spp. spawn large numbers of small eggs in quiet ponds where many large predators are unlikely. Most dusky salamanders (Desmognathus) and Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon) lay smaller batches of medium-sized eggs in a concealed site in flowing water, and these are usually guarded by an adult, normally the female. Many of the tropical climbing <b>salamanders</b> (<b>Bolitoglossa)</b> and <b>lungless</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodontinae) lay {{a small number of}} large eggs on land in a well-hidden spot, where they are also guarded by the mother. Some species such as the fire salamanders (Salamandra) are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the eggs inside her body until they hatch, either into larvae to be deposited in a water body, or into fully formed juveniles.|$|R
5000|$|Slender {{salamander}} is {{the name}} often given to Plethodontid (<b>lungless)</b> <b>salamanders</b> of the genus Batrachoseps. They are distinguished from other <b>lungless</b> <b>salamanders</b> by their four toes on each foot. Their range is from Oregon and California (USA) to northern Baja California (Mexico). Batracho-seps means [...] "frog-lizard." ...|$|R

The northern banana salamander has a robust body with ll costal grooves running longitudinally between its legs and 3 additional costal grooves in between their limbs. This grooves assist salamanders in water transportation, enhances respiration and aids in thermo-regulation. They possess webbed fingers and toes, with 4 digits on its front limb and 5 digits on its hind limbs.
