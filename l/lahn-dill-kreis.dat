25|$|The city of Wetzlar, {{located in}} the state of Hesse, Germany, is a former Free {{imperial}} city that owed much of its fame to being the seat of the Imperial Supreme Court (Reichskammergericht) of the Holy Roman Empire. Located at 8° 30′ E, 50° 34′ N, Wetzlar straddles the river Lahn and is on the German Timber-Frame Road which passes mile upon mile of half-timbered houses. Historically, the city has acted as the hub of the <b>Lahn-Dill-Kreis</b> on the north edge of the Taunus. The city is known for its ancient town and its medieval cathedral.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 1977, {{as part of}} Hesse's {{municipal}} reforms, Wetzlar was {{united with}} the neighbouring town of Gießen and fourteen outlying communities to form the city of Lahn. This district-free city had about 156,000 inhabitants. The amalgamation was very unpopular, and after persistent protests – not least of all from Wetzlar – the city of Lahn was dissolved on 31 July 1979, and Wetzlar once again became an independent town. The municipal reforms, however, had been [...] "worth the trouble" [...] for Wetzlar inasmuch as the town gained eight new outlying communities in the deal, making both the town's area and population considerably greater than they had been. Moreover, Wetzlar has since this time been {{the seat of the}} <b>Lahn-Dill-Kreis,</b> which also came into being at the same time.|$|E
