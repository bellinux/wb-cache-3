We also investigated the association of lipid <b>levels</b> <b>with</b> bacterial species (gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive cocci) in the {{subgroup of}} septic patients. In the trauma group, we investigated the association of lipid <b>levels</b> <b>with</b> admission SOFA score, mechanical ventilation use and its duration, mortality in ICU and length of ICU stay. We used nonparametric covariance analysis to study the association of lipid <b>levels</b> <b>with</b> qualitative severity/outcome variables and partial Spearman’s rank coefficient correlation to study the association of lipid <b>levels</b> <b>with</b> quantitative severity/outcome variables.|$|R

The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
