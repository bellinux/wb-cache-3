Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain.|$|E
5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. Chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain {{is associated with}} sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E

5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain is not straightforward. While most <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy.

5|$|<b>Low</b> <b>back</b> pain (LBP) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. <b>Low</b> <b>back</b> pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal}} in the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain often includes medications {{for the duration}} that they are beneficial. With the first episode of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain the hope is a complete cure; however, if the problem becomes chronic, the goals may change to pain management and the recovery of as much function as possible. As pain medications are only somewhat effective, expectations regarding their benefit may differ from reality, and {{this can lead to}} decreased satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E

5|$|For {{persistent}} <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain, {{the short-term}} outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|In {{the common}} {{presentation}} of acute <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms may start {{soon after the}} movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain. It {{may or may not}} worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low</b> <b>back</b> pain {{has been}} with humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.|$|E

5|$|<b>Low</b> <b>back</b> pain {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low</b> <b>back</b> pain {{results in}} large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. <b>Low</b> <b>back</b> pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E
