50|$|Marketed as a safer {{alternative}} to barbiturate anxiolytics, meprobamate (Miltown, Equanil) was {{commonly used to}} relieve anxiety in the late 1950s and 1960s. Like barbiturates, therapeutic doses produce sedation and significant overdoses may be fatal. In the US, meprobamate has generally been replaced with benzodiazepines while the drug is now withdrawn in many European countries and Canada. The muscle relaxant carisoprodol has anxiolytic effects by metabolizing to meprobamate. Various other carbamates {{have been found to}} share these effects, such as tybamate and <b>lorbamate.</b>|$|E
