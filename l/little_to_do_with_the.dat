In 1908, {{the courts}} began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> situation on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the early}} {{success of the}} series, three video games based on the series were {{released}} by Acclaim Entertainment.

This was followed in 1999 by , a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, South Park Rally, a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC.

5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} war in New England was the Pequot War of 1637. The war's roots {{go back to}} 1632, when a dispute arose between Dutch fur traders and Plymouth {{officials}} {{over control of the}} Connecticut River Valley near modern Hartford, Connecticut. Representatives from the Dutch East India Company and Plymouth Colony both had deeds which claimed that they had rightfully purchased the land from the Pequots. A sort of land rush occurred as settlers from Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies tried to beat the Dutch in settling the area; the influx of English settlers also threatened the Pequot. Other confederations in the area sided with the English, including the Narragansetts and Mohegans, who were the traditional enemies of the Pequots. The event that sparked formal hostilities was the capture of a boat and the murder of its captain John Oldham in 1636, an event blamed on allies of the Pequots. In April 1637, a raid on a Pequot village by John Endicott led to a retaliatory raid by Pequot warriors on the town of Wethersfield, Connecticut, where some 30 English settlers were killed. This led to a further retaliation, where a raid led by Captain John Underhill and Captain John Mason burned a Pequot village to the ground near modern Mystic, Connecticut, killing 300 Pequots. Plymouth Colony had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actual fighting in the war.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels {{as if they are}} moving.

25|$|The sudden {{revisions}} in OPEC reserves, totaling nearly 300 bn barrels, {{have been}} much debated. Some of it is defended partly by the shift in ownership of reserves away from international oil companies, {{some of whom were}} obliged to report reserves under conservative US Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The most prominent explanation of the revisions is prompted by a change in OPEC rules which set production quotas (partly) on reserves. In any event, the revisions in official data had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actual discovery of new reserves.|$|E

25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate.
