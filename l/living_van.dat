5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a <b>living</b> <b>van</b> he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the blood pressure of children who had similar demographic characteristics but lived at different altitudes. Blood pressure of the children aftending primary schools in Izmir (sea level: n = 425) and Van (altitude: 1725 m, n = 291) were measured by mercurial sphygmomanometer for this study. They were similar with respect to age, sex, weight, height, and BMI. Mean age of the children was 10. 51 ± 0. 87 years (range: 9 to 12 years), and 358 (50 percent) of them were female. Mean systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the children <b>living</b> in <b>Van</b> than in the children living in Izmir (104. 72 + 11. 2 vs. 97. 96 ± 25. 5 mmHg, respectively, p <. 001). Similarly mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the children <b>living</b> in <b>Van</b> than in the children living in Izmir (63. 98 ± 9. 3 vs. 59. 91 ± 10. 0 mmHg, respectively, p <. 001). When blood pressure was evaluated with regard to height percentile, {{the number of children}} with a blood pressure over 90 percentile were 19 (4. 5 percent) and 48 (16. 5 percent) for systolic blood pressure, and 25 (5. 9 percent) and 37 (12. 7 percent) for diastolic blood pressure among the children living in Izmir and Van, respectively (p <. 001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were found to increase in parallel to the increase in body mass index in children <b>living</b> in <b>Van</b> (r = 0. 358, p <. 001 and r = 0. 235, p <. 001, respectively). However, blood pressures were not correlated to body mass index in children living in Izmir. A difference of 1700 m in altitude was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in children with similar demographic characteristics, and at this altitude, body mass index and blood pressure showed a positive correlation...|$|R

Rory Gallagher formed the blues rock trio Taste and went on to achieve critical acclaim in his solo career which lasted until his death in 1995.

50|$|Traction {{engines in}} the Victorian period {{represented}} an expensive capital {{investment in the}} latest agricultural technology of the period. Many were owned by contractors who would move them from farm to farm for hire, as required. Typical work included threshing after harvest time. A rake of engine, threshing machine, a <b>living</b> <b>van</b> and often a water cart would travel from farm to farm as needed, stopping at each for a few days. The first engines, from around 1840, were portable engines: movable steam engines that were horse-drawn to move them, unlit, between farms. From the 1860s the locomotive traction engine appeared, now capable of moving under its own power. The engine's crew would include a driver, a steersman, and often a boy. Other agricultural labourers carrying out the threshing work would already be resident on the farm. Threshing an average-sized farm of 50 acres would take about two weeks, so the capital cost of the investment in an engine and 'drum' encouraged farms to purchase such a rig as a jointly shared investment, or for others to establish themselves as itinerant contractors. Threshing would continue after harvest and into the winter, with the corn stacked in ricks until then. The first locomotive threshing teams were local and did not require living vans, the driver walking or cycling from home up to ten miles. Use of vans did not become widespread for threshing until the 1880s, some years after they were popular for ploughing.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Van Inwagen {{maintains}} that all material objects are mereological simples {{with the exception}} of biological life such that the only composite objects are <b>living</b> things. <b>Van</b> Inwagen’s view can be formulated like this: “Necessarily, for any non-overlapping xs, there is an object composed of the xs iff either (i) the activities of the xs contstitute a life or (ii) there {{is only one of the}} xs.” In other words, Van Inwagen contends that mereological atoms form a composite object when they engage in a sort special, complex activity which amounts to a life.|$|R
