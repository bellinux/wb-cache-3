40|$|Low {{and high}} speed subsonic jets {{have been studied}} in the last 50 years mainly due its large {{application}} in industry, such as the discharge of turbojets and turbofan engines. The purpose of this work is to investigate the aerodynamics and the acoustic noise generated by a single stream jet flow operating at low Mach number 0. 25 and Reynolds number of 2, 1 105. The main focus is the flow and acoustics characterization of this <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jet</b> by appling different experimental techniques for evaluating the velocity field via measurements with pitot tube and hot-wire anemometry and farfield noise acquisition by free field microphones. In order to verify the validity of aeroacoustics prediction for such <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jet,</b> a Computational Fluid Dynamics by means of RANS simulations via k- SST model have been employed coupled with a statistically low-cost Lighthill-Ray-Tracing method in order to numerically predict the acoustic noise spectrum. Sound pressure level {{as a function of}} frequency is contructed from the experiments and compared with the noise calculations from the acoustic modeling. The numerical results for the acoustic and flow fields were well compared with the experimental data, showing that this low-cost flow-acoustic methodology can be used to predict acoustic noise of subsonic jet flows, even at low speeds...|$|E

The near field measurements were modelled according to the vortex pairing hypothesis to deduce the distribution of pairings along the jet axis and the variances about the mean locations. The hodograph plane description of turbulence was explored in some detail, and a complex correlation quantity was synthesized which has useful properties for turbulence {{in the presence of}} mean shear...|$|E

The analysis is performed {{through use of}} a Galerkin finite element method with penalty formulation for solving the equations of motion and a flux method for tracking the free surface. A parametric study is performed to analyze the temporal instability of the evaporating jet. Through varying the evaporation rate, Reynolds number, disturbance wave number, initial disturbance amplitude, and density ratio the outcomes of jet breakup are investigated. Also, pressure distribution inside the jet and multiple satellite drop formations are analyzed. Results are compared to existing analytical conclusions made from linear stability analysis. This study reveals that surface evaporation has a destabilizing effect for the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jets,</b> which are considered here. That is, evaporation flux is greater at the neck than the crest, which accelerates the wave growth. Satellite drops also reduce in size as evaporation rate is increased. This reduction is seen in both the radial direction due to vapor leaving the surface and along the axis of symmetry due to decreased breakup time[URL]...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the minimum temporal requirements, spatial domain and spatial resolution requirements {{in order to}} make acoustic predictions by means of acoustic analogies, for <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jet</b> flows, by means of numerical simulations. This work is done to demonstrate the feasibility of indirect acoustic extrapolation from recent experiments undertaken by us and to develop robust techniques. For this paper we consider Direct Numerical Simulation of incompressible jets flows of Reynolds number 2, 500 and Reynolds number 5, 000 jets. Comparison of flow statistics and visualizations confirms that the simulations are representative of the jets obtained in our experiments. Lighthill’s and Powell’s aerocaoustic analogies are applied and demonstrated to yield indirect acoustic predictions of these jets, especially at 90 º to the flow axis, where the coordinate origin dependency of Powell’s acoustic analogy is minimal. Finally {{we investigate}} the robustness of these indirect acoustic predictions when the DNS simulation data is reduced in temporal and spatial extent and resolution to those currently achievable by our Tomographic PIV setup. The results indicate that our current measurement capabilities are suitable for obtaining acoustic spectra up to a Strouhal number of 1. 0. Moreover, in order to improve the spectral cut-off, it is preferable to increase the spatial resolution of the measurements at the expense of domain size and temporal resolution.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a technique which relates dynamic pressure measurements taken outside the hydrodynamic eld of a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jet</b> to single point, one component velocity measurements taken within the jet using a Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system. To improve {{the signal to}} noise ratio of the pressure measurement, a coherence based acoustic beamforming technique is applied and focussed on the LDV measurement volume in order to evaluate its contribution to the measured sound. As the pressure samples are acquired at regular time steps whereas the velocity at irregular time intervals dependent on the particle seeding, the calculation of the auto- and cross-spectra of the pressure and veloc- ity measurements require special treatment. The signal processing procedures required to calculate these are described and implemented in the paper. To validate the proposed tech- nique real experimental data was analysed. Laser Doppler Velocimetry measured velocity uctuations created by rods placed in a jet. Synchronously, a planar random array focused on the same plane as the LDV measurement, measured pressure uctuation outside the hydrodynamic eld. The same set of data was then analysed using conventional and co- herence based beamforming algorithms. The results from both techniques were compared. While conventional beamforming identi ed the contribution from the main sources within the ow, the coherence based method was able to single out the source related to the local measurement. The results shown demonstrated how coherence based beamforming, combined with LDV, can be a useful tool for aeroacoustic noise source investigations...|$|E
40|$|An image {{processing}} approach to turbulence studies has been developed. The approach employs a structure tracking technique {{to quantify the}} movement of coherent, large-scale turbulent structures. The 'structure tracking' technique {{has been applied to}} the shear layer of a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jet</b> issuing into a low speed crossflow. A study of the characteristics of the turbulent flow within this region involved comparative measurements with hot-wire anemometry measurements within the same flow regime and fractal analysis of the flow visualisation images used by the tracking routine. Fractal analysis was applied to flow visualisation images to educe a range of length scales made apparent by the flow visualisation equipment The results obtained with the structure tracking technique included the instantaneous velocity of the structures and a measure of their length scales. The instantaneous velocity measurements were used to calculate a turbulence characteristic associated with the structures. Further analysis revealed subsets of this turbulence characteristic involving the variation in average velocity of individual structures as well as variations in the instantaneous velocity of individual structures. Where possible, the results of the structure tracking technique were compared to those achieved by hot wire anemometry and good correspondence was found between the mean flow characteristics measured by both techniques. The results of the two techniques began to diverge in the regions of the flow where conventional hot-wire anemometry was unable to discriminate between the flow associated with the jet and that associated with the crossflow. In such regions, time-averaged hot-wire anemometry produced results which combined the measurements in both flow regimes and therefore attenuated any characteristics of the jet which were significantly {{different from those of the}} crossflow. In the same flow regions the structure tracking technique was able to measure those characteristics specifically associated with the jet, producing results, which reflected the behaviour of the jet more accurately...|$|E

Results show that the background flow substantially affects the sound generation process in the beginning of the vortex ring interaction. They also suggest that the axial jerk and radial acceleration/deceleration of vortex rings are the major mechanisms through which pairing sound is produced. The effect of background flow mean shear rate on sound generation is also discussed and the results suggest that higher sound levels will be generated when the vortex rings are interacting within the region of high mean shear in a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> laminar <b>jet.</b> © 1998 Acoustical Society of America. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The noise {{emitted by}} {{commercial}} aircraft {{is a major}} inhibitor {{of the growth of}} commercial air transport and is a critical environmental issue in air transportation. A functionally-silent aircraft is envisioned to achieve a step change in airframe and propulsion system noise reduction (30 EPNdB). This thesis addresses the assessment of low-noise propulsion system concepts suggested to enable such a functionally-silent aircraft. The propulsion system concepts of ultra-high bypass ratio turbofan engines, a distributed propulsion system, and silent engine air-brakes are evaluated in light of their noise signatures and propulsion system performance. These propulsion system concepts are assessed using simple analytic models and existing semi-empirical noise prediction methods. Ultra-high bypass ratio turbofan engine cycles are predicted to achieve the 30 dB jet noise reduction goal. This noise reduction is possible with bypass ratios of order 70 for separate flow exhaust nozzles and of order 40 for a mixed flow exhaust nozzle. Such large bypass ratios result in a significant decrease in specific fuel consumption. However, the cost for a step change in jet noise reduction is a dramatic drop in specific thrust which requires larger engine diameters, and hence yields penalties in weight and installation drag. For a given noise goal, the study shows that an advanced technology engine cycle achieves a specific thrust similar to current technology engine cycles but enables a lower specific fuel consumption. In order to embed such ultra-high bypass ratio engines in a blended-wing-body airframe, a distributed propulsion system consisting of 10 core engines driving a total number of 30 fans via gearboxes and shafts is suggested. (cont.) A feasibility study shows that this configuration can achieve the noise reduction goal with a trade-off between transmission losses, gearbox weight, and turbomachinery losses. Such a propulsion system allows to exhaust the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>jet</b> along the trailing edge of the wing in a single high-aspect ratio nozzle. This exhaust system integrated in the airframe is predicted to entail a 5 % loss in thrust but suggests an additional 4 dB reduction in perceived jet noise. To achieve a quiet descent without high-drag devices, an engine air-brake system with variable geometry turbomachinery is suggested to control changes in impulse of the air flow through the propulsion system. For a blended-wing-body aircraft in clean configuration, the drag generated by the air-brake system enables an approach on a 4. 5 ⁰ glide slope angle at 84 m/s. On a preliminary basis it is found that the low fan rotational speeds of the engine air-brake yield a 10 dB reduction in fan noise on approach. A distributed propulsion system with engine air-brake capability is delineated and a total reduc- tion in jet noise of 34 EPNdB is predicted at takeoff. On approach, a reduction in airframe noise of 32 EPNdB is estimated for a blended-wing-body aircraft with aerodynamically smooth lifting surfaces, boundary layer ingestion, and silent engine air-brakes. by Alexis Manneville.

The liquid and gas phase solutions, however, are coupled through the boundary conditions at the interface between the phases. The computational grid for the gas phase calculations are adapted to the shape of the liquid jet core. The axial variation of droplet sizes are calculated using a stability analysis appropriate for the atomization regime of liquid jet breakup. The predictions of this method have been validated with experimental data on <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> water <b>jets.</b> Using this method, calculations are performed for the SSME fuel preburner single injector flow field.

40|$|Jets of gas {{released}} from young stars excavate cavities and drive bipolar outflows. The outflow properties {{may be related}} to the <b>speed</b> of the <b>jets.</b> To test this, we study the propagation of supersonic overdense jets through axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with radiative cooling and chemistry, building on previous studies by injecting molecular and atomic jets with a wide range of speeds, between 50 and 300 km s − 1, into both molecular and atomic media. We show that the high collimation of outflows driven by molecular jets holds for all <b>jet</b> <b>speeds.</b> At the higher speeds, we find that the jet Mach number is the critical parameter which determines the shape of the cavity and the cavity is filled with atomic gas. However, at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> the <b>jet</b> material is the key factor with atomic jets producing much wider cavities, whereas molecular jets produce narrow cool molecular sheaths. A Mach disc is associated with the leading edge of the atomic simulations, whereas oblique shocks which refocus the jet are found in molecular flows. We also examine the mass spectra (distribution of mass with radial velocity), generally finding quite shallow relationships for all <b>jet</b> <b>speeds</b> (i. e the γ index is typically 1 – 2). Steep molecular mass spectra are, however, associated with the atomic-jet– molecular-medium combination. We conclude that the properties of bipolar outflows possess signatures related to the <b>jet</b> <b>speed</b> but are probably more sensitive to other factors.

40|$|Passive {{and active}} control of {{swirling}} turbulent jets is experimentally investigated. Initial swirl distribution {{is shown to}} dominate the free jet evolution in the passive mode. Vortex breakdown, a manifestation of high intensity swirl, was achieved at below critical swirl number (S = 0. 48) by reducing the vortex core diameter. The response of a swirling turbulent jet to single frequency, plane wave acoustic excitation was shown to depend strongly on the swirl number, excitation Strouhal number, amplitude of the excitation wave, and core turbulence in a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> cold <b>jet.</b> A 10 percent reduction of the mean centerline velocity at x/D = 9. 0 (and a corresponding increase in the shear layer momentum thickness) was achieved by large amplitude internal plane wave acoustic excitation. Helical instability waves of negative azimuthal wave numbers exhibit larger amplification rates than the plane waves in swirling free jets, according to hydrodynamic stability theory. Consequently, an active swirling shear layer control is proposed to include the generation of helical instability waves of arbitrary helicity {{and the promotion of}} modal interaction, through multifrequency forcing...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of heating and velocity on the unsteady nature of jet mixing layers is investigated by solving the time-dependent compressible Navier-Stokes equations using MacCormack's explicit finite difference algorithm. The computations are performed for jet Mach numbers of 0. 3 and 0. 8 with flow total temperatures up to 800 K. The Reynolds number ranges from 3 x 10 to the 5 th to 1. 3 x 10 to the 6 th. Excitation {{is accomplished by}} imposing an acoustic pressure signal inside the jet duct. The objective of this effort is to compare the response of heated and unheated jets with acoustic excitation at high and low subsonic Mach numbers. The preliminary results indicate that without acoustic excitation the mixing in the heated jet is greater than in the unheated case. It has also been found that for the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> heated <b>jets</b> (M = 0. 3, Tt = 672 K) acoustic excitation causes the production of large scale vortex structures to occur in a regular periodic manner with organized periodic pairing at some Strouhal numbers.

Forced simulations reveal a large difference in the instantaneous structure of scalar dissipation fields between nonbuoyant and buoyant cases.

40|$|Propulsion {{airframe}} aeroacoustic (PAA) interactions, {{resulting from}} the integration of engine and airframe, lead to azimuthal asymmetries in the flow/acoustic field, e. g., due to {{the interaction between the}} exhaust jet flow and the pylon, the wing and its high-lift devices, such as, flaps and flaperons. In the first two parts of this series we have presented experimental results which show that isolated and installed nozzles with azimuthally varying chevrons (AVCs) can reduce noise more than conventional chevrons when integrated with a pylon and a wing with flaps at take-off conditions. In this paper, we present model-scale experimental results for the reduction of jet-flap interaction noise source due to these AVCs and document the PAA installation effects (difference in noise between installed and isolated nozzle configurations) at both approach and take-off conditions. It is found that the installation effects of both types of chevron nozzles, AVCs and conventional, are reversed at approach and take-off, in that there is more installed noise reduction at approach and less at take-off compared to that of the isolated nozzles. Moreover, certain AVCs give larger total installed noise benefits at both conditions compared to conventional chevrons. Phased microphone array results show that at approach conditions (large flap deflection, <b>low</b> <b>jet</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>low</b> ambient Mach number), chevrons gain more noise benefit from reducing jetflap interaction noise than they do from quieting the jet plume noise source which is already weak at these <b>low</b> <b>jet</b> <b>speeds.</b> In contrast, at take-off (small flap deflection, high <b>jet</b> <b>speed</b> and high ambient Mach number) chevrons reduce the dominant jet plume noise better than the reduction they create in jet-flap interaction noise source.

However, there is a tradeoff in propeller efficiency compared to forward speed, so while the turboprops are efficient engines, they are only efficient at speeds of up to 500 mph. This meant there was a sweet spot between the high efficiencies of the turboprop at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> and the <b>jet</b> at high <b>speeds</b> that was not being directly addressed.

A finite element model is developed that couples a lumped thermodynamic formulation for the vapor region with a complete solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations for the flow and temperature fields in the liquid. Numerical results show that buoyancy effects are strong, even in microgravity, and can reposition a vapor bubble that is initially {{at the center of}} the tank to a region near the tank wall in a relatively short time. Long-term tank pressurization with the vapor bubble at the tank wall shows that after an initial transient lasting about a week, the final rate of pressure increase agrees with a purely thermodynamic analysis of the entire tank. However, the final pressure levels are quite different from thermodynamic predictions. Numerical results also show that there is significant thermal stratification in the liquid due to the effects of natural convection.

If the high <b>speed</b> downward <b>jet</b> penetrated far enough into the bubble, such that its length exceeded Rayleighs wave-length for instability, it broke up to form a single drop within the bubble. The entrapped drop would then bounce around in-side the bubble before the drop coalesced with the bulk liquid through a coalescence cascade with a geometric similarity given by We = 8...|$|R

40|$|Supercritical {{airfoils}} {{and their}} applications to wings for {{various types of}} aircraft are studied. The various wings discussed were designed for a subsonic jet transport with increased speed, a variable sweep fighter with greater transonic maneuverability, a high subsonic <b>speed</b> STOL <b>jet</b> transport with improved <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> characteristics, and a subsonic jet transport with substantially improved aerodynamic efficiency. Results of wind tunnel and flight demonstration investigations are described. Also discussed are refinements of the transonic area rule concept and methods for reducing the aerodynamic interference between engine nacelles and wings at high subsonic speeds...|$|R
5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} {{high speed}} or full <b>speed</b> and <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, it will by default disable communication to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> device unless requested to switch to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, to allow the host to send a single <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices. After the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices again.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{detection}} of the compact radio structures of 14 radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS 1) galaxies from Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 5 GHz performed in 2013. While 50 % {{of the sources of}} our sample show a compact core only, the remaining 50 % exhibit a core-jet structure. The measured brightness temperatures of the cores range from 10 (8. 4) to 10 (11. 4) K with a median value of 10 (10. 1) K, indicating that the radio emission is from non-thermal jets, and that, likely, most sources are not strongly beamed, thus implying a <b>low</b> <b>jet</b> <b>speed</b> in these radio-loud NLS 1 galaxies. In combination with archival data taken at multiple frequencies, we find that seven sources show flat or even inverted radio spectra, while steep spectra are revealed in the remaining seven objects. Although all of these sources are very radio-loud with R > 100, their jet properties are diverse in terms of their milliarcsecond (mas) scale (parsec scale) morphology and their overall radio spectral shape. The evidence for slow <b>jet</b> <b>speeds</b> (i. e., less relativistic jets), in combination with the low kinetic/radio power, may offer an explanation for the compact VLBA radio structure in most sources. The mildly relativistic jets in these high accretion rate systems are consistent with a scenario where jets are accelerated from the hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and the radiation force of the accretion disk. Alternatively, a low jet bulk velocity can be explained by low spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism...|$|R
