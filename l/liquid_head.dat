A pilot plant was built containing two columns one 'rectangular' and the other 'round'. The trays had downcomers as would be the case in practice. The investigations are divided into four main sections: (i) Hydrodynamic studies of gas/liquid interactions on the tray. These include the measurements of <b>liquid</b> <b>heads,</b> froth heights, pressure drops, aeration and froth density factors, weeping and entrainment on the tray and <b>liquid</b> <b>heads</b> froth heights and froth density factors in the downcomer.

(iii) Mass transfer and efficiency studies with the system air/CO 2 water, and (iv) Measurement of liquid/gas interfacial areas employing the system air/CO 2 /NaOH solution. The values of 'a' the interfacial area, obtained were combined with the mass transfer coefficient 'kla' obtained from efficiency studies to give values of Where possible, the results of the hydrodynamic studies {{have been reported in the}} form of correlation equations suitable for design purposes. A novel method was arrived at to sample the vapour stream for entrained liquid and the results although not yet complete enough for direct design purposes are very encouraging. A new criterion, pzf, has been introduced and the values obtained for it confirm the correlation proposed by FAIR. The extent of relative liquid mixing on the tray was determined using the variance of the residence time distribution. Graphical correlations of the mean liquid residence time and the extent of mixing have been presented. The validity of the method for obtaining the eddy diffusion coefficient from the variance of residence time distribution has been discussed. An accurate sampling and analysing technique was used in the efficiency and mass transfer studies. For the latter, operating conditions were selected such that the second order reaction between CO 2 and NaOH solution could be regarded as pseudo-first order. The values of the interfacial area 'a' obtained were found to vary slightly with liquid and vapour flows.

40|$|Two-phase {{thermosyphon}} loops (TPTLs) {{are highly}} effective devices for spontaneously transferring heat through a relatively long distance. Therefore, TPTLs are extensively used in various fields, such as cooling of electronic components, light water reactors, etc. Recently, the TPTL {{has also been}} found to be an effective way to recover or transfer heat in air-conditioning systems for energy saving. A typical TPTL consists of an evaporator, a riser (gas tube), a condenser, and a downcomer (liquid tube), and the condenser is higher than the evaporator by a certain vertical distance. The TPTL is powered by the natural force [...] - gravity, which means the pressure drop in the cycle always equals to the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> caused by the density difference of the liquid in the downcomer and the vapor or vapor/liquid mixture in the riser. Therefore, the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> is a key factor affecting the circulation flow rate and energy performance of TPTLs. In the traditional applications, the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> is considered to be proportional to the height difference between the condenser and the evaporator based on the underlying assumption: the downcomer is fully liquid filled. According to that, the TPTL will perform better with a larger height difference. The conclusion may be correct in the cases with large temperature difference and heat flux, such as in the field of cooling of electronic and light water reactors. However, when the TPTL is used in air-conditioning system, which has quite small temperature difference and small heat flux, some special phenomena were observed: the liquid heat is lower than the height difference and the downcomer is partially liquid filled. That is largely different from the thermosyphons in traditional applications. What’s the thermodynamic mechanism of partially liquid filled in the downcomer? How to determine the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> and the height difference? These are the fundamental questions that required answers before using two-phase thermosyphon in air conditioner field. In this study, the thermodynamic mechanism of partially liquid filled in the downcomer is researched and the effect of height difference on the performance of TPTL is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Firstly, a visual experimental setup is established, and the performance of a water-water TPTL is measured when the height difference ranges from 0 m to 2. 4 m. Based on it, the basic phenomena are observed and the thermodynamic mechanism is investigated. Secondly, a generalized distributed-parameter model is developed based on the conservations of momentum, energy, and mass, which can determine <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> and overall performance simultaneously according to external conditions. The model is verified by experiments. Then the model is used to analyze the variation of <b>liquid</b> <b>head,</b> circulation flow rate, heat transfer rate, system pressure under different height differences. The results show that with the increase of the height difference, the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> rises continuously until remain stable. Therefore, the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> is less than the height difference in some cases. Consequently, with the increase of height difference, the circulation flow rate and thermal performance firstly increases then remains constant...|$|E

30|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{production}} at a constant withdrawal rate, because of low-resistance force in fracture against flow, at first the liquid was pumped from fracture, and consequently, the fracture was invaded immediately by gas. Therefore, the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> (gas–liquid interface) inside the fracture dropped and at a particular time due to the pressure difference (ΔP) between top and bottom of the model, it became feasible for gas to begin to enter the matrix, while it was continuing to flow in fracture (Maroufi et al. 2012).

40|$|In-space {{propulsion}} often necessitates {{the use of}} {{a capillary}} liquid acquisition device (LAD) to assure that gas-free liquid propellant is available to support engine restarts in microgravity. If a capillary screen-channel device is chosen, then the designer must determine the appropriate combination screen mesh and channel geometry. A screen mesh selection which results in the smallest LAD width when compared to any other screen candidate (for a constant length) is desirable; however, no best screen exists for all LAD design requirements. Flow rate, percent fill, and acceleration are the most influential drivers for determining screen widths. Increased flow rates and reduced percent fills increase the through-the-screen flow pressure losses, which drive the LAD to increased widths regardless of screen choice. Similarly, increased acceleration levels and corresponding <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> pressures drive the screen mesh selection toward a higher bubble point (liquid retention capability). After ruling out some screens on the basis of acceleration requirements alone, candidates can be identified by examining screens with small flow-loss-to-bubble point ratios for a given condition (i. e., comparing screens at certain flow rates and fill levels). Within the same flow rate and fill level, the screen constants inertia resistance coefficient, void fraction, screen pore or opening diameter, and bubble point can become the driving forces in identifying the smaller flow-loss-to-bubble point ratios...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the experimental results {{of research on}} the influence of gravity on flow pattern transitions, pressure drop and flow characteristics for cocurrent gas-liquid two-phase flow through packed columns. The flow pattern transition data indicates that the pulse flow regime exists over a wider range of gas and liquid flow rates under reduced gravity conditions compared to normal gravity cocurrent down-flow. This is illustrated by comparing the flow regime transitions found in reduced gravity with the transitions predicted by Talmor. Next, the effect of gravity on the total pressure drop in a packed column is shown to depend on the flow regime. The difference is roughly equivalent to the <b>liquid</b> static <b>head</b> for bubbly flow but begins to decrease at the onset of pulse flow.

Convection due to superheating may be responsible for undesired dilution of the bead with the substrate material. A quasi-stationary state temperature field is calculated by means of Rosenthal's solution, assuming some low energy surface shape for the <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> of a single track bead. This shape is analytically described with free parameters which have to be determined from the powder flux and the feed rate and by fitting iteratively the temperature condition at the border line between the melted part of the bead and the substrate. The Marangoni flow essentially modifies the primary surface heat source density caused by the laser beam and the impinging preheated powder particles and, therefore, has a large influence on heat transfer and temperature gradients in the melt pool, particularly on its surface. Hence the temperature field, the fluid flow velocity at the melt pool surface and the unknown parameters of the bead geometry have to be calculated iteratively in a selfconsistent manner. The simulation is to visualize the origin of various possible failures during the cladding process and of the resulting lacks in the quality of treatment such as insufficient heating of the melt pool, poor bonding between substrate and bead, or too large a dilution of the bead with the substrate material.

The effects on the amplitude and frequency of the pressure pulsations of gas velocity, tray <b>liquid</b> <b>head,</b> liquid crossflow and tray and column geometry were determined using pressure transducers with real time signal analysis. Pulsations were produced with fifteen tray geometries, including five hole diameters between 4. 76 mm and 15. 87 Mm. Most of the pulsations were produced at gas velocities below 12 mls and liquid heads below 200 N/m 2. The pulsation fundamental frequency varied between 12 Hz. and 40 Hz., with an r. m. s. amplitude of up to 60 N/m 2 • The gas-liquid behaviour on the sieve-tray was studied using high speed cine-photography and electrical conductivity probes. This showed conclusively that, during the occurrence of pulsations, the gas-liquid interaction was highly regular and synchronised with the pressure pulsations. Detailed measurements were obtained {{of the degree of}} synchronisation and of the liquid motion on the tray. Several modes of gas-liquid interaction were identified. During pulsation production, the pulsating jet and the imperfect bubble were most common. Calculated fluctuations in the gas flow rate through the test-tray based on measured pressures agreed well with the results of the film analysis. A model of the synchronisation process is proposed based upon control by the pulsating jet. The model explains the measured limits of pulsation occurrence and permits some prediction of these limits for systems other than air-water. A simplified system flow analysis accounts for effects of gas density and column geometry on the pulsation frequency. The form of the empirical correlation of frequency with experimental variables is consistent with a physical description of the pulsating jet...|$|E

The properties of blood pose several problems for quantitave applications as a test fluid: composition differs from donor to donor, precluding a fixed standard; properties change with time because of metabolic processes; opacity restricts optical studies of flow; blood samples can carry disease, thus presenting a biological hazard to workers; blood is a two phase, unstable system subject to sedimentation, and it can clot, thus blocking its fluid-like flow; the volume which can be withdrawn from a single donor is limited, restricting high volume applications. To formulate a model blood fluid it is necessary to understand the rheological and fluidodynamic properties of blood and in particular of red blood cells (RBCs), because they form the major and the largest constituent of blood components. One of the most striking properties of red blood cells is their high deformability, which allows them to flow through vessels with radius smaller than cell size in microcirculation and is essential to maintain optimal blood circulation and gas transfer between blood and tissues. In this work, the attention was focussed on microconfined shear flow of RBCs in capillaries with radius comparable to average cell size. The main fluidodynamic observables are shape and velocity of the flowing RBCs, which depend on capillary radius, pressure drop, and RBC volume fraction in the capillary (referred to as tube hematocrit HT). The microcapillaries are placed in a rectangular flow cell, where a suspension of RBCs is fed under the action of a <b>liquid</b> <b>head</b> in the physiological range. Video microscopy images of the flowing RBCs are acquired at high magnification and later processed by an automated image analysis macro.

The great potential of a thermosiphon system as a replacement of currently used cooling techniques is studied in the presented work. A thermosiphon loop using two-phase heat and mass transfer process uses latent heat of the working fluid. The latent heat is much more efficient than sensible heat improving the heat dissipation ability of the system. The thermosiphon system is a gravity driven loop thus reducing the power consumption {{and the cost of}} the system. However, the system performance is limited by Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and Heat Transfer Coefficients (HTC). An increase in CHF offers wide temperature operating range while the HTC defines the efficiency of the process. In the proposed design of the cooling solution, a manifold with a taper is employed over the heater surface to guide vapor away from the surface along the flow length. The incoming liquid flows over the heating surface unobstructed developing separate liquid-vapor pathways. Two taper angles, 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ in the manifold are tested for the benchtop configuration of the thermosiphon loop. A heat transfer coefficient of 27. 3 kW/m 2 ᵒC and 33. 4 kW/m 2 ᵒC was achieved for 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ taper angles respectively. The heat transfer performance was analyzed with HFE 7000 as the working fluid. The performance of the benchtop thermosiphon loop was evaluated for three liquid fill volumes resulting in three different <b>liquid</b> <b>heads</b> available in the thermosiphon loop. Based on the benchtop thermosiphon loop performance a new cooler was designed and built for CPU cooling in RIT’s data center. The performance of the new thermosiphon loop used in CPU cooling was compared with the air and water based coolers currently used in the data center. The maximum CPU temperature achieved for thermosiphon loop was 84. 4 ᵒC under the stress test. The maximum CPU temperatures for air based and water based coolers were 82. 6 ᵒC and 63. 4 ᵒC respectively under the stress test...|$|R
