5|$|In March 2014, Dot is told by {{the police}} that Nick has died of {{respiratory}} failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne {{to tell the truth}} and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.|$|E
5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|They {{lose the}} {{diamonds}} {{in the plane}} crash and {{spend much of their}} time on the island searching for them. Paulo suspects they are the only reason for their relationship, and thus does not tell Nikki when he finds them on their thirty-third day after the crash. One day while <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jungle, they come across the , a scientific research station built in the early 1980s. Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the diamonds in the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the Others speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki walking into a small orange-lit room with a black object on a stall. After touching it, the entire room starts to light up, and the singer subsequently walks around singing to the song; scenes are digitally-altered and edited during the process. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is seen wearing a white outfit while a mysterious light shines around the room. The video subsequently ends with the singer sitting on a small chair, <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance. The clip was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best (2016). The visual was additionally used as the theme song for Japanese cosmetics company Aube's launch of their lipstick range, which led to Hamasaki becoming their spokeswoman and appearing in a campaign video.|$|E

25|$|Angles are {{commonly}} defined {{according to the}} right-hand rule. Namely, they have positive values when they represent a rotation that appears clockwise when <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> positive direction of the axis, and negative values when the rotation appears counter-clockwise. The opposite convention (left hand rule) is less frequently adopted.|$|E

25|$|When <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Observation Sculpture {{through its}} sights (an {{aperture}} or circles), the space beyond is (roughly) framed. Combining the different perspectives framed, the little sculpture, usually in bronze, takes shape after the space it is aiming at.

25|$|Independent {{researcher}} Warren Whittaker, who {{had presented}} {{evidence at the}} 2001 seminar based on his and Lindsay Knight's experimental wreck-locating system, wrote in The Weekend Australian in July 2006, reiterating his belief that HMAS Sydney Search Pty Ltd was <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong area. Through hindcasting based on the known movements of flotsam and the lifeboats from Kormoran, Whittaker incorrectly surmised that both ships would be located {{just west of the}} Abrolhos Islands.|$|E
25|$|The single-lens microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek were {{relatively}} small devices, the largest being about 5cm long. They {{are used by}} placing the lens very close {{in front of the}} eye, while <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the sun. The other side of the microscope had a pin, where the sample was attached in order to stay close to the lens. There were also three screws to move the pin and the sample along three axes: one axis to change the focus, and the two other axes to navigate through the sample.|$|E

25|$|As a Google search shows, {{the phrase}} ad orientem is today much more {{commonly}} used to describe a particular orientation of a priest in Christian liturgy, facing the apse or wall behind the altar, with priest and people <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction, {{as opposed to the}} versus populum orientation, in which the priest faces the congregation. In this use, the phrase is not necessarily related to the geographical direction in which the priest is looking and is employed even if he is not facing to the east or even has his back to the east.|$|E
25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because {{from the point of view}} of the source, <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.|$|E
25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert.|$|E

25|$|As of December 2007, YTL Corporation Group {{managing}} director, Tan Sri Francis Yeoh Sock Ping, express {{great confidence}} that the project will be approved by both governments. JPMorgan added that almost all regulatory road blocks in building the railway is resolved. The key consideration in the project approval rests {{in the role of}} developing the Iskandar Development Region. On January 2008, the transport minister, Datuk Seri Chan Kong Choy said that the government is still <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proposal and had yet to make a final decision. He added that the train would be Broad gauge and will run at 350km/h. If this is the case, new lines need to be laid down as the currently ERL tracks are only Standard gauge. In March 2008, the government is still studying the social impact of the project through the Economic Planning Unit. The Deputy Prime Minister stress out that the risk and funding of the project will squarely rest on the private sector.|$|E

500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{called it}} a good, but difficult, episode, saying, [...] "the story lines were all {{parallel}} – it was even an anthology, with each story mirroring the next (bringing to mind that memorable scene when Roger, under the influence, is <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and told to look away) ... the themes of male-female entanglement, and disentangle (and yes, hair, once again is a predominant metaphor.) The themes of travel ... of being a stranger {{in a strange land}} ... of life on Mars, or in Plattsburgh ... of alienation, pursuit, and of a generation born during the Holocaust, amid the Holocaust".|$|E

500|$|The {{front cover}} of Life Is Peachy depicts a boy <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, seeing {{a much larger}} person behind him. The photo was taken by Martin Riedl. The design and concept were by Scott Leberacht. Other {{pictures}} in the booklet were taken by Stephen Stickler. Doug Small said that it [...] "continued the threatened child theme as depicted on Korn's artwork." [...] The cover is mostly black and white, with a little boy, hair combed, straightening his tie in a gilt mirror; behind him looms a larger, shadowed presence." [...] Life Is Peachy is, to date, the only album by Korn to feature their name spelled in a different font.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the disaster at Sutton Wick, the non-return valve was redesigned to make such an error impossible. Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that, after the crash, [...] "airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads {{at either end of}} all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other. Items like a non-return valve simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense." [...] Nevertheless, Perry wrote, [...] " [...] would be amazed how many people have still tried {{to do so in the}} forty-seven years since, most realising their mistake after <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|The seal from 1752 {{is shown}} in Figure 2. The beaver honored Albany's past as an {{important}} fur trading port. Adding {{to the history of}} this seal, one historian states, [...] " [...] displays the beaver, but <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original, more like a drowned cat than the fat and sleek animal, it was intended to represent. Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made." [...] In 1755 the original seal (Figure 1) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses. So at this point the city had two seals, one corporate and one public. The earlier seal, however, was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on.|$|E
