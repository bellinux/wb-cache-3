50|$|Patients {{with asthma}} have higher eNO levels than other people. Their levels also rise {{together}} with other clinical and laboratory parameters of asthma (for example, the amount of eosinophils in their sputum). In conditions that trigger inflammation such as upper respiratory tract infections or the inhalation of allergens or plicatic acid, eNO levels rise. The eNO levels also tend to {{vary according to the}} results of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>test</b> results such as the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, drugs used to treat asthma (such as inhaled glucocorticoids or leukotriene receptor antagonists) also reduce eNO levels.|$|E
50|$|Spirometry is {{recommended}} {{to aid in}} diagnosis and management. It is the single best test for asthma. If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It however may be normal in those {{with a history of}} mild asthma, not currently acting up. As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>test</b> may interfere with the results. Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD. It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Periodontitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease {{associated with a}} number of lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia. Both chronic periodontitis (CP) and COPD share similar risk factor profiles. Thus, recognition of interaction between periodontitis and COPD could lead to establishment of better preventive and therapeutic approaches. The microbial analysis of sputum from COPD patients with CP to detect periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) both before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Materials and Methods: The study group comprised 30 individuals diagnosed as COPD with CP. Periodontal indices, <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>test,</b> and P. gingivalis in sputum were assessed before and 6 months after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Results: A decrease in the count of P. gingivalis and decreased periodontal indices values were observed in COPD patients with periodontitis after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. <b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>test</b> (forced expiratory volume in the first/forced vital capacity) was improved in COPD patients with periodontitis after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Conclusions: The study results suggest that nonsurgical periodontal therapy can be a part of treatment protocol in COPD patients because it helps in reducing the P. gingivalis count and improving the lung function...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> {{consists}} of different {{tests to determine}} obstructive or restrictive lung disease. It includes tests for lung mechanics – measurements of lung volumes and flows, tests for gas exchange (diffusion capacity of the lung, blood gas analysis) and tests that confirm airway infllammation.

Results: The results of article present an overview of recommended <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> in follow-up and diagnostic procedure in asthma and COPD. Conclusion: Proper selection of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> in following asthma and COPD patients rationalizes the management of those patients.

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis show that {{research}} in the field of <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in infants has moved from methodological issues towards clinical applications. This development is mainly the result of publications of guidelines for infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> and standardization of the equipment used, by the European Respiratory Society en de American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) (7 - 10). As a result, normative data have become available for different <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> methods, allowing comparison of data from different centers. In addition, several biomedical engineering companies have marketed equipment with specifications according to the guidelines given by the ERS/ATS. These developments are a necessity for wide applications of infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in a clinical setting, such as collaborative studies and multicenter drug trials in infants with airway disease (II). On the other hand, there are high costs for buying complete recording systems and training the staff. In addition, most methods require sedation of the infant. Therefore, infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> measurements will probably be established primarily in larger, mostly academic, centers. The forthcoming challenges for those involved in this field will be to develop methods that are cheap to buy and simple to use, still providing essential information. These methods should be applicable in infants without sedation. When this has been achieved, infant <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> may even move out of the clinic (II) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective 　To {{compare the}} {{different}} expressions of miRNAs of alveolar macrophages (AM) in two {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) models of rat induced by smudging alone or combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion. Methods 　Sixty female Wistar rats {{were randomly assigned}} into 4 groups: control group Ⅰ, control group Ⅱ, COPD model group Ⅰ(cigarette smoke exposure alone, CS) and COPD model group Ⅱ(cigarette smoke exposure + LPS infusion, CS+LPS). COPD rat models were evaluated by chest CT, <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>test</b> and histopathological examination of lungs. The primary AM were acquired and the RNAs were then extracted after carrying out bronchoalveolar lavage. Three pairs of samples were used for detection of miRNAs expression by the method of miRNA microarray chip. The difference was verified by qRT-PCR analysis on another 5 pairs of samples. Data analysis was performed to find out the significantly differential miRNAs expression profiles in COPD rat models. Results 　The chest CT, <b>lung</b> <b>function</b> <b>test</b> and histopathological examination verified the COPD in rats of CS and CS+LPS groups. Compared with control group Ⅰ, the expressions of let- 7 b- 3 p, miR- 376 c- 3 p and miR- 675 - 5 p were down-regulated in CS group with no miRNAs up-regulated. Compared with control group Ⅱ, the expressions of let- 7 b- 3 p and miR- 675 - 5 p were down-regulated, while the expressions of 11 miRNAs were obviously up-regulated in CS+LPS group as miR- 200 b- 3 p, miR 665, miR- 344 b- 1 - 3 p, miR- 34 c- 5 p, miR- 34 b- 5 p, miR- 99 b- 5 p, miR- 129 - 1 - 3 p, miR- 3557 - 5 p, miR- 331 - 5 p, miR- 493 - 5 p and miR- 200 a 3 p.
