25|$|<b>Local</b> <b>integration</b> {{is aiming}} at {{providing}} the refugee with the permanent {{right to stay}} in the country of asylum, including, in some situations, as a naturalized citizen. It follows the formal granting of refugee status by the country of asylum. It is difficult to quantify the number of refugees who settled and integrated in their first country of asylum and only the number of naturalisations can give an indication. In 2014 Tanzania granted citizenship to 162,000 refugees from Burundi and in 1982 to 32,000 Rwandan refugees. Mexico naturalised 6,200 Guatemalan refugees in 2001.|$|E
500|$|The {{new plan}} drew {{extensive}} criticism. [...] Southside legislators feared that only all-white schools would close.

Attorney General Almond voiced his opinion that the new plan would not stop integrationist lawsuits, and that making the governor {{an agent of the}} legislature was clearly unconstitutional.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{and explains}} {{variation in the}} choices of public engagement methods across Ontario’s <b>Local</b> Health <b>Integration</b> Networks, in order to inform the policy space these organizations operate in with respect to enabling citizen participation in regional health planning decisions. The websites of all 14 <b>Local</b> Health <b>Integration</b> Networks (LHINs) were searched for three key documents that detail their past and future public engagement method choices. Drawing from the literature, a multi-metric qualitative scoring framework was designed to explore patterns of variation in public engagement method choices across each region. The findings demonstrate that there is minimal variation in the choices of public engagement methods across <b>Local</b> Health <b>Integration</b> Networks, but suggest that variation in regional characteristics provide different justification for the same methods being chosen across multiple jurisdictions. The study concludes by outlining opportunities for public engagement practitioners in Ontario and other jurisdictions to improve the rigour of the proposed framework and potential use as a predictive tool of public engagement method choice dependent on variation in regional characteristics...|$|R

40|$|An {{image is}} {{captured}} as a coherent set of <b>local</b> <b>integrations</b> of a source field under an aperture function. This formulation is explicit in, for example, well-known scale-space theory. The source may {{be subjected to}} a flow changing the image over time. Depending on the physical model, the source may change as a density (preserving local mass) or as a scalar (preserving local intensity value). In this paper, we derive the dual transformation of the apertures. The apertures must transform in the dual way to create invariance. This has implications for any algorithm estimating flow from image sequences as {{it is based on}} the computational invariants...|$|R
