25|$|Youth Recreation Park {{is one of}} {{the well}} known and popular parks in the city. The park was {{established}} in the '20s-'30s in the English style. It reopened its doors post war and was popular among citizens in the '80s-'90s with its beautiful boat house and tennis courts, as well as merry-go-rounds. The park had a massive reconstruction in 2004 adding to the park a cafe, carting, and various modern entertainments. It is located in the quiet area of the city, in Leningradsky area, and is connected to the <b>Lower</b> <b>Pond.</b> Youth Recreation Park provides entertainment for all age groups. There is also Interpersonal Communications Development Central located in the park. Its beautiful building became a popular backdrop for wedding pictures.|$|E

2500|$|The {{southwest}} corner of Grove Park lies {{next to one of}} Carshalton's ponds (<b>Lower</b> <b>Pond),</b> from where water flows through the park as the River Wandle. Among its features of interest is the Leoni Bridge, situated where Grove Park meets the <b>Lower</b> <b>Pond.</b> It is made of white Portland stone. Its name derives from the conjecture that the Venetian architect Giacomo Leoni designed it. Leoni had been commissioned to design a new mansion for Carshalton Park during the early 18th century (although the mansion itself was never constructed). Grove Park also features Grove House, a large early nineteenth house, a watermill and a cascade. The cascade is near the footbridge leading to the Stone Court corner of the park. The 1.5 metre fall is now ornamental in design, but its original purpose was to create a head of water in order to provide power for the nearby [...] "Upper Mill".|$|E

50|$|Wilson Stream {{originates}} in Upper Wilson Pond {{on the western}} edge of Bowdoin College Grant West. Tributaries North Brook and South Brook flow into the eastern end of Upper Wilson Pond from Mountain Pond and Horseshoe Pond, respectively. The western end of Upper Wilson Pond overflows into the eastern end of <b>Lower</b> Wilson <b>Pond.</b> <b>Lower</b> Wilson <b>Pond</b> is {{in the eastern part of}} Greenville. The southern end of <b>Lower</b> Wilson <b>Pond</b> overflows into Wilson Stream. Wilson Stream flows 17 mi south into Sebec Lake. The Appalachian Trail crosses Wilson Stream approximately 6 mi south of <b>Lower</b> Wilson <b>Pond.</b> Little Wilson Stream flows 8.6 miles east from Shirley to join Wilson Stream approximately 2.5 mi downstream of the Appalachian Trail crossing. Big Wilson Cliffs and Little Wilson Falls and Gorge are scenic highlights along the Appalachian Trail.|$|R
30|$|The net {{movement}} of organic material differed somewhat from the net {{movement of}} inorganic {{material in the}} wetland. High values characterized the volatile suspended solids and dissolved organic nitrogen flux in Main Pond and accounted for 67 and 81 %, respectively, of the wetland flux for these materials (Table  2). Main Pond also accounted for 21 – 35 % of the total and dissolved organic carbon flux of the wetland. Similar to the inorganic materials, the flux of total and dissolved organic carbon, volatile suspended solids and dissolved organic nitrogen was northward into the wetland from the Sacramento River. In contrast, the small and positive chlorophyll a flux of Main Pond accounted for only 4 % of the chlorophyll flux (0.4  kg day− 1) in the wetland. Greater and more positive chlorophyll a flux for <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> than Main Pond indicated Main Pond received its chlorophyll a from <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond.</b> The greater negative phaeophytin flux than chlorophyll a flux for Main Pond and the reverse for <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> also supported the contribution of live chlorophyll a from <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> to Main <b>Pond.</b> Over all, <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> accounted for 87 % (9.1  kg day− 1) of the chlorophyll a flux among the wetland <b>ponds.</b> <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> also produced the majority of total organic carbon (72 %) in the wetland, which again was exported southward into Main Pond. By contrast, Upper Beaver Pond accounted for only 2 – 11 % of the organic material flux, with the largest flux associated with volatile suspended solids (− 6, 949  kg day− 1). Like <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond,</b> the organic material flux in Upper Beaver Pond was characterized by negative values and indicated <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> {{was a source of}} organic material to the river.|$|R

60|$|George {{came out}} with us, coatless, hatless, his {{waistcoat}} all unbuttoned, as he was. We crossed the orchard, over the old bridge, and went to where the slopes ran down to the <b>lower</b> <b>pond,</b> a bank all covered with nettles, and scattered with a hazel bush or two. Among the nettles old pans were rusting, and old coarse pottery cropped up.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while we}} went out also, before the light faded {{altogether}} from the pond. Emily took us into the lower garden to get some ripe plums. The old garden was very low. The soil was black. The cornbind and goosegrass were clutching at the ancient gooseberry bushes, which sprawled by the paths. The garden was not very productive, save of weeds, and perhaps, tremendous lank artichokes or swollen marrows. But at the bottom, where {{the end of the}} farm buildings rose high and grey, there was a plum-tree which had been crucified to the wall, and which had broken away and leaned forward from bondage. Now under the boughs were hidden great mist-bloomed, crimson treasures, splendid globes. I shook the old, ragged trunk, green, with even the fresh gum dulled over, and the treasures fell heavily, thudding down among the immense rhubarb leaves below. The girls laughed, and we divided the spoil, and turned back to the yard. We went down {{to the edge of the}} garden, which skirted the bottom pond, a pool chained in a heavy growth of weeds. It was moving with rats, the father had said. The rushes were thick below us; opposite, the great bank fronted us, with orchard trees climbing it like a hillside. The <b>lower</b> <b>pond</b> received the overflow from the upper by a tunnel from the deep black sluice.|$|E
50|$|Regular {{garden was}} laid in 1720 by Dutch masters of {{landscape}} gardening on three benches {{in front of}} Imperial Palace. At the same time reflecting pool was constructed on the third bench, and there were made two ponds on the river Vangazi flowing from the hill: Upper (Large) and Mill (later included in cascade of <b>Lower</b> <b>ponds).</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond,</b> a small vegetated pond in the {{interior}} of the wetland, was an important source of carbon and accounted for {{a large percentage of the}} total organic carbon and chlorophyll a flux within the wetland. <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> contributed 87 % of the chlorophyll a, 72 % of the total organic carbon and 10 % of the diatom flux among wetland ponds. The lack of water exchange between <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> and the river may have been a critical factor contributing to the high export of carbon from <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> to the other ponds, because it prevented export of carbon out of the wetland. Most of the organic matter in the freshwater tidal Shark River Slough in the Florida Coastal Everglades was produced in isolated bays (Xu et al. 2006). Algal biomass was also greater in pools with long residence time in 33 temporary freshwater pools in Hungary (Boven et al. 2008).|$|R

50|$|The <b>Lower</b> <b>Pond</b> (Нижний пруд) {{is a large}} {{artificial}} pond {{in northern}} Kaliningrad, Russia. It {{was known as the}} Schlossteich while part of Königsberg, Germany, until 1945.|$|E
30|$|Liberty Island is a 21  km 2 {{freshwater}} perennial tidal wetland {{that was}} created by a levee failure in 1998. A system of levees separates this wetland from the Yolo Bypass floodplain on the north, the Sacramento River on the south, Shag Slough on {{the west and the}} Sacramento deep water ship channel on the east (Figure  1). The wetland is called a flooded island because agricultural practices have stripped off the top soil within the levied region so that the surface of the sediment is below sea level. The upper third of the wetland consists of the two shallow ponds, Upper Beaver Pond (1.4  km 2) and <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> (5.6  km 2). These vegetated ponds primarily contain emergent vegetation consisting of tule rush and cattail. Upper Beaver Pond exchanges water with Shag Slough at SSB and <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> at LIBN (Figure  1). <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>pond</b> is located in the interior of the wetland and is not directly connected to a river channel, but water exchange occurs with Upper Beaver Pond at LIBN and the open water pond, Main Pond, at LIBS. Main Pond is a large 14  km 2 open water pond, which comprises two-thirds of the wetland. The southern end of Main Pond at MAIN exchanges water with the Sacramento River. Water is exchanged between all of the ponds, except at low water on ebb tide, when Upper and <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Ponds</b> become disconnected due to an elevated portion of land in the middle of <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond.</b> Water depth in Upper and <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Ponds</b> reaches 2  m at high tide. In Main Pond, water depth is less than 1  m at low tide in the north and gradually increases toward the south, where it is 20  m deep. The depth of Main Pond also decreases from 1.5 to 3  m in the west to 0.3 to 2  m in the east.|$|R
30|$|Increased tidal {{asymmetry}} {{coupled with}} wetland topography facilitated the inorganic and organic material export from <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> {{in the interior}} of the wetland. During flood tide, high flows pushed water up and into the elevated region in the northern quadrat of <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond.</b> As the flood water receded, it left a pool of water that was isolated from the rest of <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> by a sill, which prevented the pooled flood water from fully draining during ebb tide. The pooled flood water facilitated accumulation of inorganic material and the growth and accumulation of organic material. The pooled flood water and its accumulated inorganic and organic material was released back into the wetland during the next flood tide, when water was again pushed into the northern end of the pond and partially drained back into the wetland during ebb. The release of this pooled flood water back into the wetland produced a 40 % increase in the organic and inorganic material export from <b>Lower</b> Beaver <b>Pond</b> on ebb tide. Most of the material flux also occurred on ebb tide for freshwater tidal bayous in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and freshwater tidal wetlands off the Hudson River (Stern et al. 1991; Arrigoni et al. 2008).|$|R
5000|$|In 1912 {{the site}} {{consisted}} of [...] "a small ruinous timber-framed building, {{used as a}} cowshed, mainly of 15th century date but bearing traces of earlier features. On the hillside itself is a segment of a moat encircling {{a third of the}} hill and the embankments of three communicating fishponds covering about 4 acres. The two <b>lower</b> <b>ponds</b> still contain water while the upper is used as an orchard". In 1913 it was thought to be the ruins of a castle, a possibility which David Cathcart-King mentions in his 1983 work Castellarium anglicanum.|$|R
