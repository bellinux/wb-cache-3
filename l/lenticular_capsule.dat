40|$|BACKGROUND: Alport {{syndrome}} is a progressive genetic disease which is characterised by glomerulonephritis, sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. We aimed {{to present a}} clinical case of a patient with Alport syndrome with spontaneous anterior lens capsule rupture. CASE REPORT: A 16 -year-old male with histologically proven Alport syndrome was hospitalised in the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital „Prof. Stoyan Kirkovich“, Stara Zagora with low vision, pain, redness, high IOP and rupture of the anterior <b>lenticular</b> <b>capsule</b> of the right eye. Phacoaspiration was successfully performed (Millenium, Bausch& Lomb, Rochester, New York, USA) with the bimanual irrigation-aspiration system (Geuder AG, Heidelberg, Germany) with excellent visual results. CONCLUSION: As the {{syndrome is}} quite rare {{and can lead to}} diagnostic difficulties for the ophthalmologist complications such as spontaneous or traumatic rupture of the capsule are not uncommon. In such cases, phacoaspiration is an efficient method for clear lens extraction after ruptures of the anterior <b>lenticular</b> <b>capsule</b> of young patients with Alport syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Behçet's disease (BD) is a multisystem {{vascular}} {{inflammatory disease}} with several clinical manifestations. Intracranial aneurysms are an extremely rare but nevertheless severe complication of BD. We report {{a case of}} a 44 -year-old man. The diagnosis of BD was made based on the presence of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA-) B 51 in the absence of evidence of other diseases. MRI showed an ancient ischemic right capsulolenticular lesion, subacute white matter hypersignals of the left <b>capsule</b> <b>lenticular</b> region, and multiple arterial aneurysms. The patient underwent two-month systemic high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy associated with severe neurological deficiency upon admission and severe impairment upon discharge. A thorough review of the literature showed 20 case reports of intracranial aneurysms in BD...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to further define the {{clinical}} features of subcortical aphasia in children with deep brain infarcts and to define the sequelae associated with childhood strokes. We retrospectively studied nine children with left subcortical brain infarcts who presented with acquired language disorder and underwent language investigations based on standardized tests. Stroke in these patients involved the left internal <b>capsule,</b> <b>lenticular</b> or thalamic nuclei, or a combination of these. Early aphasic manifestations following the deep cerebral infarcts affected language expression. These included mutism, nonfluent speech, word finding difficulties, and phonemic and semantic paraphasia. Speech comprehension was generally more preserved. All patients subsequently improved, although variably; sequelae such as dysfluency, word finding difficulties, and written language learning impairment could be detected through standardized tests in six of them (all younger than 6 years at the time of the infarct). Two of the three remaining patients (both older than 6 years at the time of the infarct) had a full recovery. Our study confirms the concept of childhood subcortical aphasia, depicts the linguistic profile in these patients, and sustains the indication of systematic formal language assessment during the follow-up of all children with subcortical infarct involving the dominant hemisphere.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} thrombolysis in stroke patients {{is explained by}} the increased rate of recanalization, which limits infarct growth. However, the efficacy could also {{be explained by the}} protection of specific sites of the brain. Here, we investigate where is this outcome-related tissue at risk using voxel-based analysis. METHODS: We included 68 acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion on the admission MRI performed within 6  h of symptoms onset (H 6) and 16 controls. MCA recanalization was assessed using the magnetic resonance angiography performed at day  1 (D 1). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes were analyzed using a voxel-based method between patients vs. controls group at admission (H 6) in non-recanalized vs. recanalized and in 3 -month poor vs. good outcome patients at D 1. RESULTS: Complete or partial MCA recanalization was observed in 52 of 68 patients. Good outcome at 3  months occurred in 40 patients (59 %). In non-recanalized patients, ADC was decreased in the deep MCA and watershed arterial territory (the <b>lenticular</b> nucleus, internal <b>capsule,</b> and the overlying periventricular white matter). This decrease was not observed in recanalized patients at D 1 or patients at H 6. Fiber tracking suggested that the area is crossed by the cortico-spinal, cerebellar, and intra-hemispheric association tracts. Finally, this area almost co-localized with the area associated with poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A clinically relevant area of tissue at risk may occur in patients with MCA infarcts at the level of deep white matter fiber tracts. These findings suggest that neuroprotection research should be refocused on white matter...|$|R
