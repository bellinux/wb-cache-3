The litigation involved <b>lands</b> that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of <b>lands</b> previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these <b>lands</b> passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's <b>lands</b> were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter.

40|$|The mega {{cities of}} China {{are faced with}} great {{pressure}} from conflict between huge <b>land</b> demand for construction use and limited resources. To improve this situation, {{it is necessary to}} slow the increasing rate of built-up <b>land</b> and even reduce the existing built-up <b>land</b> by improving <b>land</b> use efficiency.

To address these issues, we developed a model named “current-plan-requirement response (CPRR) ”, to optimize the <b>land</b> quotas. With this model, we investigated the current status of <b>land</b> use, the process of <b>land</b> use planning, and the requirements of <b>land</b> use planning with urban sprawl deceleration in Shanghai.

30|$|The {{state has}} a strict scope for the {{collective}} use of rural <b>land</b> [1]. Rural <b>land</b> transfer refers to the circulation of collective construction <b>land,</b> which mainly includes farmer’s own housing <b>land,</b> <b>land</b> used by rural self-owned enterprises, and <b>land</b> occupied by rural public places and facilities [2]. <b>Land</b> transfer is a method of <b>land</b> use permitted by national laws. It must be subject to scope and conditional restrictions in order to lease and resell rural collective <b>land.</b> There are many details of the transfer of <b>land</b> in rural areas and the sale of <b>land</b> in cities [3]. The same is true whether the <b>land</b> in the cities or in the countryside is a commodity with circulation value. However, {{the fact that the}} <b>land</b> has an immovable position also allows the <b>land</b> circulation to not circulate the <b>land</b> itself. It is actually the change of ownership of the <b>land</b> within a certain period of time. Domestic <b>land</b> transfer and foreign <b>land</b> resale are two different concepts. This is because foreign <b>land</b> is privately owned and domestic <b>land</b> is owned by rural collectives. The impact of the transfer of collectively owned <b>land</b> in China is more complicated than the impact of <b>land</b> transfer abroad.
