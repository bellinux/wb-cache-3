Nowadays the development of ballistic tests aimed to design a bullet-proof material {{to be able to}} reduce as much as possible bullets energy which generated by the firing process. 3 D simulation has been performed to study the ballistic resistance of ductile target collides with projectile with conical nose at normal collision. The angle formed between the target sheet and the projectile is 90 o. The first simulation used 81, 06 grams 4340 aluminum steel projectile which has Caliber-Radius-Head (CRH) 3, 0, with 88. 9 mm long and 12. 9 mm in diameter. This projectile collides with the target plate which has a 6061 -T 6 aluminum material with a thickness of 26. 3 mm. The second simulation used Weldok 460 E steel plate as a target with a thickness of 12 mm and a diameter of 500 mm, collides with hardened Arne projectile with 20 mm in diameter and 98 mm in length. The third simulation used 608 mm aluminum plate with 608 mm length of the plate.

50|$|Ignatowski wrote {{some papers}} on special relativity. In 1910 {{he was to}} first who tried to derive the Lorentz {{transformation}} by group theory only using the relativity principle, and without the postulate of the constancy {{of the speed of}} light (1910b, 1911b, 1911c, 1911h). Although he derived the correct transformation, the invariant limiting speed remained undefined. Ignatowski had to resort to length contraction of moving electrostatic fields in order to identify this <b>limiting</b> <b>velocity</b> with the velocity of light in vacuum. While some said that this approach was insufficient and the second postulate is still needed, others continued the attempts to derive special relativity without the light postulate (see Postulates of special relativity). Ignatowski also investigated the status of rigid bodies within special relativity (1910a, 1911a). He concluded that velocities greater than the speed of light are possible, even though he showed that those are not signal velocities and therefore are not in conflict with relativity (1910b, 1911g). He also formulated a relativistic theory of hydrodynamics (1911f).|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.Because of this experiment Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a <b>limiting</b> <b>velocity</b> in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed.

40|$|Ballistic impact {{performance}} of structures made of polymer matrix composites is presented. During the ballistic impact event, the energy lost by the projectile is {{absorbed by the}} composite target through various energy absorbing mechanisms. Compression of the target directly below the projectile, compression in the region surrounding the impacted zone, stretching and tensile failure of yarns/layers in the region consisting of primary yarns, tensile deformation of yarns/layers in the region consisting of secondary yarns, delamination, matrix cracking and friction between the projectile and the target are the energy absorbing mechanisms. Additionally, conical deformation on the back face of the target and energy absorbed by the moving cone is the special feature of thin composites whereas energy absorbed by shear plugging of the target is the special feature of thick composites. In the present studies, a generalized approach is used and both shear plugging and tensile failure during conical deformation are considered. The generalized approach used is valid {{for a wide range}} of laminate thicknesses. Based on the generalized approach, {{performance of}} typical 2 D plain weave fabric composites has been presented in this study. Ballistic impact experiments were performed to validate the analytical predictions. The analytical predictions of ballistic <b>limit</b> <b>velocity</b> and plug dimension are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.
