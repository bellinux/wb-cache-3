5|$|A special {{tribute to}} five-time host Johnny Carson was {{presented}} by host Chris Rock with previous emcee Whoopi Goldberg discussing Carson's legacy to {{television and the}} Academy Awards in the segment. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Best Actor winner Jamie Foxx briefly eulogized singer and musician Ray Charles, who died in June 2004, during his acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast.</b> After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not}} know which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail. He was stopped when Sting interfered in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell. The match result was ruled a no-contest, with Joe retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, during Victoria's Women's Championship match, Wilson {{ran down}} and gave Victoria a facebuster costing her the victory. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> it had {{appeared}} that Candice Michelle and Victoria {{may have gotten}} their revenge as Trish Stratus found an unconscious Wilson {{laid out in the}} Divas' Locker room with Candice's Playboy magazine lying across Wilson. At WrestleMania 22, Wilson gained revenge by defeating the evil Candice Michelle in a Playboy Pillow Fight match. On the June 12 episode of Raw, Wilson defeated Candice Michelle in the first ever Wet and Wild match, a wrestling match involving water balloons and squirt guns, in which the winner of the match would be {{on the cover of the}} WWE 2006 Summer Special magazine. After the match, the feuds and alliances between the women ended, and they continued to appear together in television segments with no mention of their time as former allies and enemies. On the July 17 episode of Raw, Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match of Stratus and Wilson against Victoria and Mickie. James entered the match without being tagged in, so Candice threw her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice, but she ducked out of the way, allowing Stratus to perform a Stratusfaction for the victory. As a result of her participation in the match, Candice became a face. Their allies between Candice and Victoria came to an end.|$|E

50|$|Also in 1993, Ry Cooder {{arranged}} to have Masley record music for the soundtrack of the film Geronimo: An American Legend. When the soundtrack album was issued, Masley's name did not appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> credits.

25|$|During a Monday Night Football {{telecast}} on September 15, 2008, Kornheiser made {{a comment}} about a clip of the ESPN Deportes crew's call of a Felix Jones touchdown, saying, “I took high-school Spanish, and that either means ‘nobody is going to touch him’ or ‘could you pick up my dry cleaning in the morning.’” <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Kornheiser apologized on-air for the remark.|$|E
25|$|On the February 18, 2008 {{broadcast}} of his radio show, Carolla {{announced that he}} {{would be one of the}} contestants on the next season of Dancing with the Stars. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> it was revealed to Adam that his partner would be Julianne Hough. He was voted off on the April 8, 2008 episode after his performance of the Paso Doble, after incorporating a demonstration of unicycle riding in his dance routine.|$|E
500|$|Natalie Cole was {{initially}} scheduled {{to sing the}} nominated song [...] "I Finally Found Someone" [...] from The Mirror Has Two Faces on the show after its songwriter and original performer Barbra Streisand declined to do so. However, after Cole contracted the flu, she withdrew for her performance duties and was eventually replaced by Celine Dion who also sang [...] "Because You Loved Me" [...] <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wilson rarely flubbed his lines. His {{most famous}} {{incident}} {{occurred on the}} January 8, 1950 <b>broadcast.</b> <b>The</b> script called for him to refer to columnist Drew Pearson, but Wilson read the name as [...] "Dreer Pooson." [...] <b>Later</b> on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> during a murder-mystery skit, Frank Nelson {{took advantage of the}} situation. Benny asked Nelson, [...] "Pardon me, are you the doorman?" [...] and Nelson, in his customary sarcastic manner, came back with: [...] "Well who do you think I am, Dreer Pooson?," [...] to sustained laughter and applause.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{its success}} in London, Thunder Rock {{has had a}} lasting legacy. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> 1940 <b>the</b> BBC <b>broadcast</b> a live radio version, and in 1946 they {{produced}} an adaption for television. In 1942, Thunder Rock {{was turned into a}} film, directed by the Boulting Brothers, also starring Michael Redgrave. (See Thunder Rock (film)) ...|$|R
50|$|Crosby had {{appeared}} on radio {{on many occasions}} {{as a member of}} The Rhythm Boys trio, first as part of the Paul Whiteman orchestra and <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nightly <b>broadcasts</b> with Gus Arnheim from <b>the</b> Cocoanut Grove <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ambassador Hotel <b>in</b> Los Angeles. It was at the Cocoanut Grove that Bing's solos made him stand out from the Rhythm Boys and a dispute with the management at the Grove more or less led to the break-up of <b>the</b> trio <b>in</b> May 1931. Bing had already started making records under his own name and then he made several short films for Mack Sennett which were well received.|$|R
2500|$|If {{something}} {{were not}} done by January, the affiliates reasoned, they would instate syndicated programming or move up their news broadcasts and preempt Leno. Desperate for a decision, Ludwin, Gaspin and Zucker kicked around possible solutions for their dilemma, such as cutting Leno {{to a few}} nights per week. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Vickers moved the most popular comedy segments to the second act of The Jay Leno Show, moving their [...] "10 at 10" [...] segment to <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast.</b> Gaspin again received the suggestion to put Leno back at 11:35, and soon began working {{on a plan to}} cut The Jay Leno Show to a half-hour, leading into Conan's Tonight Show around midnight. The biggest calamity in this scenario would be Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, which would get bumped to 1am. The reconfigured lineup could start in March 2010, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics. Zucker preferred a plan for Leno to include an occasional guest and comedy piece, while Dick Ebersol favored returning to the way it once was, with Leno at 11:35 and O'Brien at 12:35 (this plan would effectively cancel Late Night). Gaspin laid out his plan to Zucker one week before Christmas, but both agreed to wait it out for the new year, as to not [...] "ruin anybody's holiday season".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Hadley {{said that}} if either Mr Ahmed or his [...] "grub of a wife" [...] still owned their shop, [...] "they should {{completely}} and utterly be sent out of business". 2GB refused to cover legal costs {{in connection with this}} case ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{being interviewed}} by ESPN <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Tobin famously said [...] "Who {{the hell is}} Mel Kiper?!" [...] Tobin later called a press conference where he ranted about Kiper for several minutes, stating that Kiper had been biased against the Colts ever since they moved from Baltimore, Kiper's home.|$|E
50|$|The equator was crossed for <b>the</b> {{first time}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program when it {{switched}} to the Australian contributions, which was at 5:22 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). This was the most technically complicated point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> as both <b>the</b> Japanese and Australian satellite ground stations had to reverse their actions: Tokyo had to go from transmit mode to receive mode, while Melbourne had to switch from receive to transmit mode. The first segment dealt with trams leaving the South Melbourne tram depot with Australian Broadcasting Commission's Brian King explaining that sunrise was many hours away as it was winter there. Two scientific segments, <b>later</b> on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> were also included; one, presented from Canberra by the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Eric Hunter showed experiments being {{carried out by the}} Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to extend the frequency of cereal crop cycles, while the second dealt with the Parkes Observatory tracking a deep space object.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{first several}} seasons <b>the</b> NBC Symphony <b>broadcasts</b> were [...] "sustaining" [...] programs, {{meaning that they}} were paid for and {{presented}} by NBC itself. <b>In</b> <b>later</b> years <b>the</b> <b>broadcasts</b> were commercially sponsored, primarily by General Motors. Under GM's sponsorship <b>the</b> NBC Symphony <b>broadcasts</b> went out under the title of General Motors Symphony of the Air, {{not to be confused}} with the later orchestra of the same name. Other sponsors included the House of Squibb, the Reynolds Metals Company, and the Socony Vacuum Oil Company (Mobil).|$|R
5000|$|As a {{response}} of shrinking sales, the Employee Pricing Plus program was extended {{through the end}} of August, three new TV ads, which did not feature Dr. Z, were added to the August campaign. After three months however DaimlerChrysler hurriedly withdrew the Dr. Z campaign due to a significant loss in market-share. However, some of the Dr. Z ads can still be seen in Canadian television. <b>In</b> <b>later</b> <b>broadcasts,</b> <b>the</b> tagline <b>in</b> Dr. Z TV ads was changed to 'See <b>the</b> best <b>in</b> German and North American design in your Dodge and Chrysler dealer.' ...|$|R

It is widely credited as the first soap opera broadcast on television. It may be more accurately described as the first daytime drama or the first soap opera strip, as it was preceded by DuMont series Faraway Hill in 1946 and Highway to <b>the</b> Stars <b>in</b> 1947, {{both of which are}} described as soap operas but aired <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evenings and <b>broadcast</b> only once a week.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Bluegrass Miracle" [...] on November 9, 2002, a {{football}} game won by LSU against Kentucky with a last-second touchdown pass.

Hunt was a defensive back and was not on the field. Hawthorne acknowledged it was Henderson <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast.</b> The mistake was later deleted from archived versions of the broadcast.|$|E

So when TBS went to an interview conducted between innings by Sam Ryan in the Dodgers' dugout with Mattingly, the assumption was that Ryan would ask Mattingly what happened. Ryan then proceeded to ask Mattingly instead, how he thought Zack Greinke was pitching, what he thought of the game so far. <b>Later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Cal Ripken, Jr. brought up what we had all seen when Ethier came up to bat again in the fifth, saying, [...] "We’re still guessing what that argument was all about." ...|$|E
