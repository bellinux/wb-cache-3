5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle <b>length</b> {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle <b>length</b> of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle <b>length</b> shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle <b>length</b> is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E
5|$|Hair <b>length</b> is {{most often}} {{measured}} (in centimeters or inches) from {{the line of the}} scalp on the forehead up over the highest point of the skull to its termination, and sometimes from the crown, the latter resulting in 10 centimeter lower values in average. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to the part of the body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, shoulder <b>length,</b> lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist <b>length,</b> hip-length, classic <b>length</b> (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the buttocks), thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor <b>length</b> hair.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg <b>length,</b> with foot <b>length</b> only about 25%–30% the <b>length</b> of the lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the <b>length</b> of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial <b>length</b> in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E
