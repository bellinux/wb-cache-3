40|$|White spot sydrome virus (WSSV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} viral disease of shrimp. Several studies to control the disease have been done. Tank experiments identified WSSV risk factors related to the physico chemical properties of the water. A few studies reported pond level WSSV risk factors. This study identifies the risk factors associated with essentially two different farming systems: polyculture and semi-intensive monoculture of Penaeus monodon. Data were gathered from a total of 174 shrimp farmers in eight provinces of the Philippines using a structured questionnaire. Forty-seven variables related to pond history and site description, period of culture, pond preparation techniques, water management, culture methods, feed and other inputs, and biosecurity measures were investigated. In the analysis for combined monoculture and polyculture farms, feeding <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> was identified as important WSSV risk factors. In addition to feeding <b>live</b> <b>molluscs,</b> sharing of water source with other farms, having the same receiving and water source, larger pond size, and higher stocking density were identified as important WSSV risk factors in monoculture farms. Climate, i. e. stocking during the cold months and sludge removal and its deposition on the dikes were identified as WSSV risk factors in polyculture farms. Protective factors, listed in decreasing significance, were feeding with planktons and high mangrove to pond area ratio, both observed in the dataset with both monoculture and polyculture farms, while only the latter was observed in the dataset for monoculture farms only. No protective factor was observed in the dataset for polyculture farms. This study confirmed the negative effect of sharing water source with other farms and identified several new factors influencing WSSV infection such as feeding <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> increases the risk, while feeding with planktons and high mangrove to pond area ratio reduce the risk.

40|$|In 1999, {{the world}} {{aquaculture}} production of molluscs {{was estimated at}} 9. 4 million tonnes which represents approximately a 23 % contribution to the global aquaculture production. Aquaculture of molluscs has been growing at an average annual rate of 11 % over the past decades, although some activities - such as aquaculture of pectens or abalones - were growing even more rapidly. In many countries, {{there is a significant}} mollusc aquaculture, traditionally based on wild stocks. However, these natural populations frequently do not fulfil market demand, because of low value of the product, over-fishing of the resource and/or mass mortality outbreaks caused by diseases. A frequent answer to this situation has been the introduction of new stocks or new species in these areas (Grizel, 1996).

40|$|Global {{molluscan}} {{aquaculture production}} is continuously increasing, dominated by five species, among which the Pacific cupped oyster, Crassostrea gigas, predominates.

Hatchery development contributes significantly to the demand for international transfers of live molluscs; a consequence of which pathogen transfer via transfer of <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> is currently recognised as a major cause of epizootic disease outbreaks. Diseases are a primary constraint to mollusc aquaculture growth and sustainability, severely impacting socio-economic development in many countries. Several diseases which occur in hatcheries could be disseminated with live transfers to grow-out areas. On the other hand, hatchery production may also be a way to provide disease-free juveniles and therefore be a pivotal tool to prevent the transfer of infected stocks to susceptible areas. After reviewing the importance of hatcheries for molluscs and mollusc diseases in hatcheries, this paradox in health risk and management is discussed...|$|E
50|$|Cyrtopleura costata has {{a pair of}} brittle, {{asymmetric}} white {{valves and}} can grow to about 7 in in length. The anterior end is elongated and has a rounded point which is used for digging through the substrate.

In the living animal, the valves are covered by the periostracum, a thin grey protective layer. This coating has usually been abraded when the empty shells are washed up on the beach, and the valves are usually found singly because the muscles that hold them together are weak.

A total of 2, 980 samples of shellfish from Galicia (N. W. Spain) were tested for the presence of Salmonella spp. between September 1998 and August 2001. The overall incidence of Salmonella was 1. 8 % and showed a slight rise during the 3 years of the study. Mussels and oysters presented a higher incidence than clams and cockles, possibly because of their distinct growing habitat. A seasonal pattern was noted for the isolation of Salmonella spp. : 54 % of the isolations were detected from September to November. That nearly 67 % of the total Salmonella was isolated from shellfish with fecal coliform levels < 300 / 100 g (the maximum level criteria in the European Communities regulations) supported the view that low levels of fecal coliforms do not necessarily indicate the absence of Salmonella. A total of nine serovars were found in the 54 Salmonella isolated. Salmonella Senftenberg was the most frequent (50 %), followed by Salmonella Typhimurium (18 %) and Salmonella Agona (17 %).

40|$|Effective {{methods of}} {{traceability}} are urgently required {{for use in}} research {{as well as in}} different types of aquaculture operations and to control trade in aquatic animals and products. In regard to the marking of fish, many different tagging methods have been described and the method to be used depends on the purpose and need for tagging. In contrast, for molluscs and crustaceans, only a few methods of marking such animals have been described, due to the practical difficulties. The authors first describe the different methods for tracing fish and fishery products, by means of external tags, such as Floy tags, Carlin tags and passive integrated transponder tags; chemical marking using inorganic substances such as silver nitrate or potassium nitrate, pigments, oxytetracycline, etc.; and several different types of electronic devices in which basic information such as the strain of fish, farm of origin or weight can be stored. Genetic traceability using deoxyribonucleic acid profiling is developing quite rapidly for cultured brood stocks and wild populations. This technique may be used with very high degrees of confidence to assign to or exclude animals or products from their claimed origin, paternity or strain, and may be used as evidence in court proceedings. The second section of this paper describes the traceability of <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> for restocking and for human consumption. In these applications, genetic markers have been demonstrated to be suitable. Mechanical tagging on a small scale for research purposes has also been used. Otherwise, the only means of tracing <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> are the movement documents and the labelling on boxes that certifies the origin of the commodity. The third section describes the methods available for tracing live and dead crustaceans. A large variety of physical tagging methods for decapod crustaceans is described, such as the injection of biological stains (fast green, Niagara sky blue, trypan red and blue) and external tags such as coloured streamer tags, wire tags and a variety of anchor tags. Furthermore, a number of different internal coding methods, such as the coded micro-wire tags and injected elastomer tags are discussed in detail. As is the case for fish, genetic molecular techniques are also applied in population studies of crustaceans; some of the molecular genetic methods are described. Prawns for human consumption are most frequently packed whole or as tails after the necessary sorting, washing and freezing and the only way of performing a traceback is through documents relating to movement, invoices, health certificates and labelling of the boxes. The minimum requirements for labelling would be the content of the packages, i. e. species, quantity, identification of the manufacturer (name and address), packing place, importer/exporter or vendor of the product, in addition to the loading bill number.

40|$|Dicathais orbita is a predatory marine whelk of {{interest}} {{as a new}} source of protein for potential production in aquaculture. Establishment of a successful aquaculture industry based on this species will require optimisation of their diet for fast growth and survival, whilst maintaining a good proximate composition in the flesh. Here we compare the effects of four diets fed to juvenile D. orbita over a 12 week period, to evaluate consumption, feed conversion, growth rates, mortalities and proximate composition. It was found that diet impacts significantly on the growth and survival rates of this whelk, with bivalve feeds resulting in significantly higher consumption (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and growth rates (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) compared to artificial pellets, despite similar feed conversion ratios (P = 0. 359).

From June 1998 to December 2001, {{a total of}} 3, 410 samples of steamed frozen mussels and items related to their manufacture were analyzed {{for the presence of}} Salmonella. Salmonella Senftenberg was isolated in 573 (16. 8 %) samples, and no other serovar was detected. The contamination episodes extended for several months. Salmonella Senftenberg colonies from the first contamination events showed a rugose morphology on agar with a shiny crystalline layer and limited colony formation on microbiological media. These contaminations were mainly associated with brine (300 g of NaCl per liter), while the <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> that were being processed were free of Salmonella. When the brine contaminations were nearly controlled, new episodes were detected that were associated with live mussels. In the new episodes, colonies showed the typical characteristics of Salmonella and normal growth on agar. Salmonella Senftenberg presented a high resistance to unfavorable environments and showed a preference for clean environments. While Salmonella Senftenberg could be isolated from mussels after steam treatment, it could not survive after immersion in water at 80 °C for 1 min. This fact was used to develop a process to remove contamination from products, minimizing the health risk associated with frozen mussel consumption. The general incidence of Salmonella Senftenberg in facilities and mussels was reduced from 31. 2 % in 1998 to 2. 5 % in 2001. During this study, no cases of illness from consumption of frozen mussels were reported, indicating a possible lack of virulence of Salmonella Senftenberg in these contamination events...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} factors {{limiting}} molluscs production {{is the presence of}} pathogens and diseases. Disease agent transfer via transfers of <b>live</b> <b>molluscs</b> has been a major cause of disease outbreaks and epizootics. Because of that, the European Union has adopted several decisions and directives, the last in 2006 (2006 / 88 /EC) to control movements of marine organisms over the European countries. Once the disease is established in a determined area its eradication is a complicated task because life cycle of pathogens are not completely known and only a good and early diagnosis of the disease could be the most appropriate way to deal with it. Besides, molluscs do not have an adaptive immune response and vaccination strategies are not possible. Molluscs listed diseases under EU legislation are mainly protozoan parasites, that's why histological techniques are recognized for their diagnosis. However, molecular techniques are being increasingly used primarily as confirmatory techniques of the presence of the pathogens but also in disease monitoring programs. Research perspectives are mainly focussed in the optimization, of the already described techniques to gain in sensitivity and sensibility and in the development of new molecular biology techniques (quantitative real time PCRs), that are faster and easier to apply and that allow a positive diagnosis even in early stages of infection. However, molecular tools detect DNA sequences of the pathogen which does not imply that pathogen is viable in the cell host and the infection is established. Consequently, it needs to be validated against other techniques, such as histology or in situ hybridization, so that its reliability can be determined.

The pursuit of {{a high level of}} protection of human life and health is one of the fundamental objectives of this laws package. Some points of EC Regulations undergo to critical review by the Commission, and particular attention was given to fishery products. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs, in Annex I, Chapter 1, lays down the food safety criteria for <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs</b> and <b>live</b> echinoderms, tunicates and gastropods and sets sampling-plans, limits and analytical reference methods only concerning bacterial micro-organisms of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli genera. Epidemiological data of the last years reported the consumption of live bivalve shellfish infected by enteric viruses as common cause of human gastroenteritis. Norovirus resulted the leading cause of all human gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. For this reason, {{in the first part of}} Reg. (EC) No 2073 / 2005, in the whereas at point 12, it’s written that the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health (SCVPH) issued an opinion on Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs, noroviruses) on 30 - 31 January 2002. In that opinion it concluded that the conventional fecal indicators are unreliable for demonstrating the presence or absence of NLVs and that the reliance on fecal bacterial indicator removal for determining shellfish purification times is unsafe practice. So Salmonella and Escherichia coli can not be used as only indicators of safety criteria in <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs.</b> In particular, at following points we can read that it may be necessary to set harmonized sampling frequencies at Community level, particularly in order to ensure the same level of controls to be performed throughout the Community. Finally it’s confirmed that criteria for pathogenic viruses in <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs</b> should be established when the analytical methods are developed sufficiently (at point 27). In response to concerns expressed by EU Regulations and taking into account the latest epidemiological data, the international networks dealing prevention, communication and control of human food borne illness diseases caused by enteric viruses have intensified their researches on norovirus. In the past few years, numerous research projects financed by government departments and international organizations have been implemented in order to get more information on these viral pathogens and check most hazardous areas. Among the areas traditionally known for a high fish consumption, there are the Southern Italy regions, where mussels are highly appreciated. Mytilus galloprovincialis accounts for over 22. 4 % of annual consumption of fish (data by E. U., Unimar, Ismea e Uniprom), particularly in Campania the mussels consumption was calculated to be about 41 000 tonnes each year. Since ancient times, in most coastal areas the custom of eating raw or undercooked bivalve shellfish remains common. In this way, however, the assumption of norovirus eventually present and bioaccumulated in shellfish makes easier. Noroviruses are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions and a simple shellfish cleaning or the application of so-called "mild technologies", such as steaming, are unable to eliminate viral contamination. Among filter feeders bivalve, oysters are the species most common in France. In fact the French coastal areas produce more than 90 % of oysters in the EU and France has the historic first for production and consumption of these molluscs. Oysters are traditionally eaten raw, still alive, mostly with a few drops of lemon juice. As for Mytilus galloprovincialis, oysters can represent an hazard for the occurrence of human food borne illness from enteric viruses. In the course of my PhD studies, I have dealt with norovirus in bivalve molluscs. During my first year of PhD study, I concurred to the development of a method for detection of norovirus in <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs</b> working together with researchers of the ISS. The method is based on the use of Real Time RT PCR. During our researches it has been subjected to inner validation by the ISS and it resulted provided of efficiency to research norovirus in <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs.</b> So the Italian Ministry of Health with Note of 24 / 11 / 2009 established the one-step Real Time RT-PCR protocol as the official method to research norovirus in <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs.</b> After this period, during the second year of my PhD studies, I worked for a national monitoring to test norovirus presence in bivalve molluscs. The one-step Real Time RT PCR protocol was used again. Studies have been carried out within a project financed by Campania Region. Shellfish collected from harvesting areas and bought at retailers located on the three coastal districts of Naples, Caserta and Salerno have been tested for norovirus presence. During the last year, my scientific experience has been enriched by a collaboration with IFREMER researchers. IFREMER is one of the French national research centers taking part in FBVE-network. I have worked at the section of the Virology of Laboratory of Microbiology (MIC) sited in Nantes, that was indicated National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for the control of bacterial and viral contamination of bivalve molluscs in France by the French Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. IFREMER has the same functions of the Italian NRL concerning norvirus research and control. During my stage at IFREMER, bioaccumulation physiological activity was analyzed in oysters living in seawater contaminated by Norovirus spp. The research was carried out on samples of Crassostea gigas coming from different harvesting areas located along the Atlantic coast of Brittany, area known for oysters production worldwide.

The maximum amounts of PSP and ASP biotoxins were found in great scallops (532. 6 μg/kg and 1. 0 mg/kg respectively) and the peak for DSP was in blue mussels (107 μg/kg). Conclusion: The analysis of toxicological status of raw bivalve molluscs available on the market in Poland indicates that they are safe for consumers...|$|R
50|$|The chalky {{buttercup}} has {{a symbiotic}} relationship with certain bacteria that live in its gills. These can oxidise methane and hydrogen sulphide, {{both of which are}} found in the low-oxygen, silty sand and mud in which this mollusc burrows. The chalky buttercup uses the energy produced by the bacteria and this enables it to live in an environment that would otherwise be too low in food particles. A similar mutually beneficial arrangement is found among deep-water clams which harbour bacteria that flourish beside the thermal vents where the <b>molluscs</b> <b>live.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ovalipes ocellatus is {{a species}} of crab from eastern North America. It is most {{commonly}} known as the Lady Crab. Other names for it include the Leopard Crab or Atlantic Leopard Crab due to the leopard-like rosette patterns on its shell, the Calico Crab (not to be confused with Hepatus epheliticus), or Ocellated Crab. It has a shell 3 in long and only slightly wider, which is covered in clusters of purple spots. It occurs from Canada to Georgia, and <b>lives</b> mainly on <b>molluscs,</b> such as the Atlantic surf clam.|$|R
40|$|Shellfish {{may pose}} a risk in food safety, {{which is why}} the {{monitoring}} of the waters must be classified before the collection of <b>live</b> bivalve <b>molluscs.</b> These animals are filter feeders that accumulate microorganisms and chemicals present in water. Regulation (EC) 854 / 04 provides that Member States ensure the classification of production areas of bivalve molluscs and establish a surveillance system on the areas of classification and the production facilities that allows continuous monitoring of the healthiness of these products and health quality of water. This paper reports the results of the microbiological production areas of Venus gallina pertaining to the Z. T. 11 Fermo for the years 2009 - 2010. From our experience, it is the important to have an adequate monitoring regional system and the involvement of professionals in this sector for an effective prevention. So it is of great importance to involve all the different workers in this field...|$|R
5000|$|Part of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park is in Dithmarschen. It is {{the most}} {{important}} habitat in the district. Here <b>live</b> many <b>molluscs,</b> including Bivalvia and Gastropeda, Worms and Crustacea, which are welcome nourishment to bigger species. Especially fish use the Wadden Sea as a [...] "Kindergarten" [...] where they can raise their offspring in a protected environment. Although many species of birds settle permanently in the Wadden Sea, use it as a winter habitat or as a resting place. Typical birds in Dithmarschen are dunlin, red knot, bar-tailed godwit, lapwings, charadriidae, eurasian oystercatcher, many species of anatinae- and gulls, terns, sandwich tern, pied avocet, Brent goose and barnacle goose. 200,000 common shelducks alone come in August, The shelducks lose their feathers in the Wadden Sea and therefore are for around three weeks unable to fly. It is almost the whole Common Shelduck colony in North Western Europe. Big Salt marsh are at the Friedrichskoog coast and in the Neufeld Bay.|$|R
50|$|Nacre is {{secreted}} by the {{epithelial cells}} of the mantle tissue of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent nacreous layer, commonly known as mother of pearl. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against parasites and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a blister pearl attached to {{the interior of the}} shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called encystation and it continues as long as the <b>mollusc</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|R
40|$|Some paxilloid asteroids like Astropecten irregularis (Pennant, 1777) and Astropecten aranciacus (Linnaeus, 1758) <b>live</b> {{primarily}} on <b>molluscs.</b> The preys are swallowed and maintained in the stomach; soft tissues are digested before the starfish releases indigestible remains (shells) by the mouth. Inventory of stomach content of these Astropecten makes possible considerations concerning {{the biology of}} the animal and also concerning the mollusc’s fauna on which they prey. This paper relates {{the content of the}} stomach of two series of Astropecten irregularis, three series of Astropecten aranciacus and one specimen of Astropecten sp collected in the Mediterranean Sea between 2000 and 2003...|$|R
