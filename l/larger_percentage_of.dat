5|$|The Soviet-backed {{communist}} government was as harsh towards non-communist Jewish cultural, {{political and social}} institutions as they were towards Polish, banning all alternative parties. Thousands of Jews returned from exile in the Soviet Union, but as their number decreased with legalized aliyah to Israel, the PZPR members formed a much <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the remaining Jewish population. Among them {{were a number of}} Jewish communists who played a highly visible role in the unpopular {{communist government}} and its security apparatus.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the time. For this reason, {{during the winter months}} (and the late fall and early spring) it is {{considered}} an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|In 2011, 22.7% of the {{population}} in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, probably due to the relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots of jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{visual effects}} supervisor, John Sullivan, hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 shots with {{computer}} generated imagery, between a quarter {{and a third}} of what a blockbuster film would feature. The Covenant that appear are all completely computer generated, as is the academy's space elevator, weapons' muzzle flashes and a few shots of Master Chief. Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the budget on the Master Chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

The {{majority of these}} mutations will have no effect; but one might change the color {{of one of the}} butterfly's offspring, making it harder (or easier) for predators to see. If this color change is advantageous, the chance of this butterfly's surviving and producing its own offspring are a little better, and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population.|$|E

25|$|According {{to former}} {{employee}} Alberto Pelliccione, {{the company began}} as security services provider, offering penetration testing, auditing and other defensive capabilities to clients. Pelliccione states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed and accounted for a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> revenues, the organization pivoted in a more offensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Pelliccione claims fellow employees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and payloads – would not communicate with one another, possibly leading to tensions and strife within the organization.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} {{more men than women}} for a limited number of jobs, more men, in {{absolute}} terms, are excluded from formal employment. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, Peru had a {{far-reaching}} {{social safety}} net that included food programs serving 35 percent of the population, and work programs offering temporary employment to unskilled workers. The Cooperative Fund for Social Development funded projects to construct and improve schools, health clinics, rural roads, water and sanitation systems, and electric grids. Toledo placed food and infrastructure programs under the Ministry for Women and Social Development and urged that municipalities implement decentralization. Social safety-net spending in Peru remained well below the Latin American average under Toledo even as it covered a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population, which means that outlays were insufficient to lift many people up out of poverty.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, a {{progressive}} tax system is employed which equates to higher income earners paying a <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> their income in taxes. According to the IRS, the top 1% of income earners for 2008 paid 38% of income tax revenue, while earning 20% {{of the income}} reported. The top 5% of income earners paid 59% of the total income tax revenue, while earning 35% of the income reported. The top 10% paid 70%, earning 46% and the top 25% paid 86%, earning 67%. The top 50% paid 97%, earning 87% and leaving the bottom 50% paying 3% of the taxes collected and earning 13% of the income reported.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis B {{accounts}} for a much <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> health care spending in endemic regions like Asia. In 1997 it accounted for 3.2% of South Korea's total health care expenditures and resulted in $696 million in direct costs. A large majority of that sum was spent on treating disease symptoms and complications. Chronic hepatitis B infections are not as endemic in the United States, but accounted for $357 million in hospitalization costs in the year 1990. That number grew to $1.5 billion in 2003, but remained stable as of 2006, which may be attributable {{to the introduction of}} effective drug therapies and vaccination campaigns.|$|E
25|$|One {{liter of}} ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a liter of {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a liter of gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other words, {{for the same}} energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient. A <b>larger</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the energy available in a liter of alcohol fuel {{can be converted to}} useful work. This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|E
