50|$|For very bright, solid, airless {{objects such}} as Saturn's moons Enceladus and Tethys, whose total {{reflectance}} (Bond albedo) is close to one, a strong opposition effect combines with the high Bond albedo {{to give them a}} geometric albedo above unity (1.4 in the case of Enceladus). Light is preferentially reflected straight back to its source even at low angle of incidence such as on the limb or from a slope, whereas a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surface</b> would scatter the radiation much more broadly. A geometric albedo above unity means that the intensity of light scattered back per unit solid angle towards the source is higher than is possible for any <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
40|$|Ambient {{reflection}} {{is widely}} present in many applications of computer graphics and image processing, which is traditionally modelled as a constant free from environmental factors. This paper reconsiders ambient reflection modelling of <b>Lambertian</b> and Phong <b>surfaces</b> and calculates it as reflection integrations of infinitesimal incident beams from the environment. It reveals that ambient reflection exists in variable forms for <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surfaces</b> of non-convex objects and Phong surfaces of all objects. For convex objects with <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surfaces,</b> ambient reflectance coefficient {{is actually the}} diffuse reflectance coefficient. Generalised ambient reflection models are proposed to calculate ambient reflection using the same reflection model as used in calculation of other reflections. Based on this analysis, new ambient reflection formulations of <b>Lambertian</b> and Phong <b>surfaces</b> are derived to enable efficient computations in computer graphics and image processing.

50|$|Historically, in {{computer}} graphics, the commonly used model to render <b>surfaces</b> started with <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surfaces</b> and progressed first to include simple specular reflections.

5000|$|The term BSDF is {{sometimes}} {{used in a}} slightly different context, for the function describing the amount of the scatter (not scattered light), simply {{as a function of the}} incident light angle. An example to illustrate this context: for perfectly <b>lambertian</b> <b>surface</b> the BSDF (angle)=const. This approach is used for instance to verify the output quality by the manufacturers of the glossy surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Lambertian {{reflectance}} is {{the property}} that defines an ideal [...] "matte" [...] or diffusely reflecting surface. The apparent brightness of a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surface</b> to an observer {{is the same}} regardless of the observer's angle of view. More technically, the surface's luminance is isotropic, and the luminous intensity obeys Lambert's cosine law. Lambertian reflectance is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert, who introduced the concept of perfect diffusion in his 1760 book Photometria.|$|E
50|$|Images of a convex, <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surface</b> under varying illuminations span a {{low-dimensional}} subspace.

40|$|Atmospheric {{visibility}} distance is a {{property of the}} atmosphere, which can be remotely sensed by computer vision. In this aim, a non-linear mapping function between the atmospheric {{visibility distance}} and the contrast in images must be estimated. The function depends on the scene depth distribution {{as well as on}} the radiometry of the scene. In order to calibrate and deploy such camera-based atmospheric visibility estimations, we present two methods which aim at computing the scene depth distribution and the radiometry of the scene beforehand. The scene depth is recovered by registering a full 3 D model of the environment in the frame of the camera. The radiometry of the scene is partly recovered by looking at the temporal correlation between the variation of pixels intensity and the variation of the sky luminance estimated by a luminance meter oriented toward the North direction. Based on clear-sky models, it is demonstrated that such a process detects a set of pixels, which include pixels belonging to North-oriented <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This finding leads to a simplified way of detecting <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surfaces</b> without any additional luminance meter. Good results obtained experimentally prove that such techniques are relevant to estimate the atmospheric visibility distance. 1...|$|R

The accuracy of our dynamic polarimeter, together with the polar decomposition to describe the Mueller matrix (MM) depolarizing action, combine to produce a powerful tool for the proper analysis of this scattering surface. Results allowed us to revisit, for confirmation or revision, the role of some MM elements, as described in the bibliography.

40|$|A {{major issue}} with Time of Flight sensors is the {{presence}} of multipath interference. We present Sparse Reflections Analysis (SRA), an algorithm for removing this interference which has two main advantages. First, it allows for very general forms of multipath, including interference with three or more paths, diffuse multipath resulting from <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and combinations thereof. SRA removes this general multipath with robust techniques based on $L_ 1 $ optimization. Second, due to a novel dimension reduction, we are able to produce a very fast version of SRA, which is able to run at frame rate. Experimental results on both synthetic data with ground truth, as well as real images of challenging scenes, validate the approach...|$|R
40|$|When a <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surface</b> is {{illuminated}} by several chromatic lights the surface normals may be {{recovered from a}} single color image. A robust regression is used to find the ellipsoid in color space on which {{at least half the}} pixels lie. Then the matrix giving the linear relationship between the color and the surface normal, for non-outlier points, is found as a root of the ellipsoid quadratic form. But this root is recovered only up to an arbitrary rotation. An integrability condition can be used to determine the correct rotation. The rotation of recovered surface normals is needed to align partial derivatives p and q with the camera plane and thus establish the object's attitude. Here a new smoothness condition approximating the integrability condition is introduced that allows one to solve for the rotation matrix in closed form. 1 Introduction Consider a single, uniformly colored <b>Lambertian</b> <b>surface</b> {{illuminated by}} a set of distant lights that vary spectrally with orientation from th [...] ...|$|E
