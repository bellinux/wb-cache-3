5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (<b>limites)</b> patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from {{what was perceived as}} an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
5|$|This line of {{occupation}} of Britain was consolidated {{as one of}} the <b>limites</b> (defensible frontiers) of the empire by its construction. It is a stone fortification built across the width of what is now northern England. The wall was 80 Roman miles (73.5 statute miles or 117 kilometres) long, its width and height dependent on the construction materials which were available nearby. East of the River Irthing the wall was made from squared stone and measured 3metres (9.7ft) wide and 5–6 metres (16–20ft) high, while west of the river the wall was originally made from turf and measured 6metres (20ft) wide and 3.5metres (11.5ft) high; it was subsequently rebuilt in stone. The wall was augmented by various ditches, berms, and forts.|$|E

25|$|On 7 March 1291, King D. Dinis conceded a new foral {{and defined}} the <b>limites</b> of the {{municipal}} territory of Mirandela. Construction of the tower and walls along the hilltop of São Miguel continued. Within the walls, the first fair occurred in 1295.|$|E
25|$|These {{troubles}} {{may have}} influenced Hadrian's plan to construct the wall {{as well as his}} construction of <b>limites</b> {{in other areas of the}} Empire, but to what extent is unknown. Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become the Scottish Lowlands and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts.|$|E
25|$|Around the 19th century, the {{northern}} <b>limites</b> of the Bairro, including the zone around São Pedro de Alcântara up to Príncipe Real were delimited. The area was consolidated {{with the construction}} of a group of diverse buildings and specifically rental properties. The block that existed between Rua da Rosa and the Travessa do Tijolo came to condition activity in the neighborhood, including the establishment of various newspapers, of which O Bolastill remains. In 1880, the municipal council decided to widen the Rua dos Moinhos do Vento (now the Rua de São Pedro de Alcântara), expropriating lands and buildings that restricted its expansion.|$|E

25|$|Detroit {{expanded}} its borders exponentially annexing {{all or part}} of the incorporated villages of Woodmere (1905), Delray (1905), Fairview (1907), St. Clair Heights (1918), and Warrendale (1925) as well as thousands of acres of land in the surrounding townships. Nevertheless, there remained several legally separate cities that formed enclaves inside the city <b>limites,</b> such as Hamtramck and Highland Park. By the 1930s, Poles became a large immigrant group with more than 66,000 Poles residing in Detroit at the time. Between 1900 and 1930, the city's population soared from 265,000 to over 1.5 million. During World War II, there was a large influx of whites from Appalachia and blacks from the rural South. Arabs (especially Palestinians) arrived in large numbers after 1970.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. <b>Limites</b> did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.|$|E
