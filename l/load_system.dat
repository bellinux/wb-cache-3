40|$|Abstract. The {{force of}} control column is very {{important}} for the pilot in a flight simulator. So the control <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> in the flight simulator has been concerned since the flight simulator appeared. As the force command signal generated part of control <b>loading</b> <b>system,</b> flight control system module is the most important module for the fidelity of control <b>loading</b> <b>system.</b> This paper described a method to build flight control module.

40|$|Pig mortalities {{from the}} farm to the harvest {{facility}} have been estimated to cost the U. S. swine industry over 55 million dollars annually. Improved understanding of the major factors impacting the behavioral and physiological responses of the finisher pig during transportation {{and its effects on}} final meat quality is needed. Fresh pork loin quality attribute evaluations were performed over two experiments. Experiment one – closeout pull (no-piling) : (n = 2 loads, average number of pigs load = 172, average weight / head = 131. 5 ± 1. 7 kg) included the comparison of two <b>loading</b> <b>systems</b> on the last pigs marketed (closeout [CO] pigs) from a finishing facility. Experiment two – closeout pull (piling) : (n = 2 loads, average number of pigs / load = 172, average weight / head = 114. 9 ± 4. 8 kg) included the comparison of two <b>loading</b> <b>systems</b> on the last pigs marketed (closeout [CO] pigs) from a finishing facility that experienced a 10 minute delay due to piling on the P <b>loading</b> <b>system.</b> Two <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> designs were compared in the study. The first <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> design (T) was the production system’s traditional metal covered chute. The second design (P) used was a prototype loading gantry constructed of an aluminum covered chute. After loading was complete, pigs were transported ~ 88. 5 km to a commercial packing plant. Initial pH, 24 -h pH, Japanese Color Score (JCS) cut, JCS rib, color pass rate and Loin L* were scored on each loin. Experiment one – closeout pull (no piling) : Loins from pigs loaded with the P <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> had higher (P = 0. 01) 24 -h pH and JCS rib values. Pigs loaded on the P <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> tended to have lower (P = 0. 06) L* values compared to the T pigs. Although not statistically different (P = 0. 14), pigs loaded with the P <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> had 8 % more loins qualify for upper-end foreign markets as evidenced by the color pass rate values. Experiment two – closeout pull (piling) : Loins from pigs loaded with the T <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> had higher (P = 0. 01) initial pH, but lower (P = 0. 03) 2 pH values. Pigs loaded on the T <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> also had higher (P = 0. 02) JCS cut values and rib scores, and lower (P = 0. 01) L* values, all indicative of a darker, redder meat. Although not statistically different (P = 0. 07), pigs loaded with the T <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> had 7 % more loins qualify for upper-end foreign markets as evidenced by the color pass rate values. In conclusion, this investigation has provided data to support changes in facility/loading system design that may ultimately lead to the improvement of pork quality. Results indicate that pigs loaded on the P chute, under routine handling management, have superior meat quality attributes. However, differences in results in this investigation implicate when handling challenges arise these may in turn negate any advantages that the <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> provides...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the degree}} to which the {{lithosphere}} relaxes over time is still controversial, most workers (Allen & Allen 2005, Flemings & Jordan 1989) accept an elastic or visco-elastic rheology to describe the lithospheric deformation of the foreland basin. Allen & Allen (2005) describe a moving <b>load</b> <b>system,</b> one in which the deflection moves as a wave through the foreland plate before the <b>load</b> <b>system.</b> The deflection shape is commonly described as an asymmetrical low close to the load along the foreland and a broader uplifted deflection along the forebulge. The transport rate or flux of erosion, as well as sedimentation, is a function of topographic relief.|$|E
