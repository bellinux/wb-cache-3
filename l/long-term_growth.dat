5|$|The {{other story}} about the balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor tree and the temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment and the Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the <b>long-term</b> <b>growth</b> and the health of the tree.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{research}} documents a large dispersion in <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts among financial analysts {{covering the}} same stock. This suggests that while analysts believe <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> is predictable, they face significant uncertainty when estimating it. This thesis examines the effect <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecast dispersion {{has on the}} firm that receives <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts, and investors who follow analysts’ stock recommendations based on valuations that incorporate <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth.</b> The first essay examines determinants of voluntary earnings growth guidance by management, and investigates analysts’ reactions to the guidance. The second essay examines trading strategies based on superior analysts’ <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts. The results of the first essay indicate that there is pervasive upward bias in managers’ earnings growth guidance. As {{a result of this}} bias, managers are more likely to issue earnings growth forecasts in years of negative short-term earnings surprises and when analysts have low initial <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts. The finding that managements’ earnings growth forecasts primarily convey good news is in contrast to the generally negative nature of management short-term earnings guidance, and suggests that different incentives drive firms’ disclosure of different financial information. Moreover, analysts respond to managements’ earnings growth guidance by increasing their <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts. This finding sheds new light on the over-optimism hypothesis in analysts’ <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts, suggesting the bias could be management induced. However, with regard to analysts’ response, the findings suggest that analysts sacrifice precision in <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecasts for deliberate upward bias. This bias is not subject to ex post scrutiny and is designed to maintain or increase analysts’ target prices, even though short-term earnings may warrant a lower target price. Results in the second essay show a contemporaneous association between <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecast accuracy, one-year ahead earnings forecast accuracy, and stock recommendation profitability. Despite these results, a model that predicts the profitability of future stock recommendations based on the analyst’s historical one-yea ahead earnings forecast accuracy and <b>long-term</b> earnings <b>growth</b> forecast accuracy, is not found...|$|R

25|$|The Flin Flon greenstone belt {{in central}} Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan is {{a collage of}} {{deformed}} volcanic arc rocks {{ranging in age from}} 1,904 to 1,864 million years old during the Paleoproterozoic sub-division of the Precambrian eon. Volcanic activity between 1,890and 1,864million years ago produced calc-alkaline andesite-rhyolite magmas and rare shoshonite and trachyandesite magmas while the 1,904‑million-year-old arc volcanism occurred in one or more separate volcanic arcs that were possibly characterized by rapid subduction of thin oceanic crust and large back-arc basins. In contrast, the younger 1,890‑million-year-old volcanics indicate evidence of crustal thickening. This was due to <b>long-term</b> <b>growth</b> of the volcanic arcs by continuous volcanic activity and tectonic thickening associated with arc collisions and successive arc deformation. This in turn followed a massive mountain building event called the Trans-Hudson orogeny.|$|E
25|$|In , Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) {{discuss the}} current debates on macroeconomics, capital market {{liberalization}} and development, {{and develop a}} new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith {{in the role of}} markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for <b>long-term</b> <b>growth</b> and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.|$|E
