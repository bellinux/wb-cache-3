Unlike <b>laser</b> <b>epilation,</b> {{electrolysis}} can be used to remove 100% of the hair from an area and is effective on hair of all colors, if used at an adequate power level with proper technique. More hair may grow in certain areas that are prone to hormone-induced growth (e.g. a woman's chin and neck) based on individual hormone levels or changes therein, and one's genetic predisposition to grow new hair.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. Pilonidal {{disease is}} a chronic disease of the natal cleft. Recurrent {{follicular}} infection is the causative factor. Surgi-cal treatment has a significant failure rate, and recurrence is com-mon. Laser removal of hair in the natal cleft could be an alter-native to surgery. OBJECTIVE. To determine the effectiveness of laser hair removal in the natal cleft on pilonidal disease. METHODS. Six young men with recurrent pilonidal disease were treated with <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> in our clinic from 2000 to 2003. Most patients {{had a history of}} one or more surgical treatments in the area, and all patients had suffered recurrent folliculitis for years. An alexandrite laser was mostly used, although, occasionally, an intense pulsed light device was used. The number of epilation treatments ranged from 3 to 11, performed at 6 - to 8 -week inter-vals. RESULTS. All patients experienced progressive resolution of the folliculitis with the <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> treatments. No more surgical treatments have been needed. The treatments were simple and quick, and there were no complications. CONCLUSION. <b>Laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of the natal cleft should be consid-ered a first choice treatment for recurrent pilonidal disease. Pre-ventive <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of the natal cleft in patients with recurrent folliculitis could avoid future surgery...|$|E
30|$|Laser-assisted hair removal is {{currently}} {{the most popular and}} efficient method for long-term removal of unwanted body and facial hair. Various laser systems including red spectrum ruby laser (694 nm), near-infrared spectrum alexandrite laser (755 nm), diode laser (800 nm), neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (1, 064 nm), and intense pulse light (590 to 1, 200 nm) are available for this use. Most of the time, more than one session is needed. Ocular protection with protective glasses during laser hair removal is recommended. Most complications of <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> such as crusting and vesiculation of the treatment site, hypopigmentation, or hyperpigmentation are not generally serious [1, 2]. Periocular <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> is rarely associated with complications. Although various case reports of ocular complications with <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of eyebrows have been described in the literature, most of these reports revealed ocular complications with diode laser [3 – 6]. In this paper, we describe a case of anterior uveitis caused by alexandrite (755 nm) laser-assisted removal of eyebrows.|$|E
40|$|Acne keloidalis nuchae {{is usually}} treated with oral antibiotics, local {{antiseptics}} or intralesional steroids but with limited success. I assessed {{the efficacy of}} diode laser for treating the inflammatory and keloidal papules of acne keloidalis nuchae in two cases. The lesions in both the cases showed about 90 to 95 &#x 0025; clearance after 4 treatment sessions at one to one and half month intervals. No new lesions were observed during the follow up period of {{six months after the}} last laser treatment. Thus, after clearing bacterial infection, <b>laser</b> hair <b>epilation</b> can be used as the first line of therapy for treating papules of acne keloidalis nuchae. This is the first attempt at treating acne keloidalis nuchae with a diode laser...|$|R
30|$|The probe must be firmly {{placed on}} the skin during the procedure, but the {{structure}} of orbital rim makes this difficult when used on the hair of eyebrows. Additionally, in most cases, the patients are told to remove the protective glasses because of their large size. Furthermore, the normal Bell’s phenomenon causes the pigmented iris to be damaged by the peripheral laser beams. The thin skin of the eyelids fails to prevent the penetration of the laser beams to the eye; thus, a variety of clinical presentations can occur with <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of eyebrows. Lin et al. and Carrim et al. reported patients with pigment dispersion and temporary increased intraocular pressure associated with alexandrite <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of eyebrows [7, 8]. Elkin et al. described a 41 -year-old male who presented with bilateral iritis and iris atrophy without posterior synechiae 2 days after receiving alexandrite <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of eyebrows [9]. Our case is different from their case {{because of the presence}} of posterior synechiae without iris atrophy.|$|E

30|$|A 36 -year-old healthy female with {{no history}} of ocular {{problems}} had undergone alexandrite (755 nm) laser-assisted hair removal of both eyebrows. She stated that she had covered her eyes with one finger during the procedure but had not used protective glasses because of the difficulties caused by their size. Although there were no problems during <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of the right eyebrow, the patient indicated that she felt a temporary pain in her left eye during the treatment. Two days after receiving <b>laser</b> <b>epilation,</b> she presented to our clinic with the complaints of severe pain, redness, and photophobia in her left eye. On ophthalmologic evaluation, uncorrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 in both eyes. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the right eye was unremarkable. There were moderate conjunctival injection, 2 + cells in the anterior chamber, and local posterior synechiae in her left eye. Intraocular pressure and fundus examination were normal in both eyes. Topical dexamethasone (eight times per day) and cyclopentolate hydrochloride eyedrops (three times per day) were prescribed. Three days after the initiation of topical treatment, there was a reduction in anterior chamber cells to 1 +, but posterior synechiae was enhanced. A subconjunctival injection of adrenaline and dexamethasone was administered. Three days after the injection, the anterior chamber cells reduced to 0.5 +, {{and there was no}} further enlargement of the posterior synechiae. Topical dexamethasone eyedrops were tapered to five times per day, but cyclopentolate hydrochloride eyedrops were continued. One week later, the anterior chamber was clear, but the posterior synechiae persisted in her left eye. Topical medications were gradually tapered and then stopped. Additionally, she was told not to receive <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of eyebrows. At the 2 -month follow-up, uncorrected visual acuity remained 20 / 20 in both eyes. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure, and fundus examination of the right eye were still unremarkable. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the left eye revealed a clear anterior chamber and persistent posterior synechiae. Intraocular pressure and fundus examination of the left eye remained normal. Follow-up examinations of the patient are still continuing in our department.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the use of}} less {{penetrating}} alexandrite laser, ocular damage {{can occur}} with laser-assisted hair removal of eyebrows. Consequently, the procedure should not be suggested as a simple method, and individuals contemplating <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of eyebrows should be warned against the potential risks. If the patient is decisive in having the procedure, well-educated and experienced physicians should be chosen, and protective glasses should be worn. In case of ocular pain during laser treatment, the procedure should be stopped and the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist.|$|E

Methods: A 41 -year-old male presented with bilateral eye pain and mild photophobia 2 days after receiving alexandrite (755 nm) <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> of both eyebrows. Examination showed visual acuity of 20 / 20 in both eyes, 2 + conjunctival injection in both eyes, 1 + cells in the anterior chamber of right eye and trace cells in left eye, poor right pupil dilation, and left pupil without movement. Intraocular pressure and fundus examination were normal. He was diagnosed with iritis and iris atrophy, associated with <b>laser</b> <b>epilation.</b> Topical steroids and cycloplegic drops were prescribed for 1 month. Results: After 1 month of treatment, transillumination defects remained in both eyes, but greater in right. In dim light, the right pupil was 4 mm and oval and the left pupil was 6 mm and round. Visual acuity remained 20 / 20 in both eyes. Conclusion: Laser hair removal of the eyebrows can lead to permanent ocular damage even with eye protection, and should be avoided.

30|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>epilation,</b> {{based on}} {{selective}} photothermolysis, is achieved through follicular unit destruction. Melanin {{in the hair}} follicles at the dermis level is the target of laser-assisted systems. Although treatment outcomes are not affected by the laser system preferred, laser parameters are important when choosing the appropriate system for the patient. The shorter the wavelength, the more the laser energy may cause epidermal damage and side effects [2]. Alexandrite and diode lasers do not affect the more superficial epidermal tissue and were designed to prevent potential side effects by penetrating deeper layers of the skin. The penetration depth of these laser systems is approximately 3 to 4 mm.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) for manage-ment of congenital distichiasis. Methods: In this interventional case series, 16 eyelids of 5 patients with congenital distichiasis underwent posterior lamella resection and AMT. Results: All patients were male subjects with mean age of 13. 6 ± 15. 2 (range 2 - 42) years. Mean follow up was 17 ± 7. 5 (range 6 - 29) months. Distichiasis did not recur in 11 eyelids (68. 7 %). Misdirected eyelashes recurred in 3 eyelids (18. 8 %) outside the AMT area and in 2 eyelids (12. 5 %) within the AMT area which were successfully treated by gentle <b>laser</b> <b>epilation.</b> Postoperatively, symptoms of dry eye were controlled by medical treatment in all patients.

40|$|Background : Chronic {{pilonidal}} {{disease is}} a common debilitating condition. It is a cause of considerable morbidity and social embarrassment. This prospective randomized study compared permanent laser hair removal following the excision of pilonidal disease with conventional methods for hair removal. Materials and Methods : Patients undergoing surgery for pilonidal disease were randomized to two groups: those using laser hair removal methods following completed healing of wounds (group I) or regular post-healing conventional methods for hair removal, mainly razor and depilatory creams, for at least 6 months (group II). Group I patients received regular, monthly laser hair treatment sessions using Alexandrite laser for four sessions. Results : Group I patients had {{a mean age of}} 23. 6 ± 4. 7 years. Group I patients had monthly laser hair removal session and then they were regularly followed up within the proposed schedule. They found the procedure comfortable with no complications. Group II patients had a mean age of 23. 7 ± 6. 6 years; they reported difficulty in maintaining hair removal with these conventional methods, and mostly, {{by the end of the}} first year, all cases stopped maintaining regular hair removal. Recurrence occurred in Group II patients (two cases) mostly due to failure in maintaining hair removal and area hygiene. Conclusions : We advocate the use of <b>laser</b> <b>epilation</b> after surgery for pilonidal sinus as it decreases the chance of recurrence but larger studies with long-term follow-up are still needed to approve this conclusion...|$|E
