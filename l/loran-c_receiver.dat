5000|$|Loran-C had {{originally}} been designed to be highly automated, allowing the system to be operated more rapidly than the original LORAN's multi-minute measurement. It was also operated in [...] "chains" [...] of linked stations, allowing a fix {{to be made by}} simultaneously comparing two slaves to a single master. The downside of this approach was that the required electronic equipment, built using 1950s-era tube technology, was very large. Looking for companies with knowledge of seaborne, multi-channel phase-comparison electronics led, ironically, to Decca, who built the AN/SPN-31, the first widely used <b>Loran-C</b> <b>receiver.</b> The AN/SPN-31 weighed over 100 lbs kg and had 52 controls.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} its many advantages, {{the high cost of}} {{implementing}} a <b>Loran-C</b> <b>receiver</b> made it uneconomical for many users. Additionally, as military users upgraded from Loran-A to Loran-C, large numbers of surplus Loran-A receivers were dumped on the market. This made Loran-A popular in spite of being less accurate and fairly difficult to operate. By the early 1970s the introduction of integrated circuits combining a complete radio receiver began to greatly reduce the complexity of Loran-A measurements, and fully automated units the size of a stereo receiver became common. For those users requiring higher accuracy, Decca had considerable success with their Decca Navigator system, and produced units that combined both receivers, using Loran to eliminate the ambiguities in Decca.|$|E

Therefore, the navigation system of the future will combine various systems that complement each other in an optimal way. As Loran-C is with respect to system characteristics, especially to the propagation behaviour of the carrier wave, very dissimilar to GPS, it seems to be a favourable complement to GPS in an integrated navigation receiver.

The road measurements were made successively during February-March and July-August 1991 to analyse seasonal effects. The signals received from the East Coast Canada Chain ((5930 M, X, Y, Z) and the Northeast U. S. Chain (9960 M, W, X) are discussed herein. The Field Strength and Signal to Noise Ratio measurements are compared with predicted values using various models for conductivity and atmospheric noise. The Time Difference (TD) measurements are first compared between forward and reverse runs along the road profiles to ascertain the quality and reliability of the system utilized. The differences between Winter and Summer TD measurements are then analyzed. A relatively small but significant seasonal effect is found. The GPS-derived TD distortions are compared with those derived using various models for the combined effect of the primary, secondary and additional secondary phase lags. The differences between measured and modeled distortions reached several µs. The effect of these differences on Loran-C positions is found to reach several hundred metres in many cases.

40|$|There is {{ever-increasing}} {{interest in}} employing accurate values of Additional Secondary Factors (ASFs) in <b>Loran-C</b> <b>receivers.</b> Precise ASF values are essential if Loran is {{to deliver the}} high absolute accuracies now demanded of it for aircraft approaches, maritime harbour entrance guidance, and land vehicle tracking. In some situations, accurate ASFs can be measured. But in many other applications, we find it more economical to employ a computer model to predict ASFs, and then store the results within the Loran receiver itself. This paper will introduce readers unfamiliar with the concepts of ASFs to the principles involved. It will briefly review the use of measured and modelled ASF values {{in a range of}} applications. The BALOR computer model developed by the authors calculates the values of ASFs along complex propagation paths, taking into account the variations of both ground conductivity and land height between the transmitter and the receiver. It has been used to produce ASF data sets for the region served by every NELS Loran station, and many North American stations, too. These results are available in the form of maps and tables of numerical values. Typically, data points are spaced at intervals of 0. 01 o degree of latitude by 0. 01 o degree of longitude (approximately 1 x 1 km). Recently, the authors have extended the BALOR model to take into account more accurately the curvature of the earth at ranges beyond 1000 km. This extended model employs a more complex, and more accurate, integral equation. The equation was developed, using the Compensation Theorem, by Wait at the US National Bureau of Standards. It describes the changes in the amplitude and phase of the Loran signal as it propagates from the transmitter to the receiver. As in the existing BALOR model, Monteath’s numerical approach is then used to solve this integral equation. The paper will demonstrate the validity of this extended model by reference to NBS results, and present examples of ASF data it has produced for specific Loran stations...|$|R
