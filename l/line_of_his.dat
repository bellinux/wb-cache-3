She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, inaugurated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father.|$|E

5|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting a Gold Star {{in lieu of}} a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Phil Hinkle Bucklew, United States Naval (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> profession as Officer in Charge of an LCT Scout Boat during the amphibious assault on the Normandy Coast of France on June 6, 1944. Embarked in one of the first craft to approach the strongly defended cost, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bucklew successfully accomplished his highly important mission of locating the designated beaches and, despite rough surf and continuous harassing enemy fire, skillfully led the first wave of DD tanks, going in close to the beach and taking his station as guide. Firing his boat's rockets over the tanks at target objectives in support of the landings, he moved in closer to direct his guns at suspected hostile machine-gun nests in houses along the beach and subsequently, in the face of heavy enemy opposition, rescued wounded personnel from burning landing craft and regulated the flow of traffic throughout the morning and afternoon of D-Day. The conduct of Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bucklew throughout this action reflects great credit upon himself, and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

25|$|Besides his subjects, {{unconventional}} for the time, {{his poems}} also exhibit a skilled and versatile craftsmanship, which {{is extremely difficult}} to translate. Cavafy was a perfectionist, obsessively refining every single <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poetry. His mature style was a free iambic form, free in the sense that verses rarely rhyme and are usually from 10 to 17 syllables. In his poems, the presence of rhyme usually implies irony.|$|E

25|$|Cäcilie's father, Grand Duke Leopold, {{descended from}} a morganatic {{branch of the}} Baden family (his mother was Luise von Heyer, a noblewoman) and thus did not have rights to a princely status or the {{sovereign}} rights of the House of Zähringen of Baden.

The xhamadan appears to be the jacket to which 16th-century English poet Edmund Spenser refers in a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Faerie Queene, published in the 1590s, where he mentions the sleeves-dependent, Albanese wise. It is mentioned several times by British travel writers, such as John Foster Fraser, who in the first (1906) edition of his book, Pictures from the Balkans, observes the preferences of Albanian men for xhamadans embroidered in gold or silver.|$|E

25|$|Henry IV of France's {{succession}} to {{the throne}} in 1589 {{was followed by a}} four-year war of succession to establish his legitimacy. This was part of the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598). Henry IV inherited the throne after the assassination of Henry III, the last Valois king, who died without children. Henry was already King of Navarre, as the successor of his mother, Jeanne d'Albret, but he owed his succession {{to the throne}} of France to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father, Antoine of Bourbon, an agnatic descendant of Louis IX.

Roach hoped that the Brazil Line would be {{the first step in the}} creation of a vast global transportation network with John Roach & Sons at the center. Accordingly, he constructed two new 3,000-ton ships for the line, City of Rio de Janeiro and City of Para.|$|E

25|$|Alliance then {{returned}} to the main battle, firing two broadsides. Again, these did at least as much damage to Richard as to Serapis, but the tactic worked to the extent that, unable to move, and with Alliance keeping well out of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own great guns, Captain Pearson of Serapis accepted that prolonging the battle could achieve nothing, so he surrendered. Most of Bonhomme Richard's crew immediately transferred to other vessels, and after {{a day and a half}} of frantic repair efforts, it was decided that the ship could not be saved, so it was allowed to sink, and Jones took command of Serapis for the trip to neutral (but American-sympathizing) Holland.|$|E

When his station in the forward dynamo room of the U.S.S. Nevada became almost untenable due to smoke, steam, and heat, Machinist Ross forced his men to leave that station and performed all the duties himself until blinded and unconscious. Upon being rescued and resuscitated, he returned and secured the forward dynamo room and proceeded to the after dynamo room where he was later again rendered unconscious by exhaustion. Again recovering consciousness he returned to his station where he remained until directed to abandon it.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting a Gold Star {{in lieu of}} a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Commander Charles Elliott Loughlin (NSN: 0-72307/1100), United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> profession as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. QUEENFISH (SS-393), on the SECOND War Patrol of that submarine in enemy Japanese-controlled waters in the Pacific War Area, from 27 October to 2 December 1944. A skilled and aggressive leader, Commander Loughlin penetrated strong hostile escort screens to launch repeated attacks against hostile shipping and, by his courage and determination, succeeded in sinking a total of 35,300 tons and in damaging 10,000 tons. His superb ship-handling in evading severe Japanese countermeasures saved his ship from possible disaster and his devotion to duty throughout reflects the highest credit upon Commander Loughlin and the United States Naval Service.|$|E
25|$|Bowling {{actions are}} {{typically}} divided into side on and front on actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands {{parallel to the}} bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This {{is not to be}} confused with a mixed action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged amongst young bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to the twisting of the back inherent in the action.|$|E
