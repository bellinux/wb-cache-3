50|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>engines</b> were {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} trains at Hawkesbury River station to assist them in the climb and were detached at Cowan station. After assisting a train up the <b>bank,</b> the <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> would usually return to Hawkesbury River station to await the next train. <b>Bank</b> <b>engines</b> are no longer used on the line.|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, The Mortehoe {{banks were}} much harsher. Northbound {{there was a}} 3½ mile {{continuous}} climb of 1 in 41, from Heddon Mill Crossing to Mortehoe. While southbound, from Ilfracombe to Mortehoe, the climb was 1 in 36 for 2½ miles, with severe S-curves past Lower Slade making the journey even harder. <b>Banking</b> <b>engines</b> were kept at Braunton and Ilfracombe, to assist when required. Mortehoe station provided a number of sidings for stabling the <b>banking</b> <b>engines</b> after assisting with the climb.|$|R

50|$|In {{countries}} where buffers-and-chain couplers are used, <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> often cannot {{be added to}} the front of the train due to the limited strength of the couplers; In the case of standard UIC couplers and a maximum grade of 28‰ (which is common e.g. for lines through the Alps), the limit is a train weight of 1400 tons; if a train is heavier, <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> have to be added in the middle or to the end of the train in order not to exceed the maximum load for any coupler.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{line was}} graded at 1 in 40 for Sydney bound trains, which imposed a severe limitation on train loads, and also caused congestion as <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> were attached.|$|R

50|$|Steam {{operations}} on the Spessart Ramp before 1957 were very complex. In Laufach, a <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> was attached behind freight and long-distance passenger trains. Where appropriate, a third locomotive was attached {{in front of}} freight trains.|$|R
