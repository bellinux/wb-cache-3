Higher minimum, higher mean, and more stable flow releases from the dam after 1991 provided conditions that supported greater relative abundance of rainbow trout. Though the relative abundance of most length-classes increased following the onset of a stabilized flow regime, relative condition declined, particularly in <b>large</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> (? 305 mm). Correlation analyses suggested that the small rainbow trout (3 ̆c 305 mm) were more strongly influenced by physical factors (flow variation, mean discharge, and water temperature) than the large trout (? 305 mm). However, the relative condition of small trout was negatively correlated with that of all trout, and the condition of trout 305 - 405 mm in length was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of trout within this length category, suggesting food limitation or density-dependent influences on physiological well-being.

Humpback chub and <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> used resources high in the food web and assimilated similar proportions of native fishes, suggesting non-native <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> may occupy an ecological role similar to humpback chub.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of a water re-circulating system for fish farming were studied through the case study of an inland turbot farm located in Brittany (France). Life Cycle Assessment methodology {{was used to evaluate}} the potential environmental impact through the following indicators: Eutrophication Potential, Acidification Potential, Global Warming Potential, Net Primary Production Use and Non Renewable Energy Use. Two methods were used to assess the farm's nitrogen, phosphorus and solids emissions: nutrient measurement accounting and nutrient balance modelling. The two methods gave similar results for solids and phosphorus emissions, while for nitrogen the measurement-based approach resulted in half the emissions predicted by the model. The uncertainty regarding the potential gaseous nitrogen emissions led us to assess impacts according to three scenarios, differing with respect to emissions of N 2, N 2 O and NH 3. This approach illustrates that the uncertainty concerning nitrogenous emissions to the atmosphere leads to uncertainty with respect to the production system's Eutrophication Potential and its Global Warming Potential. The comparison of our results with similar results for <b>large</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> production in a flow-through system points out the impacts associated with the high level of energy consumption in the studied re-circulating system (i. e.

40|$|A {{bioenergetics}} {{model was}} constructed for stream-resident drift-feeding salmonids. Model predictions of surplus power (energy available per unit time for lll growth and reproduction) {{were not statistically}} distinguishable from observations of surplus power in three laboratory studies. Of 40 experimental trials in these three studies, the model correctly predicted surplus power in 39 cases (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). I collected observations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) focal velocity and physical habitat availability in the Green River of northeastern Utah, USA (1988 - 1990). In the winter of 1988, Flaming Gorge Dam generated hydropower and delivered an lJDStable discharge regime with a higher mean discharge to the Green River. During 1989 and 1990, Flaming Gorge Dam 2 ̆ 7 s operation was curtailed by drought. Therefore, the Green River exhibited a more stable discharge regime with lower mean daily discharge. During winters exhibiting the stable discharge regime, all size classes of rainbow trout selected slower focal velocities than under an unstable winter discharge regime. Season had less influence on microhabitat selection of large fish than smaller individuals. Rainbow trout larger than 33 cm (total length) find and use positions with low focal velocities and high velocity shear regardless of season. In contrast, during the summer, fish less than 33 cm TL find and use positions with much higher focal velocities and greater velocity shear compared to the winter. Four bioenergetic models were tested with the focal velocity use data. Two optimal goal models produced excellent fits (r 2 = 0. 91 and 0. 93) to observed focal velocity use of rainbow trout larger than 33 cm TL. These results {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that <b>large</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> were finding optimal focal velocity positions in stable discharge summers and under both discharge regimes in winter. Rainbow trout movement was quantified along two scales with radio-telemetered fish: 1) weekly observations generated estimates of distances moved at intervals greater than one day and 2) multiple observations of a fish in one day produced estimates of distances moved over hours. I found an unstable discharge regime significantly reduces movement measured weekly (F = 11. 10, P = 0. 0019); hourly movement rates (m/h) were also reduced (F = 5. 90, P = 0. 0273) ...|$|E
40|$|Background Estimates {{of fishing}} and natural {{mortality}} {{are important for}} understanding, and ultimately managing, commercial and recreational fisheries. High reward tags with fixed station acoustic telemetry provides a promising approach to monitoring mortality rates in large lake recreational fisheries. Kootenay Lake is a large lake which supports an important recreational fishery for large Bull Trout and Rainbow Trout. Methods Between 2008 and 2013, 88 large (≥ 500  mm) Bull Trout and 149 large (≥ 500  mm) Rainbow Trout were marked with an acoustic transmitter and/or high reward ($ 100) anchor tags in Kootenay Lake. The subsequent detections and angler recaptures were analysed using a Bayesian individual state-space Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) survival model with indicator variable selection. Results The final CJS survival model estimated that the annual interval probability of being recaptured by an angler was 0. 17 (95 % CRI [0. 11 – 0. 23]) for Bull Trout and 0. 14 (95 % CRI [0. 09 – 0. 19]) for Rainbow Trout. The annual interval survival probability for Bull Trout was estimated to have declined from 0. 91 (95 % CRI [0. 76 – 0. 97]) in 2009 to just 0. 46 (95 % CRI [0. 24 – 0. 76]) in 2013. Rainbow Trout survival was most strongly affected by spawning. The annual interval survival probability was 0. 77 (95 % CRI [0. 68 – 0. 85]) for a non-spawning Rainbow Trout compared to 0. 41 (95 % CRI [0. 30 – 0. 53]) for a spawner. The probability of spawning increased with the fork length for both species and decreased {{over the course of}} the study for Rainbow Trout. Discussion Fishing mortality was relatively low and constant while natural mortality was relatively high and variable. The results indicate that angler effort is not the primary driver of short-term population fluctations in the Rainbow Trout abundance. Variation in the probability of Rainbow Trout spawning suggests that the spring escapement at the outflow of Trout Lake may be a less reliable index of abundance than previously assumed. Multi-species stock assessment models need to account for the fact that large Bull Trout are more abundant than <b>large</b> <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Trout</b> in Kootenay Lake...|$|E

40|$|I {{examined}} {{spatial and}} temporal consumption dynamics using an energy intake model and a bioenergetics model of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and brown trout, Salmo trutta, within three catch-and-release (C-R) areas in Bull Shoals and Norfork tailwaters to determine whether trout populations were limited by food supply. I also examined the seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the foraging patterns of brown and rainbow trout within these areas using gut content analysis (GCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of C and N. I examined 605 brown trout and 768 rainbow trout for GCA and SIA at Bull Shoals, Norfork, and Sylamore C-R areas. For growth analysis and abundance estimates, I tagged a total of 11, 423 brown and rainbow trout. Mean rainbow trout densities were higher (47 to 342 fish*ha- 1) than brown trout (3 to 84 fish*ha- 1) at all C-R areas. The Norfork C-R area contained the highest densities of brown and rainbow trout. Benthic macroinvertebrates at Bull Shoals and Norfork were 14. 0 to 18. 7 times higher in biomass than at Sylamore. Biomass of sculpin was approximately 2 to 8 times higher at Norfork than Bull Shoals and Sylamore. I found {{a high proportion of}} filamentous algae, Cladophora, and a nuisance diatom, Didymosphenia geminata in the diets of rainbow trout (15 - 91 %), despite the apparent lack of energetic value from this food source. Generally, SIA mixing model results provided broad ranges of source contributions rather than more informative narrow ranges of solutions limiting the conclusions regarding food source contributions. <b>Large</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> failed to consume sufficient food biomass to exceed maintenance ration and exhibited slow or negative seasonal growth suggesting poorer energetic conditions existed for this size class and species. In contrast, brown trout experienced high growth rates at lower densities than rainbow trout. Growth rate differences between brown and rainbow trout may be from brown trout shifting towards the incorporation of more energetically profitable prey fish. These findings suggest rainbow trout, and not brown trout, in Arkansas tailwater C-R areas were limited by spatial-temporal fluctuations in food availability...|$|E

Aquaculture (410 – 411), 236 - 244 Selection to improve processing yields relies on sib selection, in which live candidates are ranked {{according to their}} family breeding value. This approach limits genetic progress, as it only exploits genetic variability between families and not within them. Indirect criteria measured on live candidates could overcome this limitation. The present study (1) proposes a procedure to identify indirect criteria to predict processing yields in rainbow trout (head, carcass and fillet yields), (2) estimates genetic {{parameters of}} these indirect criteria, and (3) predicts relative genetic gains in processing yields using full-sib selection or indirect individual selection on those indirect criteria. DNA-pedigreed all-female rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (n = 2029, 1631. 0 ± 355. 6 g) from 600 families produced from 100 sires and 60 dams were characterized by external and internal non-lethal morphological measures using digital pictures and real time ultrasound tomography. Nineteen landmarks were recorded on the digital pictures to define {{the outline of the}} body, head and lateral line. Their coordinates were used to calculate different lengths, heights and areas. Five different internal thicknesses were measured by ultrasound tomography. In the first phase of this study, processing yields were predicted using multiple linear regressions including both external and internal morphometric variables. In a second phase, the heritability of the predicted values and their genetic correlations with real processing yields were estimated using animal models. Predicted yields exhibited intermediate heritabilities (0. 25 – 0. 28) that were half the value of heritabilities for real processing yields (0. 47 – 0. 55), but had high genetic correlations with these real yields (0. 87 – 0. 90). The relative efficiency of indirect selection (IS) on these indirect criteria was compared to theoretical mass selection (MS) or sib selection (FS) with different family sizes (10 or 100) and two different selection pressures (10 % or 40 %). At the same selection pressure (10 %, with 100 sibs per family %), full-sib selection created genetic progress 49. 6 % to 60. 5 % higher than indirect selection according to the processing yield targeted. However, when sib-selection pressure was limited to a more realistic between family selection pressure (40 % and 10 sibs per family), indirect selection with 10 % selection pressure was 21. 9 % to 32. 7 % more efficient than sib selection...|$|E

When <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> were first found in a tributary (Rock Creek) in the park in 1979. a study was begun to assess changes through time in distribution and abundance of rainbow (rout in Rock Creek and to compare the brook <b>trout</b> and <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> associations in Rock Creek with associations found in other park streams. Abundance of brook trout was low in the downstream sections of Rock Creek in 1979 - 1993. Brook trout abundance was highest in the steep-gradient, pool-dominated headwater section which was only 2 km from the confluence of Rock Creek and Cosby Creek. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> were present in low densities in Rock Creek during the same period. Although <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> were most abundant in the lower stream sections and never found in the headwater section, adult and agc- 0 <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> were found in the middle section in 1988. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> were absent in the middle section in 1991. but one <b>large</b> adult <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> was present in the section in 1992 and 1993...|$|R
2500|$|Fish inhabiting {{the streams}} of the Smokies include trout, lamprey, darter, shiner, bass, and sucker. [...] The brook trout {{is the only}} trout species native to the range, {{although}} northwestern <b>rainbow</b> <b>trout</b> and European brown trout were introduced {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. The <b>larger</b> <b>rainbow</b> and brown <b>trout</b> outcompete the native brook trout for food and habitat at lower elevations. As such, most of the brook trout found in the park today are in streams above 3,000 feet in elevation. Trout in the Smokies are generally smaller than other members of their species in different locales. Protected fish species in the range include the smoky and yellowfin madtom, the spotfin chub, and the duskytail darter.|$|R
