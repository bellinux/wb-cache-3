50|$|Lagging {{indicators}} are indicators that usually change after {{the economy as}} a whole does. Typically the lag is a few quarters of a year. The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator: employment tends to increase two or three quarters after an upturn in the general economy. In finance, Bollinger bands are one of various lagging indicators in frequent use. In a performance measuring system, profit earned by a business is a <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator</b> as it reflects a historical performance; similarly, improved customer satisfaction is the result of initiatives taken in the past.|$|E

30|$|The ADX {{does not}} {{indicate}} trend direction or momentum. It only measures trend strength. It is a <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator</b> {{in a sense that}} a trend must have established firmly before the ADX will generate a signal that a trend is under way. The ADX varies between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness and readings above 40 and 50 indicate a strong trend and an extremely strong trend, respectively. However, one major problem with the ADX is that it is too volatile. The ADXR improves over the ADX on this respect by using the average instead of a single number. In general, ADXR less than 20 indicates a trendless market, while ADXR greater than 25 indicates a trending market.|$|E

40|$|The Australian {{construction}} industry has traditionally relied on &# 039;lagging&# 039; indicators {{of health and}} safety performance. <b>Lagging</b> <b>indicators,</b> including lost time injury rates, are limited in usefulness because they rely on after the fact recording of statistically low probability events. They are subject to random variation, which can provoke &# 039;knee jerk&# 039; reactions immediately following a reportable incident and encourage management complacency when no reportable incidents have occurred {{for a period of}} time. An update is provided on the development of a multi-level measurement method, which combines &# 039;leading&# 039; safety performance indicators and safety climate measures. It is argued that leading performance indicators and climate measures can (in combination with <b>lagging</b> <b>indicators)</b> provide a more comprehensive analysis of health and safety performance in the {{construction industry}}. The opportunities for internal (between project) and external (between organization) benchmarking of health and safety performance are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{issues of}} {{business}} cycles assessment {{and most of}} all forecasting turning points represent crucial components in the game of crisis anticipation. The aim {{of this study is to}} statistically evaluate the predictive power of several macro economic variables in estimating economic changes and to classify them into either leading or lagging indicators. The importance thereof resides in the fact that, while the leading indicators are useful in anticipating downturns, a change within the structure or the dynamics of the lagging indicators could signal the beginning of an economic upswing. The detection of the turning points in the macroeconomic series, focusing exclusively on the US, is performed by employing Markov chains switching models and the taxonomy of the indicators is awarded accordingly. Results show that the price of gold is a leading indicator, while unemployment is a <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator</b> of the crisis.

The first part of the article addresses the issue of the traditional indicators identified in the literature. Once defined, their contribution and limitations are discussed. Next, the general concept of Balanced Scorecards is described, along with a survey of the work that has been carried out in the OHS domain. Finally, an example from the aeronautic and aerospace industry is used to illustrate the Balanced Scorecards model. It integrates leading management indicators for two particularly interesting sub-processes of a Management System; namely, the supervision of regulatory compliance and risk management. 1 Keywords: Occupational health and safety management system, balanced scorecard, leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator,</b> cccupational risks and regulatory compliance management...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the housing markets {{described in the}} Philadelphia Neighborhood Transformation Initiative (NTI), launched by Mayor John Street in April 2001, {{through the lens of}} social capital indicators. In SIAP’s view, the lack of hard data on the city 2 ̆ 7 s social and human assets made it difficult for NTI or other urban revitalization efforts to evaluate urban assets with the same rigor as urban deficits. The paper uses SIAP data on three categories of assets to examine their potential implications for the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative: social institutions, individual participation, and economic and ethnic diversity. The paper argues that each of the three dimensions measures a different temporal aspect of social capital. Using economic parlance, institutions was proposed as a <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator,</b> participation as a concurrent indicator, and diversity as a leading indicator of social capital. Specifically, the paper sought to assess whether differences in social capital reinforce or cut across housing markets, and whether a social capital perspective could help identify neighborhoods with a better than average chance of succeeding in transforming themselves...|$|E

The methodology to identify Australia's classical cycle and growth cycle chronologies is discussed. Reviews are made of the lead-lag patterns of, first, both chronologies in relation to the specific cycles of the individual coincident indicators, and second, the growth chronology in relation to the leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>indicators.</b> Australia's growth cycle chronology is compared with the chronology of other countries, notably of United States, United Kingdom, and Japan.

40|$|Safety {{performance}} data collected over a five year period, {{at a large}} Australian infrastructure project was analysed. The analysis examined the temporal relationships between the safety performance indicators measured at the project, including traditional <b>lagging</b> <b>indicators,</b> as well as expected leading indicators. The purpose of the research was to uncover time dependent relationships and explore causal relationships between indicators. The analysis revealed complex interactions between safety indicators over time. Notably, the expected leading indicators behaved as both leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>indicators</b> {{in relation to the}} project total recordable injury frequency rate. This finding suggested a cyclical relationship between management actions relating to safety and the rate of safety incidents. This cyclical relationship is unlikely to produce long term sustained improvement in safety performance. The expected leading indicators of safety were also inter-related with one another in complex ways. The results indicate that assumptions underpinning the use of leading indicators should be reconsidered. In particular, the findings challenge the assumption that leading indicators measured at one point in time can predict safety outcomes at a subsequent point in time. The collection and use of different types of safety indicator data should be reconsidered...|$|R

40|$|The two {{recently}} developed Australian indexes of leading indicators have received much {{attention in the}} press. Despite this, relatively {{little is known about}} their usefulness in forecasting the associated indexes of coincident indicators (i. e., measures of the business cycle) or any activity variables which move with the business cycle. Using the vector autoregression methodology and the related innovation accounting techniques, this paper evaluates the usefulness of the two leading indexes in forecasting these variables. We also examine the intertemporal relationships between the various variables to determine which (if any) of the variables the leading indexes in fact lead. The results indicate that the two leading indexes are quite useful in forecasting their associated indexes of the business cycle. One of the leading indexes is, however, a <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator</b> of its coincident index. The results for individual activity variables are mixed. The evidence suggests that the leading indexes are useful in forecasting GDP, an index of production and employment related variables. They are not useful in forecasting either retail sales or motor vehicle registrations. ...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementThere {{have been}} no major fatal {{accidents}} in the Norwegian sector after 1985, and those which occurred before that are not considered very relevant to the current investigation, because circumstances and policies differed considerably from current practice. However, {{there have been numerous}} minor accidents, including occupational accidents, near-misses and dangerous occurrences, known as lagging indicators. Can we deduce that installations built in the last decade are significantly safer than those constructed prior to year 2000 ? In this report, our working hypothesis will be to attempt to prove that installations built in and after 2000 have significantly less dangerous occurrences (known as lagging indicators) and greater inherent barriers (known as leading indicators) against major accidents than those following earlier regulations. The RNNP database contains relatively systematic information on minor accidents and near-misses, from and including 1996, so it will be used as source for our investigation. There is no similar overview for events prior to 1996, as the data either does not exist, or only for a few incidents. For barrier data, systematic information is available from and including 2002. Statistics will be presented and discussed both chronologically, and by type of accident, for the lagging indicators; and by type only for the leading indicators, to determine actual trends in safety levels. The <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator</b> data has been normalised by number of installation years and by number of million man-hours. For the report, both risk analyses and experience data from the offshore business will be drawn upon to be able to compare the detailed plans prepared before start of production with the actual events and reality on the installations. The investigation will be carried out at sector level, {{not on the basis of}} each individual installation. However, I will be connecting the RNNP data with risk analyses for some selected installations. Helicopter accidents are excluded from the investigation, as it is a very different topic, and would constitute a thesis in itself. The data show inconclusive results. There are no significant differences between number of leaks of installations built before and after 2000, the most important <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator,</b> when the results are normalised. However, for leading indicators gas detection and ESDV riser, the differences are statistically significant once outliers are removed. Installations built in or after 2000 have fewer well-kicks, minor fires, field vessel collisions and structural damage, but the differences are not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|A wave of {{depository}} institution failures and dramatic losses to deposit insurance funds {{occurred in the}} 1980 s and continued into the 1990 s. In response, the Congress passed a series of bank regulatory acts intended {{to address the problems}} that led to the crisis and prevent its recurrence. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) was the capstone of this transformation of banking legislation, with two key provisions designed to reduce the cost of troubled banks to the deposit insurance fund: early closure of failing institutions, and early supervisory intervention in problem banks, referred to as prompt corrective action. > This article considers whether the capital ratio thresholds that trigger prompt corrective action intervention provide sufficient lead time for successful intervention at troubled banks. The study finds that because prompt corrective action is based on a <b>lagging</b> <b>indicator</b> of a bank's financial health, it is likely to trigger intervention in problem banks only after they have been identified by examiners, who rely on far more information that the capital ratio. The authors propose two simple measures to improve the current triggers for prompt corrective action. Bank supervision; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991...|$|E

40|$|Most major {{process safety}} {{incidents}} are preventable {{and can be}} avoided as shown in several incident investigation reports. Moreover, these reports indicated that these incidents were certain to occur as shown from the related near-misses and safety control system failures that occurred prior to the incidents. The key element to improve process safety performance is developing effective process safety leading indicators. In the past, the petrochemical industrial organizations used traditional personnel safety measures to measure process safety performance. Now, most of the current industrial facilities focus more on process safety <b>lagging</b> <b>indicators.</b> Ignoring organizational factors and lacking a systematic approach were the major deficiencies during the development of process safety indicators. The main objective {{of this research is}} to construct a systematic technique to develop process safety leading indicators by selecting the most effective leading indicators, defining different safety metrics for each leading indicator, conducting accurate measurements, monitoring these metrics on a frequent basis, and revalidating the measures using <b>lagging</b> <b>indicators</b> and near-misses. The effects and contribution of different organizational factors were studied and analyzed within process safety performance. Process safety leadership, data collection system, and proactive monitoring are critical factors that directly impact the development of process safety leading indicators...|$|R
