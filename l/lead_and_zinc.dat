5|$|Nigeria {{also has}} {{a wide array of}} underexploited mineral {{resources}} which include natural gas, coal, bauxite, tantalite, gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, niobium, <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>zinc.</b> Despite huge deposits of these natural resources, the mining industry in Nigeria is still in its infancy.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E
40|$|Mineral and ore occurences at Mt. Ivanščica are {{situated}} in the Middle Triassic carbonate rocks and are of epigenetic origin. These occurences are characterised by simple paragenesis of primary sulphides of <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> traces of sulphides of iron and copper. This mineralization is similar to Mississippi Valley Pb-Zn deposits (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
5|$|Trappers and explorers {{arrived in}} {{southern}} Idaho {{in the early}} 19thcentury. They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849, including the Oregon and California trails. The forest was used by early settlers primarily for extractive industries. Fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin {{in the northern part}} of the forest in the 1820s, but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver. For early settlers, the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply, regulation of stream flow for irrigation, and use of the land for cattle range. Mining began in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s, and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold, silver, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>zinc.</b> The Black Pine Division of the forest was explored in the late 1800s, and the Tallman Mine began producing gold in the 1920s with production peaking from 1949 to 1954. The Black Pine Mine again produced gold from 1992 through November 1997, when the mine's parent company, Pegasus Gold, declared bankruptcy. The location of the mine has since been reclaimed.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around {{the beginning of the}} 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after {{the discovery}} of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.|$|E
