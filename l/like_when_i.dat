500|$|Jam and Lewis {{also asked}} the boy band 98 Degrees to join Carey and Joe on the track, as they wanted male harmonies. Carey talked about the {{collaboration}} {{in an interview with}} MTV. [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was writing 'One Sweet Day'. It really cried out for a group to be singing with me and for a strong male-female thing in terms of going back and forth, vocally. So you know, we just naturally came together." [...] The vocals were recorded at Capri Digital Studios, Capri, Italy and Avatar Studios, New York City. The track was mixed by Supa Engineer Duo at Right Track Recording and mastered by Herb Powers.|$|E
500|$|Her {{biological}} father's {{love for}} rock music by Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and Jimi Hendrix also influences her. She has also listed Nine Inch Nails and its frontman, Trent Reznor, Björk, Fiona Apple, Aaliyah, Skinny Puppy, AC/DC, Hole and Oasis as musical influences, citing the albums (What's the Story) Morning Glory? and Live Through This {{as the most}} influential to her current sound. She has also mentioned Janet Jackson as a primary influence, saying [...] "I love everything she does." [...] The first concert she attended was an AC/DC concert with her father. Recalling the experience, she told Revolver, [...] "...I was <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> grow up, this is what I want to do!" ...|$|E

[...] Officially {{known as}} the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy, she acted as a {{coordinator}} for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government. [...] Her position was sometimes informally described as the [...] "Energy Czar" [...] or the [...] "Climate Czar". [...] It did not require Senate confirmation. Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress, but the Obama transition team said {{there was nothing wrong}} with it. In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: [...] "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was at EPA and I could depend on regulation." ...|$|E

500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

2500|$|After {{seeing them}} at SXSW, Robin Hilton of NPR's All Songs Considered {{described}} their sound as [...] "gloriously loud fuzzy rock." [...] All Songs Considered featured the band's song “Yeah, I’m Okay With My Shit Life.” Hilton went on saying that there's been lot of comparisons between Generation X and the Millennials over the years, they’re exactly the same, nothing’s changed. He expanded, [...] "The complaint about Gen Xer's were they’re lazy and don’t care. They’re the whatever generation. And I felt <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was watching a}} lot of the younger bands at South by this year I really felt like that vibe is coming back. The whatever rock, and I loved it." [...] Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton coined the genre name of 'Whatever Rock'/Shrug Rock, naming Bethlehem Steel as their source.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
