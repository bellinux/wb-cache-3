The degree of foreign ownership in Baltic banking is quite high, thus majority credit growth was largely financed by heavy borrowing of the biggest players in the lending market from the parent banks. Consequently, there is a sizeable inflow of debt (denominated in foreign currency) into the banking sector from parent banks to support the credit growth in the Baltic states.

In the interior, the religious wars {{had been going}} on for 35 years, devastating the country. The peasants, like the inhabitants of the cities, bore the brunt of supporting the troops when they crossed or were stationed in their region. And between campaigns, a good part of those demobilized troops, composed of mercenaries, were wandering, looting and extorting money from towns, villages and castles.

50|$|During the 1980s, Interflug had to {{cope with}} {{increasing}} problems due to its ageing fleet: The fuel efficiency proved to be inferior compared to (at that time) modern Western airliners, and noise protection regulations meant that the company had to pay increased landing fees, in some cases even facing bans from operating at certain airports. Western-built airliners (most notably those produced by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas or Airbus) could not be delivered to countries of the Soviet bloc because of the CoCom embargo. Following a deal between Boeing and LOT Polish Airlines for the purchase of six Boeing 767 aircraft and in order to acknowledge the Perestroika movement, commercial airliners were exempted from the trade embargo in 1988. Also Malév Hungarian Airlines bought Boeings in 1988. In the same year, Interflug placed an order for three Airbus A310 long haul aircraft, worth DM 420 million.

50|$|The {{government}} {{sought to}} go further and end the repayment to Britain of land annuities. These originated from the government <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> Irish tenant farmers by the Land Commission from the 1880s, which had enabled them purchase lands from their former landlords, under the Irish Land Acts. In 1923, the previous W. T. Cosgrave government had assured Britain that the Free State would honour its debts and hand over the land annuities and other financial liabilities. Under the 1925 London Agreement, the Free State was relieved from its treaty obligation to pay its share towards the public debt of the United Kingdom. The Free State's liability to supervise and pass on land annuities payments led to controversy and debate on whether they were private or public debts. In 1932, de Valera interpreted that the annuities {{were part of the}} public debt from which the Free State had been exempted, and decided that the State would no longer pay them to Britain. His government passed the Land Act of 1933 that allowed the money to be spent on local government projects.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to analyze the credit risk of a {{microfinance}} institution based on the loan portfolio of a leading Maghrebian microfinance institution, both in terms of number of clients served and of portfolio size. This allows us to work with a proprietary data set of 1, 144, 770 contracts issued between 1997 and 2007. Using a resampling technique, we estimate the probability density function of losses and value-at-risk measures for a portfolio of <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> female and male microfinance clients separately. Results show that loss rates are higher for a male client population than for a female client population, both on average as for percentiles 95 to 99. 99. We find that this difference is due to lower default probabilities for female clients, while recovery rates for male and female clients are similar. We also analyze diversification effects, where we find that the proportion of diversifiable risk in total risk is bigger for portfolios of <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> female clients than for portfolios of <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> male clients. Finally we show that capital requirements determined by the 99. 9 percentile remain below those required by the Basel 2 Accords, which opens perspectives for a specific treatment of microfinance if financial regulation becomes applicable to the sector. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Our database comes from Union des Mutuelles du Partenariat pour la Mobilisation de l’Epargne et du Crédit au Sénégal (UM-PAMECAS), a Senegalese network made of 38 financial cooperatives providing 419, 602 members with micro-loans. We use fixed-effect panel estimation to analyze the interplay of female/male-dominated boards with female/male managers. The regressions explain the average loan size and the proportion of <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> women. Our results show that male managers mitigate the social orientation of female-dominated boards. In contrast, female managers tend to enhance this orientation. More puzzling is the influence of female managers associated with male-dominated boards. In this case, the presence of a female manager increases the average loan size and reduces the proportion of <b>loans</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> women. In sum, female managers tend to align their objectives on those of the local board even though their hierarchy is at the central level.
