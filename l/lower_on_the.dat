The album performed better on the Billboard R/Hip-Hop Albums component chart, where it managed to reach number six. Dance Again... the Hits performed significantly <b>lower</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard 200 than Lopez's seventh studio album Love?, which peaked at number five, {{as well as her}} previous compilation album J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002), which peaked at number one. After a month, the album had sold 38,000 copies in the United States. As of December 2012, Dance Again... the Hits is Lopez's second lowest performing album in the country; only The Reel Me achieved a lower chart position in 2003, peaking at number 69. On the UK Albums Chart, Dance Again... the Hits debuted at number four with sales of 9,213 copies in its first week of release, matching the peak of J to Tha L-O!: The Remixes in that country.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even <b>lower</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social scale, a black newsboy.

The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

25|$|The {{leaves are}} flat linear, 3–8cm long and 2–5mm broad. They are {{arranged}} spirally on the shoot but twisted {{at the base}} to appear in two or four flattened ranks. As the leaves mature, they develop from bright lime-green to a more yellowish-green. The seed cones are green, 6–12cm long and 5–10cm in diameter, and mature about 18–20 months after wind pollination. They disintegrate at maturity to release the seeds which are small and brown, thin and papery with a wing around the edge to aid wind-dispersal. The male (pollen) cones are slender conic, 5–11cm long and 1–2cm broad and reddish-brown in colour and are <b>lower</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree than the seed cones.

25|$|S. balanoides {{can be the}} {{dominant}} species of rocky shores, where it grows {{in a range of}} situations, from very sheltered to very exposed. It is typically found <b>lower</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore than another barnacle, Chthamalus montagui, although with some overlap. S. balanoides can tolerate salinities down to 20psu, allowing it to colonise parts of estuaries. On semi-exposed shores, S. balanoides may form a patchwork with patches of seaweeds, such as Fucus serratus, and limpets; the fronds of the seaweeds brush the barnacle larvae from the rocks, allowing limpets to colonise it instead. At the southern limit of its range, including Cornwall, S. balanoides is replaced by Chthamalus montagui. Although capable of living in the sublittoral zone, S. balanoides tends to be restricted to the intertidal by predation and by competition from species such as the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Chondrus crispus.|$|E
25|$|The {{basin and}} range {{topography}} of northern Nevada and the extensive and flat Snake River Plain characterize the geologically young Salmon Falls Creek basin. The Basin and Range area {{was created by}} crustal stretching along an area dense in faults running north to south, with valleys forming along the fault lines. Sediments deposited by streams and lakes in the Pliocene and Miocene filled much of the present-day main stem valley. <b>Lower</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creek, basalt rocks of volcanic origin and thick deposits of loess soil compose the primary surface geology. Beginning about 12 million years ago, the North American Plate slowly passed over a large volcanic hotspot, which formed and caused frequent volcanic activity throughout the Snake River Plain. The hotspot, which now lies beneath Yellowstone National Park, deposited massive lava flows throughout the plain. About 14,500 years ago, the Bonneville Flood rushed through the Snake River Plain, carving out and extending many canyons including lower Salmon Falls Creek Canyon. The extent of the floods {{was so great that}} most of lower Salmon Falls Creek pooled up into a temporary lake as miles of land were submerged {{on both sides of the}} Snake. Wind-blown soil and sediment deposited by the floods have covered most of the basalt, which is still exposed in areas such as Salmon Falls Creek Canyon.|$|E
