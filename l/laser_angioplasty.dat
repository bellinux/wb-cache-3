BACKGROUND: Previous randomized studies evaluating the effect of coronary interventions mainly focused on {{the long-term}} clinical and angiographic outcome. The functional outcome, assessed by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, has not been evaluated in a randomized setting. METHODS: A total of 308 patients with stable angina and a longer coronary lesion (> 10 mm) were randomized to excimer <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> or balloon angioplasty. A 99 mTechnetium- 2 -methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study was performed in 139 patients before the initial angioplasty procedure and at 6 months follow-up (73 patients in the laser group versus 66 patients in the balloon group, respectively). Exercise tolerance at follow-up was compared to baseline values by means of exercise duration and double product at peak exercise. Myocardial perfusion of the randomized vascular bed was assessed semi-quantitatively on the MIBI SPECT images. The reversible defects were graded as mild, moderate or severe. Myocardial perfusion at follow-up was expressed as a percentage reduction in incidence and grading of the reversible defects compared to baseline values. RESULTS: Forty-four (61 %) patients assigned to <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> were asymptomatic at 6 months follow-up compared to 34 (52 %) patients assigned to balloon angioplasty (p = NS).

The mean (SD) reference diameter before target lesion revascularisation was 2. 12  (0. 5)  mm. Procedural success was achieved in all cases, but 57 % of the patients had restenosis after six months. The rate of further restenosis was higher with <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> (78 %) than with restenting (47 %) or balloon angioplasty alone (49 %, p <  0. 05).  CONCLUSIONS—Treatment for in-stent restenosis in small coronary arteries is feasible and safe, with a second restenosis rate comparable to large coronary artery series. The strategy of target lesion revascularisation influences further in-stent restenosis, with an increased rate with <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> compared with restenting and repeat dilatation alone.    Keywords: restenosis; coronary stent; small vessels; coronary artery diseas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} shown that {{coronary}} excimer <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> can remove atherosclerotic intracoronary tissue. Stand alone coronary excimer <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> was successfully performed in a 53 year old white man with 90 % stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and exertional angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III). The lesion was reduced to a 30 % residual stenosis with use of a 1. 2 mm and subsequently a 1. 8 mm diameter laser catheter. Early follow-up angiography 24 h later revealed persistent patency and unchanged lesion diameter of the target vessel. The patient was free of symptoms during the 2 month follow-up period, but died suddenly while playing in a tennis tournament 63 days alter the procedure. Postmortem histologic examination revealed 80 % restenosis at the lesion site without plaque disruption or thrombosis. Specific staining of the histologic specimen for smooth muscle cells using alpha-actin revealed significant smooth muscle cell proliferation at the site of coronary excimer <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty.</b> However, most of the vessel narrowing appeared to be due to underlying fibrotic plaque as a result of insufficient tissue ablation.

40|$|In this study, the {{development}} of intraoperative angioscopy, {{the value of the}} information obtained, and the problems encountered with the procedure are reported. Eight angioscopes, 1. 5 to 2. 8 mm in diameter, with a line resolution of greater than 0. 4 mm at 5 mm, were used. One-hundred ten angioscopic investigations were performed in 46 patients; 24 at peripheral bypass surgery and 22 at coronary artery bypass surgery. These included 68 arteries, 28 new anastomoses, six old grafts, five <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasties,</b> and three in situ vein grafts. The most important finding was that angioscopic data provide information not available from probes or angiography. Angioscopic findings were responsible for a change in surgical procedures in 12 patients (26 %) including three anastomotic revisions, three alterations in graft site placement, and two repeat thrombectomies. The most significant technical problems were lack of steerability and insufficient irrigation, which resulted in poor angiographic images. Further technical development is necessary before routine intraoperative angioscopy is practical. Nevertheless, if these problems are resolved, angioscopy will provide unique, high-resolution information which can directly alter surgical therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} the addition of plaque ablation by hot-tip <b>laser</b> to balloon <b>angioplasty.</b> Design:Prospective randomised clinical trial. Materials and methods:Patients with either occlusion or > 50 % diameter stenosis less than 3 cm in length in the superficial femoral artery, and with two or three calf vessel run-off were eligible and randomised to receive either balloon angioplasty alone or with laser assistance. Treatment failure in follow-up was defined as reocclusion or recurrence of greater than 50 % stenosis at the site of angioplasty. Results:Ninety limbs (82 patients) were entered into the study. Forty-four patients had mild claudication, 32 more severe symptoms and 6 rest pain or ulceration.

40|$|The authors {{report their}} {{experience}} of <b>laser</b> thermal <b>angioplasty</b> {{in a series of}} 20 patients. An argon laser with a 1. 5 or 2. 0 millimeter diameter metalcapped optical fiber (Hot Tip Trimedyne Inc.) was used; the laser probe was pushed to the occlusion point; after a channel was produced through the obliteration, a conventional percutaneous balloon angioplasty was performed. The indications were: 4 primitive iliac occlusions, 15 femoral/popliteal occlusions and 1 subclavian obliteration. The immediate results were as follows (table I) : 75 % overall recanalization (50 % at the iliac level, 87 % at the femoral/popliteal level and failure at the subclavian level); 5 notable complications were observed (2 limb ischaemia, 2 voluminous inguinal haematoma and 1 aortic cross perforation) without clinical sequelae. The short term follow-up (1 to 8 months) of the successfully treated patients (table II) shows 100 % permeability at the iliac level and 77 % at the femoral/popliteal level. We conclude that <b>laser</b> thermal <b>angioplasty</b> is a very attractive method in the treatment of primitive iliac and femoral/popliteal occlusions. The well-defined indications must form the subject of a closely discussion between the angiologist, the vascular surgeon and the interventional radiologist.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>angioplasty,</b> {{or the use}} {{of laser}} {{radiation}} to vaporize or remove obstructure atherosclerotic plaque, has been an active area of research for the past several years. This article reviews current design considerations for developing a safe, effective clinical <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> system. The choice of laser, fiber, and catheter determines the performance characteristics of such a system. The laser provides the power source for ablative radiation, the fiber furnishes a means of transmitting the laser radiation, and the catheter provides a way of directing the fiber at the target tissue. Other considerations, such as the need for feedback control of laser ablation and the planned application of the system in the coronary or peripheral circulation, also determine the ultimate design.

40|$|AbstractVascular {{injury and}} {{platelet}} accumulation after balloon angioplasty are two potentially important triggers {{of the process}} of restenosis that may be minimized by the use of laser energy to ablate atherosclerotic plaque. The type of laser most suitable to achieve these goals remains unknown. Accordingly, angiographic and histologic studies and quantitative platelet deposition analysis were performed on 27 atherosclerotic rabbit iliac arteries randomized to treatment with excimer laser or thermal <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty.</b> Excimer <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> was achieved with 35 to 40 mJ/mm 2 of 308 nm xenon chloride irradiation delivered through a 4. 5 F catheter made of 13 concentrically arranged 200 μm fiber optics, at a repetition rate of 25 to 30 Hz and a pulse duration of 135 ns; thermal <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> was achieved with a 1. 7 mm metal probe heated with 10 W of continuous wave argon laser energy. The baseline and post-laser luminal diameters of excimer laser-treated vessels (0. 92 ± 0. 28 and 1. 56 ± 0. 48 mm, respectively) were similar to those observed in thermal laser-treated vessels (1. 05 ± 0. 44 and 1. 61 ± 0. 41 mm, respectively). Perforation occurred in 4 (29 %) of 14 thermal laser-treated arteries and in 0 of 13 excimer laser-treated arteries (p = 0. 04); spasm was observed in only 1 thermal laser-treated vessel. On the basis of a quantitative histologic grading scheme (damage scores of 0 to 4), greater degrees of injury were measured in thermal versus excimer laser-treated vessels (2. 4 ± 1. 0 versus 1. 3 ± 0. 4, p = 0. 009). When arteries with vascular perforation were excluded, similar degrees of platelet deposition were seen in thermal and excimer laser-treated vessels (27 ± 22 and 17 ± 3 × 106 platelets/ cm, respectively; p = 0. 37). In vessels treated with thermal <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty,</b> platelet deposition was strongly correlated with histologie gradc (r = 0. 72; p = 0. 006). These results suggest that the excimer laser is able to ablate atherosclerotic plaque in vivo with fewer complications and lower levels of histologic damage than are obtained with the thermal laser; however, in atherosclerotic vessels, excimer <b>laser</b> <b>angioplasty</b> does not reduce platelet deposition. Whether these effects of the excimer laser will translate into an increased or decreased rate of restenosis after angioplasty remains to be determined...|$|E
