40|$|Running title: Structural {{proteomics}} of macrophage proteins 2 This chapter {{describes the}} methodology adopted {{in a project}} aimed at structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of proteins that potentially {{play an important role}} in mammalian macrophages. The methodology that underpins this project is applicable to both small research groups and larger structural genomics consortia. Gene products with putative roles in macrophage function are identified using gene expression information obtained via DNA microarray technology. Specific targets for structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> are then selected based on a set of criteria aimed at maximizing insight into function. The target proteins are cloned using a modification of Gateway ® cloning technology, expressed with hexa-histidine tags in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity using a combination of affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Purified proteins are finally subjected to crystallization trials and/or NMR-based screening to identify candidates for structure determination. Wher...|$|R
