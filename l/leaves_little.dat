The road continues northwest through farmland with some trees and homes, passing to the southwest of Octagonal Schoolhouse before heading through the community of Cowgills Corner. Past this intersection, the route runs southwest of Chandelle Estates Airport. DE 9 curves {{to the north and}} enters the town of Leipsic. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Denny Street and runs past homes and businesses, curving north to intersect the eastern terminus of DE 42.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, <b>leaves</b> <b>little</b> or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

In Ellicottville, NY242 gains the moniker of West Washington Street, paralleling Sunset Hill Cemetery into downtown, where the route intersects with US219 (Jefferson Street).|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} {{for the evolution of}} sexual symbiosis is that the relatively low density of females in deep-sea environments <b>leaves</b> <b>little</b> opportunity for mate choice among anglerfish. Females remain large to accommodate fecundity, as is evidenced by their large ovaries and eggs. Males would be expected to shrink to reduce metabolic costs in resource-poor environments and would develop highly specialized female-finding abilities. If a male manages to find a female, then symbiotic attachment is ultimately more likely to improve lifetime fitness relative to free living, particularly when the prospect of finding future mates is poor. An additional advantage to symbiosis is that the male’s sperm can be used in multiple fertilizations, as he stays always available to the female for mating. Higher densities of male-female encounters might correlate with species that demonstrate facultative symbiosis or simply use a more traditional temporary contact mating.|$|E

500|$|The {{reception}} for {{the album was}} mostly positive.

Orens went on to say [...] "It's not a completely satisfying recording, but it is the best example {{of one of the most}} dominating and influential styles of the 1980s." [...] Lori E. Pike of the Los Angeles Times gave the album a grade of an A-, saying that [...] "Collins' recipe of tense vocals spiced with saucy horns and splashy electro-jitterbugging synthesisers often <b>leaves</b> <b>little</b> room for real feeling to squeeze through.

500|$|Brode {{acknowledges}} {{that the question of}} whether Brownlee seduced MacMillan [...] "defies any definitive answer" [...] but says that the evidence presented in the trial did not justify a finding that he did, and speculates that if MacMillan had brought her suit in a later generation she would have been [...] "laughed out of court". [...] Lakeland College historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster does not take a position on whether or not Brownlee was guilty of seduction, but hints that a likely truth might lie [...] "between the two extremes" [...] of the parties' claims: that Brownlee and MacMillan did have a consensual affair which was then highjacked and exploited by the premier's more opportunistic and vengeful opponents. [...] He <b>leaves</b> <b>little</b> doubt that he considers the behaviour of the Edmonton Bulletin and of the Liberal Party, especially its leader, William R. Howson, to have been profoundly unethical. [...] Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel has criticized Foster for being too friendly towards Brownlee, saying that he does not consider the scandal sufficiently from MacMillan's perspective.|$|E
500|$|In the 1st century, {{the area}} was conquered by the Romans. The late 2nd century Antonine Itinerary {{mentions}} a Roman settlement called Coccium [...] from the Roman fort at Manchester (Mamucium) and [...] from the fort at Ribchester (Bremetennacum). Although the distances are slightly out, it has been assumed that Coccium is Roman Wigan. Possible derivations of Coccium include from the Latin coccum, meaning [...] "scarlet in colour, scarlet cloth", or from cocus, meaning [...] "cook". [...] Over the years chance finds (coins and pottery) provided clear indications that a Roman settlement existed at Wigan, although its size and status remained unknown. [...] In 2005 investigations ahead of the Grand Arcade development, and in 2008 at the Joint Service Centre development, have proved that, without doubt, Wigan was a significant Roman site in the late first and second centuries AD. [...] The excavated remains of ditches at Ship Yard off Millgate were consistent with use by the Roman military and possibly formed part of the defences for a fort or a temporary camp. More remarkable remains were excavated to the south, {{in the area of}} McEwen’s Yard (opposite the baths), where the foundations of a large and very important building were discovered, together with many other Roman features. It was demonstrated to be 36 metres long and 18 metres wide and had been constructed in stone with a tiled roof. It contained nine or ten rooms, including three with hypocausts. It had a colonnaded portico on the northern side, which presumably formed the main entrance. The structure's ground-plan and the presence of the hypocaust, <b>leaves</b> <b>little</b> doubt that this was a bath-house. [...] A timber building excavated at the Joint Service Centre (top of the Wiend) has been interpreted as a barrack block. This suggests a Roman fort occupied the crest of the hill, taking advantage of the strategic position overlooking the River Douglas. [...] It is clear from the evidence gained from these excavations that Wigan was an important Roman settlement, and was almost certainly the place referred to as Coccium in the Antonine Itinerary.|$|E
