40|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>loss</b> causes optical {{energy to}} leave the laser cavity in the transverse, lateral, direction, and is {{sometimes}} neglected to simplify the numerical simulations. However, in contrast to outcoupling and absorption losses, we show that the <b>lateral</b> <b>loss</b> can change drastically with only nanometer-sized changes of the cavity structure, from being virtually zero to becoming {{the major source of}} cavity loss, since the cavity becomes antiguiding. This can be explained as the opening of a channel of efficient resonant lateral leakage of optical power at a certain oblique propagation angle. A number of different realizations of current apertures and top mirror designs in GaN-based VCSEL cavities, which have been suggested for realization of microcavity lasers emitting in the blue wavelength range, are simulated. Many of these are shown to lead to unintentional antiguiding, which can more than double the threshold gain for lasing. Notably, for strong enough antiguiding the resonant lateral leakage decreases so that the threshold gain values might again be tolerable. This regime has been suggested for robust single-mode operation since earlier predictions, building on analogies with slab waveguides, hinted at a very strong suppression of higher order modes. However, our simulations indicate that for the VCSEL cavities the derived formulas grossly overestimate the modal discrimination...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} were numerous but {{centered on a}} scientific overarching question: the influence of mesoscale physical processes on planktonic ecosystems in coastal upwellings. The use of several and complementary tools was necessary to assess the various mechanisms occurring at these scales. First, the variability of the physical and biogeochemical properties of the Iberian Peninsula Upwelling System was studied using in-situ data from the MOUTON 2007 survey. The coastal domain was divided into different biogeochemical provinces: high nutrient concentrations {{are found in the}} northern part due to upwelled waters of subpolar origin whereas the southern area was characterized by moderate nutrient concentrations (waters of subtropical origin). The intense cross-shore gradient revealed that the biological activity is associated with the successive upwelling pulses. Data from a filament allowed us to assess its impact in terms of cross-shore exchanges of biological material. Then, a secondary upwelling front located at the shelf break was observed in these data. We built a simplified 2 D numerical model to explain it by the eastward advection from upwelling currents of deep water columns onto the shelf. It creates a negative anomaly of Potential Vorticity (PV) which generates the secondary front. A simulation revealed a filamentation process that was further investigated numerically. The interaction between the alongshore upwelling current and a promontory creates anomalies of PV in the lower layer that generates the development of a filament trapped {{in the vicinity of the}} promontory. Finally, we used satellite data associated with a lagrangian tool (Finite-Size Lyapunov Exponent) to study the horizontal mixing in relation to the biological activity over the four eastern boundary upwelling zones. We showed a negative relationship between horizontal surface mixing and chlorophyll content, which seems related to a diminution of vertical velocities of the coastal upwelling, as well as a <b>lateral</b> <b>loss</b> of nutrient due to moving eddies. Horizontal mixing induced by eddies thus has an inhibiting effect on the phytoplankton in coastal upwellings, whereas a positive effect stands for the open ocean. Using diverse and complementary tools allowed us to improve our knowledge of the large influence of physical processes on marine ecosystems. Les objectifs multiples étaient centrés autour d'une thématique générale : l'influence des processus physiques à mésoéchelle sur l'écosystème planctonique dans les upwellings côtiers. L'utilisation d'outils variés était nécessaire pour aborder les nombreux mécanismes impliqués.

40|$|Side weirs, {{also known}} as a lateral weirs, and {{overflow}} dams are free overflow regulation and diversion devices commonly encountered in hydraulic engineering. They are set into the side of a channel or river allowing to spill a part of the discharge over their crest when the surface of the flow in the main-channel exceeds a certain level. The <b>lateral</b> <b>loss</b> of water is reducing the sediment transport capacity in the main-channel yielding to aggradation and the formation of a local sediment deposit in the downstream weir alignment. The reduced cross section generates backwater effects and additional contraction and expansion losses. As a consequence, the head over the side weir rises and the side overflow discharge as well. The design discharge to be diverted over the weir is increased by this flow-sediment transport interaction. Since the interaction of side overflow with bed-load and bed morphology in a channel has not been studied so far, systematic tests have been performed. Three test series and one reference experiment without side weir have been carried out in a 20. 00 m long, 1. 50 m wide and 1. 20 m high rectangular flume. The first test series consisted of a 3. 00 m long side weir, the second one had a 6. 00 m long weir and the third series was characterised by two weirs of 2. 50 m length each. The approach discharge varied between 0. 098 m 3 /s ≤ Q 1 ≤ 0. 222 m 3 /s. The overall flow regime has been subcritical. The average initial bottom slope was 0. 21 %. The mobile bed was characterized by a median particle size of d 50 = 0. 72 mm. During the experiments the water surface, the 2 D-velocity field, the side overflow discharge and sediment supply were measured. The final bed morphology has been recorded by means of digital photogrammetry. Based on the systematic experimental flume study a one- and a two-dimensional empirical model for the prediction of the mobile bed evolution near the side weir have been developed. The models allow a simple and straightforward estimation of the interaction of a side overflow with bed-load transport and bed morphology in engineering practice. The 1 D-model represents the overall mobile bed evolution in the weir reach. The model takes into account a deposit being uniform over the channel width. The height of the deposit only varies in longitudinal direction. In addition to the 1 D-approach the 2 D-model incorporates the variation of the deposit over the channel width. For the parameterisation of the two models a Maxwell-type distribution function is applied. Input parameters for both models such as the location and height of the maximum bed elevation and a shape factor are expressed in terms of non-dimensional geometric channel and side weir variables as well as hydraulic parameters and bed load transport relations. For the 2 D-approach an additional relationship considering the spanwise variation is developed. To implement the models in numerical flow simulations expressions for the location of the empirical deposit relative to the side weir are established. Regarding the impact of the deposit on the intensity of side overflow it has been found out that the spilled discharge might increase by a factor of up to ≈ 3 compared to fixed plane bed conditions. In this context about 25 % of the total increase are attributed to effects of form roughness and about 75 % to bed aggradation phenomena. In this regard the height of the deposit represents the most important parameter. The location of the deposit with respect to the position of the side weir has a smaller influence, whereas the downstream shape of the deposit is of minor importance. To test the prediction accuracy of the models they have been implemented into 1 D-flow calculations. The predicted side overflow was about 85 % for the 1 D-model and about 91 % for the 2 D-model. The difference is mainly caused due to the implementation of the spanwise variation in the 2 D-model. Besides the two models a simple relationship for direct estimation of side overflow discharge in presence of bed-load transport has been established. The empirical models have been applied in a case study on the Rhone river upstream of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. In the case of a flat bed without deposit a protection for a flood event with a hundred year return period persists. Taking into account the mobile bed evolution a protection even for an extreme flood might be obtained. This presumes a sufficiently large storage volume of the retention bassin. The skewed deposit induces the formation of an oscillatory erosion gutter downstream of the weir. For the description of the sine-generated evolution of the thalweg indicative expressions are proposed. In order to test the capability of a numerical tool to reproduce the bed aggradation phenomena observed in the experiments, 1 D-numerical simulations with bed-load transport have been performed (DUPIRO). From these computations it can be concluded that the most experimental phenomena are captured with reasonable accuracy...|$|E

Estimates of <b>lateral</b> <b>losses</b> are essential for beach nourishment design, these predictions {{have been made in}} the last decade utilizing empirical formulations, one line models or lately, process-based coastal morphology models. Coastal morphology models are, however, complex and computationally intensive and in order to maintain a balance between model complexities, computational effort and processing capacity, schematization of model input (input reduction) is necessary. This paper is divided into two main sections. In the first section techniques of wave input reduction for morphological models are evaluated with focus on open ocean wave-dominated coasts. Subsequently, the optimized morphological model is applied to evaluate coastal engineering interventions aimed at reducing volume losses from the Delray Beach nourishment project. Wave input reduction is defined here as the process of reducing the full wave climate of a given coastal region to a set of representative wave-wind conditions, ‘running’ a model with these representative wave conditions in sequence for a smaller time period (i. e. a few tide cycles) and multiplying its effect on the morphology by a Morfac value, that is related to the frequency of occurrence of that wave condition in nature, or its weight in the overall wave climate. Five different techniques of wave input reduction were tested. Of all the methods of wave climate schematization tested the methods defined as ‘Energy Flux Method’ and ‘Opti Method’ showed best results in terms of representing accurately the sediment transport patterns of the study area. The tests conducted indicate that a number around 12 representative wave cases was enough to represent an annual wave climate compared to a very detailed wave climate used as benchmark. The optimized model was used to evaluate alternative engineering solutions to reduce volumetric losses from the beach nourishment project. Engineering solutions evaluated included a construction of a breakwater field, backfilling all dredge pits located offshore of the project site, construction of a groin field at the downdrift end of the project, and backfilling the deepest dredge pit. These engineering interventions caused a reduction in beach volume losses within the project limits with varying levels of effect on the downdrift beaches.
