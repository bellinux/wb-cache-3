50|$|Linguistic syntax is {{especially}} marked by its structural richness, which becomes apparent in its multi <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> {{as well as}} in the strong relationship between syntax and meaning. That is that there are special linguistic syntactic principles that define how the language is formed out of different subunits, such as words out of morphemes, phrases out of words and sentences out of phrases. Furthermore, linguistic syntax is featured by the fact that a word can take on abstract grammatical functions that are less defined through properties of the word itself and more through the context and structural relations. This is for example that every noun can be used as a subject, object or indirect object, but without a sentence as the normal context of a word, no statement about its grammatical function can be made. At last, linguistic syntax is marked by abstractness. This means that only conventional structural relations and not psychoacoustic relationships are the basis for the linguistic syntax.|$|E

5000|$|The {{highest level}} of pitch {{organization}} {{can be seen in}} key structure. In Western European tonal music the key is based on a scale with its associated chords and chord relations. Scales can be built up as minor or major scales (differing in the succession of intervals between the scale tones) on each of the 12 pitch classes and therefore there are 24 possible keys in tonal music. Analysing key structure in context of musical syntax means {{to examine the relationship between}} keys in a piece of music. Usually, not only one key is used to build up a composition, but also so-called key [...] "modulations" [...] (in other words the alteration of keys) are utilized. In these modulations a certain recurring pattern can be perceived. Switches from one key to another are often found between related keys. Three general principles for relationship between keys can be postulated on the basis of perceptual experiments and also neural evidence for implicit knowledge of key structure. Looking at the C-major key as an example, there are three close related keys: G-major, A-minor and C-minor. C-major and G-major are keys whose 1st scale degrees are separated by a musical fifth (the pattern of relations is represented in the circle of fifths" [...] for major keys). A-minor and C-major share the same notes of the scale but with a different tonic (so-called relative minor key, i.e. C-major and A-minor). And C-major and C-minor have the same tonic in their scales.All in all it can be said that music like the human language has a considerable multi <b>layered</b> <b>organization.</b>|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we report}} in vivo 3 -D {{visualization}} of the <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> of a rat olfactory bulb (OB) by a swept source {{optical coherence tomography}} (SS-OCT). The SS-OCT operates at a wavelength of 1334 nm with respective theoretical depth and lateral resolutions of 6. 7 μm and 15. 4 μm in air and hence {{it is possible to}} get a 3 D structural map of OB in vivo at the micron level resolution with millimeter-scale imaging depth. Up until now, with methods such as MRI, confocal microscopy, OB depth structure in vivo had not been clearly visualized as these do not satisfy the criterion of simultaneously providing micron-scale spatial resolution and imaging up to a few millimeter in depth. In order to confirm the OB’s <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> revealed by SS-OCT, we introduced the technique of electrocoagulation to make landmarks across the layered structure. To our knowledge this is such a first study that combines electrocoagulation and OCT in vivo of rat OB. Our results confirmed the <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> of OB, and moreover the layers were clearly identified by electrocoagulation landmarks both in the OCT structural and anatomical slice images. We expect such a combined study is beneficial for both OCT and neuroscience fields...|$|E

End-on views reveal that chlorosomes are composed of several multi-layer tubules of variable diameter (20 – 30 nm) with some locally undulating non-tubular lamellae in between. The multi-layered tubular structures are more regular and larger in a C. tepidum mutant that only synthesizes [8 -ethyl, 12 -methyl]-BChl d.

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} fibrils have circular {{cross sections}} with radii mostly distributed in between 50 and 100 nm and {{are characterized by}} an axial banding pattern with a period of 67 nm. The constituent long molecules of those fibrils, the so-called triple helices, are densely packed but their nature is such that their assembly must conciliate two conflicting requirements : a double-twist around the axis of the fibril induced by their chirality and a periodic <b>layered</b> <b>organization,</b> corresponding to the axial banding, built by specific lateral interactions. We examine here how such a conflict could contribute to {{the control of the}} radius of a fibril. We develop our analysis with the help of two geometrical archetypes : the Hopf fibration and the algorithm of phyllotaxis. The first one provides an ideal template for a twisted bundle of fibres and the second ensures the best homogeneity and local isotropy possible for a twisted dense packing with circular symmetry. This approach shows that, as the radius of a fibril with constant double-twist increases, the periodic <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> can not be preserved without moving from planar to helicoidal configurations. Such changes of configurations are indeed made possible by the edge dislocations naturally present in the phyllotactic pattern where their distribution is such that the lateral growth of a fibril should stay limited in the observed range. Because of our limited knowledge about the elastic constants involved, this purely geometrical development stays at a quite conjectural level...|$|E

40|$|The {{blood vessel}} wall {{consists}} of three cellular layers, an outer adventitial, a middle medial and an inner intimal layer. When the blood vessel forms in the embryo it begins as a tube composed of a single cell type called endothelial cells. Over time, other cells are recruited from the surrounding tissue to form additional layers on the outer surface of the endothelial tube. The cells that are recruited are called mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal cells {{are responsible for the}} production of connective tissue that holds the blood vessel together and for developing into vascular smooth muscle cells that are responsible for regulating the diameter of the vessel (1) and therefore, blood flow. In a fully developed blood vessel, the endothelial cells make- up the majority of cells in the intimal layer while the mesenchymal cells make-up the majority of cells in the medial and adventitial layers. Within the medial layer of a mature vessel, cells are organized into multiple circular layers of alternating bands of connective tissue and cells. The cell layer is composed of a mixture of mesenchymal cells that have not developed into smooth muscle cells and fully developed smooth muscle cells (2). The assembly and organization of complex tissues is directed in part by a signaling system composed of proteins on the cell surface called adhesion molecules. Adhesion molecules enable cells to recognize each other as well as the composition of the connective tissue in which they reside (3). It was hypothesized that the different cell types that compose the vascular wall possess different adhesion molecules that enable them to recognize each other and through this recognition system, form the complex <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> of the vascular wall. In other words, the <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> is an intrinsic property of the cells. If this hypothesis is correct then the different cells that make up the vessel wall, when mixed together, should organize themselves into a layered structure resembling an intact blood vessel. Experiments described below were designed to test this hypothesis...|$|E

Our approach performs better than the other existing approaches in terms of accuracy and interactivity, it supports human inputs and constraints. In this paper, we present this approach and compare it to existing solutions. We applied our approach on two large software systems to identify package layers and the results are manually validated by software engineers of the two systems...|$|E

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are characterised by reflection–absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), sum frequency generation (SFG) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements. Data obtained for alkanethiols SAMs are also shown for comparison. The measurements show that nicely organized HSC 9 SH SAMs can be obtained in n-hexane provided that N 2 -degassed solutions are used and all preparation steps are performed {{in the absence of}} ambient light. SFG measurements show that these SAMs have free standing SH groups.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a disk-based explicit state model checking algorithm that uses an approach called layered duplicate detection. In this approach, states encountered during a breadth-first traversal of {{the graph of}} the transition system are stored in memory according to the layer of the graph {{in which they are}} first encountered. With this <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> of memory, transition locality is exploited by checking only the most recent layers for duplicates. In RAM, exploiting transition locality in this way saves time. In external memory, it saves space. In addition, a layered structure allows an easy method of counterexample reconstruction in disk-based model checking. We prove a worst-case linear bound on the redundant work performed by our approach. Experimental results indicate that average case redundant work is much better than the worst-case. The implemented model checker has been used to verify a transition system that required more than 275 GBs of disk storage...|$|E
40|$|The folding of the {{mammalian}} {{cerebral cortex}} into sulci and gyri {{is thought to}} be favored by the amplification of basal progenitor cells and their tangential migration. Here, we provide a molecular mechanism for the role of migration in this process by showing that changes in intercellular adhesion of migrating cortical neurons result in cortical folding. Mice with deletions of FLRT 1 and FLRT 3 adhesion molecules develop macroscopic sulci with preserved <b>layered</b> <b>organization</b> and radial glial morphology. Cortex folding in these mutants does not require progenitor cell amplification but is dependent on changes in neuron migration. Analyses and simulations suggest that sulcus formation in the absence of FLRT 1 / 3 results from reduced intercellular adhesion, increased neuron migration, and clustering in the cortical plate. Notably, FLRT 1 / 3 expression is low in the human cortex and in future sulcus areas of ferrets, suggesting that intercellular adhesion is a key regulator of cortical folding across species...|$|E
