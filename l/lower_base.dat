The route continues as such northwest to Highway401, passing under <b>Lower</b> <b>Base</b> Line (which continues east as Eglinton Avenue) and interchanging at Britannia Road and Derry Road before crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway's (CP) Galt Subdivision. At Highway401, the route makes a sharp curve to the northeast, while ramps weave across both freeway over several kilometres, interconnecting them. It enters Peel Region at the Winston Churchill Boulevard (Peel Regional Road19) overpass and follows another power transmission corridor just north of the Brampton–Mississauga boundary.|$|E

Tickets were sold one-way and did not require a round trip and staying away over a Saturday to claim discounts. However, they did not support interlining.|$|E
25|$|Blue Knob and its {{subsidiary}} {{peaks form}} a grouping of mountains that {{stand out as}} a massif {{from the rest of}} the Allegheny Front and form some of the highest elevations in Pennsylvania's Allegheny Mountains. Blue Knob is separate {{from the rest of the}} Allegheny Front escarpment, and the mountain's <b>lower</b> <b>base</b> is made up of siltstone and shale of the Devonian Catskill and Devonian-Mississippian Rockwell formations. The upper slopes and summit are made up of the buff-colored Mississippian Burgoon Formation of sandstone and conglomerate, which is far more resistant to weathering than the underlying shale and siltstone. The rocks near the summit have a bluish-green appearance, giving Blue Knob its name.|$|E

Prior to laying the foundations, the entire Confederation section was regraded. Roads through the section, built in 1901-1903, were closed and removed and replaced with turf.

The <b>lower</b> <b>base</b> was identical in design to the upper base, only larger in circumference. Each facet of the octagonal base was made with two vertical stiles and two horizontal rails, a top rail and a bottom rail, resembling a protruding frame set against a sunken panel. These panels have some relief design set or sculpted within them. The panels are depicting the Ziz and the Leviathan from Jewish mythology.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn [J. Shao, L. You, H. Shan, Bound on {{the bases}} of {{irreducible}} generalized sign pattern matrices, Linear Algebra Appl. 427 (2007) 285 – 300], the authors extended {{the concept of the}} base from powerful sign pattern matrices to non-powerful irreducible sign pattern matrices. Recently, the kth local bases and the kth upper bases, which are generalizations of the bases, of primitive non-powerful signed digraphs were introduced. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter called the kth <b>lower</b> <b>bases</b> of primitive non-powerful signed digraphs and obtain some bounds for it. For some cases, the bounds we obtain are best possible and the extremal signed digraphs are characterized, respectively. Moreover, we show that there exist “gaps” in the kth <b>lower</b> <b>bases</b> set of primitive non-powerful signed digraphs...|$|R

40|$|Knickpoints often form in bedrock {{rivers in}} {{response}} to base-level lowering. These knickpoints can migrate upstream without dissipating. In the case of alluvial rivers, an impulsive <b>lowering</b> of <b>base</b> level due to, for example, a fault associated with an earthquake or dam removal commonly produces smooth, upstream-progressing degradation; the knickpoint associated with suddenly <b>lowered</b> <b>base</b> level quickly dissipates. Here, however, we use experiments to demonstrate that under conditions of Froude-supercritical flow over an alluvial bed, an instantaneous drop in base level {{can lead to the}} formation of upstream-migrating knickpoints that do not dissipate. The base-level fall can generate a single knickpoint, or multiple knickpoints. Multiple knickpoints take the form of cyclic steps, that is, trains of upstream-migrating bedforms, each bounded by a hydraulic jump upstream and downstream. In our experiments, trains of knickpoints were transient, eventually migrating out of the alluvial reach as the bed evolved to a new equilibrium state regulated with <b>lowered</b> <b>base</b> level. Thus the allogenic perturbation of base-level fall can trigger the autogenic generation of multiple knickpoints which are sustained until the alluvial reach recovers a graded state...|$|R

The windows are supported by terra cotta brackets and the upper spandrels are ornamented with terra cotta paneling.|$|E
