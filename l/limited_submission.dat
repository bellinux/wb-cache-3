40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal {{analysis of the}} relation between monitoring and <b>limit</b> order <b>submission</b> risk. With heterogeneous information, limit order traders face two types of risk. First, they may be "picked off" when prices change unexpectedly after the limit order is entered (known as free trading option risk). Second, they face the possibility that their limit order will not result in a trade. To mitigate these risks, traders can monitor information and prices and cancel or revise their orders as needed. But such monitoring is costly, resulting in a trade-off between the cost of monitoring and the risks of <b>limit</b> order <b>submission.</b> The model predicts that if the stock is actively traded, <b>limit</b> order <b>submission</b> risks and order cancellations/revisions are positively related. Further, shares with a wide bid-ask spread will tend to have a lower rate of order cancellations and revisions than shares with small bid-ask spreads. Finally, the model suggests that if larger capitalization stocks have lower costs of gathering information (and hence more intense monitoring of limit orders), there will be more cancellations and revisions in limit orders. A sample of 23 liquid stocks provides evidence that is consistent with these three main hypotheses. Limit orders Free trading option Non-execution risk News monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{controversy}} over Laetrile is nearly at an end, the worthlessness {{of the drug}} having been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. But the Laetrile experience raised important questions of public policy, some of which remain unresolved and {{all of which are}} worthy of examination. Could the Laetrile phenomenon have been prevented? Did the regulatory system perform as intended? Could there be another Laetrile? The drug regulatory system administered under law by the Food and Drug Administration, like any other system carried out by Government in a free society, functions only so long and so far as the public will allow. Survey after survey shows that there is overwhelming support by the American people for the consumer health protection activities of the FDA. But, as the case of Laetrile proves, that support is neither absolute nor permanent. It can be selectively or totally withdrawn. In those circumstances, {{it would seem that the}} best, perhaps the only, recourse in a free society is for those institutions and groups that have a responsibility for protection of the public health [...] institutions outside Government as well as within it [...] to identify, expose, and halt quackery that threatens the public health and welfare. Their weapons in such a struggle are facts as well as laws, credibility as well as confidence, compassion as well as the scientific method.

This imbalance, defined as the “superstition index” for each investor, is positively correlated with trading losses.

I develop a structural model of participant entry and sponsor choice in contests with multiple prizes and heterogeneous participants. The structural model allows for multiple equilibria in the participant entry game and a flexible specification of participant information sets. Counterfactual simulations reveal the impact of design parameters on partic-ipation and quality outcomes: multiple prizes discourage stronger participants and encourage weaker participants but do not have a substantial impact on outcomes in contests that attract a large number of submissions; a larger prize increases expected total and maximum idea quality but may not substantially increase participation; a <b>submission</b> <b>limit</b> increases the number of entrants but reduces expected total and maximum idea quality. The results provide guidance for the optimal design of ideation contests...|$|R
40|$|Very {{few people}} are happy at present with the law review {{publishing}} process, from article submission and selection to editing. Complaints are longstanding, and similar ones emerge from faculty and students alike. Yet, heretofore, change has not occurred. Instead, we are locked in our ugly world of submit and expedite, stepping on the toes of numerous student editors in the process. And the editing process falls far short of ideal. This Article recommends wholesale change to the submission and editing process. The first part details the dysfunctions of the current system, including everything from lack of student capacity to evaluate faculty scholarship—particularly under the gun of the expedite process—to faculty submitting subpar work in light of rigid submission cycles. It then turns to making a perverse defense of the current system. In light of technological change, law reviews play a very different function at present than even twenty years ago. Most faculty publish their work on electronic databases even prior to submission to law reviews. Law reviews serve as the final resting place of those articles for archival purposes, while ostensibly providing students with a sound pedagogical experience. Part three undercuts the perverse defense by pointing to the huge and unacceptable costs of the present system, in which student editors scramble over one another to accept manuscripts, often wasting time on rejected submissions, while faculty labor with student-overediting, all {{in the service of}} articles {{that for the most part}} are rarely or never cited. The final part of this article is a raft of suggestions to change the present system to produce better published scholarship, at lower cost to faculty and students, including blind submission, elimination of submitting articles to one’s own school, some form of peer review, and <b>limiting</b> <b>submissions</b> or requiring authors to accept the offer they receive. The suggestions extend to the editing process, which—at present—is out of control, and does little to make scholarship the best it can be...|$|R

Conversely, they can mitigate adverse selection risk by canceling limit orders at risk and resubmitting them further behind in the limit order book. The decision of limit order traders are tracked from <b>limit</b> order <b>submission</b> to cancellation and from cancellation to resubmission. The paper also performs both static and dynamic analyses of factors affecting the risks of limit order trading. The results show that limit order traders are generally more concerned with non-execution risk than adverse selection risk, except when trading in the least active stocks. The paper also shows that nearly 40 percent of all limit orders are cancelled and nearly 70 percent of these limit orders are never resubmitted into the market. In other words, liquidity leakage through order cancellations is rarely replenished by the same traders. JEL Classification: G 1...|$|R

Given the large order quantity contained in ULOs, we attempt to examine the impact of ULO submissions, cancellations and executions on price changes and volatility over differing intervals within a day. Motivation is generated by the ASX decision to abolish the use of ULOs in favour of iceberg orders. Intraday analysis shows that the impact of both ULO and disclosed order submissions are no longer than one day. ULO buying/selling order submissions at the best bid/ask price increase/decrease returns and price volatility significantly more than disclosed orders.
