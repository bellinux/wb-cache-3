50|$|Magnetometers are {{instruments}} {{designed to}} locate ferrous materials. It can detect iron containing materials {{to a maximum}} depth of approximately 10 feet. This is useful for <b>locating</b> <b>dowel</b> pins or determining if reinforcing steel exists.|$|E
5000|$|Reamed {{holes are}} used to create holes of precise {{circularity}} and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008") This will allow the force fitting of <b>locating</b> <b>dowel</b> pins, which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them. Other holes, reamed slightly larger in other parts, will fit these pins accurately, but not so tightly as to make disassembly difficult. This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines. After joining the halves, the assembled case may then be line bored (using what is in effect a large diameter reamer), and then disassembled for placement of bearings and other parts. The use of reamed dowel holes is typical in any machine design, where any two locating parts have to be located and mated accurately to one another - typically as indicated above, to within 0.02 mm or less than [...]001".|$|E
5000|$|This {{combined}} with the early practice of installing the head gasket with plastic <b>locating</b> <b>dowels,</b> which subsequently melted when the engines overheated, allowed the head gaskets to [...] "walk." [...] A redesigned head gasket, which consists of a multiple layer metal gasket or [...] "MLS" [...] {{used in conjunction with}} steel <b>locating</b> <b>dowels,</b> is alleged to significantly reduce the chance of a head gasket failure.|$|R
25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is <b>located</b> with <b>dowel</b> pins.|$|R
30|$|This article {{addresses}} the splitting failure of moment-resisting dowel-type fastener joints, {{in which the}} failure {{may be attributed to}} the perpendicular-to-grain loading of one single <b>dowel</b> <b>located</b> close {{to the end of a}} beam. A quasi-non-linear fracture mechanics model based on beam on elastic foundation theory is applied. A simple approximation suitable for practical design is also proposed. Model predictions of the influence of edge distances and end distances are compared with test results.|$|R
