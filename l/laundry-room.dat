I have told you already of the thoughts which the Shivering Sand put into my head. Those thoughts came back to me now. I wondered in myself which it would be harder to do, if things went on in this manner--to bear Mr. Franklin Blake's indifference to me, or to jump into the quicksand and end it for ever in that way? ...|$|E

5000|$|English Heritage, which lists Wimbledon Park a Grade II* {{protected}} monument, {{suggest that}} the Duchess consulted the landscape gardener Charles Bridgeman, but {{the extent of his}} contribution is unknown. Through the Duchess of Marlborough, Wimbledon manor passed, in 1744, to her heir, the 10-year-old John, Viscount Spencer, soon to be made the 1st Earl Spencer.Under a contract of late 1764 Lancelot [...] "Capability" [...] Brown undertook landscaping projects in the park, which still comprised some 1200 acres; his work, which included the lake (Wimbledon Park Lake), was complete by 1768, In 1780, Hannah More visited the house as the guest of Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St. Asaph, to whom Lord Spencer lent the house annually for a season: [...] "I did not think there could have been so beautiful a place within seven miles of London. The park has as much variety of ground, and is as un-Londonish {{as if it were an}} hundred miles out." [...] Hannah More enjoyed the Duchess of Marlborough's books in the library, where: [...] "numbers of the books were presents to her from the great authors of her time, whose names she had carefully written in the blank leaves, for I believe she had the pride of being thought learned, as well as rich and beautiful." [...] "elegantly fitted up, and are used as an occasional retirement by Lord Spencer's family. The situation is singularly eligible, having a beautiful home prospect of the park, with a fine piece of water towards the north, and an extensive view over the country of Surrey on the south." [...] The house burnt down at Easter 1785, spreading from the <b>laundry-room</b> where linen was being aired in preparation for the return of the family after a brief absence. Lord Spencer cleared away the ruins and leveled and turfed the ground, so that scarcely a trace remained of its foundations except for an underground tunnel, which still survives, which had linked the main house to the separate staff quarters.|$|E
