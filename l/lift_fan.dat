40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of ancient Indian Knowledge of Vimanas, the Mini Rukma Vimana Unmanned Air Vehicle designs make a several advantages for many purposes as mentioned. The MRV UAV concept is proposed mainly to create VTOL, the <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> configuration similar to Rukma vimana, {{hence the name}} Mini Rukma vimana Unmanned Air Vehicle. <b>Lift</b> <b>fans</b> are {{the main part of}} the MRV UAV. They can be used to go through mountainous regions. And fans are preferred other than wings for Vertical takeoff. The <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> configuration is similar to Rukma vimana Mentioned in Vimanika shasthra. Based on Analysis for VTOL, UAVs are having <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> embedded in Wings. But MRV UAV has simpler configuration, enabling the UAV to <b>lift</b> off with <b>fans</b> provided at the top of the UAV directly connected to the base of UAV with the help of Ducts. The Direction control can be achieved by operating the maneuvering fans acting as propellers, the UAV can move 360 degrees in at mid air in single position. Using the MRV UAV, the missions become much more simpler and easier to be carried out...|$|R

25|$|The {{contract}} for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) was awarded on 26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin, whose X-35 beat the Boeing X-32. One {{of the main}} reasons for this choice appears to have been the method of achieving STOVL flight, with the Department of Defense judging that the higher performance <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> system was worth the extra risk. When near to the ground, the Boeing X-32 suffered from the problem of hot air from the exhaust circulating back to the main engine, which caused the thrust to weaken and the engine to overheat.|$|E

2500|$|The team {{responsible}} {{for developing the}} propulsion system includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, {{under the leadership of}} the United States Department of Defense Joint Strike Fighter Program Office. Paul Bevilaqua, Chief Engineer of Lockheed Martin Advanced Development Projects (Skunk Works), invented the <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> propulsion system. The concept of a shaft-driven lift-fan dates back to the mid-1950s. [...] The <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> was demonstrated by the Allison Engine Company in 1995-97.|$|E
2500|$|The HS.141 {{design was}} a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted swept wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 28degrees. The design featured two wing-mounted [...] "cruise" [...] engines and 16 <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> engines mounted in sponsons {{either side of}} the fuselage (eight per side). The engines under main consideration were the Rolls-Royce RB.220 turbofan for forward propulsion and the Rolls-Royce RB.202, a high bypass ratio <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> engine using technology developed for the Rolls-Royce RB.162 lift jet. Both engines were themselves design studies by Rolls-Royce and it was feared that there would be delays in their development due to the company's problems at the time. One new engine type also considered for main propulsion was the 'SNECMA M.56', which became the CFM International CFM56. Variations using fewer <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> engines for STOL operations only were also studied as it was realised that the engines could account for 15% of the total weight of the aircraft and 35% of the final cost.|$|E
2500|$|... 3) The Lockheed Martin {{aircraft}} concept used a reheated turbofan with thrust augmentation from {{a remote}} shaft-driven <b>lift</b> <b>fan.</b> This engine configuration was to lead eventually to the F135-PW-600 which powers the [...] F-35B JSF production aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] LP turbine {{drives the}} <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> through a shaft {{extension}} {{on the front}} of the LP rotor and a clutch. The engine operates as a separate flow turbofan with a higher bypass ratio. The power to drive the fan (about 30,000SHP) is obtained from the LP turbine by increasing the hot nozzle area.|$|E
2500|$|The F135 {{originated}} with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with {{efforts to develop}} a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA program. Lockheed employee Paul Bevilaqua developed and patented a concept aircraft and propulsion system, {{and then turned to}} Pratt & Whitney (P) to build a demonstrator engine. The demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the <b>lift</b> <b>fan.</b> The engine fan and core from the F100-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the <b>lift</b> <b>fan.</b> Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the [...] "F100-229-Plus" [...] demonstrator engine. This engine proved the lift-fan concept and {{led to the development of}} the current F135 engine.|$|E
2500|$|There are 3 F-135 variants: the -100 engine, -400 engine, and the -600 engine. [...] The -400 {{is similar}} to the -100, the major {{difference}} being the use of salt-corrosion resistant materials. The -600 is described below with an explanation of the engine configuration changes that take place for hovering. The engine and Rolls-Royce LiftSystem make up the Integrated <b>Lift</b> <b>Fan</b> Propulsion System (ILFPS).|$|E
40|$|The synonym of SES {{stands for}} ''Surface Effect Ship'' and {{refers to a}} double-hulled {{air-cushion}} vehicle. This air-cushion catamaran combines the positive properties of a pure air-cushion vehicle and those of a catamaran. This project has created the project fundamentals for the design stage. Simple-to-use formulas based on measurement results and on the operational experience gathered with the CORSAIR permit quick projecting of the <b>lifting</b> <b>fans</b> of an SES vehicle. The numerical optimization of the <b>lifting</b> <b>fan</b> air ducts has shown that simple design measures can considerably reduce the pressure losses of deflections so that significant energy advantages are created {{with reference to the}} installed fan power.

25|$|Attempts {{were made}} in the 1960s to develop a {{commercial}} passenger aircraft with VTOL capability. The Hawker Siddeley Inter-City Vertical-Lift proposal had two rows of <b>lifting</b> <b>fans</b> on either side. However, none of these aircraft made it to production after they were dismissed as too heavy and expensive to operate.|$|R
50|$|Operational Requirement 351 {{was issued}} {{to meet a}} {{requirement}} for the Royal Air Force for a medium-range freighter to replace the Beverley and Hastings. There were proposals from British Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley, the former offering the BAC.222 based on the Lockheed Hercules and the BAC.208 with deflected-thrust engines and <b>lift</b> <b>fans.</b> Armstrong Whitworth's design was selected.|$|R
2500|$|The lift for the STOVL {{version in}} the hover is {{obtained}} from a 2-stage <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> (about 46%) {{in front of the}} engine, a vectoring exhaust nozzle (about 46%), and a nozzle in each wing using [...] fan air from the bypass duct(about 8%). These relative contributions to the total lift are based on thrust values of 18,680lb, 18,680lb and 3,290lb respectively. Another source gives thrust values of 20,000lb, 18,000lb and 3,900lb respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "lift" [...] mode for {{assisted}} vertical maneuvers, 29,000hp is diverted forward {{through a}} driveshaft from the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a clutch and bevel-gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating <b>lift</b> <b>fan</b> located {{forward of the}} main engine. The fan efflux (low-velocity unheated air) discharges through a thrust vectoring nozzle {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, thus balancing the aft lift generated by the 3BSM. For lateral stability and roll control, bypass air from the engine goes out through a roll-post nozzle in each wing. For pitch control, the areas of exhaust nozzle and LiftFan inlet are varied conversely to change the balance between them while maintaining their sum, and with constant turbine speed. Yaw control is achieved by yawing the 3BSM. Forward, and even backward, motion is controlled by tilting the 3BSM and LiftFan outlet.|$|E

50|$|The J85 and lift-fan {{combination}} was {{a precursor}} to developments {{which led to the}} first GE high BPR engine, the TF-39. The <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> were driven by turbine blades mounted around the periphery of the fan, with mass flow 13 times greater than the gas generators mass flow and increased thrust 3 times over that available using a propelling nozzle.|$|R
50|$|Practical {{hovercraft}} use {{a peripheral}} skirt system, {{where the air}} from the <b>lift</b> <b>fans</b> is routed to a narrow slot {{around the edge of}} the hull, and bound by a flexible skirt. Distribution of this air from the fans to the periphery is through a large-volume plenum chamber, so as to provide even distribution of airflow without sensitivity to the length of the direct path.|$|R

50|$|To use jet {{power for}} lift, the impracticality of tail-sitting meant it was {{necessary}} for the aircraft to take off and land vertically while still in a horizontal attitude. Solutions tried included <b>lifting</b> <b>fans</b> (typically buried in the wings), swivelling engine pods similar in concept to the convertiplane, dedicated lightweight lift jets or turbofans, thrust-vectoring by deflecting the jet exhaust as needed, and various combinations of these.|$|R
50|$|What {{was lacking}} {{from all of}} them was a {{suitable}} way to move the vehicles forward - since the whole idea of the hovertrain concept was to eliminate any physical contact with the running surface, especially wheels, some sort of contact-less thrust would have to be provided. There were various proposals using air ducted from the <b>lift</b> <b>fans,</b> propeller, or even jet engines, but none of these could approach the efficiency of an electric motor powering a wheel.|$|R
