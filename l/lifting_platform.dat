25|$|Yulius Fuchik {{belonged to}} the {{distinct}} group of cargo ships known as barge carriers which offered, at the time, the highest theoretical loading and unloading rate of all cargo ships. The lighter aboard ship (LASH) system was based on unpowered barges, also known as lighters, that were loaded on board a larger vessel for transport between inland waterways separated by open seas. For this purpose, Yulius Fuchik had vast cargo decks and a large <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> in the stern.|$|E
500|$|Harland and Wolff, the RMS Titanic builders, {{opened their}} private {{archives}} to the crew, sharing blueprints that were thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for {{artifacts from the}} era. The newness of the ship meant every prop {{had to be made}} from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunken by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, {{but the rest of the}} ship was just steel plating. Within was a fifty-foot <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. Towering above was a [...] tower crane on [...] of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, the 2002 dive season {{was dedicated to}} lifting the [...] turret to the surface. Around 160 divers were assigned to remove {{the parts of the}} hull, including the armor belt, that lay on top of the turret using chisels, exothermic cutting torches and [...] hydroblasters. They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted. This was usually concreted coal as one of the ship's coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret. The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> for the second stage. A large, eight-legged lifting frame, nicknamed the [...] "spider", was carefully positioned over the turret to move it onto the platform and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the Wotan. The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} ship was the <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> in the stern, abaft from the propellers and rudders, which was supported by high cantilever structures on both sides. Although the arrangement {{was similar to the}} original Seabee design, the [...] "Syncrolift" [...] cargo elevator was electric instead of hydraulic. Eight winches in four pairs were capable of hoisting 2,600 tons of cargo at a speed of 0.7 metres per minute ( [...] per minute), giving the ship a calculated loading capacity of about 2,600 tons per hour in optimum conditions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{remodeling}} {{was planned}} that would remove the gondola and incorporate a <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> into the structure. [...] The firm finally commissioned with designing the new bridge was the descendant of Waddell's company. [...] The new design, which closely resembles the 1892 concept, {{is attributed to}} C.A.P. Turner. Reconstruction began in 1929. In {{order to ensure that}} tall ships could still pass under the bridge, the top span had to be raised to accommodate the new deck when raised. [...] The support columns on either side were also modified so that they could hold new counterweights to balance the weight of the lifting portion. The new bridge first lifted for a vessel on March 29, 1930.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a vision-based control {{approach}} for autonomously docking a wheelchair onto a vehicle <b>lift</b> <b>platform.</b> This is a principle component of the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS) - an alternate mobility solution for drivers with lower body disabilities. The ATRS employs robotics, automation, and machine vision technologies, and can be integrated into a standard minivan or sport utility vehicle (SUV). At {{the core of the}} ATRS is a “smart ” wheelchair system that autonomously navigates between the driver’s position and a powered lift {{at the rear of the}} vehicle- eliminating the need for an attendant. From an automation perspective, autonomously docking the wheelchair onto the <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> presented the most significant technical challenge for the proof-of-concept ATRS. This was driven primarily by geometry constraints, which limited clearance between the chair wheels and the <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> rails. We present significant simulation and experimental results for our approach. These indicate that the coupling of visionbased localization for feedback and input/output feedback linearization techniques for controller design can provide for accurate wheelchair navigation and reliable docking under a range of ambient illumination conditions.
