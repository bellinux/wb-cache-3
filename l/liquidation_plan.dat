50|$|According to Rayburn, {{potential}} buyers {{expressed interest in}} acquiring the Hostess brand. On November 21, Judge Robert Drain cleared Hostess to close. In approving the plan, Drain ruled against U.S. Trustee for the Southern District Tracy Hope Davis' motion to convert the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with an appointed trustee to oversee liquidation. Davis criticized the plan's provisions, which would grant bonuses to insiders' and 'cherry-pick' which administrative claims get paid". Drain left Rayburn {{in charge of the}} liquidation; Hostess had argued that its assets would devalue if the company had to wait for a trustee to get up to speed on the company. Hostess Brands' <b>liquidation</b> <b>plan</b> was finalized by a federal bankruptcy judge on November 29. In January 2013, the company asked a judge to set a March 21 deadline for workers to file back-pay claims. On February 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York approved stalking horse bidders for Hostess Brands.|$|E

40|$|Information Technology is an {{essential}} part of the society today, not least in large ﻿﻿﻿organisations dealing with sensitive information. An example of such an organisation is the Swedish Armed Forces which indeed is in the need of ways to ensure information security in their Information Technology systems. The means which is used is an authorisation and accreditation process. All Information Technology systems go through a life cycle which includes realisation, usage, development and liquidation. In the Swedish Armed Forces the lifecycle is an authorisation process. Each step in the process is followed by an authorisation decision and one of these steps is accreditation. Accreditation is a formal approval to put the system in operation. The aim of the thesis is to study how large organisations may ensure information security when developing IT and the importance of a standardised process to handle information security. The study has been carried out by comparing the process of the Swedish Armed Forces with other methods to run projects and theories concerning development of IT. Interviews with Information Security Consultants at Combitech AB along with a study of documentation have been carried out in order to study the process. The theoretical framework has been formed through a literature study of project models and methods for development of IT. The main result of the thesis is that a standardised process which manage quality, communication, traceability, complexity, aim, operation and <b>liquidation</b> <b>plan,</b> risk assessment as well as use case increases the chance of a successful project and the achievement of information security in development of new IT. High quality in the formation of the security aim and the specification of requirements, along with tests to establish that all requirements are fulfilled, are crucial when it comes to information security...|$|E

In Spain,“all <b>liquidations</b> were <b>planned</b> and executed under Orlov's direction. After an apparent failure to mount some sort of intelligence-gathering operations, it seems that Orlov's main preoccupation was now witch-hunting.

30|$|An {{insolvency}} administrator {{replaces the}} manager of an insolvent firm to devise and organize a <b>liquidation</b> or reorganization <b>plan</b> in the creditors’ interest. In {{the course of the}} process, the insolvency administrator presents the most favourable option from his perspective, and the creditors choose to accept or reject this plan. Conflicts of interest arise because the insolvency administrator, as the better-informed party, considers in his proposal liability risks and reputational issues that are beyond the creditors’ scope. We model this conflict as a Bayesian game and find that, under those compensation schemes typically used in real-world regulations, optimal creditor satisfaction and efficient decisions concerning the economic future of the insolvent firm will never be achieved simultaneously.|$|R

The guerrillas were armed with only one machine gun, several dozen pistols, Molotov cocktails and bottles filled with acid. The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April 1943, the Białystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest ghetto uprising, after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Several dozen guerrillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Białystok where they joined the partisan units of Armia Krajowa and other organisations and survived the war.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plan was}} to be {{implemented}} in several stages. One of the parts for the plan, the [...] "Demolition of the Polish City and the Construction of the German City" [...] (Abbau der Polen-Stadt und der Aufbau der Deutschen Stadt) included {{a list of the}} Polish capital’s centers of life destined for destruction, put in chronological order based on <b>planned</b> <b>liquidation</b> date. The planners also decided to use the destruction caused by bombings and fires during the September 1939 seizure of the city as a pretext for the urbanistic changes. Another part of the plan included a detailed map of the anticipated destruction showing almost all buildings destroyed coincidentally according to the original plan. In reality only 10 percent of the buildings were destroyed in 1939, with total civilian and military losses of around 12,000 killed and 66,000 wounded.|$|R

40|$|The {{meltdown}} {{in residential}} real-estate prices that commenced in 2006 resulted in unprecedented mortgage delinquency rates. Until mid- 2009, lenders and servicers pursued {{their own individual}} loss mitigation practices without being significantly influenced by government intervention. Using a unique dataset that precisely identifies loss mitigation actions, we study these methods - <b>liquidation,</b> repayment <b>plans,</b> loan modification, and refinancing - and analyze their effectiveness. We show {{that the majority of}} delinquent mortgages do not enter any loss mitigation program or become a part of foreclosure proceedings within 6 months of becoming distressed. We also find that it takes longer to complete foreclosures over time, potentially due to congestion. We further document large heterogeneity in practices across servicers, which is not accounted for by differences in borrower population. Consistent with the idea that securitization induces agency conflicts, we confirm that the likelihood of modification of securitized loans is up to 70 % lower relative to portfolio loans. Finally, we find evidence that affordability (as opposed to strategic default due to negative equity) is the prime reason for redefault following modifications. While modification terms are more favorable for weaker borrowers, greater reductions in mortgage payments and/or interest rates are associated with lower redefault rates. Our regression estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point decline in mortgage interest rate is associated with a nearly 4 percentage point decline in default probability. This finding is consistent with the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) focus on improving mortgage affordability...|$|R

30|$|The {{second set}} of papers {{considers}} failure from a legal point of view. It is then defined {{on the basis of}} judicial criteria introduced in the insolvency act enacted in a given country at a given period. Most legal rules considered a firm as bankrupt when the judge decides it is not able to make its repayments when the claims fall due (Cabrillo and Depoorter 1999). Insolvent companies always conform to this mix of legal and accounting logic. At each stage of the judicial process, accounting considerations are introduced to strengthen the rationality of the decision made by the judges. Indeed, the proceeding always begins with a cessation of payments and ends up with a <b>liquidation</b> or continuation <b>plans.</b> To fix a point of time to signal the transition from a reliable and sound company to a failing one, many scholars consider that the failure occurs from the moment a company presents to the courts the legal documents required for its liquidation or reorganization. The failure is then assimilated to the entry in the insolvency proceedings and filing for petition has to be considered as an extreme situation, i.e., an exit from the market resulting from the mismatch between the entrepreneurial project and the market conditions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to address the}} problem of hunger from the viewpoint of its social face against the backdrop of fast growing economy of India. Current sad state of affairs in the domain of poverty and hunger are nothing but the cumulative result of what happens in the Indian development planning since Independence, or at least in the name of development planning. This paper sociologically examines three most critical events in the history of Indian development planning, which are introduced to mitigate hunger and poverty, in both urban and rural India. The central focus of this paper is to highlight politics of those development initiatives and <b>liquidation</b> of public <b>planning</b> at the level of implementation, which eventually increased the gap between rich and poor, and left the Indian poor to their own fate. This paper also examines the most significant aspect of delinking power relations from the development discourse of India by providing more room for populist ideas with an aim to gain political mileage by the ruling elite. The present state of affairs with respect to poverty and hunger coupled with low standards of health, literacy and social awareness in India call for serious introspection. This paper, therefore, critically looks at Indian development discourse from the perspective of power relations, both established and emerging, which could alter our views on India and its growth story...|$|R
