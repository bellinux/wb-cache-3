5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> Ireland since 16 November 2015.

The Marriage Act 2015, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment.

5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as {{there was a lot of}} interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|As {{minister}} {{in charge of}} the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and {{the country as a whole}} was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by the author’s own {{experience}} of providing <b>legal</b> education <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> practice, this research seeks to explore <b>legal</b> education <b>in</b> UK law firms. Just as surveys have been completed that explore the extent and nature of <b>legal</b> education <b>in</b> UK law schools, this survey will seek to understand the extent and nature of <b>legal</b> education <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> practice. As such, {{it will be the}} first survey in the UK to do so. The existing legal education survey data was largely born out of a desire to obtain “hard data” (Harris and Jones, 1997) as to the nature and extent of teaching and learning patterns within law schools. Anecdotally there appears to have been a growth during the last decade both <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> education offered by further education institutions and also by law firms, yet the absence of “hard data” has meant it has been impossible to say whether these are isolated incidents or part of a genuine shift. The behaviour of law firms in this respect has been of particular importance given the potentially radical reforms that have been proposed for <b>legal</b> education <b>in</b> England and Wales during the last five years...|$|R
5|$|As the {{population}} of the territory grew, so did the people's exercising of their freedoms. In 1809, the territory was granted permission to fully elect its own legislature for the first time. Before that, Governor Harrison appointed the legislature. Although Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery, it had existed in the region since French rule. In addition, settlers from the Upper South occupied areas along the Ohio River, bringing slaves with them. They wanted to have it be <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> the territory, but others from the northern states opposed the expansion of slavery into this region. The anti-slavery party won a strong majority in the first election. Governor Harrison was at odds with the new legislature, which proceeded to overturn the indenturing and pro-slavery laws he had enacted. Slavery remained the defining issue in the state for the decades to follow. In these early decades, although the legislature did not encourage free blacks to settle here, it extended suffrage to them.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> Spain since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began {{a campaign for}} its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage {{was passed by the}} Cortes Generales (Spain's bicameral Parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day, making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry across the entire country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada.|$|E
