40|$|We have {{isolated}} a 12 kb clone {{from the}} murine genome which we show by DNA transfection studies to contain an entire functional <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> and the transcriptional promoter sequences necessary for its expression. We have also isolated a 3. 1 kb cDNA sequence from a murine brain cDNA library which corresponds {{to most of}} the L-myc mRNA. We have identified the L-myc coding region within the genomic clone by a combination of S 1 nuclease analyses. Northern blotting analyses and comparative nucleotide sequence analyses with the cDNA clone. The <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> appears to be organized similarly to the other well-characterized myc-family genes, c-myc and N-myc. The predicted amino acid coding sequence of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> indicates that the L-myc protein is significantly smaller than c- and N-myc, but is highly related. In particular, comparison of the N- and c-myc protein sequences reveals seven relatively conserved regions interspersed among non-conserved regions; the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> retains five of these conserved regions but lacks two others. In addition, a portion of one highly conserved region is encoded within a different region of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> but, due to changes in the size of L-myc exons relative to those of N- and c-myc, maintains its overall position in the peptide backbone with respect to other conserved regions. We discuss these findings in the context of potential functional domains and the possibility of overlapping and distinct activities of myc-family proteins...|$|E
40|$|The <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is {{the third}} member of the myc family of proto-oncogenes. Amplification and {{elevated}} expression of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> has been detected in a subset of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines. The biological properties and functions of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> and its product {{have not yet been}} elucidated. Monoclonal antibodies against two myc homology boxes were used to characterize the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> product. These antibodies react with two groups of polypeptides of apparent masses of 60, 61 and 66 kd (the long forms), and 34 and 37 kd (the short forms) in SCLC cells expressing L-myc transcripts. The long form L-myc proteins are associated with the nuclear fraction of the cells. The short form L-myc proteins are present in the cytoplasmic fraction, though diffusion of the short forms from the nucleus during cell fractionation cannot be ruled out. The half-life of the long form polypeptides is approximately 45 - 90 min. The short form polypeptides have a half-life of approximately 120 - 180 min. The L-myc protein is not detectable in the mitotic cells, suggesting that the L-myc protein expression is tightly regulated during the cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic {{constructs}} {{containing the}} murine <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> {{under the control}} of the immunoglobulin transcriptional enhancer element (Emu) are expressed at unexpectedly high levels in thymocytes and proliferating T cells compared with cells from bone marrow and proliferating B cells. In contrast, double transgenic animals bearing constructs containing the L- and N-myc genes similarly linked to the Emu element maintain preferential L-myc expression in T cells but express the N-myc transgene preferentially in B cells. These results indicate that the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> contains elements that act in concert with the Emu element to allow preferential expression in T lineage cells. In correspondence to the expression pattern, Emu-L-myc transgenic mice show expanded thymic cortices and irregularly formed splenic follicles with expanded T cell areas. Moreover, the percentage of thymocytes positive for the surface marker 1 C 11, which defines thymic progenitor cells, activated T cells and preleukemic T cells, is dramatically raised in transgenic mice compared with normal littermates. Emu-L-myc transgenic animals are predisposed to clonal lymphoid tumors, most of which are T cell lymphomas. The relative incidence, latency period, and degree of malignancy of Emu-L-myc tumors compared with Emu-N- or c-myc tumors is consistent with a lower oncogenic potential of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> However, the Emu-L-myc tumors do not express detectable levels of endogenous myc family genes indicating that the L-myc protein can substitute for c- or N-myc in the generation and growth of lymphoid neoplasms...|$|E
50|$|Myc protein {{belongs to}} Myc family of {{transcription}} factors, {{which also includes}} N-Myc and <b>L-Myc</b> <b>genes.</b> Myc family of transcription factors contain a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) structural and LZ (leucine zipper) motives. Through its bHLH DNA-binding motif, Myc interacts with DNA, while the leucine zipper TF-binding motif allows the dimerization with its partner Max, another bHLH transcription factor.|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} post-translational {{modification of the}} L-myc protein using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against a peptide well conserved in the predicted amino acid sequences of the c-myc, N-myc and <b>L-myc</b> <b>genes.</b> These antibodies precipitate three polypeptides of Mr 60 - 66, 000 from [35 S]methionine or [32 P]orthophosphate-labelled human small cell lung cancer cell lines expressing amplified <b>L-myc</b> <b>genes,</b> but not the other myc genes. Treatment of the L-myc immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase prior to electrophoresis converts the three methionine-labelled polypeptides into a single band migrating at Mr 59, 000, and efficiently removes radioactivity from the 32 P-labelled L-myc protein, suggesting that, {{in contrast to the}} c-myc and N-myc proteins, the L-myc polypeptide heterogeneity is due to differential phosphorylation of a common precursor. When the phorbol ester 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) or serum is added to cultures of U- 1690 cells the Mr 66, 000 polypeptide is rapidly enriched while the Mr 60, 000 form is decreased in the L-myc immunoprecipitates. This effect is correlated with the ability of phorbol ester and diacylglycerol analogues to activate protein kinase C. The TPA-induced phosphorylation of the L-myc protein occurs in a protein synthesis-independent manner as it is not inhibited by cycloheximide or anisomycin. These data indicate that the phosphorylation of the L-myc nuclear oncoprotein is modulated in response to TPA via a rapid signal transduction system involving protein kinase C. This mechanism could {{play an important role in}} the response of lung cells to e. g. bombesin-related growth factors...|$|R
40|$|Brown adipocytes (BAs) play {{important}} roles in body temperature regulation, energy balance, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Activities of BAs are remarkably diminished in obese and diabetic patients, providing possibilities of transplanting functional BAs resulting in therapeutic benefit. Here, we show generation of functional BAs by cellular reprogramming procedures. Transduction of the PRDM 16 gene into iPSC-derived embryoid bodies induced BA phenotypes (iBAs). Moreover, normal human fibroblasts were directly converted into BAs (dBAs) by C/EBP-β and C-MYC gene transduction. Approximately 90 % of the fibroblasts were successfully converted within 12  days. The dBAs were highly active in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Mouse dBAs were induced by Prdm 16, C/ebp-β, and <b>L-myc</b> <b>genes,</b> and after transplantation, they significantly reduced diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in an UCP 1 -dependent manner. Thus, highly functional BAs can be generated by cellular reprogramming, suggesting a promising tailor-made cell therapy against metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} affecting proto-oncogenes {{are frequently}} detected in human cancer. Oncogenes of the myc family are activated in {{several types of}} tumors {{as a result of}} gene amplification or chromosomal translocation. We have recently found the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> involved in a gene fusion in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). This results in a chimeric protein with amino-terminal sequences from a novel gene named rif joined to L-myc. Here we present a preliminary structural characterization of the rlf-L-myc fusion gene, which has been found only in cells with an amplified <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> In addition, we have used somatic cell hybrids to assign the normal rlf locus to the same chromosome (chromosome 1) on which L-myc resides. Finally, {{we have been able to}} establish a physical linkage between rif and L-myc with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Our results demonstrate that normal rlf and L-myc genes are separated by less than 800 kb of DNA. Thus, the rlf-L-myc gene fusions are due to similar but not identical intrachromosomal rearrangements at 1 p 32. The presence of independent genetic lesions that cause the formation of identical chimeric rlf-L-myc proteins suggests a role for the fusion protein in the development of these tumors...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} the proto-oncogene L-myc to substitute for c-myc in blocking murine erythroleukemia differentiation. Murine erythroleukemia cells (line C 19) were transfected with recombinant plasmids containing genomic and cDNA fragments of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> driven by a Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Clones expressing constitutive high levels of L-myc failed to differentiate in response to the chemical inducer N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). The block to differentiation correlated with the level of L-myc expression. Furthermore, transfected clones grown in the presence of inducer {{for an extended period of}} time showed an increased level of L-myc expression. These results suggest that functional domains of the c-myc gene involved in differentiation are located in the discrete regions of homology between the c- and L-myc genes...|$|E
40|$|Retinoic acid (RA) {{and nuclear}} retinoic acid receptors (RARs) have {{been implicated in}} a variety of human {{malignancies}} including lung cancer, and RA has been proposed as a chemopreventive agent for bronchogenic carcinoma.

In contrast, 1 7 of 22 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 9 of 15 non-SCLC lines treated with 1 M RA showed no significant growth inhibition. Of interest, 5 SCIC lines with high levels of myc gene family expression related to c-, N-, or <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification exhibited growth inhibition (28 - 87 %), whereas 2 non-SCLC lines adually showed growth stimulation after treatment with 1 M RA.

40|$|A {{polymerase}} chain reaction-based cloning strategy {{allowed for}} the isolation of two distinct Xenopus <b>L-myc</b> <b>genes,</b> as well as previously isolated xc- and xN-myc genes, thus demonstrating that these three well-defined members of the mammalian myc gene family are present in lower vertebrates as well. Comparison of the Xenopus and mammalian Myc families revealed {{a high degree of}} structural relatedness at the gene and protein levels; this homology was consistent with the ability of the xc-myc 1 and xN-myc 1 genes to function as oncogenes in primary mammalian cells. In contrast, the xL-myc 1 gene was found to be incapable of transforming rat embryo fibroblast cells, and this inactivity may relate to localized but significant differences in its putative transactivation domain. Analysis of xc-, xN-, and xL-myc gene expression demonstrated that (i) all three genes were highly expressed during oogenesis and their transcripts accumulated as abundant maternal mRNAs, (ii) each gene exhibited a distinctive pattern of expression during embryogenesis and in adult tissues, and (iii) the xL-myc 1 and xL-myc 2 genes were coordinately expressed in the maternal and zygotic genomes. The markedly high expression of the Xenopus myc gene family in differentiated tissues, such as the central nervous system and kidney, contrasts sharply with the low levels observed in mammalian adult tissues. These differences may reflect unique functions of the Myc family proteins in processes specific to amphibians, such as tissue regeneration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext: Cushing disease (CD) {{is due to}} {{pituitary}} corticotrope adenomas {{that produce}} unrestrained ACTH secretion and have lost the negative feedback exerted by glucocorticoids (GCs). GCs also restrain corticotrope proliferation, and the mechanisms of this inhibition are poorly understood. Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} to identify cell cycle regulatory genes that are regulated by GCs and the glucocorticoid receptor and to assess regulatory genes that have a rate-limiting action on corticotrope proliferation and may be disregulated in CD. Design: The mouse corticotrope tumor cells AtT- 20 were used to identify GC-regulated genes that contribute to control of cell cycle progression. Surgery sections from patients with CD were used to assess expression of CABLES 1 in corticotrope adenomas. Methods: Gene expression profiling, small interfering RNA knockdowns, cell cycle analyses, and genetic manipulations were performed in AtT- 20 cells. Sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitation for pituitary-restricted transcription factors and RNA polymerase II were used to identify regulatory elements and genes that bind GR and are direct transcriptional targets. A panel of previously well-characterized corticotrope adenomas was used to correlate expression of CABLES 1 with that of other markers. Results: GCs altered expression of 3 positive and 3 negative regulators of cell cycle progression. Two Myc <b>genes</b> (<b>L-Myc</b> and N-Myc) and E 2 F 2 are repressed by GCs, whereas genes for the negative regulators of the cell cycle, Gadd 45, Gadd 45, and Cables 1 are activated by GCs. Cables 1 small interfering RNA knockdown strongly stimulates AtT- 20 cell proliferation and antagonizes the growth inhibition produced by GCs. The Gadd 45 and Cables 1 genes have the hallmarks of direct GC targets. CABLES 1 is expressed in normal human pituitary cells, but expression is lost in 55 % of corticotrope adenomas, and this is strongly correlated with the loss of p 27 Kip 1 expression. Conclusions: CABLES 1 is a critical regulator of corticotrope proliferation that defines a pathway often inactivated in CD and links proliferation to GC resistance. (J Clin Endocrinol Meta...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{in detail the}} structure of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> isolated from human placental DNA and characterized its expression in several small-cell lung cancer cell lines. The gene is composed of three exons and two introns spanning 6. 6 kilobases in human DNA. Several distinct mRNA species are produced in all small-cell lung cancer cell lines that express L-myc. These transcripts are generated from a single gene by alternative splicing of introns 1 and 2 and by use of alternative polyadenylation signals. In some mRNAs there is a long open reading frame with a predicted translated protein of 364 residues. Amino acid sequence comparison with c-myc and N-myc demonstrated multiple discrete regions with extensive homology.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the R locus of maize is responsible for determining the temporal and spatial pattern of anthocyanin pigmentation in the plant. In this report we demonstrate that three members of the R gene family, P, S, and Lc, encode homologous transcripts 2. 5 kilobases in length. The structure of one R gene, Lc, was determined by sequencing cDNA and genomic clones. The putative Lc protein, deduced from the cDNA sequence, is composed of 610 amino acids and has homology to the helix-loop-helix DNA-binding/dimerization motif found in the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> product and other regulatory proteins. It also contains a large acidic domain that may be involved in transcriptional activation. Consistent with its proposed role as a transcriptional activator is our finding that a functional R gene is required for the accumulation of transcripts of at least two genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. We discuss the possibility that the diverse patterns of anthocyanin pigmentation conditioned by different R genes reflect differences in the R gene promoters rather than their gene products...|$|E
40|$|The <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{from a human}} small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line {{on the basis of}} its amplification and sequence similarity to c-myc and N-myc. A new mechanism of L-myc activation which results from the production of rlf-L-myc fusion protein was recently reported. On the basis of our earlier observation of a rearrangement involving amplified L-myc in an SCLC cell line, ACC-LC- 49, we decided to investigate this rearrangement in detail along with the structure of L-myc amplification units in five additional SCLC cell lines. We report here the identification of a novel genomic region, termed jal, which is distinct from rlf and is juxtaposed to and amplified with L-myc during the process of DNA amplification of the region encompassing L-myc. Long-range analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the amplified L-myc locus is involved in highly complex intrachromosomal rearrangements with jal and/or rlf. Our results also suggest that the simultaneous presence of rearrangements both in rlf intron 1 and in regions immediately upstream of L-myc may be necessary for the expression of rlf-L-myc chimeric transcripts...|$|E
40|$|Restriction length {{fragment}} polymorphism of the <b>L-MYC</b> <b>gene</b> {{was examined}} in DNAs from lung cancer tissues and normal tissues of 51 Japanese patients with lung cancer. In individual patients, no difference was seen between the restriction length {{fragments of the}} two alleles of L-MYC [6 -kilobase (kb) and 10 -kb fragments in EcoRI digests] in lung cancer tissues and normal tissues. But a striking correlation {{was found between the}} restriction length fragment polymorphism pattern of L-MYC and the extent of metastasis, particularly to the lymph nodes at the time of surgery: Patients with only the L band (10 kb) had few lymph node metastatic lesions, whereas patients with either the S band (6 kb) or the S and L bands almost always had lymph node metastatic lesion. A similar correlation was found between the presence of the S band and metastases to other organs. This correlation was particularly marked in cases of adenocarcinoma. These results indicate a clear genetic influence on metastases and a consequent poor prognosis for certain patients of lung cancer; L-MYC restriction length fragment polymorphism is thus shown to be a useful marker for predicting the metastatic potential of human lung cancer...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the role of}} L-Myc in normal mammalian development and its functional relationship to {{other members of the}} Myc family, we determined the normal patterns of <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the developing mouse by RNA in situ hybridization and assessed the phenotypic impact of L-Myc deficiency produced through standard gene targeting methodology. L-myc transcripts were detected in the developing kidney and lung as well as in both the proliferative and the differentiative zones of the brain and neural tube. Despite significant expression of L-myc in developing mouse tissue, homozygous null L-myc mice were found to be viable, reproductively competent, and represented in expected frequencies from heterozygous matings. A detailed histological survey of embryonic and adult tissues, characterization of an embryonic neuronal marker, and measurement of cellular proliferation in situ did not reveal any congenital abnormalities. The lack of an apparent phenotype associated with L-Myc deficiency indicates that L-Myc is dispensable for gross morphological development and argues against a unique role for L-Myc in early central nervous system development as had been previously suggested. Although overlapping expression patterns among myc family members raise the possibility of complementation of L-Myc deficiency by other Myc oncoproteins, compensatory changes in the levels of c- and/or N-myc transcripts were not detected in homozygous null L-myc mice...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Association between {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of known oncogenes and a predisposition to develop cancer have been postulated. The <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> {{is a potential}} molecular marker associated with cancer susceptibility as well as metastasis, prognosis, and adverse survival. Our aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that there was an association between L-myc S allele in breast cancer and a predisposition to the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The distribution of L-myc polymorphism in 56 patients with breast cancer was determined by polymerase chain reaction-based {{restriction fragment}} length polymorphism and compared with that of 51 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of L and S in breast cancer patients were 0. 70 and 0. 30, respectively and those in normal individuals were 0. 54 and 0. 46, respectively. This difference was primarily the result of a high frequency of the S allele among breast cancer patients compared to controls. The frequency of S allele was significantly higher in breast cancer patients than in normal individuals (p < 0. 01). No correlation was observed between the presence of L-myc S allele and several parameters of each patient's history or characteristics of tumor. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that L-myc polymorphism may be significant in an individual's susceptibility to breast cancer in Turkey and may be useful for identifying patients at high risk of developing breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice {{that contain}} {{constructs}} of the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> under the transcriptional {{control of the}} immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (E mu) develop thymic hyperplasia and are predisposed to T cell lymphomas. Here we describe a second form of malignancy that occurs in aging E mu L-myc transgenic mice. The mean latency period {{for the development of}} this malignancy is longer compared with the E mu L-myc T cell lymphomas but the overall incidence is increased threefold. The histopathological morphology is that of a highly malignant mesenchymal neoplasm that closely resembles human fibrous histiocytoma. The tumor cells were classified as myelomonocytic on the basis of several lineage-specific markers and the lack of rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and the T cell receptor beta loci. Cultured tumor cells produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) protein and express the M- CSF receptor, suggesting the involvement of an autocrine loop in this malignancy. Similar to the E mu L-myc T cell lymphomas, these tumors show high-level transgene expression but no detectable levels of endogenous c-myc mRNA, directly implicating the deregulated expression of L-myc in the generation of this malignancy. E mu L-myc myelomonocytic tumors show consistent trisomy of chromosome 16, implicating this as a secondary event in the development of this tumor. In the light of recent findings that L-myc is expressed in human myeloid leukemias and in several human myeloid tumor cell lines, the results described here might implicate L-myc in the development of naturally occurring myeloid neoplasias...|$|E

The patients and the normal healthy volunteers were classified into three genetic types according to the polymorphic patterns defined by the two alleles (6. 6 kb, S fragment; and 10. 0 kb, L fragment). DNA isolated from the PBC of each patient always exhibited {{the same pattern of}} L-myc alleles as that observed for the corresponding tumour DNA.

Further, analysis of L-myc RFLP with the clinical pattern of the malignancy showed no significant correlation with nodal metastasis, TNM staging or recurrence of the tumour. The relative ratios of the three genotypes (L-L, L-S, S-S) in the oral cancer patients were not significantly different from those seen in the healthy Indians, implying no predisposition to oral cancer by either allele.

The cases and controls had a cigarette-smoking history of 40 or more pack years or other abnormalities in pulmonary function tests, their ages were closely matched (64 years for cases and 61 years for controls) and the ratio of Caucasians to African Americans was close to unity (cases, 0. 95 : 1. 00, controls, 1. 00 : 0. 88). The H-ras- 1 gene contains an insertion deletion polymorphism. Inheritance of rare H-ras- 1 alleles, defined by MspI digestion, confers a relative risk for lung cancer of 2. 0 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 5 - 7. 3) for Caucasians and 3. 2 (0. 9 - 11. 6) for African Americans (74 cases, 67 controls).

40|$|Gene {{amplification}} is {{an important}} mechanism of oncogene activation in various human cancers, including ovarian carcinomas (OvCas). We used restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) to detect amplified DNA fragments in the genomes of 47 primary OvCas. Visual analysis of the RLGS gel images revealed several OvCa samples with spots of greater intensity than corresponding spots from normal tissues, indicating possible DNA amplification in specific tumors. Two primary tumors (E 1 and S 12) shared four high-intensity spots. A recently developed informatics tool termed Virtual Genome Scans {{was used to compare}} the RLGS patterns in these tumors with patterns predicted from the human genome sequence. Virtual Genome Scans determined that three of the four fragments localized to chromosome 1 p 34 - 35, a region containing the proto-oncogene L-MYC. Sixty-eight primary OvCas, including 40 analyzed by RLGS, were screened by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for possible amplification of L-MYC. Ten tumors with increased L-MYC copy number were identified, including tumor E 1, which showed an ∼ 24 -fold increase in copy number compared to normal DNA. Southern analysis of several tumors confirmed the quantitative PCR results. Using sequence tagged site (STS) markers flanking L-MYC, increased DNA copy number in tumor E 1 was found to span the region flanking L-MYC between D 1 S 432 and D 1 S 463 (≈ 3. 1 Mb). Other tumors showed amplification only at the L-MYC locus. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, L-MYC was found to be more frequently overexpressed in OvCas than either c-MYC or N-MYC relative to ovarian surface epithelium. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed elevated L-MYC expression in a substantial fraction of OvCas, including nine of nine tumors with increased L-MYC copy number. The data implicate <b>L-MYC</b> <b>gene</b> amplification and/or overexpression in human OvCa pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} genes {{contribute}} to CRC tumorigenesis. These include oncogenes. TSGs, and MMR genes. This study aims {{to reveal the}} significance of oncogenes, TSGs and the genomic instability in Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients. The frequencies of genetic alterations in Hong Kong Chinese CRC were compared to those in Caucasians and Japanese. The significance of the Ki-ras oncogene was evaluated by screening Ki-ras codon 12 point activational mutations by PCR-ASO hybridization while that of TSGs was investigated by PCR-LOH analysis. For the importance of genomic instability in Hong Kong sporadic CRC, the RER status indicator, BAT- 26, was used. Specific biomarkers may have independent prognostic significance. Another {{aim of this study}} was examination of the association between clinical and pathological parameters and individual molecular markers (Apt, Mcc, and Dcc TSGs, Ki-ras oncogene and RER phenotype). This study included 99 colorectal carcinomas and their matching normal tissues. Thirty of the 99 (30 %) specimens showed Ki-ras codon 12 mutations. Aspartic acid 1 substitutions were the most frequent mutation among the five specific types of mutatiom detected. The frequency of Ki-ras codon 12 mutations in Chinese was similar to previous studies in Caucasians and Japanese. For the patterns of Ki-ras codon 12 mutations, Hong, Kong CRC patients had a remarkably similar one to that observed in the US and Japan, while the pattern differed significantly from that observed in Western Europe. A significantly lower incidence of aspartic acid substitutions and G-to-A transitions at Ki. ras codon 12 were observed in Western European CRC patients, while these were the predominant changes in Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients. The results suggested that the etiologic cause of Ki-ras codon 12 mutations in CRC patients with different ethnic origins may vary geographically. The TSGs are the second category of genes involved in the CRC model. The frequencies of allelic losses of Apc, Mcc and Dcc were 31. 3 % (15 / 48), 11. 6 % (5 / 43), and 44. 4 % (20 / 45), respectively, for Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients. The frequency of Apc LOH was similar, the Mcc LOH was lower, and the Dcc LOH was higher than previous Caucasian and Japanese reports. In Hong Kong Chinese CRC, the RER+ phenotype occurred at a frequency of 10 % (10 / 99). This frequency was similar to other studies using microsatellite markers where RER+ frequencies ranged from 11 % to 28 %. The rates of genetic alterations in RER+ tumors were lower in p 53, Mcc and Dcc; similar in Apc; and higher in Ki-ras as compared to that observed in RER-tumors. None of these differences achieved statistical significance, however. L-myc genotyping was done in the same group of patients. The ratio of S to L alleles in the current study population was 0. 51 : 0. 49. There were 26. 3 % (26 / 99) CRC patients harboring the SS genotype, 46. 5 % (46 / 99) the LS genotype, and 27. 3 % (27 / 99) the LL genotype. Allele and genotype frequencies for the <b>L-myc</b> <b>gene</b> in Hong Kong CRC were similar to Caucasian and Japanese groups. The usefulness of individual molecular markers including Apc, Mcc and Dcc, LOH, Ki-ras codon 12 point mutations, and the RER phenotype for independent prognosis of Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients was assessed. None of the biomarkers examined were predictive of the survival independently. However, the Ki-ras mutations were associated significantly with well-differentiated tumors and the RER+ phenotype was correlated significantly to the less aggressive Dukes' stage B. Tumors with Ki-ras codon 12 point activational mutations and RER+ phenotypes are positively correlated with the degree of differentiation and Dukes' staging, respectively, and an improved prognosis. Previous studies showed the presence of 18 q allelic loss and L-myc SS genotype were associated with a poorer prognosis. The L-myc SS genotype was associated with the Dukes' stage C in this current study. No evidence supported the association of the L-myc SS genotypes with Dcc LOH and poor prognosis. RER+ phenotypes are associated significantly with poorly differentiated tumors in this current study. Additionally, this study supported the observation that a subset of younger male CRC patients in Hong Kong developed CRC by the RER pathway. The RER+ phenotype associated significantly with male CRC patients and with those aged below 50 years. Multiple genetic alterations occur commonly in CRC. Twenty-nine tumors harbored more than one alteration; 20 had two alterations; 6 had three alterations, and 3 had four alterations in this study of Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients. There was no evidence to support the use of multiple genetic alterations as a prognostic panel of biomarkers for Hong Kong CRC patients...|$|E
