In 1917 he published an article on the disease, from which the systemic nature of the disease came to be realized by the medical community. His name is also lent to Schaumann bodies, which are calcium-containing inclusion bodies found in the cytoplasm of giant cells in sarcoidosis and berylliosis. Schaumann bodies were initially described in 1871 by Oscar von Schüppel (1837-1881), a pathologist at the University of Tübingen. Following retirement, Schaumann conducted research involving new aspects of benign <b>lymphogranulomatosis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1902 he {{graduated}} in medicine and surgery. Since {{he was a student}} he devoted himself to the study of general pathology deepening into the field of bacteriology. After graduation he made study trips abroad and lived in qualified research centers of German universities, including Munich, Berlin and Wurzburg [...] for training periods and to improve his knowledge. In 1909 he returned to his hometown where, under the leadership of Professor Rocco Jemma, chose to address the specialized area of pediatrics. In 1913, when Professor Jemma moved to the clinic in Naples, Di Cristina took over the chair of the pediatric clinic in Palermo During those years, his interest was immediately drawn to {{the very heart of the}} problem of leishmaniasis [...] children that led him to discover both a cure which was made up of salts of antimony and a method used worldwide which, since then, allowed to win this otherwise deadly infectious disease. His scientific production is extensive in many areas of research. He studied several types of hemopathy and gave contributions to the knowledge of pseudo-leukemia, of <b>lymphogranulomatosis</b> and of chloroma. He was involved in the production disorders and in the nitrogen replacement in some diseases of childhood. Beyond the clinical and scientific aspects Di Cristina strictly linked his name to many initiatives on infancy. Due to his commitments the Istituto dell’aiuto materno and the Casa del sole [...] "Ignazio and Manfredi Lanza di Trabia" [...] were founded. He prematurely died at the age of 52 in Palermo.|$|E

40|$|The author studied {{changes in}} serum {{phosphatase}} and transaminase {{in the blood}} diease, especially leukemia, that had been diagnosed as suchmainly by bone-marrow tissue culture and a new hematological technique devised in the Hiraki Clinic of Internal Medicine, and obtained the following results. 1. In leukemia alkaline phosphatase is slightly decreased while acid phosphatase is slightly increased. However, only in monocytic leukemia these phosphatases are generally normal. In transaminase both glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase are increased, but such increase is marked in acute myelogenous leukemia followed by monocytic leukemia and chromic myelogenous leukemia, while those in lymphocytic leukemia are normal. From these differences it can be assumed that {{there are differences in}} the enzyme system mainly acting upon different leucocyte series. 2. In hypoplastic anemia phosphatase is generally at the normal level, but transaminase is increased, suggesting tissue destruction similar to Banti's disease and hemolytic anemia. In contrast to this, transaminase in idopathic hypochromic anemia transaminase is hardly changed. 3. In cancer disease, only a slight decrease in both phosphatase and transaminase can be observed, but in hepatoma and in the cases with meatastasis into the liver, alkaline phosphatase and transaminase increase in parallel to obstructive jaundice. 4. In <b>lymphogranulomatosis</b> so long as jaundice is not accompanied, phosphatase and transaminase are within the normal range, and in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura a slight decrease in alkaline phosphatase can be recognized...|$|E
40|$|Morbidity and {{mortality}} rates of malignant diseases are actual problem {{all over the}} world. In Latvia there is comparatively high morbidity rate of the malignant diseases with disturbances of blood forming (haemoblastoses). Very often haemoblastoses and its therapy are complicated with anaemia. Anaemia manifestation {{is one of the}} significant factors for survival for patients with haemoblastoses, in particular for chronic form of the disease. The cause and biochemical mechanisms of the development of anaemia on patients with haemoblastoses are not completely understood up to day. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyse possible connection between enzymatic antioxidant system of blood and developing of anaemia on patients with haemoblastoses and to investigate the biochemical mechanism of the effect of antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), and selenium (Se) supplementation. 165 patients with polycythemia vera (PV), chronic myelogenouse leukaemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, <b>lymphogranulomatosis</b> as well as 50 healthy volunteers and 10 volunteers with marginal selenium status were observed. The haemoglobin concentration in whole blood and in red blood cells (RBC) were detected by standard haemicyanide method, activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, catalase (CAT), glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in RBC and tiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration in RBC and plasma were detected by spectrophotometric methods. Concentration of ferritin and transferrin in plasma were assessed by turbodimetric method, flexibility of RBC were estimated by microfiltration method, Se concentration in blood was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. The results of the study demonstrate that patients with haemoblastoses have high TBARS concentration in RBC and significant changes in activities of tested antioxidant enzymes compared to healthy volunteers. These changes are more expressed in the acute period of the disease compared to chronic stage. All observed patients, except <b>lymphogranulomatosis,</b> have reduced GSH-Px activity. Patients with PV have increased activities of CAT and GR at the beginning of the disease, but the depletion of antioxidant defence has been detected during the course of the disease. Activities of G 6 PD and GR are significantly increased in RBC formed from the leukaemic cell clone (patients with PV and CML). Reduction of the activity of SOD in RBC is close connected with developing of anaemia on patients with PV and CML. To improve antioxidant defence SOD and Se supplementation was used for patients and 10 healthy volunteers with marginal Se concentration in blood. The results obtained demonstrate differences in metabolism on patients compared to healthy volunteers. After two months of supplement therapy activities of enzymes SOD, GR, GSH-Px in RBC significantly increased, concentration of haemoglobin and Se increased, but concentration of TBARS decreased in blood of healthy volunteers. TBARS concentration in blood significantly decreased on patients with CLL. The improvement of RBC flexibility, the decrease of pathological high level of ferritin and decrease of chemiluminescence in plasma were observed in patients with PV and CML, in some cases the reduction of anaemia manifestation was found. Thereby, patients with haemoblastoses complicated with anaemia have inadequate antioxidant defence in RBC: depressed SOD activity and decreased GSH-Px activity associated with increased lipid peroxidation in blood. Antioxidants SOD and Se supplementation according to our scheme can significantly improve antioxidant defence in blood in healthy volunteers with marginal Se status and have protective effect on blood antioxidant defence in observed patients with haemoblastosesSeparate summary in EnglishAvailable from Latvian Academic Library / LAL - Latvian Academic LibrarySIGLELVLatvi...|$|E
40|$|The author {{studied the}} trends of serum cholesterol, lipoprotein, and proteins, mainly in leukemia and various blood diseases, and {{obtained}} the following results. The {{subjects of the}} present investigation were the cases diagnosed as such by bonemarrow tissue cultures and hematological examinations. 1. The cholesterol value in leukemia is almost at the normal level, showing not any marked difference {{by the type of}} the disease, but the ratio of β- and α- lipoproteins generally presents an increasing tendency. As for the trend of serum proteins on the whole a decrease in total concentration and albumin and an increase in γ-globulin are the common changes, and the differences by the type can not be considered to be marked. Only in mono cytic leukemia the decrease in albumin and the increase in γ-globulin are marked. 2. Hypoplastic anemia shows the normal level of cholesterol, but {{it is interesting to note}} that the total cholesterol, ester cholesterol as well as the ratio of ester to total chole sterol are all in the decreasing order of type I>type III>type IV. Moreover, a decrease in α-globulin and an increase in γ-globulin in the serum protein content can be observed. As for the other anemias Banti's disease shows an increase in the lipoprotein ratio, a marked decrease in serum protein, and an increase in γ-globulin; idiopathic hypochromic anemia a decrease in serum proteins; a single case of hemolytic anemia an increase in cholesterol, a decrease in the serum protein content and albumin fraction and an increase in γ-globulin. In addition, in one case of hookworm anemia an extremely high value of the lipoprotein ratio, a decrease in albumin and an increase in γ-globulin can be recognized. 3. In cancer a decrease in cholesterol, serum protein content, and albumin fraction and an increase in γ-globulin can be recognized, but as for the differences in the site only hapatoma shows a marked change in serum protein and fractions. 4. Choresterol in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is decreased, and in one of them a decrease in albumin of serum protein fractions and a slight increase in γ-and β- globulin can be observed. In <b>lymphogranulomatosis</b> a decrease in albumin and an increase in γ-globulin are marked, and in one case of reticulum cell sarcoma a decrease in cholesterol, the serum protein content, and albumin as well as an increase in γ-globulin can be recognized...|$|E
40|$|The megacaryocytes {{in various}} kinds of {{hematological}} diseases were examined, with special respect to their number, morphological aspect, {{and the formation of}} blood platelets. For the purpose of the measurement of megacaryocytes there exist histological method, counting chamber method, and smearing method; however, by the only method among them the conclusive estimation is impossible. There can be denoted the relative correlation between the numbers of megacaryocytes per total white cell count measured by these three kinks of methods. Both pernicious anemia and hypoplastic anemia show the abnormal aspect of megacaryocytes. In Banti 2 ̆ 7 s symptom complex, the increase in number of megacaryocytes and the decrease in blood platelet count were found. Leucosis does not show any definite fluctuation of megacaryocyte count, but there is found a tendency to increase in the aleucemic state and decrease in the leucemic. In addition, the megacaryocytes display often the abnormal aspect. There can be ascertained any clear-cut relationship between hepatic function and megacaryocyte count. Between splenomegalia and megacaryocyte count, there are observed {{various kinds of}} changes according to underlying disorders. From the results above mentioned, the existence of the characteristic features in certain diseases may be, to some extent, emphasized. In thorombopenic purpura, there can be observed the increase in number of megacaryocytes, despite of not abnormal aspect. In purpura abdominalis there is found not any abnormal appearance of both megacaryocytes and platelets. Appendix: Clinical Evalution of Actinomycin C for the treatment of <b>Lymphogranulomatosis</b> (Hodgkin) Author had a chance to evaluate Actinomycin C (Sanamycin 2 ̆ 2 Bayer 2 ̆ 2) for the treatment of malignant lymphogranuloma, and obtained the results as follows. The lymphatic glands which can be per cutaneously palpated, decrease in their size, while then increase in their hardness. The effects upon the lymphatic glands of mediastinum, abdomen and so on, are ascertained not only clinically, but also by autopsy. The diminution of hepatomegalia is not striking, however, the splenomegalia decreased in its size considerably. The dosage depends upon individual reaction and existence of complication; usually the initial dosis ranges from 100 to 200 γ pro die, then with due regards to reduction of tumour size and extent of size effects, 2 or 3 times weekly method is applied by which the favourable effect can be far advanced. The therapy with large amount is apt to display more side effect. Erosion and rhagades can be observed in the alimentary mucosa, but soon afterward the cessation of the medication these side effects are used to disappear. So far as the dosage used by author is concerned, there can not be recognized any disturbances of liver, heart, kidney and so on. Comparing with therapies applied hitherto, this treatment posses far less damage to bone marrow; although Actinomycin C reduces the intramedullary cellular components to some extent, after the stoppage of the administration this effect recovers gradually within relative short time. The increase of plasma cells their counts can not be found intramedullarily and peripherally in this disorder, so that the influence of this drug upon the count of plasma cells remains undecided. Both intramedullarily and peripherally, there can be seen more or less the increase in monocytes which are not directly affected with the use of this preparate. The only case among total observation (in cases) showed eosinophilia, but the count of eosinophils does not recover up to the normal range by this treatment. Except for no. 3, the neutrophils decrease in their count relatively, and by the treatment there can be found the tendency to return within normal limits. After the cessation of the treatment, the histological findings observed 2 months later showed the new development of the cellular hyperplasia around the fibrosis. So far as the experience of author is concerned, there can be seen the remission for 1 or 2 months after the cessation of the treatment, therefore the maintenance dosis of Actinomycin C should be continured long enough, even after the subjective improvement...|$|E
