50|$|Circa 1988-89, it {{is known}} that at least Coliban had been fitted with end-of-train marker lights and a <b>lamp</b> <b>bracket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Corris Railway Mail Wagon, 2 ft, {{used for}} {{carrying}} mail by gravity {{down the line}} every week-day afternoon, <b>lamp</b> <b>bracket</b> fitted at down end. Four-wheel, end door, 1-ton wagon ex-GWR 31992, TR 10, Turner axleboxes, bought by TR in 1951 and donated to Museum 1994.|$|E
50|$|Within {{and around}} the Grade II listed parkland and {{pleasure}} grounds are several historic listed structures. On Wigan Lane {{is a pair of}} square ashlar lodges and a round-headed entrance arch in the Classical style probably built in 1840. The lodges are single-story with pyramidal roofs. The gateway arch has ornamental cast iron gates and a pendant <b>lamp</b> <b>bracket</b> suspended from the arch. Another stone lodge with a hipped roof on Hall Lane west of the canal dates from around 1830.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} {{it was common}} for most country {{passenger}} trains to run with a VP van, usually at the Melbourne end of the consist. This meant that half the time the VP van would be trailing the guard's van; to facilitate this, VP vans were equipped with a taildisc and <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LP's had {{a maximum}} speed 10 mph {{higher than the}} LF's; 70 mph. They also had tail discs and side <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets,</b> making them {{suitable}} for trailing a passenger train. The vans were converted from LL 16, 28, 45, 27, 44, 12, 15, 6, 8 and 50 respectively. They were used between Mildura and Ouyen.|$|R
5000|$|The UP van {{numbers were}} 14, 28, 32, 33, 42, 46, 48, 53 and 60. It {{is thought that}} UP 19 also ran; UB 19 is {{mentioned}} as being fitted with [...] "pass" [...] (passenger) bogies in 1956, though the records do not show the code UP. Vans recoded were fitted side <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets</b> and tail discs at each end.|$|R
50|$|Allocated to {{work the}} Weymouth Harbour Tramway, trains {{operating}} over public thoroughfare tramway without escort are required to be fitted with warning equipment for the general public. Two warning units were built and housed in a cabinet at the track side of the quay spur at the throat of Weymouth yard. This equipment comprised a yellow box which fitted on a bracket just above the rubbing plate on the cab front. It had an amber rotating beacon and bell which served to warn thoroughfare users and was controlled from the driving cab. Each member of Class 33/1 and all TC stock had a small socket where the bell/beacon units plugged in to draw power from the train systems. Later units (i.e. those in use after the tramway fell out of general use and the power sockets had been removed during overhaul) were smaller and mounted on a <b>lamp</b> <b>bracket</b> just below the cab window. These had an on/off switch {{on the bottom of}} the unit and no bell - warnings being given using the train horn.|$|E
5000|$|By 1987 {{the engine}} had been {{transported to the}} nearby Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway where a section of 2 0" [...] track was laid and the engine turned a wheel under its own steam {{for the first time}} since 1939. Thereafter it was {{returned}} to works for completion and painting before arriving at Groudle Glen that September to the delight of the railways restorers, the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters Association. The engine first performed passenger duties that Christmas, appearing in original olive green colour scheme and entered service thereafter. Reboilering was completed in 2003 at which time the locomotive was repainted into the darker brunswick green that it carried in the 1920s and it is this guise that she remains in service today. To honour one of the lines engineers, a plaque in his name, Alastair Lamberton, was erected inside the cab in 1999, and the rebuild plates were also removed from the exterior as part of the reboilering, making for a more authentic appearance. Sea Lion carried a back <b>lamp</b> <b>bracket</b> between the cab windows which is inaccurate (although correct on Polar Bear) as hers was originally on the waistband of the cab sheet.|$|E
5000|$|During {{operation}} of services by British Rail Class 33 locomotives, two warning units were built and {{housed in a}} cabinet at the track side entrance to the tramway at the throat of Weymouth yard. This equipment comprised a yellow box which fitted on a <b>lamp</b> <b>bracket</b> on the cab front, and had an amber rotating beacon and bell which served to warn thoroughfare users. The bell did not ring continuously but could be controlled by the train driver. Each member of Class 33/1 and all TC stock had a small socket where the bell/beacon units plugged in to draw power from the train systems. Trains for the quay would halt at the station throat, the warning equipment attached and then tested by the train guard. In addition, trains on the tramway were [...] "walked" [...] by railway staff with flags, clearing the route of people and badly parked cars all the way between the points at which the tramway reverted to conventional track at the quay station and road crossing into Weymouth yard. On arrival at the quay terminus the guard would move the warning equipment {{to the other end}} of the train in readiness for the return journey.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} of the church include a piscina and sedile, an altar rail with wrought iron standards, a low stone screen, carved stone pulpit and square font. There are ornate wrought iron <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets</b> on {{the north and south}} walls of the nave and a pipe organ {{on the south side of}} the chancel. It is furnished with benches, which include choir stalls, and a carved wooden eagle lectern.|$|R
5000|$|The Bootie Folding Cycle came well-equipped, with mudguards, a {{built in}} luggage rack, {{front and rear}} <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets</b> and sidestand. The {{crankset}} is a steel, cottered mass market unit manufactured by Williams, and the handlebars and stem are conventional chrome plated steel. A black double sprung mattress type saddle was fitted to the 500 mm long 'L' shaped seatpost. Booties were shod with Dunlop or Michelin ETRTO size 203 - 62, balloon-type tyres.|$|R
5000|$|... 73129 was outshopped from Derby Works in August 1956. It {{was one of}} 30 built {{fitted with}} Caprotti valve gear. Originally {{allocated}} at Shrewsbury Shed (which required the fitting of GWR style <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets),</b> it was later transferred to Patricroft Shed (near Manchester) in 1958. It {{spent the rest of}} its working life there until it was stored at Patricroft from June to November 1967. It was officially withdrawn from traffic on 2 December 1967.|$|R
50|$|The tender {{took the}} form of a hollow box, low enough to avoid {{obscuring}} the driver's view when pushed. The body was carried on a pair of former carriage bogies, which provided the automatic brakes. The body was filled with scrap steel to raise the weight of the vehicle to 35½-37½ tons; consequently increasing the available brake force. Four <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets</b> were provided at each end to display locomotive headcode discs describing the class of train - when propelled, the tender obscured the front of the locomotive, and hence the headcode.|$|R
50|$|Vehicle: {{carriage}} {{should be}} the correct size and weight for the horse, as should the height and length of the poles for pairs and fours. Lamps are required at the advanced level, but only required at the training, preliminary, and intermediate levels if the carriage has <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets.</b> A set of spares should be carried on the vehicle in case of emergency: a spare trace of the correct size, a rein splice, a hole punch and similar items are traditionally included. These may be inspected by the judge and the groom {{will be expected to}} know how to use them.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between particular locomotives, {{some of them}} easily seen. Western Region Class 37s can be identified by 'cow horns' around halfway up on {{the outer edge of}} each end of the <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets.</b> When British Railways took over from the Great Western Railway the use of Great Western <b>lamps</b> continued. Their <b>brackets</b> used an L-shaped upright that was parallel to the direction of travel, unlike the other regions which used transverse brackets. Another difference between the regions is by the nose end headcodes. Lower-numbered, split-box Class 37s were allocated to northern England and east Anglia; centre-box locomotives were almost all allocated to Wales and the south west. After locomotives were transferred between pools in the 1980s they tended to stray from their original depots. Regional decorations included the Highland (Inverness) Stag, the Cockney Sparrow (Stratford) the Cornish lizard (St Blazey) and Eastfield Highland Terrier. All the Cardiff Canton Class 37/4s received Celtic Dragons below the driver's window whilst in large logo blue. Some Scottish locomotives were later fitted with small Saltire flags by their TOPS data panels or on their noses in a similar fashion to the HAA hoppers allocated to Scottish power stations.|$|R
60|$|The tent was lighted dimly by {{kerosene}} <b>lamps,</b> hung in <b>brackets</b> {{against the}} poles, and by stable lanterns set {{here and there}} upon the benches.|$|R
6000|$|... "What make ye here, good brother?" [...] she inquired. [...] "Ye are doubtless ill-directed. Whom do ye require? And {{she set her}} <b>lamp</b> {{upon the}} <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
60|$|They looked, and by {{the light}} of a big <b>bracket</b> <b>lamp,</b> made out two men and a boy moving about the kitchen, evidently {{preparing}} the evening meal. The door to the next room was open, and they caught a glimpse of several men at a table eating, or waiting to be served.|$|R
60|$|Before I could answer, {{she came}} out eagerly {{to speak to me}} in the corridor. We met under the light of a <b>lamp</b> on a <b>bracket.</b> At the first sight of me, Miss Verinder stopped, and hesitated. She {{recovered}} herself instantly, coloured for a moment--and then, with a charming frankness, offered me her hand.|$|R
60|$|Following her light, Razumov climbed two {{flights of}} stairs from the lower darkness. Leaving the <b>lamp</b> on a <b>bracket</b> on the landing, she opened a door, and went in, {{accompanied}} by the sceptical guest. Razumov entered last. He {{closed the door behind}} him, and stepping on one side, put his back against the wall.|$|R
6000|$|The three {{visitors}} who had waited longest consulted among themselves, and (having {{nothing better to}} do with their time) decided on accepting the Doctor's proposal. The visitor who believed it all to be [...] "humbug" [...] coolly took a gold coin out of his pocket, tossed it into the air, caught it in his closed hand, and walked up to the shaded <b>lamp</b> on the <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{composite}} sitting/sleeping car, VAM1, {{was built}} with 10 evenly-spaced windows per side, plus a closer window and a {{door at the}} No.2 end. Access to the car was via the doors at the No.2 end, or via coupled carriages and the diaphragms linking them to VAM1. The ten windows each represented a single compartment. The first and second compartments at the No.1 end were fitted with bench seats for four people each, while the other eight compartments were fitted with three-person seats divisible with retractable armrests. All seats could fold down to form a bed, and above that was a second bed, giving capacity for up to 20 sleeping passengers or up to 24 first-class and 8 second-class passengers. Generally speaking only the first four compartments at the No.1 end were used for sitting passengers, and the remaining six were used exclusively for sleeping passengers. Partially because of this, the public address system was only wired to the four compartments at the No.1 end, {{and not the other}} six. Each compartment also had its own cupboard, shower, toilet, card table and wardrobe. The interior was sheathed with laminex panels.At the No.2 end a small curtained-off area was reserved for the carriage conductor, with a seat to work at. Weight of the car was 51 tons 13 cwt. Water capacity was 280 gallons of cold water, plus 75 gallons of hot water for the showers. The car was fitted with marker lights, backup <b>lamp</b> <b>brackets</b> and tail discs at both ends, allowing it to trail any train. Notably, even though the car would only normally trail trains in New South Wales, the end-of-train marker was a Victorian Railways disc rather than a New South Wales Railways triangle.|$|R
50|$|The {{furniture}} reputedly {{dates from}} the church's establishment. The altar, lectern, pulpit and pews are of stained pine. To {{the west end of}} the aisle is the movable stone baptism font. The altar has been moved away from the apse to face the congregation. The original timber screen from the altar is presently stored in the vestry. To the rear of the altar there are now stained glass windows. To the side walls of the chancel are gas <b>lamps</b> on swivelling <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} a {{sentiment}} bordering on devotion that Harry passed the window. A semi-barbarous delight in form and colour had presided over the studied disorder of the room in which he found himself. It was filled with dainty stuffs, furs and rugs and scarves of brilliant hues, and set with elegant and curious trifles--fans on the mantelshelf, an antique <b>lamp</b> upon a <b>bracket,</b> and on the table a silver-mounted bowl of cocoa-nut about half full of unset jewels. The fair Cuban, herself a gem of colour and the fit masterpiece for that rich frame, motioned Harry to a seat, and, sinking herself into another, thus began her history.|$|R
60|$|At length, with a lamp in one hand, he {{mounted to}} his new apartment. It was large, low, and {{somewhat}} dark. The window looked upon the moat, and although it was so high up, it was heavily barred. The bed was luxurious, with one pillow of down and one of lavender, and a red coverlet worked in a pattern of roses. All about the walls were cupboards, locked and padlocked, and concealed from view by hangings of dark-coloured arras. Dick made the round, lifting the arras, sounding the panels, seeking vainly to open the cupboards. He assured himself that the door was strong and the bolt solid; then he set down his <b>lamp</b> upon a <b>bracket,</b> and once more looked all around.|$|R
50|$|When {{built in}} 1753, the {{interior}} {{had a single}} large open space, with the pulpit on the north wall. In 1802 galleries were added to either end, and pews were installed. The pulpit was also enlarged at this time, with stairs on either side. At a later date the space was again rearranged, and the pulpit, now reduced in size, is in the southeast corner. The current entrance was added in 1869, as was the social hall (extended to its present size {{just a few years}} later). The chandelier and four <b>bracket</b> <b>lamps</b> were added at this time, and were electrified in the 20th century. The 1870s also saw the construction of horse sheds, which were removed in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Since 1837, the {{building}} {{has served as the}} focal point for the decision making process in Salem. This two-story building was designed and constructed in the style of Greek Revival. The original dimensions were 32 feet high, 45 feet wide and 68 feet long. The side and rear elevations are unadorned brick while the main facade is dressed granite. Three bays wide, this facade is broken by four giant pilasters, one on each corner and one {{on either side of the}} recessed center bay. The bays are set with tall windows, 6 over 6. The central entrance is reached by a short flight of granite steps; a cast iron <b>lamp</b> on a <b>bracket</b> projects from above. The tall front double doors are made of mahogany with brass studs outlining the center panels.|$|R
6000|$|But when Uncle William makes {{speeches in}} the dining-room I {{think the whole}} room becomes {{transformed}} for him into the banquet room of a palace, and the cheap <b>bracket</b> <b>lamps</b> against the wall turn into a blaze of light and the boarders are all courtiers, and he {{becomes more and more}} grandiloquent. He waves his hand towards Uncle Henry and refers to him as [...] "my brother the Admiral," [...] and to me as [...] "the Princess at my side." [...] Some of the people, the meaner ones, begin to laugh and to whisper, and others look uncomfortable and sorry. And it is always on these occasions that Uncle William refers to himself as America's guest, and refers to the Americans as the hospitable nation who have taken him to their heart. I think that when Uncle says this he really believes it; Uncle can believe practically anything if he says it himself.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco-based American {{architect}} Arthur Brown, Jr. {{designed the}} auditorium {{as well as}} the two buildings adjacent to it. The architectural style of the building is Neoclassical, as are all the buildings in the Federal Triangle development. The portico of the Auditorium provides the motif for the both buildings which are on either side of it. Six Doric columns form the auditorium's portico. Over the portico is a pediment titled [...] "Columbia", by Edgar Walter. The sculpture on the pediment depicts Columbia (the feminine personification of the United States) seated on a throne-like chair, an eagle on her right, a nude youth on her left, and the rays of the sun spreading out behind her. Behind the portico, a second pediment sits over an archway which leads to the colonnade. This sculpture, by Edmond Romulus Amateis, depicts George Washington at the Battle of Trenton. The interior is in the Beaux Arts style. The interior lighting was designed by Brown, and consists of brass and aluminum chandeliers overhead and aluminum and gold leaf <b>bracket</b> <b>lamps</b> on the walls. The ceiling was originally painted blue.|$|R
6000|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the summer's day in which Austen had the conversation with his father just related, Pepper was trotting at a round clip through the soft and shady wood roads toward the town of Tunbridge; the word [...] "town" [...] being used in the New England sense, as a piece of territory about six miles by six. The fact that automobiles full of laughing people from Leith hummed by occasionally made no apparent difference to Pepper, who knew only the master hand on the reins; the reality that the wood roads were climbing great hills the horse did not seem to feel. Pepper knew every lane and by-path within twenty miles of Ripton, and exhibited such surprise as a well-bred horse may when he was slowed down at length and turned into a hard, blue-stone driveway under a strange granite arch with the word [...] "Fairview" [...] cut in Gothic letters above it, and two great <b>lamps</b> in wrought-iron <b>brackets</b> at the sides. It was Austen who made a note of the gratings over the drains, and of the acres of orderly forest in a mysterious and seemingly enchanted realm. Intimacy with domains was new to him, and he began to experience an involuntary feeling of restraint which was new to him likewise, and made him chafe in spite of himself. The estate seemed to be the visible semblance of a power which troubled him.|$|R
40|$|Landing on {{lighting}} columns like nature’s birds is {{a desirable}} capability {{which can only}} extend the uses of unmanned aerial systems. This thesis investigates what the most effective form of perching on existing street furniture with a VTOL UAV and how the perch site can be recognised using low cost off the shelf sensors. Additionally to this, the UAV in question will have to execute the perch without relying on GPS data. The work conducted here covers an extensive design review which selects a bird claw like gripper to sustain the perch. In order for the UAV to {{know where it is}} in relation to the perch site without relying on GPS data, a Raspberry Pi and PiCamera were used to detect common features which are found on top of a lighting column. Using a search and perch algorithm which was developed specifically for the task of perching on <b>lamp</b> post projection <b>brackets,</b> the on-board microprocessor controlled the UAV over the perch site and gradually descended into the perch position. The perched position and approach was also tested to ensure the perching element could cope with various weather conditions. The testing was conducted in a wind tunnel with the UAV mounted in various perched positions and the moment the UAV would slip, the wind speed were measured and analysed which highlighted an interesting prediction method. During the perching development the addition of a gantry style test-rig was also developed to ease the algorithm development with minimal incidents. The final result is a search and perch algorithm which is initiated when the VTOL UAV is within the vicinity of a lamp post at which point the on-board vision processing and control system takes over, removing the burden from the UAV operator to ensure a collision free perch...|$|R
40|$|The scene {{opens in}} the kitchen which is strewn with cooking utensils, {{indicating}} that grandma is busy preparing the Christmas pastry. Two bad boys of the red headed, freckled face type, enter. The mischievous expressions on their faces indicate that they have already planned a huge joke on grandma. One of the boys climbs to {{the kitchen table and}} takes down the old kitchen <b>bracket</b> <b>lamp,</b> which is equipped with a very large chimney, the other goes to the flour barrel and scoops out a quantity of flour, pouring it into the chimney of the lamp until it is filled to the top and packed down solidly. The lamp is then replaced in the bracket. Grandma, who is very near sighted enters, scratches a match, removes the lamp chimney for the purpose of lighting up for the evening, when a large quantity of flour falls upon her head, instantly changing her old gingham wrapper into a snow white frock and giving her a general ghost-like appearance. The flour sticks in her hair and fills her eyes, but this is where she turns the tables. Suspecting the bad boys, she immediately looks for them under the old kitchen table where she finds them, as they thought, safely hidden away and enjoying the joke. She grabs them by the heels, and throws them one after the other, head first into the flour barrel. She then sits them down upon the floor very forcibly with their faces toward the audience and they present a very ludicrous appearance in the mad scramble to remove the flour from their eyes and hair.

6000|$|His {{mother had}} told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the source, and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion. He had a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been left {{together}} in the drawing-room. Lord Warburton, who had ridden over from his own house, some ten miles distant, remounted and took his departure before dinner; and an hour after this meal was ended Mr. and Mrs. Touchett, who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their forms, withdrew, under the valid pretext of fatigue, to their respective apartments. The young man spent an hour with his cousin; though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent. She was really tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay for it on the morrow; but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down. A fine hypocrisy was for the present possible; she was interested; she was, as she said to herself, floated. She asked Ralph to show her the pictures; there were a great many in the house, most of them of his own choosing. The best were arranged in an oaken gallery, of charming proportions, which had a sitting-room at either end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted. The light was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage, and the visit might have stood over to the morrow. This suggestion Ralph had ventured to make; but Isabel looked disappointed--smiling still, however--and said: [...] "If you please I should like to see them just a little." [...] She was eager, she knew she was eager and now seemed so; she couldn't help it. [...] "She doesn't take suggestions," [...] Ralph said to himself; but he said it without irritation; her pressure amused and even pleased him. The <b>lamps</b> were on <b>brackets,</b> at intervals, and if the light was imperfect it was genial. It fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames; it made a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery. Ralph took a candlestick and moved about, pointing out the things he liked; Isabel, inclining to one picture after another, indulged in little exclamations and murmurs. She was evidently a judge; she had a natural taste; he was struck with that. She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there; she lifted it high, and as she did so he found himself pausing {{in the middle of the}} place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures than on her presence. He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering glances, for she was better worth looking at than most works of art. She was undeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when people had wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers they had always called her the willowy one. Her hair, which was dark even to blackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light grey eyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had an enchanting range of concession. They walked slowly up one side of the gallery and down the other, and then she said: [...] "Well, now I know more than I did when I began!" ...|$|R
