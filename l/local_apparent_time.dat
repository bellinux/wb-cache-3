50|$|A tall pole {{vertically}} {{fixed in}} the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local apparent noon, or 12:00 <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time.</b> About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly.|$|E

50|$|Local {{mean time}} {{is a form of}} solar time that corrects the {{variations}} of <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time,</b> forming a uniform time scale at a specific longitude. This measurement of time was used for everyday use during the 19th century before time zones were introduced beginning in the late 19th century; it still has some uses in astronomy and navigation.|$|E
50|$|Sidereal time, at {{any moment}} (and at a given {{locality}} defined by its geographical longitude), more precisely <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> sidereal <b>time</b> (LAST), {{is defined as the}} hour angle of the vernal equinox at that locality: it has the same value as the right ascension of any celestial body that is crossing the local meridian at that same moment.|$|R
50|$|Since the Earth rotates at {{a steady}} rate of 360° per day, or 15° per hour (in mean solar time), {{there is a direct}} {{relationship}} between time and longitude. If the navigator knew the time at a fixed reference point when some event occurred at the ship's location, the difference between the reference <b>time</b> and the <b>apparent</b> <b>local</b> <b>time</b> would give the ship's position relative to the fixed location. Finding <b>apparent</b> <b>local</b> <b>time</b> is relatively easy. The problem, ultimately, was how to determine the time at a distant reference point while on a ship.|$|R

50|$|Vertical declining dials are sundials that {{indicate}} <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time.</b> Vertical south dials are a special case: as are vertical north, vertical east and vertical west dials.

50|$|Observing the sun from earth, {{the solar}} hour angle is an {{expression}} of time, expressed in angular measurement, usually degrees, from solar noon. At solar noon the hour angle is 0.000 degree, with the time before solar noon expressed as negative degrees, and the local time after solar noon expressed as positive degrees.

The original drawing in brown ink with a grey wash is in the British Museum collection On top of an 8 ft high plinth, there is a 20 ft high Doric column. The sculpture that contains the six sundials and the pinnacle is 10 ft. This block is orientated {{so there are a}} direct south and direct north vertical dial, and four vertically declining dials. The monument was erected in 1694, but removed in 1773.The replica was commissioned in 1984 and erected in 1989 The dials were designed, carved and gilded by Caroline Webb, while the astronomer Gordon Taylor verified the maths. Each of the faces is accurate to within ten seconds. The dials give <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> solar <b>time,</b> so a correction must be made using the conversion graph displayed on the plinth to work out clock time. Seven dials is 0 °07' geographical degrees to the west of Greenwich — that is 3.048 seconds behind Greenwich mean time.|$|R

The equation of time is shown as a three rings, showing the words WATCH SLOWER,WATCH FASTER, the months and dates and the minutes of time of variance.|$|E
5000|$|The Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea {{was held}} in London in June 1917. The Conference {{established}} the nautical date line and adopted an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system for use at sea. It recommended that time changes required by changes of longitude be made in one-hour steps. This recommendation was adopted between 1920 and 1925 by all major fleets, including British, French and American. The rules applied to almost all naval ships and to many non-naval ships. Nevertheless, up to the Second World War, the old practice of keeping <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> prevailed on many independent merchant ships.|$|E

He related the trace of the sun to conic sections and the angle on the dial-plate to the hour angle and the calculation of <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time,</b> using conventional hours and the historic Italian and Babylonian hours.

40|$|The dynamic {{processes}} {{governing the}} acceleration {{and loss of}} electrons in the radiation zones are investigated. The radial diffusion coefficient was determined for a McIlwain parameter between 1. 6 and 2. 2 for electrons having a first adiabatic invariant of 12 MeV/gauss. The coefficient is larger than earlier values and suggests that there exists a lower limit to the fluxes in the inner zone. The agreement between observed and calculated magnetic fields and particle fluxes is improved by using solar wind pressure as input to the magnetic field models. Changes in the plasma pressure can cause <b>apparent</b> <b>local</b> <b>time</b> asymmetries in particle flux. A comparison of the magnetic field models with observed location of the trapping boundary also indicates the need for including distributed currents within the magnetosphere. The high latitude trapping boundary is only weakly dependent on A sub p, and the trapping boundary data are improved by including in the models a stand-off distance which varies with the plasma pressure...|$|R

50|$|The Carefree Sundial, in Carefree, Arizona, was {{designed}} by architect Joe Wong and solar engineer John I. Yellott (1908-1986), was erected in the Sundial Circle plaza in 1959. The sundial is made from a steel frame and covered in anodized copper. As originally designed the 1200mm wide gnomon acted as a heat collecting plate for a local heating scheme. It measures 90 ft in diameter. The metal gnomon, the shadow-casting portion of the dial, stands 35 ft above the plaza and extends 62 ft. <b>Local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> is 27.7 minutes behind the meridian time which here is Mountain Standard Time.

50|$|Even {{though many}} tried their hand at winning the main prize, for decades none {{was able to}} come up with a {{practical}} solution to the problem. The Board recognised that any serious attempt would be based on the recognition that the earth rotates through 15° of longitude every hour. The comparison of local time between a reference place (e.g., Greenwich) and the local time of the place in question would determine the longitude of that place. Since <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> could be determined with some ease, the problem centred on finding a means of determining (or in the case of chronometers, keeping) the time of the reference place when one is far away from it.|$|E
50|$|Local {{mean time}} was used {{from the early}} 19th century, when local solar time or sundial time was last used until {{standard}} time was adopted on various dates in the several countries. Each town or city kept its own meridian. This led to a situation where locations one degree of longitude apart had times four minutes apart. This became {{a problem in the}} mid 19th century when railways needed clocks that were synchronized between stations, {{at the same time as}} people needed to match their clock (or the church clock) to the time tables. Standard time means that the same time is used throughout some region—usually, it was either offset from Greenwich Mean Time or was the local mean time of the capital of the region. The difference between local mean time and <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> is the equation of time.|$|E

30|$|In {{the lower}} frame of Fig. 4 the GRIMM {{versions}} differ by the estimation window length in days (w = 99, 10, 20); the r 2 in the label indicates an additional data filtering applied to CHAMP data to reduce outliers. This filtering was removing data vectors with current data residuals after inversion larger then constant thresholds, {{which can be}} set in the configuration for each component and data type. The thresholds chosen are intended to remove apparent short periods of outlier bursts, probably created by suboptimal external field handling. In particular the shown Euler angle X reveals a possibly spurious strong local time dependency, which is common to all estimates. Deviations can result from compromises on complexity (i.e. in external field modeling), from {{the size of the}} local time window and from the size of the Euler angle temporal segments. The sensitivity of the DCO-based Euler angle determination to model details appears weak, but the sensitivity to sparseness of segment population and data quality is strong. This is particularly true when a model-angle co-estimation approach is used. As shown on the upper frame of Fig. 4, for the rotation along the X component, the rotations we obtain are generally in agreement with the available references: the <b>apparent</b> <b>local</b> <b>time</b> dependence, also present in the SCA reference series, is mostly reproduced.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1920, all ships kept solar time on {{the high}} seas by setting their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the sun crossed the ship's meridian. The <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> noon is 12 noon.|$|R
50|$|A fixed {{arithmetic}} {{rule for}} determining leap years was {{proposed in the}} name of the Committee of Public Education by Gilbert Romme on 19 Floréal An III (8 May 1795). The proposed rule was to determine leap years by applying the rules of the Gregorian calendar to the years of the French Republic (years IV, VIII, XII, etc. were to be leap years) except that year 4000 (the last year of ten 400-year periods) should be a common year instead of a leap year. Because he was shortly after sentenced to the guillotine, this proposal was never adopted and the original astronomical rule continued, which excluded any other fixed arithmetic rule. The proposal was intended to avoid uncertain future leap years caused by the inaccurate astronomical knowledge of the 1790s (even today, this statement is still valid due to the uncertainty in ΔT). In particular, the committee noted that the autumnal equinox of year 144 was predicted to occur at 11:59:40 pm <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> in Paris, which was closer to midnight than its inherent 3 to 4 minute uncertainty.|$|E

50|$|Sundial {{construction}} {{is based on}} understanding the geometry of the solar system, and particularly how the sun will cast a shadow onto a flat surface, {{in this case a}} horizontal surface. Each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before, and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial, particularly its latitude. The dial is designed to tell <b>local</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>time</b> so the longitude is not significant. By this we mean that noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky and due south, standard time would be when the sun was due south at another point such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Derby is at 1° 28′ 46.2″ West of Greenwich, so the sun is approximately 5 mins and 52.05 s later in reaching noon. The other point to consider when telling the time is that as the earth moves around the sun in a slight ellipse, day length varies slightly giving a cumulative difference from the average, of up to 16 minutes in November and February, this, with another correction, is known as the equation of time and was really irrelevant until people started comparing sundials with mechanical clocks, which must either ignore the consequences or be re balanced each day to make them correspond with the natural cycle. They measure average time or local mean time. Railways timetabling demanded a fixed noon and fixed day leading to the adoption of Greenwich Mean Time. The local Midland Railway had adopted Greenwich Mean Time by January 1848.|$|E
