The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> make out what they are talking about—everything seems so curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E

500|$|As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson {{introduced}} {{measures to}} increase {{funding for the}} National Institutes of Health and reorganized the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. His position attained a unique significance following the attacks of 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks. [...] He was responsible for national preparedness {{in the event of}} bioterrorism. [...] Though he wished to resign from the position in 2003, Bush asked that he stay on for the rest of Bush's first term. [...] Thompson announced his resignation at a press conference in December 2004 in which he surprisingly admitted, [...] "I, for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply." [...] He officially left the position in January 2005 and began work in the private sector.|$|E
500|$|In a {{press conference}} on 17 December, Gittins criticized the USN for their {{continued}} insistence that Waddle not come to Japan to visit the victims' families. [...] Said Gittins, [...] "For the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> I cannot understand why the Navy did not want Scott to come meet with the families and do what is morally right and what is understood in Japanese culture {{to be the right}} thing to do." [...] Gittins added that he had received emails from the USN as recently as the week before urging Waddle not to make the trip. [...] Gittins stated that the reason that it took two years for Waddle to make the trip to Japan was because Waddle was forbidden to do so while he was still in the USN and because of financial constraints and fear of litigation after his retirement.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album. BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "I'm sure there's a punkrock reason why we should all get together and hate it, but for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> I just can't. Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics, this is a corker." [...] McAlpine praised the [...] "grand" [...] chorus and wrote: [...] "Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rocks wholesome Disneyfication of popular song might be something a little more confessional." ...|$|E

500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine piece was considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked questions about the bill's provisions, {{though he did not}} object to its passage. When the Alabama bill came to the floor, Vestal yielded time for a statement in favor from Rainey, which began with a brief explanation of the bill followed by a much longer paean to the glorious history of his home state, and his conclusion drew applause. Gard then questioned Vestal, and learned that another coin, the Pilgrim one, was next on the House's agenda. [...] Gard expressed his concerns about commemorative coins, [...] "but for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> I can not see what advantage there is for a State celebration to gather up a lot of coins with a particular stamp on them. It seems to me rather to cheapen the national coin. because it looks like an old-fashioned medal at a county ...|$|E

It’s a symptom of some kind of broader social resistance to this message. People, they don’t want to hear it.

For Sparks, {{there should}} be an [...] "element that [...] the characters apart in order to have drama". Throughout Sparks' career, he has attempted to not use the same element twice, so it had become harder for him to write each new novel. He comments, [...] "If I don't have the 'conflict', I don't have the story, and for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> I couldn't come up with something new to keep the characters apart.... I also wanted to write a story using older characters, again because it's something I haven't done (with the exception of The Notebook, in which they're elderly, not middle-aged)." ...|$|E

[...] He was allowed to represent clients in local Portland courts before passing the bar examination, and was assigned as the public defender {{in a few cases}} in 1903. [...] Like the Twin Cities, Portland's black community was small when Stewart permanently settled there in 1904. [...] Most African Americans were service workers or unskilled, menial laborers, though there were some black-owned businesses. Stewart's father was disappointed in his son's decision to move to Portland, noting [...] "But for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> I can't see why you are 'using up' your life where you are", suggesting his son try moving abroad like he had.

2500|$|An {{interview}} that Wilbur Chamberlin of the New York Sun conducted with Ament elevated the indulgences issue into a cause célèbre. Chamberlin had first met Ament in Beijing on 14 October 1900. In {{a letter to}} his wife, Chamberlin indicated: The Rev. A. is a missionary, and he appears {{to be a very good}} sort of a fellow, but I cannot for the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> approve of his methods....You see, when the soldiers came to Peking and these missionaries were safe, some of them began at once to clamor for damages that they said they had sustained. The first thing that they did was to get for living places the palaces of the rich Chinese Princes, and when they had them they started in clearing them out. They took everything of value and sold it for a song. Then they let their native Christians go out hunting and stealing more loot, and then they sold that. They said it was no sin and eased their consciences by saying they had the right to reimburse themselves for the losses they sustained. It was just as if a man had stolen something from me, and, to get square, I went and stole something from him. In other words, two wrongs make a right. That may be all right, but I don't think so. At A.'s home, which was the palace of Prince Pei, a Manchu, before the trouble, I met a lot more missionaries." ...|$|E
