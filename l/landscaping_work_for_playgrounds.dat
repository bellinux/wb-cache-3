Eaton was an early champion of planting trees with strong vertical lines like palms and cypresses to complement the dominant horizontal lines of sky, water, and shore along the California coast. Gustav Stickley, one of the American Arts and Crafts movement's most celebrated designers, praised Eaton's <b>landscape</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> its revolt [...] "against the formality, the severe training and repression of Nature which constitute the first principles of the French and Italian systems of landscape gardening".|$|R

50|$|Heade's primary {{interest}} in <b>landscape,</b> and the <b>works</b> <b>for</b> {{which he is}} perhaps best known today, was the New England coastal salt marsh. Contrary to typical Hudson River School displays of scenic mountains, valleys, and waterfalls, Heade's marsh landscapes avoided depictions of grandeur. They focused instead on the horizontal expanse of subdued scenery, and employed repeating motifs that included small haystacks and diminutive figures. Heade also concentrated on the depiction of light and atmosphere in his marsh scenes. These and similar works have led some historians to characterize Heade as a Luminist painter. In 1883 Heade moved to Saint Augustine, Florida and took as his primary landscape subject the surrounding subtropical marshland.|$|R
