There were however many Christian Poles risking death to hide Jewish families and assist the persecuted Jews on compassionate grounds. The number of Jews hiding with the Catholics quoted by Żarski-Zajdler was around 450,000. Possibly a million gentile Poles aided their Jewish neighbors. Some estimates go as high as three million helpers, wrote Richard C. Lukas. Because of the border changes imposed by the USSR, exact numbers of surviving Polish Jews have been difficult to ascertain. According to official statistics from January 1946, about 81,500 survivors of the Holocaust have registered with the Central Committee of Polish Jews; their numbers had risen to about 205,000–210,000 within half a year (see below), including 180,000 Jews who arrived from the Soviet or Soviet-controlled territories after the repatriation agreement.

In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit valuation adjustment) and DVA (debt valuation adjustment). Counterparty risk mitigants include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during <b>liquidation</b> <b>periods.</b> The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral posted as initial margin is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|R

The model {{in this article}} shows the pattern of stochastic price-dependent demand. The uncertainty of demand is decided {{on the basis of}} quantity of stock and selling price. Commonly, random demand is defined as D([...] p,ε) = d([...] p [...]) + ε in the additive case and D(p,ε [...]) = d(p) ·ε in the multiplicative case, wherein d(p) is deterministic decreasing function that captures dependency between demand and price and ε is a random variable defined on finite range. The shape of demand curve is deterministic and price related. Numerous researchers, such as Federgruen and Heching (1999), presented a combined pricing and inventory control model under uncertainty. Then, Petruzzi and Dada (1999) presented a pricing and newsvendor problem. Chen and Simchi-Levi (2004) investigated a pricing strategy and inventory control with random demand. Zhang et al. (2008) investigated the optimal decision on price, promotion and inventory control subject to stochastic demand. Pang (2011) presented that optimize the price and inventory control with stock deterioration and partial backordering. Chao et al.

40|$|During {{the turmoil}} in {{financial}} markets in late 1998, financial institutions attempting to liquidate positions to meet capital requirements may have faced unexpectedly high bid-ask spreads.

40|$|How {{should an}} {{investor}} unwind a portfolio {{in the face}} of recurring and uncertain liquidity needs? We propose a model of portfolio <b>liquidation</b> in two <b>periods</b> to investigate this question, initially posed by Myron Scholes following the fall of Long Term Capital Management. We show that when the expectation of future liquidity needs is low, the optimal solution involves selling assets that have low permanent and temporary price impacts of trading. However, when there is a high probability of a large future liquidity need, the optimal solution involves retaining assets that have a small temporary impact of trading. In the face of potential future adversity, there is a high option-value to the temporary component of liquidity. The permanent component of liquidity does not share this feature, so that investors will prefer to sell assets with a low ratio of permanent to temporary price impact {{in the early stages of}} a crisis, and to hold on to assets with a high ratio of permanent to temporary price impact to protect themselves against an aggravation of the crisis. ...|$|R

The exit decision of newly founded firms is discussed {{in the context of the}} self-selection mechanism among entrepreneurs and the coexistent external selection mechanism implemented by the insolvency law. The estimation of semi-parametric competing risk models is based on panel data samples for the period from 1990 to 1997, which were drawn from a credit rating database. The samples cover together about 20, 000 firm foundations between 1990 and 1994 in all East and West German regions and in all industries in the manufacturing, construction, trade and service sectors. The type-specific baseline hazard function estimates indicate that selection via bankruptcy liquidation starts as the first wave of voluntary liquidations already tapers off. Selection among firms founded during the period of economic transition in East Germany is delayed compared to the selection in West Germany. Further empirical results support the claimed relevance of owner-specific liquidation thresholds in addition to venture return-driven effects and the expected impacts of the German insolvency law on liquidation decisions. ...|$|R

A potential strategy that a financial institution may adopt to address this problem is to sell illiquid assets first while keeping a “cushion” of cash and liquid assets for a “rainy day. ” Our analysis demonstrates that, although such a strategy increases expected transaction costs, it may significantly decrease tail losses and the probability of insolvency.

Financial institutions that need to liquidate positions under such stress to meet capital requirements may, there-fore, face unexpectedly high bid–ask spreads, trig-gering additional losses in the form of transaction costs. The result may be a vicious circle of sales, which cause illiquidity losses, which necessitate further sales, and so on.

40|$|Degree Name: Doctor of Natural Resource Management In 1996, the Western Australian Government {{decided to}} {{progressively}} liquidate 21, 000 hectares of Pinus pinaster Aiton plantations located 20 kilometres north of Perth on the Gnangara Water Mound. The {{decision was made}} {{for a number of}} reasons but one of the principal concerns was the conflict between water use and timber production. The decision to liquidate the plantation over a prescribed period while meeting a legal requirement to produce timber for a laminated veneer lumber plant provided the opportunity to integrate the large database on plantation growth and water recharge and use operational research models to determine the optimum liquidation scenario. Pinus pinaster Aiton growth on the Gnangara Water Mound on sites with shallow water tables was found to be less than on sites with deep water tables. This indicates that the trees on these shallow sites, with depths to water table of five to ten metres, are not accessing the water table. Consequently, it is concluded that it is the volume of the water in the unsaturated zone, beneath the trees that is the factor limiting growth not the depth of the water table. Leaf area index (LAI) can be derived from satellite photography except in stands with very open canopies. The relationship between LAI and the extent to which groundwater is recharged is critical. The relationship between Leaf Area Index and Basal Area was not linear as has been assumed in previous recharge models but there was a strong relationship between tree growth and Leaf Area Index. LAI is subject to a number of influences which include amongst other species, age and stand density. Site maximum LAI for Pinus pinaster Aiton was 3. 3 on the Gnangara Mound. Leaf Area Index regrowth for Pinus pinaster Aiton on the Gnangara Mound after thinning for a whole stand could be explained by: LAI regrowth = z 0 + a(SPH) + b(AGE) + c(SPH*SPH) + d(AGE*AGE) (where SPH is stems per hectare and AGE is time since planting). The LAI growth curve of unthinned young (old) stands was sigmoidal and explained by LAI = 3 /(1 - 81 ^((3. 5 + 12 / 2 -year) / 12)). This pattern is probably caused by increasing reductions of water availability. Because of this LAI pattern for young stands (old) it was hypothesized that the water recharge /age relationship for these stands is a negative sigmoid. That is it inversely mirrors the growth rates of LAI. Consequently the proportion of total rainfall used by plantations would increase with increasing LAI until it reaches the site maximum LAI and then plateaus. Combining the recharge relationship with LAI growth for the same ages of young stands (below 20 years of age) results in a negative linear relationship where percentage recharge = - 15 *LAI + 45. This differs for the LAI to recharge relationship used in PRAMS(Perth Regional Aquifer Model) which proposes that above LAI 1. 5 there is a complete extinguishment of recharge. The hypothesised negative linear relationship of LAI to water recharge is more readily able to explain the LAI to age pattern for young stands(old) whereas a full extinguishment at LAI 1. 5 is not able to explain the ongoing LAI growth to 3. 3. It is not conceivable that a plant would double its transpiration and rainfall interception area if it has already reached the limitation of full site water usage as proposed in PRAMS. There will always be some uncertainty in the LAI to water recharge relationship because it is impossible to measure directly. Sensitivity analysis was used to accommodate any departure from the actual relationship. LAI does have a strong inverse relation to water recharge. Consequently, LAI minimization within a model would have the same effect as maximizing the water recharge. A Gnangara Mound Model was developed to provide a high level decision support tool that could effectively evaluate the relationship between water recharge and timber production. The model required a number of scenarios to test sensitivity to growth rates, recovery percentage of Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) from gross volumes, increasing volume requirements and shorter <b>liquidation</b> <b>periods.</b> Changing the objective to one of minimizing LAI (equivalent to maximizing ground water recharge) was tested to determine if it would give a significantly different result to that obtained with a maximize volume objective. The effect of a number of harvesting regimes and other management options on the change in average per annum water recharge derived from the Gnangara Mound Model are listed below:- • Increasing the frequency of prescribed burning native vegetation, increased recharge by 33. 5 GL/yr. • A reduction of private and public abstraction from 370 to 304 GL/yr, increased recharge by 66 GL/yr. • Harvesting regime for Sustainable timber volume supply to 2026, increased recharge by 45. 5 to 55 GL/yr. • Harvesting regime for Minimize LAI with 100000 m 3 minimum annual timber volume until 2026, increased recharge by 47. 6 to 58. 2 GL/yr. • Harvesting regime for Sustainable timber volume supply to 2016, increased recharge by 50. 5 to 62 GL/yr. An equal area of Banksia, at LAI 1, to the pine plantations would recharge annually 39. 4 to 36. 2 GL. A continuing lower rainfall of 100 mm less than long term average would mean a reduction of recharge annually of 107 GL to that achieved prior to 1970. Within the constraints of the State Agreement Act a small increase in water recharge could be achieved by using a harvesting schedule with an objective that minimizes LAI provided the volumes from 2008 to 2026 are no lower than 117000 m 3 per annum. It is also possible to combine this scenario with maximizing the liquidation of Gnangara plantation rather than the Pinjar and Yanchep plantations within the next 5 years. The combination of these two scenarios would result in the best water outcome (3. 2 GL per annum) within the timber production constraints of achieving a minimum of 117000 m 3 per annum. Early liquidation of the plantation will increase the water recharge but the water outcomes are small (5 - 7 GL per annum) in comparison to the timber volume loss and potentially could result in significant costs. Far greater savings could be achieved at a lower cost by using other management strategies such as reduction in Banksia water use through prescribed burning or less water extraction for private use. Small gains in water production would be lost by only a small reduction in annual rainfall due to continuing climate variability...|$|R
