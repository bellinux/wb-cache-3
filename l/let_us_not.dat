5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not</b> forget the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E

He {{is complete}} as a wax figure, with long brown eyelashes and a clean-cut face. He affects no idiosyncrasies of manners or dress. One cannot question his earnestness and seriousness or sincerity. He is, perhaps, the most articulate of them all. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not</b> call him prim.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not</b> make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|A second crisis arose on 30 July 1832. A {{constitutional}} amendment effecting greater reforms was voted on and approved in the Chamber of Deputies, but still faced major {{opposition in the}} Senate. Diogo Antônio Feijó and Aureliano Coutinho, both Moderates, planned a coup d'état. Feijó would assume dictatorial powers and immediately enact the {{constitutional amendment}}, thus bypassing the Senate entirely. Honório Hermeto called on his fellow deputies to uphold the Constitution: [...] "We need not hurt the legal order and [...] principles: we can make fair laws ... and in the respected Constitution we have safe and legal ways of giving the nation what it wants... <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not</b> violate it , as it is our only safeguard."

Against, as it were, the ferocious legions of the barbarians, which in their troops never cease to batter the tortoise of the soldiers of Christ with the artillery of guileful fraud, the struggle must go on manfully, fought with the darts of spiritual weaponry and the iron-tipped spears of the virtues. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not,</b> like timid soldiers who effeminately dread the shock {{of war and the}} call of the trumpeter, inertly offer to the ravening foe the backs of our shoulders rather than the bosses of our shields! ...|$|E
500|$|In 1918, while {{teaching}} in Geneva, Szigeti met {{and fell in}} love with Wanda Ostrowska. She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not,</b> if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions.

40|$|User {{feedback}} {{has proven}} very successful to query large multimedia databases. Due {{to the nature}} of the data representation and the mismatch between mathematical models and human perception, the query techniques benefit substantially from interactively modifying a query. Typical examples are generalized ellipsoid queries where optimal ratios and orientations of the half-axes are determined by relevance feedback. However, no information about the outcome of a feedback process is stored whatsoever once the process is terminated. Accordingly, the entire feedback loop has to be repeated [...] -starting out with default parameters [...] -if the same query is posed again. In this paper we present preliminary results on how to preserve feedback results in a space efficient way and learn from user feedback.
