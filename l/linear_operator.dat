5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint <b>linear</b> <b>operator</b> acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} for a <b>linear</b> <b>operator</b> on a Hilbert space to be self-adjoint {{is stronger than}} to be symmetric.

25|$|Polynomials are {{frequently}} used to encode information {{about some other}} object.

25|$|The Kalman {{filters are}} based on linear {{dynamical}} systems discretized in the time domain. They are modelled on a Markov chain built on linear operators perturbed by errors that may include Gaussian noise. The state {{of the system is}} represented as a vector of real numbers. At each discrete time increment, a <b>linear</b> <b>operator</b> is applied to the state to generate the new state, with some noise mixed in, and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known. Then, another <b>linear</b> <b>operator</b> mixed with more noise generates the observed outputs from the true ("hidden") state. The Kalman filter may be regarded as analogous to the hidden Markov model, with the key difference that the hidden state variables take values in a continuous space (as opposed to a discrete state space as in the hidden Markov model). There is a strong duality between the equations of the Kalman Filter and those of the hidden Markov model. A review of this and other models is given in Roweis and Ghahramani (1999), and Hamilton (1994), Chapter 13.|$|E
