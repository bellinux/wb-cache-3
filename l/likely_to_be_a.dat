5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers it more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E
5|$|Belief in the {{existence}} of water bulls persisted in Scotland until at least {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, descriptions are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. It differs from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> resident of marshland.|$|E

5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> threat, as demonstrated by the attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation from the Neolithic period in Cheddar. Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found. There is some evidence of a Bronze Age field system at the Batts Combe quarry site. There is also evidence of Bronze Age barrows at the mound in the Longwood valley, which if man-made it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> field system. The remains of a Roman villa have been excavated in {{the grounds of the}} current vicarage.|$|E

Tono reveals {{that after he}} {{graduated}} from elementary school in Bandung, where he studied with Yah, he attended medical school in Surabaya and married Tini for her beauty. Meanwhile, Yah was forced to marry an older man and move to Palembang. After deciding that life as a wife was not for her, she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute, before serving as a Dutchman's mistress for three years. Tono falls further in love with Yah, as he feels that she is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> proper wife for him; Yah, however, does not consider herself ready for marriage.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, {{it is not clear whether}} mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E

5|$|Records {{state that}} plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept {{up over the}} summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{considerable}} underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate {{and many of the}} poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|Roman remains, {{possibly}} a signal station or watchtower, {{have been identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II. A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Celtic head from the Romano-British era, but may be from the Iron Age. In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been shards of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying {{the presence of a}} heating system and {{possibly a}} bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.|$|E
5|$|The Ioviani and Herculiani legions and equites Dalmatae are not {{mentioned}} by the sources as under Julian, but {{as part of}} the Gaul comitatus of usurper Magnentius. They are likely to have been inherited by Julian. If all these units were present at Strasbourg, the infantry total is 1,500 short, or 3,500 if Severus commanded an extra 2,000 men. Probably the names of a number of auxilia regiments (and possibly a legion) are missing in our sources. If so, {{at least one of these}} units is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sagittarii (archer) unit, as a comitatus would be incomplete without archer capacity. Overall, the most likely scenario is that Julian's force at Strasbourg consisted of 5-6 legiones and 10-14 auxilia of infantry and 6 vexillationes of cavalry.|$|E
