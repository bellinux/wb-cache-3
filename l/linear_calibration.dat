40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of pooled dietary intake data in multicenter and multiethnic studies is often hampered {{by lack of}} comparability due to application of different food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). To remove this deficiency, dietary intake measurements should be standardized. This paper presents a standardization procedure based on nonlinear calibration, which aims to approximate the usual intake distribution estimated by reference measurements. The method can be applied in studies with repeated standardized reference measurements that can refer to time periods {{different from that of}} the FFQ. It was developed especially for short-term reference assessment methods, such as 24 -hour recalls, diet records, and biomarkers. Similar to <b>linear</b> <b>calibration,</b> the proposed method does not change the rankings of subjects in each center or group; therefore, it maintains the within-center validity of the FFQ data. In contrast to <b>linear</b> <b>calibration,</b> the mixture of nonlinearly calibrated intake measurements from different centers or groups corresponds to the mixture of usual intake expected from the reference measurements.

40|$|RATIONALE: We {{describe}} an analytical procedure that allows sample collection and measurement of carbon isotopic composition (δ 13 CV-PDB value) and {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} concentration, [DIC], in aqueous samples without further manipulation post field collection. By comparing outputs from two different mass spectrometers, we quantify with the statistical rigour uncertainty associated with the estimation of an unknown measurement. This is rarely undertaken, but it is needed to understand the significance of field data and to interpret quality assurance exercises. METHODS: Immediate acidification of field samples during collection in evacuated, pre-acidified vials removed the need for toxic chemicals to inhibit continued bacterial activity that might compromise isotopic and concentration measurements. Aqueous standards mimicked the sample matrix and avoided headspace fractionation corrections. Samples were analysed using continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, but for low DIC concentration the mass spectrometer response could be non-linear. This had to be corrected for. RESULTS: Mass spectrometer non-linearity exists.

Methods:Between 1995 and 1999, 1072 study subjects (59 % women) from 12 EPIC centres volunteered to collect 24 -h urine samples. Log-transformed questionnaire, 24 -HDR and urinary measurements of nitrogen and potassium intakes were analysed in a multivariate measurement error model to estimate the validity of coefficients and error correlations in self-reported dietary measurements. In parallel, correlations between means of 24 -HDR and urinary measurements were computed. <b>Linear</b> regression <b>calibration</b> models were used to estimate the regression dilution (attenuation) factors. Results:After adjustment for sex, centre, age, body mass index and height, the validity coefficients for 24 -HDRs were 0. 285 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 194, 0. 367) and 0. 371 (0. 291, 0. 446) for nitrogen and potassium intakes, respectively. The attenuation factors estimated in a <b>linear</b> regression <b>calibration</b> model were 0. 368 (0. 228, 0. 508) for nitrogen and 0. 500 (0. 361, 0. 639) for potassium intakes; only the former {{was different from the}} estimate obtained using urinary measurements in the measurement error model.
