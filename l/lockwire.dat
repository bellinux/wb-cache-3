50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: lock washers, jam nuts, specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or <b>lockwire</b> {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|E
50|$|Turnbuckles {{have been}} used in {{aircraft}} construction. Historically, biplanes might use turnbuckles to adjust the tension on structural wires bracing their wings. Turnbuckles are also widely used on flexible cables in flight control systems. In both cases they are secured with <b>lockwire</b> or specifically designed wire clips to prevent them from turning and losing tension due to vibration.|$|E
50|$|Starting with Ranger battalions, the U.S. Army began {{adopting}} and modifying M240 variants {{to replace}} their remaining M60s {{in the early}} 1990s. The M240 is several pounds heavier than the M60, and has a longer barrel and overall length, {{but it is more}} reliable in use and testing. However, the M60 uses a much simpler gas system that is easier to clean when care is taken during reassembly. This advantage is obviated since the gas tube is wired shut with <b>lockwire</b> to prevent the weapon from disassembling itself from vibration in hard use.|$|E
40|$|Bergen Cable Technology (BCT) has {{introduced}} a new product they refer to as 'safety cable'. This product is intended {{as a replacement for}} <b>lockwire</b> when installed per Aerospace Standard (AS) 4536 (included in Appendix D of this document). Installation of safety cable is reportedly faster and more uniform than <b>lockwire.</b> NASA/GSFC proposes to use this safety cable in Shuttle Small Payloads Project (SSPP) applications on upcoming Shuttle missions. To assure that BCT safety cable will provide positive locking of fasteners equivalent to <b>lockwire,</b> the SSPP will conduct vibration and pull tests of the safety cable...|$|E
