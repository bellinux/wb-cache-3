40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a strategy for}} a robotic hand to pick up deformable 3 D objects from a table. Inspired by the human hand behavior, the robotic hand employs two rigid fingers to first squeeze a soft object until it “feels ” the object to be liftable. Such “feeling ” is provided by a (virtual) <b>liftability</b> test that is repeatedly conducted during the squeeze. Passing of the test then triggers a lifting action. Throughout the manipulation the object’s deformation and its state of contact with the fingers and the table are being tracked based on contact events. Deformable modeling uses the finite element method (FEM) while slip computation employs the homotopy continuation method, based on the contact displacements induced by finger movements. Experiment was conducted over daily items ranging from vegetables to a toy. A simulation-based comparison between deformable grasping and rigid body grasping reveals why soft objects are easier to pick up than hard ones, and demonstrates how a grasping strategy for rigid objects could fail on soft objects in certain situations.

40|$|An {{enveloping}} grasp is one {{for which}} the fingers surround the object and hold it securely against the palm. It {{is the kind of}} grasp that we use to hold the steering wheel of our car or to hold a wet ice cube. In the case of the ice cube and other slippery objects, we must use an enveloping grasp, because friction forces are small. ^ In this dissertation we are particularly interested in achieving an enveloping grasp of an object by manipulating it away from its supporting surface with an articulated hand. To solve the problem, we make several extensions to the firmly established kinematic equations of grasping and develop a linear program to predict the instantaneous motion of a slippery object during its manipulation. ^ We define the <b>liftability</b> regions for any two-dimensional object and develop a graphical method to determine them. The <b>liftability</b> regions are used to select the initial grasp of the object. Then lift planning strategies determine how to manipulate the object from its initial position into an enveloping grasp in the hand. After achieving envelopment, the grasp is adjusted, maintaining its enveloping character while optimizing an appropriate objective function. These three planning steps, initial grasp selection, lift planning, and grip adjustment are used to determine a grasping plan. ^ The motion linear program is used as the basis of a simulator which solves the equations of motion of the manipulated object. Given a grasp plan, the simulator is used to verify its validity. ...|$|E

40|$|Dexterous {{manipulation}} {{refers to}} the skillful execution of object reorienting and repositioning maneuvers, especially when performed within the grasp of an articulated mechani-cal hand. In this paper we study the problem of gaining a secure and enveloping grasp of a two-dimensional object by exploiting sliding at the contacts between the object and the hand. This is done in two steps:first, choosing an initial grasp with which the object can be manipulated away from the support, and second, continuously altering the grasp so that envelopment is achieved. The plans generated by our technique could be executed with only position control. How-ever, it would be prudent to incorporate contact force sensing to prevent damage during unexpected events.

In particular we show that any finite harmonic morphism of (non-augmented) metric graphs lifts. We also give various applications of these results.

40|$|We study central {{extensions}} E {{of elementary}} abelian 2 -groups by elementary abelian 2 -groups. Associated {{to such an}} extension is a quadratic map which determines the extension uniquely. The components of the map determine a quadratic ideal in a polynomial algebra and we say that the extension is Bockstein closed if this ideal is invariant under the Bockstein operator. We find a direct condition on the quadratic map that characterizes when the extension is Bockstein closed. Using this we show for example that quadratic maps induced from the fundamental quadratic map on gl_n, Q(A) =A+A^ 2 yield Bockstein closed extensions. We also show that this condition is equivalent to a certain <b>liftability</b> of the extension and under certain conditions, {{to the fact that}} Q corresponds to a 2 -power map of a restricted 2 -Lie algebra.

We also describe some ergodic properties of equilibrium measures including decay of correlations and the central limit theorem.

40|$|AbstractLet G be {{a finite}} group and let k be a field. We {{say that a}} kG-module V has a {{quadratic}} geometry or is of quadratic type if there exists a non-degenerate (equivalently non-singular) G-invariant quadratic form on V. If V is irreducible or projective indecomposable and k of odd characteristic, {{the existence of a}} quadratic geometry can be read off from invariants of representation theory. In terms of the group algebra the existence of such a geometry is characterized by the existence of an idempotent e which corresponds to V and is invariant under the antiautomorphism on kG given by g → ĝ = g− 1 for g ∈ G. In characteristic two the problem is more delicate. For an irreducible module the existence of a quadratic geometry is partly a question in cohomology. Unfortunately, a satisfactory answer {{does not seem to be}} known. However, if V is projective, <b>liftability</b> of the module to characteristic zero may help to find the geometry more easily.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The goal of {{this short}} paper is to give a {{slightly}} different perspective on the comparison between crystalline cohomology and de Rham cohomology. Most notably, we reprove Berthelot’s comparison result without using pd-stratifications, linearisations, and pd-differential operators. Crystalline cohomology is a p-adic cohomology theory for varieties in characteristic p created by Berthelot [Ber 74]. It was designed {{to fill the gap}} at p left by the discovery [SGA 73] of ℓ-adic cohomology for ℓ ̸ = p. The construction of crystalline cohomology relies on the crystalline site, which is a better behaved positive characteristic analogue of Grothendieck’s infinitesimal site [Gro 68]. The motivation comes from Grothendieck’s theorem [Gro 66] identifying infinitesimal cohomology of a complex algebraic variety with its singular cohomology (with C-coefficients); in particular, infinitesimal cohomology gives a purely algebraic definition of the “true ” cohomology groups for complex algebraic varieties. In fact, the fundamental structural result of Berthelot [Ber 74, Theorem V. 2. 3. 2] is a direct p-adic analogue of this reconstruction result: the crystalline cohomology of a smooth variety X over Z/p is canonically identified with the de Rham cohomology of a lift of X to Zp, provided one exists. In particular, crystalline cohomology produces the “correct ” Betti numbers, at least for liftable smooth projective varieties (and, in fact, even without <b>liftability</b> by [KM 74]). We defer to [Ill 94] for a detailed introduction, and connections with p-adic Hodge theory. Our goal in this note is to give a different perspective on the relationship between de Rham and crystalline cohomology...|$|E
40|$|Some recent {{research}} on the tensor products of operator systems and ensuing nuclearity properties in this setting raised many stability problems. In this paper we examine the preservation of these nuclearity properties including exactness, local <b>liftability</b> and the double commutant expectation property under basic algebraic operations such as quotient, duality, coproducts and tensor products. We show that, in the finite dimensional case, exactness and lifting property are dual pairs, that is, an operator system $S$ is exact {{if and only if}} the dual operator system $S^d$ has the lifting property. Moreover, the lifting property is preserved under quotients by null subspaces. Again in the finite dimensional case we prove that every operator system has the k-lifting property in the sense that whenever $f:S -> A/I$ is a unital and completely positive map, where A is a C*-algebra and I is an ideal, then $f$ possess a unital k-positive lift on A, for every k. This property provides a novel proof of a classical result of Smith and Ward on the preservation of matricial numerical ranges of an operator. The Kirchberg conjecture naturally falls into this context. We show that the Kirchberg conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the five dimensional universal operator system generated by two contraction ($S_ 2 $) has the double commutant expectation property. In addition to this we give several equivalent statements to this conjecture regarding the preservation of various nuclearity properties under basic algebraic operations. We show that the Smith Ward problem is equivalent to the statement that every three dimensional operator system has the lifting property (or exactness). If we suppose that both the Kirchberg conjecture and the Smith Ward problem have an affirmative answer then this implies that every three dimensional operator system is C*-nuclear...|$|E
