5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain {{was in the}} House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 27(f), respondent-appellee Commander S.L. Wright respectfully moves this Court to remand {{this case}} to the {{district}} court with instructions to dismiss it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Respondent-appellee has conferred with counsel for petitioner-appellant, and they agree with the briefing schedule proposed below. As explained below, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366 (see Attachment1), which took effect on October 17, 2006, removes federal court jurisdiction over pending and future habeas corpus actions and any other actions filed by or on behalf of detained aliens determined by the United States to be enemy combatants, such as petitioner-appellant al- Marri, except as provided in Section1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). In plain terms, the MCA removes this Court's jurisdiction (as well as the district court's) over al-Marri's habeas action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this appeal for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and remand {{the case to the}} district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E

The initial suit was dismissed due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the court, and not {{the substance of the}} case, which was never tried. The case is currently being considered at the New York State Court.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a {{succession}} of set-backs and defeats in the courts. In October 1927, a class action suit, James Deere v. St. Lawrence River Power, filed in 1925 in United States District Court for the Northern District of New York {{on behalf of the}} Six Nations to eject a subsidiary of Alcoa Aluminum and other occupants from a small parcel of land, was dismissed for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Kellog lost a suit for control of Onondaga Nation tribal funds in 1927.

25|$|On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States {{issued its}} {{decision}} on the appeal in the case Hollingsworth v. Perry, ruling that proponents of initiatives such as Proposition 8 did not possess legal standing {{in their own right}} to defend the resulting law in federal court, either to the Supreme Court or (previously) to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Therefore, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The decision left the district court's 2010 ruling intact. On June 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit, on remand, dismissed the appeal for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and dissolved their previous stay of the district court's ruling, enabling Governor Jerry Brown to order same-sex marriages to resume.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California {{ruled that}} Proposition 8, passed {{two years earlier}} by a {{majority}} of voters, was unconstitutional. As in Judge Baitaillon's decision about the Nebraska law, Judge Vaughn Walker stated in his ruling that moral opposition to same-sex marriage is not sufficient reason to make a law valid. Judge Walker ruled the law violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, as well as the Due Process clause. The proponents of Proposition 8 appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the lower court's decision on February 7, 2012. On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court, vacated the Ninth Circuit's ruling for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Two days later the Ninth Circuit dissolved its stay of the district court's ruling, allowing same sex marriage to resume in California. In 2015 the Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges that the government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriage.|$|E

25|$|On 19 July, the Administrative Judiciary Court of the State Council put on {{hold all}} appeals against the {{formulation}} of the Constituent Assembly, tasked with drafting a new constitution, until the court decides on 30 July 2012 on suits calling {{for a change of}} the judge presiding over the case. The court was also looking at a case filed against the supplementary constitutional decree released by the Supreme Council of Armed Forces days before President Mohamed Morsi's inauguration, and another against the president's decision to bring back the People's Assembly, parliament's lower house that SCAF dissolved after the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled the parliamentary elections law unconstitutional. The court ruled <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> on both cases and referred the latter back to the Supreme Constitutional Court. Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi ordered to release 572 people detained by the Egyptian military in the 2011 protests, and reduced the sentence of 16 others from life sentence to seven years in jail.|$|E

500|$|At this point, Grandin moved for a {{judgment}} of acquittal for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Because the incident {{took place between}} Norwalk and Hell Gate, Grandin argued that venue was improper in the District of New Jersey, {{as opposed to the}} Southern District of New York or District of Connecticut. Grandin also argued that the Long Island Sound was not on the [...] "high seas" [...] and thus that the indictment was defective. In rebuttal, Dutcher cited authorities that the Sound was [...] "an arm of the sea." [...] The following day, Dutcher, followed by U.S. Attorney Cannon, argued that the Sound was [...] "uninclosed waters of the ocean outside the jaws of land." [...] In particular, Cannon cited the Amistad case (1841) and noted that the words [...] "out of the jurisdiction of any particular State" [...] had been removed in 1820. Voorhees was given rebuttal.|$|E
