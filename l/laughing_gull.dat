5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, <b>laughing</b> <b>gull,</b> roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, $1 {{million of}} federal {{stimulus}} money was delegated to {{the restoration of}} the marshland near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase the population of birds and fish. The Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collaborated to place soil and plant marsh near the causeway to allow a larger nursing location for fish and provide greater quantities of food for water birds. Over 490 species of birds have been found in the area including the brown pelican, black-billed whistling duck, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, pauraque, buff-bellied hummingbird, golden-fronted woodpecker, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, Neotropic cormorant, <b>laughing</b> <b>gull,</b> Franklin's gull, ring-billed gull, herring gull, gull-billed tern, common loon, brown-crested flycatcher, hooded oriole, peregrine falcon and piping plover.

50|$|The {{most likely}} route for {{transmission}} of TSV is cannibalism of dead infected shrimp. The virus can be spread from one farm to another by seagulls and aquatic insects.

40|$|The {{collision}} of birds with aircraft {{is a serious}} problem at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFKIA), New York. Gulls (Larus spp.), primarily <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> (L, articilla), accounted for 84 % of bird strikes (an aircraft striking> 1 bird) from 1988 - 1990, averaging 260 strikes/year. <b>Laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> are present from May-September in association with a nesting colony (7. 629 nests, 1990; 3, 381 nests, 1997) in Jamaica Bay adjacent to JFKIA. A program to reduce gull strikes was undertaken from boa}'-August 1991 - 1997 in which 2 - 5 people stationed on airport boundaries shot gulls flying over the airport. In 6, 369 person-hours of shooting, 52. 235 gulls were killed, comprised of 47. 601 <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> and 4, 634 other gulls. In 1996 and 1997, experimental falconry programs were implemented to complement the shooting program. In 1996, the falconry and shooting programs were conducted simultaneously from 21 June- 9 August, after which shooting stopped but falconry continued until 20 October. In 1997, falconry began 25 July (1 week before shooting program ended) and ended 25 November. A statistical comparison of mean strike rates for all birds and for gulls only during 1988 - 1990 (no shooting or falconry). 1991 - 1995 (shooting but no falconry) and 1996 - 1997 (shooting and falconry) indicated shooting reduced (P 0. 24).

25|$|Regional {{population}} control {{has been used}} on species that cannot be excluded from the airport environment. A nesting colony of <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98-315 bird strikes per year, from 1979-1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually the gulls would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5-6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more {{a function of the}} population reduction than the gulls altering their flight pattern (Dolbeer et al. 1993, Dolbeer et al. 2003, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Since 2002, H 5 N 1 highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPA 1) viruses {{have been associated}} with deaths in numerous wild avian species throughout Eurasia. We assessed the clinical response and extent and duration of viral shedding in 5 species of North American ducks and <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus atricilla) after intranasal challenge with 2 Asian H 5 N 1 HPAI viruses. Birds were challenged at approximately equal to 10 to 16 weeks of age, consistent with temporal peaks in virus prevalence and fall migration. All species were infected, but only wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> exhibited illness or died. Viral titers were higher in oropharyngeal swabs than in cloacal swabs. Duration of viral shedding (1 - 10 days) increased with severity of clinical disease. Both the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and agar gel precipitin (AGP) tests were able to detect postinoculation antibodies in surviving wood ducks and laughing gulls; the HI test was more sensitive than the AGP in the remaining 4 species...|$|R
40|$|Events in {{the attack}} on the {{southern}} oyster drill, Thais haemastoma, by miracidia of the digenetic trematode, Parorchis acanthus, are described. Infection rates in wild drill populations of various Gulf Coast localities from Florida to Texas were low, but intensity of infection in individual drills was high and caused castration. Infection rates in laboratory experiments were high, but intensities were low. Pathology of natural infections in drills is described. The infection lasts at least two years, possibly even for life. Natural infection rates of juvenile herring gulls (Larus argentatus), ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis), and juvenile <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> (L. atricilla) are reported. Juvenile herring and ring-billed gulls were readily infected experimentally with P. acanthus, juvenile <b>laughing</b> <b>gulls</b> were less susceptible, and nestling least terns (Sterna albifrons) appeared to be resistant. Intensity of infection was generally low. P. acanthus offers little hope of being useful as a biological control of the drill, Thais, because of difficulties in spreading the parasite or assuring a significant rise in wild drill infection rates...|$|R

40|$|Coastal urban environments {{provide a}} {{potentially}} diverse {{source of food}} for gulls, including items of marine, terrestrial, and anthropogenic origin. Our objective was to examine variation in the diet and use of feeding habitat of four species of <b>gulls,</b> the <b>Laughing</b> (Leucophaeus atricilla), Herring (Larus argentatus), Great Blackbacked (L. marinus), and Ring-billed (L. delawarensis), at a coastal–urban interface. We necropsied, identified the sex and age class, and quantified the stomach contents of 1053 Laughing, 249 Herring, 67 Great Black-backed, and 31 Ring-billed Gulls collected near the New York City metropolitan area in 2003 and 2004. Great Black-backed Gulls specialized on marine foods, whereas Ring-billed <b>Gulls</b> were generalists. <b>Laughing</b> <b>Gulls</b> and Herring Gulls favored marine foods and foraged in marine habitats but also used terrestrial and anthropogenic food sources. We found evidence that demographics influenced the gulls’ choice of diet and use of feeding habitat. <b>Laughing</b> <b>Gulls</b> and Herring Gulls switched their use of feeding habitats at various stages of breeding, exploiting terrestrial prey and feeding habitats most during chick rearing. Interspecific and intraspecific differences in the four species’ diet and use of feeding habitat apparently allow for their coexistence at this coastal–urban interface...|$|R
