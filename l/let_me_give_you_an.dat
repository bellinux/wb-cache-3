Miss Redwood wanted to put us in the next bedroom to hers--a risk not to be run. I might have talked of the murder at the inn; and she might have heard me. Please to remark a curious thing. Whatever else I might let out, when I was in my cups, not a word about the pocketbook ever dropped from me. You will ask how I know it. My dear, I should have heard of it from my husband, if I had let that out--and he is as much in the dark as you are. Wonderful are the workings of the human mind, as the poet says; and drink drowns care, as the proverb says. But can drink deliver a person from fear by day, and fear by night?

It was a dreary neighbourhood, a miserable afternoon, and we happened to be crossing a rather high viaduct. Down below were some meadows and a canal, and {{by the side of the}} canal, a path. At a certain point--I should think about half a mile from where the train was standing--this path went underneath a rude bridge, built of bricks and covered over with turf. Well, as I sat there I could see two men, both approaching the bridge along the path from opposite directions. One was tall, dressed in light tweeds, a good-looking fellow--looked like one of your country squires except that he was a little on the thin side. The other was a sombre-looking person, dressed in dark clothes, about your height and build, I should say, Mr. Romilly. Well, they both disappeared under that bridge at the same moment, and I don't know why, but I leaned forward to see them come out. The train was there for quite another two minutes, perhaps more. There wasn't another soul anywhere in sight, and it was raining as it only can rain in England." ...|$|E

60|$|Now, to my {{indifferent}} mind, {{education in}} the large sense--not politics at all--is the only agent really capable of improving the trend of civilisation, the only lever we can use. Believing this, I think it a thousand pities that neither Britain nor America, nor, so far as I know, any other country, has as yet evolved machinery through which there might be elected a supreme Director, or, say, a little Board of three Directors, of the nation's spirit, an Educational President, as it were, with power over the nation's spirit analogous to that which America's elected political President has over America's body. Our Minister of Education is as a rule an ordinary Member of the Government, an ordinary man of affairs--though at the moment an angel happens to have strayed in. Why cannot education be regarded, like religion in the past, as something sacred, not merely a department of political administration? Ought we not for this most vital business of education to be ever on the watch for the highest mind and the finest spirit {{of the day to}} guide us? To secure the appointment of such a man, or triumvirate, by democratic means, would need a special sifting process of election, which could never be too close and careful. One might use for the purpose the actual body of teachers in the country to elect delegates to select a jury to choose finally the flower of the national flock. It would be worth any amount of trouble to ensure that we always had the best man or men. And when we had them we should give them a mandate as real and substantial as America now gives to her political President. We should intend them not for mere lay administrators and continuers of custom, but for true fountain-heads and initiators of higher ideals of conduct, learning, manners, and taste; nor stint them of the means necessary to carry those ideals into effect. Hitherto, the supposed direction of ideals--in practice almost none--has been left to religion. But religion as a motive force is at once too personal, too lacking in unanimity, and too specialised to control the educational needs of a modern State; religion, as I understand it, is essentially emotional and individual; when it becomes practical and worldly it strays outside its true province and loses beneficence. Education as I want to see it would take over the control of social ethics, and learning, but make no attempt to usurp the emotional functions of religion. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> example: Those elixirs vitæ--open-air life and a proud pleasure in one's work--imagine those two principles drummed into the heads and hearts of all the little scholars of the age, by men and women who had been taught to believe them the truth. Would this not gradually have an incalculable effect on the trend of our civilisation? Would it not tend to create a demand for a simple and sane life; help to get us back to the land; produce reluctance to work at jobs in which no one can feel pride and pleasure, and so diminish the power of machines and of commercial exploitation? But teachers could only be inspired with such ideals by master spirits. And my plea is that we should give ourselves the chance of electing and making use of such master spirits. We all know from everyday life and business that the real, the only problem is to get the best men to run the show; when we get them the show runs well, when we don't there is nothing left but to pay the devil. The chief defect of modern civilisation based on democracy is the difficulty of getting best men quickly enough. Unless Democracy--government by the people--makes of itself Aristocracy--government by the best people--it is running steadily to seed. Democracy to be sound must utilise not only the ablest men of affairs, but the aristocracy of spirit. The really vital concern of such an elected Head of Education, himself the best man of all, would be the discovery and employment of other best men, best Heads of Schools and Colleges, whose chief concern in turn would be the discovery and employment of best subordinates. The better the teacher the better the ideals; quite obviously, the only hope of raising ideals is to raise the standard of those who teach, from top to toe of the educational machine. What we want, in short, is a sort of endless band--throwing up the finest spirit of the day till he forms a head or apex whence virtue runs swiftly down again into the people who elected him. This is the principle, as it seems to me, of the universe itself, whose symbol is neither circle nor spire, but circle and spire mysteriously combined.|$|E

50|$|What else goes towards making Ghana so strong? Otto Pfister continues; In Africa {{there is}} often only one way for many young lads to escape from poverty and {{to make their way}} up the social scale - football. Youngsters want to become stars and to play in a top European league. That is their main aim and they will do {{anything}} to achieve it. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> example: While I was coaching in Ghana I once told my team to be ready for training at three o'clock in the morning. At half past two they were all assembled and ready to go. They want to learn and they want to play for the national team. They know that in their country a national team player is a hero and enjoys a level of prestige that is not comparable to that in Europe. Another positive point for young players in Ghana is that there are many good coaches in the country who help develop the available talent and above all want to let them play. This policy pays off. Today, many Ghanaian youngsters are in G14 Club Academies in Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Like most hip hop {{producers}} in the '90s, Tataee made use of various music samples in his productions. This has led to controversy among B.U.G. Mafia's fans: as none of the samples he used have been credited {{on any of the}} covers of the albums he has worked on it fueled rumors of plagiarism. As [...] "UCMR-ADA" [...] (The Composers' Union in Romania) had broken off all contacts with ASCAP in the communist era, clearing any sample from records released in the United States was virtually impossible, so Tataee chose to use whatever samples he wanted to use without any permission, since he had no legal way to do otherwise. He cleared this issue himself in a post on the B.U.G. Mafia fan message board, while conversing with the fans: Let me tell you about the 'stolen' instrumentals. Hip hop producers used, since the beginning, elements from other songs, this technique being called SAMPLING. In any country in the world there is an artist's association where every artist goes and subscribes their score and song lyrics, they are archived into a database, thus creating the copyright term. ... <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> example: if B.U.G. Mafia wants to use a sample of Snoop Dogg's What's My Name we would have to call UCMR (Uniunea Compozitorilor și Muzicienilor Români - Romanian Composers and Musicians' Union) and they should give us the right to use the sample through their connection with ASCAP, that's the association that holds Snoop Dogg's records and send the money percent from our sales and airplay. This is where the problem comes as UCMR hasn't sent any money outside the country for years and whatever contract that they give us would be useless if we would be sued for sample clearing. We tried to contact ASCAP but they can give rights for sample using only in the United States of America. So we decided to use whatever we used from other artists considering that we had no legal way to do this.|$|E

40|$|Ernst Mayr {{notes in}} his book This Is Biology that “in biology, {{concepts}} play a far greater role in theory formation than do laws. The two major contributors to a new theory in the life sciences are the discovery of new facts (observations) {{and the development of}} new concepts ” (62 - 3). With this general perspective in mind, I address my remarks in this section of the conference labeled “Emerging Theories ” on a related question, which is ‘How should we think about language? ’ The idea is that in linguistics as in biology, the way that we think about language strongly determines the kinds of theories that we come up with. Focusing on syntax in particular, {{it can be argued that}} to a considerable extent contemporary mainstream theory is the product of a very particular way of conceptualizing language. If we shift to another perspective, which I will outline here, then the way in which we theorize about the phenomena is in many cases substantially different.
