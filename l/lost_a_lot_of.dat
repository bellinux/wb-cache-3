However, when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk was {{selected}} to represent her country at the Olympic Games in London, and she competed in the road race and the individual time trial {{on the road and}} in the team pursuit on the track. In the road race, Van Dijk was a domestique for Marianne Vos, who won the gold medal. Van Dijk attacked five times but finished outside the time limit. Because the victory of Marianne Vos was seen as a team performance, Van Dijk, Loes Gunnewijk and Annemiek van Vleuten were all subsequently honoured in both the Holland Heineken House and the Ridderzaal. In the time trial, Van Dijk finished eighth. She said afterwards that she was afraid to start too fast and subsequently <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time {{in the first part of}} the race. In the team pursuit, Van Dijk finished sixth together with Kirsten Wild, Amy Pieters and Vera Koedooder. In the qualification heats, the team had held the Olympic record for a short period and they rode a new Dutch national record in round one. According to Van Dijk, sixth place was the highest attainable place the team could have hoped to achieve.|$|E

After the passing of the Land Reform Ordinance, the family <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> land that it owned. The {{ordinance}} set a ceiling on how much land an individual or family could own. As a result, the family wealth and property was partitioned in 1952. The number of members at the time of partition was 213 and the deed was registered in 1956. In addition to being the largest Joint-Hindu family, the deed was the biggest partition deed of Travancore-Cochin/Kerala.|$|E

Six sluices were constructed, and Spencer attempted to obtain permission to improve the river to Bedford, but the Act was defeated, despite support from Bedford Corporation. Some dredging was done, and Great Barford became an inland port, but he <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money on the scheme, and the condition of the river worsened.|$|E
25|$|Some {{candidates}} ran in duos {{because they}} wanted to combine family life with politics. Brouwer, Rosenmöller and Sipkes already were MPs for GreenLeft, whilst Rabbae was new – he had been chair of the Dutch Centre for Foreigners. In the first round, the duos ended up ahead of the others, but neither had an absolute majority. A second round was needed, in which Brouwer and Rabbae won with 51%. Brouwer became the first candidate and Rabbae second, the second duo Rosenmöller and Sipkes occupied the following place followed by Marijke Vos, former chair of the party. The idea of a dual top candidacy did not communicate well to the voters. GreenLeft lost one seat, leaving only five. Yet in the same election, the centre-left Labour Party also <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> seats.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{increased by}} 308% between 2005 and 2014, {{primarily as a}} result of Thomson Reuters' decision to track a much larger number of Brazilian journals in its database between 2006 and 2008. Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it is ahead of most of its neighbours. When it comes to impact, Brazil has <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ground in the past decade. One possible cause may be the speed with which enrolment in higher education has expanded since the mid-1990s, especially as concerns students passing through the federal system of universities, some of which have resorted to hiring inexperienced faculty, including candidates without doctorates.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, Jacquinot {{punctured}} three times, and <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time. Eugène Christophe {{took over the}} lead.

Christophe still led the race after that stage, 37 years and 164 days old; this makes him the oldest person in Tour de France history to lead the general classification. During this sixth stage, Philippe Thys, who was in second position in the overall classification, broke his wheel and lost more than three hours, which removed his chances to win the Tour de France for the fourth time. Also in that stage, a shepherd suggested to Emile Masson to take a shortcut on a goat track. Masson took the shortcut, had to carry his bike, and even lost time.|$|E
25|$|These radials are {{supplemented}} by two-digit codes which are routes {{that may be}} slightly less important, but may still be classified as trunk routes, although many of these routes have <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> their significance due to motorway bypasses, or the upgrading of other A-roads. These routes are not all centred on London, {{but as far as}} possible follow the general principle that their number locates them radially clockwise from the associated single digit route. For example, the A10 (London to King's Lynn) is the first main route clockwise from the A1, the A11 (London to Norwich) is the next, then the A12 (London to Great Yarmouth) and the A13 (London to Shoeburyness); the next radial is the A2, followed by the A20 (London to Dover), and so on.

After the stops, Mansell led Alesi (who planned to go without stopping), Senna, Piquet, a {{recovering}} Patrese and de Cesaris. Then on lap 22, Mansell slowed to a halt with an electrical failure, giving Alesi {{the lead of the}} race. Senna's engine then stopped for some time and because of that Piquet, Patrese and de Cesaris were right with him and allowing Alesi to remain in the lead. Senna was unable to pull away because he had gearbox troubles. On lap 31 — still intending to run non-stop — Alesi's engine blew up and Senna was back in the lead. Patrese tried to pass Piquet but went wide and de Cesaris was able to take third.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Chappell, {{his health}} was now blighted by {{recurring}} tonsillitis {{and he found}} it difficult to bat for long periods during the 1974–75 Ashes series. He was the backbone of Australia's sometimes inconsistent batting, scoring 608 runs at 55.3. At Sydney, where Australia won to reclaim the Ashes, Chappell dominated with 84 and 144, which he followed up with a century in a losing cause in the sixth Test at Melbourne. At Perth, he broke the world record for a fielder by snaring seven catches. Ironically, his grandfather Vic Richardson was one of several players who held the old record of six. Chappell reluctantly had his tonsils removed, but he quickly <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> weight which affected his performance on the tour of England that followed. He played in the World Cup (for what proved to be the only time), then made only one good score (73* at Lords) in the four Ashes Tests that followed.|$|E

The Tour of America <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money, and it appeared to have been cross-financed by the Tour de France. In the years before 1987, Lévitan's position had always been protected by Émilien Amaury, the then owner of ASO, but recently, Émilien Amaury had retired and his son Philippe Amaury was now responsible. When Lévitan arrived at his office on 17 March 1987, he found that his doors were locked and he was fired. The organisation of the 1987 Tour de France was taken over by Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet. He was not successful in acquiring more funds, and was fired within one year.|$|E

40|$|The {{necessity}} to process interlaced images in surveillance, reconnaissance, or further computer vision areas {{should be a}} topic of the past. But, for different reasons, it is not. So, there are situations in practice, in which interlaced images have to be processed. Since <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> algorithms strongly degrade when working with such images directly, a usual method is to double or interpolate image lines in order to discard {{one of the two}} enclosed image frames. This is efficient but leads to weak results, in which half of the original information is <b>lost.</b> Alternatively, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> valuable computation time has to be spent to solve the highly complex motion compensation task in order to improve the results significantly. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is presented to solve this dilemma. First, the algorithm solves the complex 2 -D mapping problem using the best state-of-the art optical flow method that could be found for this purpose. But, of course, for different physical reasons there are regions which cannot properly be handled by optical flow by itself. Therefore, an efficient post-processing method detects and removes remaining artifacts afterwards, which is the main contribution of this paper. This method is based on color interpolation incorporating local image structure. The presented results document the overall performance of the approach with respect to obtained image quality and calculation time. The method is easy to implement and offers a valuable pre-processing for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> computer vision tasks...|$|R
