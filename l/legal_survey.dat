The EMCS model is designed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) with three main sets of classes: (1) RegisterObject (2) ActivityLicense, and (3) Person. Other relevant features of the model are also specified at the class level. These include: conditional registered parcels, unregisterable areas such as prohibited or protected areas, legal borders around registered or serving parcels, reference documents such as <b>legal</b> <b>survey</b> results documents, responsibilities, and restrictions. The model also considers issues related to exploration cost, parcel code, tax, royalty, commodity, priorities, facilitations, evaluation, transfer of ownership, changing parameters, and temporal registration.

Chief student affairs officers and chief legal affairs officers have very different perception as to the most likely student legal issues to be litigated in the next ten years. Chief student affairs officers found few student legal issues highly likely to be litigated in the next 10 years. Affirmative action, sex/age discrimination, fraternities and sororities, and disabled students were the only student legal issues at least 20 percent of chief student affairs officers believed to be highly likely of litigation in the next ten years. Chief legal affairs officers believed many student legal issues would be litigated in the next 10 years. At least 20 percent of the chief legal affairs officers believed admission criteria, affirmative action, reverse discrimination, sex/age discrimination, athletic tort liability, Title IX, defaulting student loans, defamation, negligence, academic dismissals, academic dishonesty, cyberspace issues, and disabled students to be highly likely of litigation in the next ten years. Chief student affairs officers and chief legal affairs officers prepare very similarly for future student legal issues they may confront in the future. There is a large amount of crossover between professional conferences of chief student affairs officers and chief legal affairs officers.

40|$|The project’s {{objective}} is to analyse the factors involved in the feasibility study of a business centre next to Barcelona’s international airport offering a restaurant, gym, spa, and other services. The business idea has emerged to the possible need to find an office for all executives who travel frequently and cannot {{find a place to}} do their jobs or meetings, creating offices in areas not intended for such use. Furthermore, the student believes {{there is a need to}} build a building with these services, because it is possible that in Barcelona this business idea does not currently exist, and instead, they have been located in other big business cities on United Kingdom and United States of America. Therefore, the objective of the business centre is to provide a temporary office including restaurants, gym, spa, garage and big areas for development meetings or events, offering these services to all people who look the comfort and speed in days working out of town. To meet this objective, the feasibility study is structured as follows: - A <b>legal</b> <b>survey</b> in which it has made visits to building site under study. Besides having consulted all the information on it though El Catastro and “El Registro de la propiedad de Barcelona”. - An urban survey, which was written by the Plan Parcial of Mas Blau Business Park. This plan has provided all regulations that influenced in the construction of the business centre. - A market survey, analyzing the current situation of El Prat de Llobregat, the Business Park and Europe. Besides the new ideas provided by the demand survey, the study of the offer in Barcelona and interviews with potential customers. - A SWOT analysis, with the sole purpose of finding those keys for the business idea. - A strategic plan, looking for the aspects related to the target audience of the business idea. A proposal for placement, analyzing how it will find the business center to hit the market. And the marketing mix, drawing conclusions about the keys that influence the real-state product. - An economic survey, which made estimates of income and expenses that will generate by the business idea, getting a product profitability. - A financial survey, analyzing the cash inflows and outflows, and getting the latest information to complete the feasibility study. For all this, the feasibility study of a business center in El Prat de Llobregat, offering these services and looking for potential customers, is acceptable and will be cost effective. Along with all this, the student wants to prove that investments in real-state should not end because the crisis, and that people with innovative ideas will be the only that will improve the country...|$|E

40|$|Law {{schools are}} criticized for graduating {{students}} who lack {{the skills necessary}} to practice law. Legal research is a foundational ability necessary to support lawyering competency. The American Bar Association (ABA) establishes standards for legal education that include a requirement that each law student receive substantial instruction in legal skills, including legal research. Despite the recognized importance of legal research in legal education, there is no consensus of what to teach as part of a legal research course or even how to teach such a course. Legal educators struggle to address these issues. The practicing bar and judiciary have expressed concerns about law school graduates ability to conduct legal research. Studies have been conducted detailing the poor research ability of law students and their lack of skills. Although deficiencies in law student research skills have been identified, there is no agreement as to how to remediate these deficiencies. This dissertation suggests the legal research resources that should be taught in law schools by identifying the research resources used by practicing attorneys and comparing them to those resources currently included in legal research instruction at the 202 ABA-accredited law schools. Multiple data sources were used in this study. Practitioner resource information was based on data provided by practicing attorneys responding to the 2013 ABA <b>Legal</b> Technology <b>Survey.</b> Resources taught in ABA-accredited law schools were identified through three sources: a 2014 law school <b>legal</b> research <b>survey</b> sent to the 202 ABA-accredited law schools, a review of law school syllabi from ABA-accredited law school legal research and legal research and writing courses, and the Association of Legal Writing Directors 2013 annual <b>survey</b> of <b>legal</b> research and writing faculty. The combined data from these three sources were compared to the resources used by practicing lawyers identified in the annual national 2013 ABA <b>Legal</b> Technology <b>Survey.</b> This comparison of what is taught with what is used in practice identifies a deficiency in law school instruction in the research resources used by practicing attorneys.
