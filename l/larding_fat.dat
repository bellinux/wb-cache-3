ICR male mice weighing 20 – 25  g (National Laboratory Animal Center, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand) were housed under standard conditions with free access to water and fed with LFD for a week (3.85  kcal/g total energy, 10  % <b>lard</b> <b>fat,</b> 20  % protein, and 70  % carbohydrate).

During the last 6  weeks period of diet, normal control mice (NC, n[*]=[*] 8) were daily given distilled water (2  mL/kg) via oral gavage, and 24 obese mice, divided into three groups (n[*]=[*] 8 per group) were orally administered with 2  mL/kg of distilled water (obese control mice: OB), or 250  mg/kg, or 500  mg/kg of S. alata extracts. At the 5 th week of treatment period, all mice were subjected to given oral glucose tolerance test as detailed below. After the 6 -weeks treatment period, all mice were sacrificed using isoflurane anesthesia. Whole blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture, and blood glucose level was measured. The serum samples were further analyzed for insulin, leptin, adiponectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. Liver, epididymal fat, and skeletal muscle tissues were taken for histology and western blot analysis.|$|R

30|$|To {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, this is the only study that has used fat from diary origin for {{inducing}} obesity and obesity related complications such as metabolic syndrome, hypertention and dyslipidemia. Although lard was not {{used in the present study}} as a fat source (which, according to most studies, is a major factor for increasing blood cholesterol and inducing insulin resistance) and animal fat with dairy source was applied, a significant increase was found in levels of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride and also insulin resistance. In fact, no study which has used such type of fat for weight gain or insulin resistance has been found; accordingly, it can be concluded that animal fat with diary sources is capable of increasing fat and obesity as much as <b>lard</b> <b>fat</b> and can be used to substitute such fat in studies; also, such type of fat should be considered with more accuracy in dietary analyses. The importance of using fat from non-lard source in this study, is in its interoperability to Muslim cultures that religious beliefs do not permit them to use the products of pig origin. So the conventional models of diet-induced obesity, that uses Lard, could not generalize to these communities.|$|R

The present study was performed to evaluate the potential antiobesity effect of mustard oil by analyzing the changes in body weight, visceral adipose mass and serum biochemicals in dietary obesity in wistar rats. Wistar rats were fed normal chow diet, <b>lard</b> based high <b>fat</b> diet, mustard oil based high <b>fat</b> diet or <b>lard</b> plus mustard oil based high fat diet for 10 weeks. Body weight and food intake were measured regularly during the experimental period. Total fat in fecal excretions were measured in the 8 th week while as core body temperature (an index of thermogenesis) and oral glucose tolerance test were measured in 10 th week of the experiment. At the end of experiment various visceral adipose tissues were weighed and serum glucose and lipids measured. <b>Lard</b> based high <b>fat</b> diet animals gained more body weight, had higher glucose and lipid levels compared to NC animals indicating induction of obesity. However, body weight gain and visceral adipose tissue mass of lard plus mustard oil based high fat diet animals were lower than that of <b>lard</b> based high <b>fat</b> diet animals and that of the mustard oil based high fat diet were the lowest. Furthermore, both mustard oil based high <b>fat</b> diet and <b>lard</b> plus mustard oil based high fat diet animals were associated with increased thermogenesis, decreased serum glucose and lipid levels and improved glucose tolerance compared to <b>lard</b> based high <b>fat</b> diet obese animals.

Feeding of rats on HC-diet supplemented with 10 % of currant oil (from Ribes nigrum L.) containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 61. 1 % of n– 6 and 15. 4 % of n– 3) and lower amounts of saturated (SFA, 7. 7 %) and monounsaturated (MUFA, 14. 3 %) fatty acids caused {{a significant decrease in}} plasma cholesterol associated with a mild decrease in VLDL-C and an increase in HDL-C, when compared to rats fed on HC-diet with 10 % of <b>lard</b> <b>fat</b> containing low amounts of PUFA (7. 7 % of n– 6 and 0. 7 % of n– 3) and higher amounts of SFA (42. 7 %) and MUFA (47. 5 %). However, currant oil feeding led to the increased oxidizability of LDL. Silymarin, but not SPC, was effective in prevention of development of dietary induced hypercholesterolemia in the both dietary fats with slightly better result in diet containing the currant oil. On the other hand, SPC supressed more effectively than silymarin LDL oxidizability. The results suggest that antihypercholesterolemic effect of SM in rats fed on HCdiet is improved by dietary currant oil, but the currant oil induces an increased oxidizability of LDL. This can be supressed by improvement of bioavailability of silibinin, as shown here for silibinin-phosphatidylcholine complex...|$|R

The model of rat with diet-induced change of lipoprotein profile and increased sensitivity to lipoperoxidation generated by supplementation of diet with PUFA rich currant oil was in comparison to rats fed standard low-fat diet characterized by increased plasma and hepatic chol. levels with concomitant decrease in blood glutathion. Substitution of currant oil for lard fed in the diet caused expressive accumulation of triacyglycerols in liver. Silymarin decreased the chol. content in liver and VLDL, accompanied with mild increase in HDL chol. Silymarin also increased glutathion levels in blood and the same effect after extract from P. vulgaris was observed. Combination of silymarin and extract from P. vulgaris like silymarin lowered VLDL-chol. with concomitant increase in HDL chol. and increased concentrations of glutathion in blood.

40|$|Background: Compelling {{evidence}} links obesity induced systemic inflammation to {{the development}} of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systemic inflammation may result from exacerbated adipose inflammation. Besides the known detrimental effects of typical pro-inflammatory factors secreted by the adipose tissue (TNF-α, MCP- 1 and IL- 6) on the kidney, we hypothesize the enhanced obesity-induced secretion of serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute inflammatory protein, to {{play a key role in}} aggravating obesity-induced CKD. Methods: Groups of male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice (n = 99 in total) were fed a low (10 % lard) or high (45 % <b>lard)</b> <b>fat</b> diet for a maximum of 52 weeks. Mice were sacrificed after 24, 40 and 52 weeks. Whole blood samples, kidneys and adipose tissues were collected. The development of adipose and renal tissue inflammation was assessed on gene expression and protein level. Adipocytokine levels were measured in plasma samples. Results: A distinct inflammatory phenotype was observed in the adipose tissue of HFD mice prior to renal inflammation, which was associated with an early systemic elevation of TNF-α, leptin and SAA (1 A-C). With aging, sclerotic lesions appeared in the kidney, the extent of which was severely aggravated by HFD feeding. Lesions exhibited typical amyloid characteristics (2 A) and pathological severity positively correlated with bodyweight (2 B). Interestingly, more SAA protein was detected in lesions of HFD mice. Conclusion: Our data suggest a causal link between obesity induced chronic inflammation and AA amyloidosis in C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice. Though future studies are necessary to prove this causal link and to determine its relevance for the human situation, obesity may hence be considered a risk factor for the development and progression of renal AA amyloidosis in the course of CKD.
