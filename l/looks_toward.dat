25|$|The sibling {{relationship}} {{is a unique}} one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain role {{and place in the}} family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits. Siblings who enjoy a close relationship participate in each other's daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure time together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often <b>looks</b> <b>toward</b> a future together (even into retirement). Surviving siblings lose this “companionship and a future” with their deceased siblings.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a Spanish-period building which was remodeled by the United States in 1924, with small changes since then. The two-story building has massive masonry walls and large arched entrances to a central courtyard that reflects its Spanish origins, while the false partial gables with Spanish barrel tiles are typical of the United States Spanish Revival architectural work of the 1920s. The {{building is}} situated on the waterfront facing the Caribbean Sea and next to the port of Ponce, {{two miles from the}} center of this second-largest city in Puerto Rico. The customs house fully occupies a small city block. Its principal facade faces Bonaire Street and <b>looks</b> <b>toward</b> the ocean across a grassed area containing a Coast Guard beacon. It is located in an area of traditional warehouses, commercial buildings, mostly one-story and many from the Spanish period. There is a sidewalk around the four sides of the building, with the one on Bonaire Street wider and providing three mature trees.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Walter Brueggemann, {{formerly}} of Columbia Theological Seminary, suggested a chiastic structure to the Jacob narrative (shown {{in the chart}} below), moving from conflict with Esau to reconciliation with Esau. Within that is conflict with Laban moving to covenant with Laban. And within that, at the center, is the narrative of births, in which the birth of Joseph (at [...] ) marks the {{turning point in the}} entire narrative, after which Jacob <b>looks</b> <b>toward</b> the Land of Israel and his brother Esau.

2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person <b>looks</b> <b>toward</b> it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Eatwell and Neal O'Sullivan {{divide the}} right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme and new. Chip Berlet argues {{that each of}} these [...] "styles of thought" [...] are [...] "responses to the left", {{including}} liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution. The reactionary right <b>looks</b> <b>toward</b> the past and is [...] "aristocratic, religious and authoritarian". The moderate right, typified by the writings of Edmund Burke, is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including {{the rule of law and}} capitalism, although it sees radical laissez-faire and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies. Radical right is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as McCarthyism, the John Birch Society, Thatcherism and the Republikaner Party. Eatwell stresses that this use has [...] "major typological problems" [...] and that the term [...] "has also been applied to clearly democratic developments". The radical right includes right-wing populism and various other subtypes. Eatwell argues that the extreme right' has four traits: [...] "1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state". The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets and individual initiative.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{painting}} in the cycle, The Triumph of Truth, is a purely allegorical depiction of King Louis XIII and his mother, the Queen, reconciling before heaven. The Queen and Louis XIII are depicted floating in heaven, connected by the symbol of concordia, which demonstrates her sons’ forgiveness and the peace that was reached between them. [...] Below, Saturn raises Veritas to heaven which symbolizes truth being, [...] "brought to the light", {{as well as the}} reconciliation between the Queen and her son. The illustrations of Time and Truth occupy almost 3/4 of the lower canvas. The upper part of the canvas is filled with renderings of Marie and her son. In the composition, Marie is depicted as much larger than her son and occupies much more space. Her larger, less obscured body is turned frontally on the picture plane, which emphasizes her importance. Her importance is further highlighted by her equal height to her son, the King. Her son who is obscured in part by the Wing of Time, kneels before the queen and presents her with the token of amity, the clasped hands and flaming heart within a laurel crown. Compositionally, Rubens gives the queen greater importance in this panel through the use of gestures and gazes. In the work, Truth gestures toward the Queen while Time <b>looks</b> <b>toward</b> her from below. Both figures ignore the King. Rubens artfully projected both mother and son into the future, depicting them as more aged and mature than in the preceding panel (Peace is Confirmed in Heaven). It is at this point that the Medici Cycle changes to the subject of the Queen Mother's reign. With the death of son Louis' court favorite, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, mother and son reconcile. [...] Marie receives ultimate vindication by being re-admitted to the Council of State in January 1622. [...] This picture represents how time thus uncovers the truth in correspondence to the relationship between Marie and her son.|$|E
