25|$|In 1731 William Kent was {{appointed}} to work with Bridgeman, whose last designs are dated 1735 after which Kent took over as the garden designer. Kent had already created the glorious garden at Rousham House, and he and Gibbs built temples, bridges, and other garden structures. Kent's masterpiece at Stowe is the Elysian Fields with its Temple of Ancient Virtue that <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> to his Temple of British Worthies. Kent's architectural work was in the newly fashionable Palladian style.|$|E
25|$|The image {{can be read}} as a petrified {{synthesis}} of all the stages during and after the Descent from the Cross: the lowering of the corpse, the Deposition, Lamentation and the Entombment. Christ's feet appear to be still nailed together, while the spread of His arms retains the position of His body on the Cross. Christ's body is shown as if held out for the concentrated gaze of the viewer. Joseph of Arimathea <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> the body towards the skull of Adam. Joseph appears as a sumptuously dressed burgher and has the most portrait-like appearance of the figures in the painting; his gaze links the hands of Christ and his mother, the new Adam and Eve, with the skull of Adam. Thereby visualising the essence of the Redemption.|$|E
500|$|Inchdrewer Castle is a 16th-century tower {{house in}} the parish of Banff, Aberdeenshire, in the {{northeast}} of Scotland. Situated on a slight rise [...] southwest of Banff, it <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> to Banff Bay. Originally owned by the Currour family, it was purchased by the Ogilvies of Dunlugas in 1557 and became their main family seat. The Ogilvies were staunch Royalists, {{which resulted in the}} castle coming under attack from the Covenanters in 1640. George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff was murdered in 1713 and his body hidden inside the castle, which was then set on fire. The castle came under siege again in 1746, during the Jacobite rebellion. At the start of the 19th century, following the death of the 8th Lord Banff, the property was inherited by the Abercromby of Birkenbog family, who leased it to a tenant. It became uninhabited after 1836 and the structure deteriorated.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{this stretch}} of the trail is on forest roads. From the Monastic City at Glendalough, the Way follows the Green Road towards the Upper Lake. It passes through an area of native {{woodland}} made up of oak, holly, birch, and rowan. Ascending from the Upper Lake, the trail reaches Poulanass Waterfall which, over millennia, has cut a narrow gorge through the slate rock and borne millions of tonnes of rock, sand and mud into Glendalough, dividing what was originally one lake into the two seen today. The trail continues its ascent through forest before emerging onto the saddle between Mullacor and Lugduff mountains at Borenacrow. The Borenacrow route between Glendalough and Glenmalure dates back to ancient times {{and there is a}} local tradition that Saint Kevin travelled this way to celebrate Mass in Glenmalure. The view ahead <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> the Glenmalure valley at Fraughan Rock Glen and Lugnaquilla, Wicklow's highest mountain at [...] The Way then begins a long descent into Glenmalure, the longest glacial valley in Ireland and Great Britain. Along the way the trail passes another Adirondack shelter, constructed in 2006 by Mountain [...] Reaching the floor of the valley, the Way joins the Military Road to reach Drumgoff Crossroads. Crossing the River Avonbeg, the route passes the remains of an old military barracks, built around 1800, and enters Drumgoff Wood. At the forest entrance is a granite pillar marking the official halfway point of the Wicklow Way. The trail follows a forest road along the flanks of Slieve Maan before briefly re-joining the Military Road and then following a forest road around Carrickashane Mountain before reaching the road at Iron Bridge where the Way crosses the Ow River. Another Adirondack shelter, again constructed by Mountain [...] volunteers with assistance from the Glenwalk Hillwalking Club, can be found at Mucklagh, on the slopes of Carrickashane Mountain.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 1997, Fawcett {{received}} negative commentary {{after giving}} a rambling interview and appearing distracted on Late Show with David Letterman.

Though the Letterman appearance spawned speculation and several jokes at her expense, she returned to the show in 1999.

We followed it, unintentionally, as far as Le Grand Pin--that big pine tree that <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> the bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies descended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards the sea and the islands. It was evident they were suffering very deep grief. Their faces were pale and their eyes bloodshot. [...] "Poor things!" [...] Amelia said. Then her tone altered suddenly.|$|E
