40|$|This thesis {{studies in}} detail the {{dynamics}} of ball screw feed drives and expands understanding {{of the factors that}} impose limitations on their performance. This knowledge is then used for developing control strategies that provide adequate command following and disturbance rejection. High performance control strategies proposed in this thesis are designed for, and implemented on, a custom-made ball screw drive. A hybrid Finite Element (FE) model for the ball screw drive is developed and coded in Matlab programming language. This FE model is employed for prediction of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the ball screw setup. The accuracy of FRFs predicted for the ball screw mechanism alone is validated against the experimental measurements obtained through impact hammer testing. Next, the FE model for the entire test setup is validated. The dynamic characteristics of the actuator current controller are also modeled. In addition, the modal parameters of the mechanical structure are extracted from measured FRFs, which include the effects of current loop dynamics. To ensure adequate command following and disturbance rejection, three motion controllers with active vibration damping capability are developed. The first is based on the sensor averaging concept which facilitates position control of the rigid body dynamics. Active damping is added to suppress vibrations. To achieve satisfactory steady state response, integral action over the tracking error is included. The stability analysis and tuning procedure for this controller is presented together with experimental results that prove the effectiveness of this method in high-speed tracking and cutting applications. The second design uses the pole placement technique to move the real component of two of the oscillatory poles further to the left along the real axis. This yields a faster rigid body response with less vibration. However, the time delay from the current loop dynamics imposes a limitation on how much the poles can be shifted to the left without jeopardizing the system’s stability. To overcome this issue, a <b>lead</b> <b>filter</b> is designed to recover the system phase at the crossover frequency. When designing the Pole Placement Controller (PPC) and the <b>lead</b> <b>filter</b> concurrently, the objective is to minimize the load side disturbance response against the disturbances. This controller is also tested in high-speed tracking and cutting experiments. The third control method is developed around the idea of using the pole placement technique for active damping of not only the first mode of vibration, but also the second and third modes as well. A Kalman filter is designed to estimate a state vector for the system, from the control input and the position measurements obtained from the rotary and linear encoders. The state estimates are then fed back to the PPC controller. Although for this control design, promising results in terms of disturbance rejection are obtained in simulations, the Nyquist stability analysis shows that the closed loop system has poor stability margins. To improve the stability margins, the McFarlane-Glover robustness optimization method is attempted, and as a result, the stability margins are improved, but at the cost of degraded performance. The practical implementation of the third controller, was, unfortunately, not successful. This thesis concludes by addressing the problem of harmonic disturbance rejection in ball screw drives. It is shown that for cases where a ball screw drive is subject to high-frequency disturbances, the dynamic positioning accuracy of the ball screw drive can be improved significantly by adopting an additional control scheme known as Adaptive Feedforward Cancellation (AFC). Details of parameter tuning and stability analysis for AFC are presented. At the end, successful implementation and effectiveness of AFC is demonstrated in applications involving time periodic or space periodic disturbances. The conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the AFC are based on results obtained from the high-speed tracking and end-milling experiments...|$|E

During exposure the films were put into bakelite film badges containing 3 copper filters of different thickness (0. 05, 0. 5 and 1. 2 mm), one <b>lead</b> <b>filter</b> (0. 5 mm), and an open window. Doses were measured by a Victoren Condenser -r- meter. The Films were developed in an »EFKA« developer for X-ray films, while the optical density was measured by an »EEL« densitometer. Calibration curves were established giving relationship between the optical density and the radiation dose for 50, 60, 70, 100 and 200 kV of normal radiation. A curve showing the relation of the film response to the radiation energy and curves concerning the »hardness factor« and dose ratios (Dressel) were plotted. The possibility of reducing the dependence of the film response on radiation energy has been examined by the estimation of the dose (1) from the sum of the densities of a less sensitive film without filter and a more sensitive film with filter (Stekelenburg) and (2) from the film blackening beneath the Pb filter only (Behourrek and others). Both methods decrease the dependance of film response on the radiation energy enabling the estimation of the dose for any of the energies from a single calibration curve.

40|$|The {{development}} of treatment planning methods in radiation therapy requires dose calculation methods {{that are both}} accurate and general enough to provide a dose per unit monitor setting for a broad variety of fields and beam modifiers. The purpose of this work was to develop models for calculation of scatter and transmission for photon beam attenuators such as compensating filters, wedges, and block trays. The attenuation of the beam is calculated using a spectrum of the beam, and a correction factor based on attenuation measurements. Small angle coherent scatter and electron binding effects on scattering cross sections are considered by use of a correction factor. Quality changes in beam penetrability and energy fluence to dose conversion are modeled by use of the calculated primary beam spectrum after passage through the attenuator. The beam spectra are derived by the depth dose effective method, i. e., by minimizing the difference between measured and calculated depth dose distributions, where the calculated distributions are derived by superposing data from a database for monoenergetic photons. The attenuator scatter is integrated over the area viewed from the calculation point of view using first scatter theory. Calculations are simplified by replacing the energy and angular-dependent cross-section formulas with the forward scatter constant r 2 (0) {{and a set of}} parametrized correction functions. The set of corrections include functions for the Compton energy loss, scatter attenuation, and secondary bremsstrahlung production. The effect of charged particle contamination is bypassed by avoiding use of dmax for absolute dose calibrations.
