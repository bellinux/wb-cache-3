5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the actions of their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established {{that they could be}} <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E
