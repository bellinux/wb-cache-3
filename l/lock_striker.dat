50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin binnacles closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The window winder levers, the door release levers and the quarterlight vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door <b>lock</b> <b>striker,</b> was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, {{concurrently}} {{with the}} replacement of the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce by the 1750 GTV, the GT 1300 Junior was revised with many of the new parts from the 1750 GTV. This included the dashboard, the suspension and the new wheel size of 5½ × 14J instead of 4½ × 15J. This revised GT 1300 Junior, however, retained the early [...] "step-front" [...] body style, which, interestingly, makes it the most mechanically refined production [...] "step-front" [...] model. Another intriguing detail is that, just as on the 1750 GTV, the remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door <b>lock</b> <b>striker,</b> was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive. This series of GT 1300 Junior was the only model with the step-front bodyshell to have this item mounted on the left hand side. All other step-front models - Giulia Sprint GT, Giulia Sprint GT Veloce, and early GT 1300 Junior with flat dashboard - featured this item on the right hand side.|$|E
40|$|Academic thesis, {{drawn up}} within the {{framework}} of engineering studies, presents a proposal optimal production of garage door <b>lock</b> <b>striker.</b> The part is manufactured from steel sheet S 275 JR of 1. 5 mm thickness. By the analysis of its possible methods of production, with regard to the required annual series of 500, 000 pieces, was chosen technology of manufacturing the part in the compound tool by blanking and bending processes. For these technologies was designed solution of the compound tool and automatic production line with the eccentric crank press SMERAL S 160, where is the compound tool fixed. The measure of financial performance of manufacturing the part is economical assessing. In the current state is investment return in the production of 179, 186 pieces of the parts...|$|E

50|$|Collective {{bargaining}} {{negotiations between}} the union and employer had been stable and uneventful for years. When contract talks with the various locals of the United Paperworkers' International Union (UPIU, {{now part of the}} United Steelworkers) opened, it became clear that International Paper's attitude had changed. The company, which had recently recorded near-record profits, demanded wage givebacks, high monthly payments for health and other insurance, an end to double-time pay for work on Sundays, and the elimination of all holidays (including Christmas). The company then <b>locked</b> out the <b>strikers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When Whitley {{learned what}} was happening, he <b>locked</b> up the <b>strikers.</b> He also brought in SWAT teams {{to prepare for}} the strike. But he also told the media that deceiving the inmate workers was wrong and the work order should never have been issued. He {{understood}} that it put the inmates in a bad position, and {{he was not going to}} subject them to building the lethal injection gurney. With that statement, he ended the strike without violence and gained the respect of both the inmate population and his security force.|$|R
25|$|The mine {{owners had}} <b>locked</b> out the <b>strikers,</b> and were hiring strike breakers. Meanwhile, Siringo was {{suspected}} {{as a spy}} when the MOA's newspaper, the Coeur d'Alene Barbarian, began publishing union secrets. Although the union had advised the miners against violence, their anger at discovering the infiltration prompted them {{to blow up the}} Frisco mine in Gem, capturing the Gem mine, plus 150 non-union miners and company guards. Concurrent with the explosion, hundreds of miners converged on Siringo's boarding house. But Siringo had sawed a hole in the floor, and made his escape after crawling for half a block under a wooden boardwalk. He fled to the hills above Coeur d'Alene.|$|R
25|$|The Hamada pistol is a {{blowback}} {{pistol and}} functionally {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold the barrel of the Browning Model 1910 with a dovetail joint. The frame plate <b>lock</b> design and <b>striker</b> assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, rear frame plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|R

25|$|The 2006 Progressive Enterprises Dispute was an {{industrial}} dispute between New Zealand supermarket company Progressive Enterprises and employees {{represented by the}} National Distribution Union and the EPMU. On 25 August 2006, over 500 employees at Progressive's four distribution centres (in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch) began a 48-hour strike supporting a demand for a national collective agreement involving an eight percent wage increase and pay parity between the four centres. On 26 August 2006 the company <b>locked</b> out the <b>strikers</b> indefinitely, suspending operations at its distribution centres, with suppliers delivering goods directly to the supermarkets and also setting up amateur small scale distribution centres in car parks of Countdown supermarkets. The dispute was resolved on 21 September 2006 when Progressive Enterprises agreed to pay parity and a 4.5% wage increase.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 November 1987, {{technicians}} at {{the station}} went on a 24-hour strike. [...] Management <b>locked</b> out the <b>strikers,</b> but stayed on air using non-technical staff to broadcast a skeleton service including (among other things) episodes of the American series Flipper, Batman and Happy Days; while secretaries manned cameras, Gyngell himself directed the show. Although shambolic at times, this schedule turned out on occasions to be more popular than former programming (although not {{what they would have}} been allowed to broadcast under any other circumstances). In the hurricane-force storms that hit England in October that year electrical power to TV-am's studios was lost and an emergency programme had to be transmitted from facilities at Thames Television's Euston Road centre, using reports from TV-am's own crews and those of ITN, TSW and TVS. All this notwithstanding, the programme continued to thrive. Eventually, Bruce Gyngell fired all of the locked-out technicians, replacing them with non-unionised labour from around the world.|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two <b>locking</b> rollers, a <b>striker</b> sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
