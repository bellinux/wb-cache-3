5|$|Having {{reached a}} hill behind his army's {{original}} position, Alexios began to regroup his army from the units that had broken. He sent out messengers to rally his scattered men with news that Bryennios had been killed, showing his parade horse as evidence. At the same time, the promised Turkish reinforcements began {{arriving at the}} scene, <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> men's morale. All the while, on the battlefield, Bryennios's army had closed around Alexios's Franks, who dismounted and offered to surrender. In the process the rebel army had become totally disordered, with units mixed and their formations disordered. Bryennios's reserves had been thrown in confusion by the Pecheneg attack, while his front lines relaxed, thinking that the battle was over.|$|E
5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of the savior. During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for past actions by doing so.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} before his 22nd birthday, on 15 February 1944, Schnaufer and his crew claimed aerial {{victories}} 45 to 47. Bomber Command had sent 561 Lancasters and 314 Halifax four-engined bombers, supported by de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters and bombers, destined for Berlin. Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains all day, and his crew returned to Leeuwarden at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday over the intercom. Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E

25|$|After winning {{everything}} on the club level, Alvertis was still thirsty for titles nonetheless. In the 2001–02 season he led the Panathinaikos offense along with the great Dejan Bodiroga, Damir Mulaomerović and İbrahim Kutluay, averaging 10.2 points per game; in the EuroLeague Final against Kinder Bologna, he scored 11 points, showing great leadership throughout the game.

40|$|Pollard et al. 1 {{analysed}} men’s Grand Slam set scores over {{a ten-year}} period {{and found that}} the scores depend to some extent on progress during a match. They fitted a model to account for this dependency in the data and concluded the following. The better player <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning a set in certain situations. These situations are: 1. The player is behind in the set score, needs to <b>lift</b> <b>his</b> game, and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning the next set by (on average) 0. 035; 2. The player has just won a set, is ‘on-a-run’, and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning the next set by (on average) 0. 035; 3. The player has just lost two sets in a row, desperately needs to <b>lift</b> <b>his</b> game, and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> probability of winning each remaining set by (on average) 0. 110, a substantial amount. In this article, the above results are used to determine what proportion of a match win can be attributed to a player’s ability (by assuming no memory of the scoreboard) and what proportion of a match win {{can be attributed to the}} psychological affects when a scoreboard is present. Further analysis is carried out to determine how the percentages of points won on serve vary as the match progresses from set to set. These results could be used in the training and coaching of players...|$|R

25|$|Dempsey {{scored a}} brace {{in the first}} leg of Fulham's 2011–12 Europa League {{play-off}} clash against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk at Craven Cottage. Dempsey ended with two goals as Fulham ran out 3–0 winners, setting up a comfortable second leg in Ukraine. On December 5, 2011, Dempsey scored in the 85th minute to secure a 1–0 win against Liverpool at Craven Cottage. The goal propelled Dempsey to become the most prolific U.S. goalscorer in the Premier League, passing Fulham legend and fellow American Brian McBride. Dempsey scored his fifth Premier League goal of the campaign with a header in a 2–0 home win against Bolton on December 17, <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> side six points clear of the drop zone.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{where it was}} difficult for teams to alter their car's race set-ups because of strong crosswinds, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at one minute and 39.085 seconds on super-soft compound tyres; Rosberg was three-thousands of a second slower in second and had the fastest time until Hamilton's lap. Both Mercedes cars had reliability concerns with Hamilton reporting another gearbox problem and his session ended early because of a minor hydraulic issue. Rosberg had an downshifting concern which he later attributed to hitting his clutch pedal after <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> leg. Alonso was third-fastest, followed by Ricciardo, Massa (who locked his brakes lightly and later spun his car) and Kimi Räikkönen. Kvyat, Magnussen, Button and Hülkenberg followed in the top ten. Romain Grosjean and his teammate Pastor Maldonado both spun in their tight-handling Lotus cars and both drivers went off into the run-off area multiple times.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was {{swinging}} his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> shoulder at the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} poorest matches in WrestleMania history.|$|E
25|$|Three centuries were {{recorded}} at Old Trafford, as Gloucestershire Gladiators snatched {{a victory over}} the hosting Lancashire Lightning after being regarded with no chance earlier on. The Gladiators won the toss and got immediate success, as Jon Lewis dismissed Mal Loye with the second ball of the day, but pretty much everything went against Gloucestershire from then on, as Stuart Law, Mark Chilton and Andrew Symonds flayed the bowling to all corners. Symonds took 88 balls for his century, {{and went on to}} make 129 before being bowled by James Averis - who finished with four for 40. Law and Chilton also made fifties, but Averis' late spell and a slow 39-ball 11 from Marcus North ensured that the total ended on 267 for 7. Then, James Anderson had three men caught off his bowling, as Gloucestershire crashed to 47 for 4. However, Anderson finished his spell, and Ramnaresh Sarwan crafted a century - which was shortly followed by Mark Hardinges reaching his first one-day century of his career, and in the process <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> List A career batting average from 14.23 to 17.50, still below par for a specialist batsman like Hardinges. However, the pair added 221 runs in 116 minutes for the fifth wicket, hitting six sixes along the way, as they guided Gloucestershire out of the relegation zone in the National League.|$|E

500|$|While Chaplin's comedic {{style is}} broadly defined as slapstick, it is {{considered}} restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing {{his work as a}} mix of [...] "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] and [...] "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" [...] are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.|$|E
500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E
500|$|Wheelwright {{received}} intelligence {{concerning this}} publication {{at about the}} time he received the letter <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> banishment with its unwarranted assumptions. He was deeply stung by the tenor of this work, coming {{at a time when he}} was making serious inroads into putting the events of the controversy behind him with the help and encouragement of some influential magistrates and ministers in the Bay Colony. He did not want his friends and relatives in England to get their impressions of his time in New England from this unfair account of those who had opposed him. To defend his character, Wheelwright obtained the assistance of some friends to help him publish a response to Short Story. In 1645, Mercurius Americanus was published in London under the name of John Wheelwright, Jr., presumably his son, who was in England attending Jesus College, Cambridge at the time. Bell says of this work, [...] "in tone and temper, it is incontestably superior to the Short Story, and, while devoted especially to the vindication of its author's doctrinal views, agreeably to the school of polemics then in vogue, it contains some key retorts upon his detractors, and indicates a mind trained to logical acuteness, and imbued with the learning of the times".|$|E

500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary actually called my agent and said they wanted me to come back to take another look at me. They liked me and it worked out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E
500|$|On {{the third}} morning, England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 {{in the same}} over. This left Australia {{struggling}} at 68/3. Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test, joined Miller at the crease. Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner [...] "Let's get stuck into 'em". If England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead. The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker. Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six, but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, prompting Wisden to liken it to a [...] "hurricane". Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut, scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of}} the wicket. The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England's firm control. Loxton was particularly severe on Laker, <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours. At the other end, Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329/6.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{began his}} high school career playing second base; his coach, Don Morrison, said, [...] "I was {{considering}} moving him to short, but I was unsure if his arm was strong enough." [...] Despite Morrison's concerns, Ripken did move to shortstop as a sophomore, combining strong fielding with a team-leading 10 runs batted in (RBI). Needing pitching help, the Aberdeen Eagles began using Ripken as a pitcher as well in his junior year. He responded by striking out 55 batters in [...] innings pitched with three shutouts while batting [...]339 with 21 hits and nine RBI. He was named the Harford County Most Valuable Player (MVP) while helping Aberdeen become county champions {{for the first time}} since 1959. During his senior year, Ripken again had a strong season, <b>lifting</b> <b>his</b> batting average to [...]688 at one point and posting a 0.79 ERA with 45 strikeouts over his first 26 innings. In the playoffs, Ripken pitched the state championship game against Thomas Stone High School. The Eagles trailed 3–1 when Ripken, noting that rain was coming and that the game would be cancelled and replayed since the Eagles had not yet played the fourth inning, made nine throws to first base to ensure the game would be replayed. When the game was played the next week, Ripken struck out 17, allowed two hits, and threw a complete game as Aberdeen won the state championship.|$|E
