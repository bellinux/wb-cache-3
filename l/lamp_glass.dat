The possibilities for use lamp bore-silicate glass powder as cement replacing admixture in conventional concrete have been investigated in this work. Experimental work provides preparation of standard concrete samples and sample testing after the 7 and 28 day ageing period in standard condition. The following glass materials were used for cement replacement: rough ground glass powder, glass dust from filters (both materials were obtained from glass treatment plant) and additionally ground glass powder. The effect of glass powder on cement setting time was investigated. The experimental results indicate that cement replacing by rough glass powder decrease compressive strength. Fine glass particles make possible to replace up to 20 of cement without loss in strength characteristics. Fine glass powder performs long-term hardening effect. The best compressive strength results were achieved by using 60 minutes ground glass, glass dust obtained from filters gives smaller effect. Summarizing results of investigation it may be concluded that ground bore-silicate <b>lamp</b> <b>glass</b> successfully may be applied as micro filler for concrete as cement replacing material...|$|E
