5|$|One of the {{conditions}} of the NHL's participation in the Olympics is to include regular NHL referees and <b>linesmen</b> in the tournament, {{despite the fact that they}} are American or Canadian, and thus gives the perception of American or Canadian bias in the officiating.|$|E
5|$|Early games {{did not use}} any on-field {{officials}} but {{disputes between}} the players would be referred to a committee member. Umpires were introduced {{by the end of}} 1862. Two umpires were used; one from each club. The off-field referee was introduced for the Youdan Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871. The umpires would then appeal to the referee on behalf of their team. The concept was later introduced to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the referee moved onto the pitch and the umpires became <b>linesmen.</b> The umpire's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874.|$|E
5000|$|A three-official {{system uses}} only the referee, head <b>linesman,</b> and line judge, {{or in some}} cases, referee, umpire, and head <b>linesman.</b> It is common {{in junior high school}} and youth football.|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} Football League <b>linesman</b> in 1980 {{and two years}} later {{graduated}} to the referees' List. He was senior <b>linesman</b> to Peter Willis in the 1985 FA Cup Final between Manchester United and Everton.|$|R
5000|$|George Hayes (1914-87). Born in Montreal but {{grew up in}} Ingersoll. NHL <b>linesman,</b> 1945-65. The first <b>linesman</b> to work 1,000 games. Elected (posthumously) to the NHL Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988. Retired in Ingersoll.|$|R
5|$|The {{extended}} period of power outage was {{a major problem for}} the residents in Broome. Residents had to wait for days for the power supply to be restored. As all of the distribution lines were above ground, Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones. <b>Linesmen</b> from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect all high voltage distribution lines before these could be re-energised. Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion. These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected. The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April, 11days after Rosita struck. Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth, and this proved difficult to access information about any available supplies in the town. People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no fresh produce arriving. However, power was restored {{a few days after the}} cyclone hit. There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily <b>linesmen</b> Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E

He became Chairman of the Referees' Association and of the Association of Football League Referees and <b>Linesmen,</b> eventually taking up the position of President for the latter organisation.|$|E
25|$|In {{association}} football, <b>linesmen</b> carry small flags {{along the}} touch lines. They use the flags to indicate to the referee potential infringements of the laws, or who {{is entitled to}} possession of the ball that {{has gone out of}} the field of play, or, most famously, raising the flag to indicate an offside offence. Officials called touch judges use flags for similar purposes in both codes of rugby.|$|E

The Eagles side was an all-star team that played against a UK select all-star team. The match officials were referee Moray Hanson and <b>linesmen</b> Alan Craig and Rab Cowan.|$|E
25|$|Substitution infraction (Illegal Substitution) : This rare bench minor {{penalty is}} called when a {{substitution}} or addition is attempted during a stoppage of play after the <b>linesmen</b> have signalled no more substitutions (once the face-off is set) or if a team pulls its goaltender and then attempts {{to have the}} goaltender re-enter play at any time other than during a stoppage of play. Too many men on the ice and/or starting the wrong lineup can also simply be called a substitution infraction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Linesmen</b> are {{responsible}} for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee and also for conferring with the referee. The fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions, and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled {{to him by the}} referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board. The umpires {{are responsible}} for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 65 m puck (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), or a goal (wave green flag).|$|E

Hewitt said: [...] "I don't think I said anything racial out there. It was a conversation between me and the umpire".|$|R

25|$|Ball's tenure saw City {{narrowly}} avoid relegation by finishing 20th in 1991–92 and 19th in 1992–93. In December 1992, {{part of the}} floodlights failed {{with just}} six minutes left in City's home FA Cup game against Swansea City. The Grecians were losing 2-1 at the time, and when the referee tried to restart the match with {{only half of the}} floodlights working, City fans invaded the pitch and sat in the goalmouth. Once they were removed, the match restarted once more, only for the floodlights to fail one minute later; after which the match was abandoned. City lost the rescheduled match 5-2. City again made the headlines at the end the 1992–93 season, this time for all the wrong reasons. In the penultimate game of the season, City needed a win against Port Vale to avoid relegation. City were leading 1-0, but referee Bob Hamer awarded Port Vale a controversial penalty in stoppage time. The penalty was converted and, after the final whistle, City supporters invaded the pitch, the referee was knocked to the ground and one of the <b>linesmen</b> was assaulted. Manager Alan Ball also ran onto the pitch to remonstrate with Hamer and had to be pulled away by his backroom staff. The season did have a positive for City, as they completed a league double over rivals Plymouth Argyle.|$|E
500|$|In {{a single}} fight {{situation}} the <b>linesmen</b> will {{communicate with each}} other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together. [...] If both players are still standing while the <b>linesmen</b> enter, the <b>linesmen</b> will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the <b>linesmen</b> will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most <b>linesmen</b> will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the <b>linesmen</b> then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.|$|E
500|$|Throughout a game, {{the referee}} and <b>linesmen</b> {{have a role}} in {{preventing}} fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc. Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and <b>linesmen</b> have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by [...] "common sense", according to officials.|$|E

500|$|In a {{multiple}} fight situation the <b>linesmen</b> will normally break up fights together, one fight {{at a time}} using the same procedures for a single fight. The <b>linesmen</b> will {{communicate with each other}} which fight to break up. In {{a multiple}} fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a [...] "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the <b>linesmen</b> need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks, [...] and not assaulting referees or <b>linesmen.</b> Finally, whatever {{the outcome of the}} fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.|$|E
500|$|Heikkinen {{received}} 226points in the United Press poll, {{the fifth}} highest total in the balloting. The UP noted: “He dominated the voting for guards on ballots from the East, West, South and North. He has a trick on defense of jamming the opposition line {{and making a}} hole for a teammate to go through and get the ball carrier. On offense, he excels in swinging out to lead the interference and often gets in two blocks on a play. Motion pictures of the Ohio State-Michigan game show Heikkinen jamming opposing <b>linesmen</b> back from one to three yards on almost every play. He is so good that professional teams have approached him, {{but he wants to}} study law.” ...|$|E
