The aircraft tanks were to be pressurised to suppress pump cavitation problems.|$|E
25|$|These {{capacitors}} {{have a low}} {{dissipation factor}} and because of their relatively temperature-independent electrical properties of about ±80nbsp&ppm over the entire temperature range, they had many applications for <b>low-loss</b> and temperature-stable applications such as timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions. PC film capacitors had been manufactured since the mid-1950s, but the main supplier of polycarbonate film for capacitors had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000. As a result, most of the manufacturers of polycarbonate film capacitors worldwide had to stop their production of PC film capacitors and changed to polypropylene film capacitors instead. Most of the former PC capacitor applications have found satisfactory substitutes with PP film capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The first industrially {{practical}} polyethylene synthesis (diazomethane is {{a notoriously}} unstable substance that is generally avoided in industrial application) {{was discovered in}} 1933 by Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson, again by accident, at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) works in Northwich, England. Upon applying extremely high pressure (several hundred atmospheres) to a mixture of ethylene and benzaldehyde they again produced a white, waxy material. Because the reaction had been initiated by trace oxygen contamination in their apparatus, the experiment was, at first, difficult to reproduce. It was not until 1935 that another ICI chemist, Michael Perrin, developed this accident into a reproducible high-pressure synthesis for polyethylene that {{became the basis for}} industrial LDPE production beginning in 1939. Because polyethylene was found to have very <b>low-loss</b> properties at very high frequency radio waves, commercial distribution in Britain was suspended on the outbreak of World War II, secrecy imposed, and the new process was used to produce insulation for UHF and SHF coaxial cables of radar sets. During World War II, further research was done on the ICI process and in 1944 Bakelite Corporation at Sabine, Texas, and Du Pont at Charleston, West Virginia, began large-scale commercial production under license from ICI.|$|E

500|$|Waveguides are a <b>low-loss</b> medium. [...] Losses in waveguides mostly {{come from}} ohmic {{dissipation}} caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls. [...] Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide {{and is usually}} the preferred format, but the TE01 circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications. [...] Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls. [...] In some applications which require rigorous filtering, the walls are plated with {{a thin layer of}} gold or silver to improve surface conductivity. [...] An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss, high selectivity, and linear group delay from their filters.|$|E
2500|$|Butterworth {{solved the}} {{equations}} for two- and four-pole filters, showing how the latter could be cascaded when separated by vacuum tube amplifiers and so enabling {{the construction of}} higher-order filters despite inductor losses. In 1930, <b>low-loss</b> core materials such as molypermalloy had not been discovered and air-cored audio inductors were rather lossy. [...] Butterworth discovered {{that it was possible}} to adjust the component values of the filter to compensate for the winding resistance of the inductors.|$|E
2500|$|Materials can be {{classified}} according to their complex-valued permittivity , upon comparison of its real [...] and imaginary [...] components (or, equivalently, conductivity, , when accounted for in the latter). A perfect conductor has infinite conductivity, , while a perfect dielectric is a material that has no conductivity at all, this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name lossless media. Generally, when [...] we consider the material to be a <b>low-loss</b> dielectric (although not exactly lossless), whereas [...] {{is associated with a}} good conductor; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of loss that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be lossy media. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{with the price}} of copper {{steadily}} rising, the original RG6 was dropped in favour of a construction that used a copper-clad steel core and aluminium braid on aluminium foil. Its lower price made it attractive to aerial installers looking for a replacement for the so-called <b>low-loss</b> cable traditionally used for UK terrestrial aerial installations. This cable had been manufactured with a decreasing number of strands of braid, as the price of copper increased, such that the shielding performance of cheaper brands had fallen to as low as 40 percent.
