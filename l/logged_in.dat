40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the special}} {{geometric}} shape and narrow space of exploration tunnel, field geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnels has always been staying at manual drafting stage with low efficiency and low level of informatization. This paper studies the existing issues of photographic geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnel, including the control method, image acquisition method, geometric correction of original images and the generation of display images, etc. This paper realizes fast acquisition and processing of the image data of geological logging, meeting the accuracy requirement of photographic geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnels, filling the vacancy of photographic geological <b>logging</b> technologies <b>in</b> exploration tunnels, improving the efficiency, level of automation and informatization of geological <b>logging</b> <b>in</b> exploration tunnels...|$|R

25|$|Common on forums, a {{subscription}} {{is a form}} of automated notification integrated into the software of most forums. It usually notifies either by email or on the site when the member returns.

25|$|On Unix-like {{operating}} systems, {{the output}} of the command is slightly different from $USER because whoami outputs the username that the user is working under, whereas $USER outputs the username that was used to log in. For example, if the user <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> as John and su into root, whoami displays root and echo $USER displays John. This is because the su command does not invoke a login shell by default.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{were red}} cedar cutters, who were first recorded as having visited and <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> {{the area in}} 1814. As in much of coastal New South Wales, the cleared land was used for dairy farming and cedar cutting died out, as the cedar trees disappeared. Dairy farming became the predominant primary industry and remains so to this day. Gerringong had a small boat harbour used for the export of cedar and dairy produce.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, many UK Internet {{users were}} unable to edit Wikipedia pages unless {{registered}} and <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> with Wikipedia. This {{is reported to be}} due to the single blacklisted article causing all Wikipedia traffic from ISPs using the system to be routed through a transparent proxy server. Wikipedia distinguishes unlogged-in users from each other by their IP address, so interpreted all unlogged-in users from a particular ISP as a single user editing massively from the proxy address, which triggered Wikipedia's anti-abuse mechanism, blocking them.|$|E
25|$|Pictures of {{the once}} majestic trees broken and {{abandoned}} in formerly pristine groves, {{and the thought}} of the giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused most of the groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at Big Stump Grove near General Grant Grove. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> Sequoia National Forest, publicity of which helped lead to the creation of Giant Sequoia National Monument.|$|E
