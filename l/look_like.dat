The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which <b>look</b> <b>like</b> automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|E
5|$|It's like a 90's, throwback-type vibe, when I said 'I {{want it to}} <b>look</b> <b>like</b> this,' I said like a TLC, Fresh Prince type vibe. I was like, 'Let's {{just get}} really silly, 90's amazing outfits, and {{just go out and}} dance around and have fun.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{argues for}} the need to study cells with {{physical}} methods, as morphology alone had little explanatory value. He notes that in mitosis the dividing cells <b>look</b> <b>like</b> iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a force field.|$|E
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films <b>look</b> <b>like</b> those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, {{five of the six}} 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E

5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons <b>look</b> <b>like</b> small dots.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{vehicles}} were released throughout the line. For the Battle Beast line, three chariots and three bases were released that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> animals, each came with one figure that was not unique to the vehicle. The chariots were able to hold up to three figures comfortably and each had its own name: Tearin' Tiger, which <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a tiger, Big Horn which <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a ram and Deer Stalker which <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a deer. All the chariots had a pull-back motion that would spring the vehicle forward when it was released.|$|R
5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate.

Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail <b>look</b> <b>like</b> bird droppings.|$|E
2500|$|There were 33 {{letters in}} Jaᶇalif; nine were for vowels. The {{apostrophe}} {{was used for}} the glottal stop (həmzə/hämzä) and was sometimes sorted as a letter.

The letter Ꞑ ᶇ [...] ( [...] ) <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> N n/ŋ [...] which has a descender as in Cyrillic letters Щ, Җ, Ң. The letter no. 33 (similar to Zhuang Ƅ) isn't represented in Unicode, but it <b>looks</b> exactly <b>like</b> Cyrillic soft sign (Ь).

5|$|During her narrative, Penelope expresses {{opinions}} on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades. She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life. Penelope identifies Odysseus' specialty as making people <b>look</b> <b>like</b> fools and wonders why his stories have survived so long, despite being an admitted liar. She dispels the rumour that she slept with Amphinomus and the rumour that she slept {{with all the}} suitors and consequently gave birth to Pan.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
