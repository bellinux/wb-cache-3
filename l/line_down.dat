5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a <b>line</b> <b>down</b> {{the middle of}} the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E
5|$|In Super Bowl XLII, the Giants {{defeated}} the previously unbeaten New England Patriots 17–14. The signature {{play of the}} game came on a 3rd-and-5, with the Giants on their own 44-yard <b>line,</b> <b>down</b> 14–10, and 1:15 remaining in the 4th quarter. Manning dropped back to pass, but was surrounded by New England pass rushers. Escaping three tackles, he threw a long pass to David Tyree, who caught the ball against his own helmet, while being covered by Patriots safety Rodney Harrison. Four plays later, Manning threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress with 35 seconds left. Manning won the game's MVP award by completing 19 of 34 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns. The Giants' win {{is considered one of the}} biggest upsets in Super Bowl history.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Street Shuttle was {{constructed}} {{and operated by}} the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), but is currently part of the A Division of New York City Transit, and the tracks that it uses opened in 1904 {{as part of the}} first subway in the city. The original line ran north from City Hall on what is now the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to 42nd Street, from where it turned west to run across 42nd Street. Then, at Broadway, the line turned north to 145th Street on what is now the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. This operation continued until 1918, when construction on the Lexington Avenue Line north of 42nd Street, and on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line south of 42nd Street was completed. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>down</b> Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway. The section in the middle, via 42nd Street, was converted into shuttle operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her <b>line</b> <b>down</b> to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete {{the account of the}} descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E
5|$|After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{started its}} first drive {{of the second}} half at its 20-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Down</b> by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall {{prevented}} Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the defensive line. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the rest}} of the front line between Albert to beyond Dernancourt was also being heavily attacked. In the north, forward troops of the 48th Battalion were firing almost {{continuously}} from the railway line. Attacked by elements of III/229 RIR supported by minenwerfers firing from a copse south of Albert, the 48th Battalion easily beat off every German assault. This was despite being caught in enfilade by a machine gun sited on the bridge where the Albert–Amiens road crossed the railway line. Leane directed artillery onto the wood south of Albert from which the minenwerfers were firing. This was the same wood upon which the S.O.S. line of the 10th AFA Brigade had been laid. As the Germans were assembling for a renewed assault, a stray British shell exploded a munitions dump, scattering panicked troops of II/229 RIR, many of whom were then shot down by the Australians. The 48th lost only three officers and 59 men during the day's fighting. Wary of sending reinforcements from his support <b>line</b> <b>down</b> the exposed slope to the railway line, Leane only sent four men with two Lewis guns forward during the daylight hours. During the day, the right of the 48th was steadily extended to allow the 47th Battalion to move right in turn.|$|E

25|$|A {{road surface}} marking is {{any kind of}} device or {{material}} that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians. Edward N.

25|$|In {{addition}} to his inspection of the Cinderhill section on 1 January, Major Pringle also included the Carlton extension.

The Derby Road and Arnold extensions followed.|$|E

25|$|At one time, Modesto was the {{operational}} {{center of the}} Tidewater Southern Railway, which had its main <b>line</b> <b>down</b> the center of Ninth Street, a major north-south street. A city ordinance passed by the city council kept electric power lines over this section of street activated long after the railroad had converted to steam power. In 2000, the last trains ran down Ninth Street. Now the railroad (owned by the Union Pacific Railroad since 1983) no longer passes through Modesto.|$|E

The vehicle also made use, of glass-fibre reinforced plastic for certain areas of the body, this was the first instance when this technique was used.

25|$|The idea {{of running}} a rail <b>line</b> <b>down</b> Hiawatha Avenue had already been around {{for at least a}} decade by the time the {{decision}} was made to go forward. In 1985, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had produced an Environmental Impact Statement that concluded that light rail was the best alternative for the corridor. In 1996, the document was examined again as Mn/DOT looked at the possibility of adding bus rapid transit along the road, but money for light rail became available soon after, leading to the current layout.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of April, the water level reached {{the area of the}} inactive San Francisquito Fault line in the western abutment. Some seepage began almost immediately as the water covered this area. Workers were ordered to seal off the leak, but they were not entirely successful and water continued to permeate through the face of the dam. A two-inch pipe collecting this seepage was laid from the fault <b>line</b> <b>down</b> to the home of the dam keeper, Tony Harnischfeger, which he used for domestic purposes. Water that collected in the drainage pipes under the dam to relieve the hydrostatic uplift pressure was carried off in this manner as well.|$|E
