5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community {{constitutional}} referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de <b>Liste</b> voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E

These lost inscriptions are partly known from graphical documentation made by King Stanislaus Augustus's court painter, Johann Christoph Werner, in 1764 and by Jacek Przybylski in 1792. One of the plates had already been broken by that time with only part of the inscription preserved: <b>Liste</b> est glaud... h Bolezlai Duc... ("This is a sword of... Duke Boleslaus..."); the inscription on the other plate continued: Cum quo ei Dn SOS [...] auxiletur adsus partes amen ("With whom is the Omnipotent Lord and Savior, to help him against his enemies. Amen"). The missing part of the first inscription is only known from an old replica of Szczerbiec which once belonged to the Radziwiłł family (see Historical replicas below). The full inscription read: Iste est gladius Principis et haeredis Boleslai Ducis Poloniae et Masoviae, Lanciciae ("This is a sword of Hereditary Prince Boleslaus, Duke of Poland, Masovia, and Łęczyca").

40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} two goals: {{to report on}} the trialling of {{fourteen}} 1, 000 word-family lists made from the British National Corpus, and to use these lists to see what vocabulary size is needed for unassisted comprehension of written and spoken English. The trialling showed that the lists were properly sequenced and there were no glaring omissions from the lists. If 98 % coverage of a text is needed for unassisted comprehension, then a 8, 000 to 9, 000 word-family vocabulary is needed for comprehension of written text and a vocabulary of 6, 000 to 7, 000 for spoken text. Résumé: L’article a pour objectif de parler des essais menés sur quatorze <b>listes</b> de 1 000 familles de mots tirées du British National Corpus et de l’emploi de ces <b>listes</b> pour évaluer la taille du vocabulaire nécessaire afin de comprendre sans aide l’anglais oral et écrit. Les essais ont révélé que les <b>listes</b> sont adéquatement triées et ne contiennent aucune omission manifeste. Si on doit connaître 98 % des mots d’un texte pour le comprendre sans aide, il faut un vocabulaire de 8 000 à 9 000 familles de mots pour comprendre un texte écrit et un vocabulaire de 6 000 à 7 000 mots pour un texte oral. How much vocabulary? This article sets out to see how large a receptive vocabulary is needed for typical language use like reading a novel, reading a newspaper, watching a movie, and taking part in a conversation. There are several ways of deciding how many words a learner of English as a second or foreign language needs to know to read without external support. The most ambitious is to try to work out how many words there are in English and to see that as a learning goal. Studies that have tried to do this have come up with figures of 114, 000 word-familie...|$|R
40|$|Most {{articles}} on strategic breakthroughs tend {{to concentrate on}} large, high-tech organizations. Yet the French firm 1001 <b>Listes,</b> which creates and manages wedding lists, has shown {{that it is possible}} for even a relatively small organization to generate strategic breakthroughs with standard off-the-shelf information technology. Its experience highlights two points that previous studies have overlooked: Breakthrough strategies are based on innovations in business models as well as innovations in technology, and breakthrough strategies may actually reduce a company's reliance on high-tech solutions as a means of maintaining its competitive advantage. Using Henderson and Venkatraman's (1993) model of strategic alignment, this article also outlines the nature of breakthrough strategies. ...|$|R

We study the statistical properties of obtained SAA estimators. In particular we show that under moderate conditions a sequence of weak stationary points of SAA programs converge to a weak stationary point of the true problem with probability approaching one at exponential rate as the sample size tends to infinity. To implement the SAA method more efficiently, we incorporate the method with some techniques such as Scholtes' regularization method and the well known smoothing NCP method. Some preliminary numerical results are reported...|$|R
