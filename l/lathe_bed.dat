50|$|A lathe {{may or may}} {{not have}} legs, which sit on the floor and elevate the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> to a working height. A lathe may be small and sit on a {{workbench}} or table, not requiring a stand.|$|E
50|$|Some lathes {{have only}} one {{leadscrew}} that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For screw cutting, a half nut is engaged {{to be driven by}} the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into the leadscrew to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} encloses a large {{open space}} and four small rooms. It contains three workbenches, a drill stand, a shelf with nuts, bolts and spare parts, a <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> and an air receiver (about 2.2m by 05m). A largely intact, Jenbach JW15 underground locomotive and spare locomotive engine are also located in the workshop.|$|E
50|$|In {{the craft}} of woodturning, a banjo is a common term for a fixture on the wood lathe, mounted on the <b>lathe's</b> <b>bed,</b> for holding the toolrest. It allows for {{adjustment}} of the toolrest in various positions, by the lathe operator, {{making it possible to}} hold the turning tool in the most convenient position for removing material from the spinning wood. The chosen position of the fixture can be locked in place on the <b>lathe's</b> <b>bed</b> in various ways, the most common method being a lever at the forward end of the fixture which acts upon an eccentric shaft with an attached clamp to secure the fixture to the <b>lathe's</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Almost all <b>lathes</b> have a <b>bed,</b> {{which is}} (almost always) a {{horizontal}} beam (although CNC lathes commonly have an inclined or vertical beam for a bed {{to ensure that}} swarf, or chips, falls free of the <b>bed).</b> Woodturning <b>lathes</b> specialized for turning large bowls often have no bed or tail stock, merely a free-standing headstock and a cantilevered tool rest.|$|R
5000|$|Boring : Enlarging or {{smoothing}} {{an existing}} hole created by drilling, moulding etc.i.e. the machining of internal cylindrical forms (generating) a) by mounting workpiece to the spindle via a chuck or faceplate b) by mounting workpiece onto the cross slide and placing cutting tool into the chuck. This work {{is suitable for}} castings that are too awkward to mount in the face plate. On long <b>bed</b> <b>lathes</b> large workpiece can be bolted to a fixture {{on the bed and}} a shaft passed between two lugs on the workpiece and these lugs can be bored out to size. A limited application but one that is available to the skilled turner/machinist.|$|R
50|$|Glass-working lathes {{are similar}} in design to other lathes, but differ {{markedly}} in how the workpiece is modified. Glass-working lathes slowly rotate a hollow glass vessel over a fixed- or variable-temperature flame. The source of the flame may be either hand-held or mounted to a banjo/cross-slide that can be moved along the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed.</b> The flame serves to soften the glass being worked, so that the glass in a specific area of the workpiece becomes ductile and subject to forming either by inflation ("glassblowing") or by deformation with a heat-resistant tool. Such lathes usually have two head-stocks with chucks holding the work, arranged so that they both rotate together in unison. Air can be introduced through the headstock chuck spindle for glassblowing. The tools to deform the glass and tubes to blow (inflate) the glass are usually handheld.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} wood defines {{woodturning}} techniques. The {{orientation of the}} wood grain, relative to the axis of the lathe, affects the tools and techniques used by the woodturner. In spindle turning, the grain runs lengthwise along the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed,</b> as if a log were mounted in the lathe. Grain is thus always perpendicular to the direction of rotation under the tool. In bowl turning, the grain runs {{at right angles to}} the axis, as if a plank were mounted across the chuck. When a bowl blank rotates, the angle that the grain makes with the cutting tool continually changes between the easy cuts to two places per rotation where the tool is cutting across the grain and even upwards across it. This varying grain angle limits some of the tools that may be used and requires additional skill from the turner.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} lathe, often {{known as}} a 3-in-1 machine, introduces drilling or milling operations into {{the design of the}} lathe. These machines have a milling column rising up above the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed,</b> and they utilize the carriage and topslide as the X and Y axes for the milling column. The 3-in-1 name comes from {{the idea of having a}} lathe, milling machine, and drill press all in one affordable machine tool. These are exclusive to the hobbyist and MRO markets, as they inevitably involve compromises in size, features, rigidity, and precision in order to remain affordable. Nevertheless, they meet the demand of their niche quite well, and are capable of high accuracy given enough time and skill. They may be found in smaller, non-machine-oriented businesses where the occasional small part must be machined, especially where the exacting tolerances of expensive toolroom machines, besides being unaffordable, would be overkill for the application from an engineering perspective.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} lathes are [...] "jewelers lathes" [...] or [...] "watchmaker lathes", {{which are}} small {{enough that they}} may be held in one hand. The workpieces machined on a jeweler's lathe are metal. Jeweler's lathes can be used with hand-held [...] "graver" [...] tools or with compound rests that attach to the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed.</b> Graver tools are generally supported by a T-rest, not fixed to a cross slide or compound rest. The work is usually held in a collet. Common spindle bore sizes are 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The term W/W refers to the Webster/Whitcomb collet and lathe, invented by the American Watch Tool Company of Waltham, Massachusetts. Most lathes commonly referred to as watchmakers lathes are of this design. In 1909, the American Watch Tool company introduced the Magnus type collet (a 10-mm body size collet) using a lathe of the same basic design, the Webster/Whitcomb Magnus. (F.W.Derbyshire, Inc. retains the trade names Webster/Whitcomb and Magnus and still produces these collets.) Two bed patterns are common: the WW (Webster Whitcomb) bed, a truncated triangular prism (found only on 8 and 10 mm watchmakers' lathes); and the continental D-style bar bed (used on both 6 mm and 8 mm lathes by firms such as Lorch and Star). Other bed designs have been used, such a triangular prism on some Boley 6.5 mm lathes, and a V-edged bed on IME's 8 mm lathes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} of the rigidity of an Al-Cu alloy <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> {{to be used for}} high speed machining (HSM) is presented in this work. Mechanical design optimization by means of simulations based on the finite element method (FEM) was applied in order to calculate the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> deflections, the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration amplitudes. For the parametric modeling, a prototype lathe to be used in conventional speed machining (CSM) with a cast iron bed was considered. The optimized parameter was the stress in the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed,</b> considering as a restriction the allowable deflection in a node of the machine-tool structure. The design variables were the height, the thickness, and the length of the wall of the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed.</b> The <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> was loaded with cutting and inertial forces due to HSM in order to demonstrate that the evaluated stresses and vibration amplitudes are in an acceptable level according to ISO Standards (system of limits and fits in workpieces). The results show the feasibility of using an Al-Cu alloy instead of cast iron in the fabrication of lathe beds. This increases the flexibility of manufacture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Gear {{machine tool}} {{main drive shaft}} to avoid {{resonance}} problem is studied. The force of the drive shaft is analyzed, and the vibration form of the drive shaft is confirmed. Using the lumped parameter method to simplify the main drive shaft, the lumped mass model and the force model were been obtained. When bending vibrating, the natural frequency of the main drive shaft is calculated using the transfer matrix method. The calculated critical speed is 43755 r/min, which far outweighs the motor rated speed. It means that the drive shaft under normal work won't be resonance, which accords with the request of production.

40|$|Almost 50 {{years ago}} Bob Brodkey and his student, Corino, {{conceived}} of {{and carried out}} a visualization experiment for the very near wall region of a turbulent pipe flow that, together with the turbulent boundary layer visualization of Kline et al., excited the turbulence research community. Using a high speed movie camera mounted on a <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> that recorded magnified images in a frame of reference moving with the flow, they observed the motions of sub-micron particles in the sub-, buffer- and log-layers. Surprisingly, these motions were not nearly so locally random as was the general view of turbulence at the time. Rather, connected regions of the near wall flow decelerated and then erupted {{away from the wall}} in what they called "ejections". These decelerated motions were followed by larger scale connected motions toward the wall from above that they called "sweeps". They estimated that ejections accounted for 70 % of the Reynolds shear stress at Re_d = 20, 000 while only occurring about 18 % of the time. This fluid dynamics video shows short sequences, at three Reynolds numbers, from the original Corino and Brodkey visual study. In the following decades it inspired numerous laboratory and simulation studies aimed at unraveling the structure of bounded turbulent flows and understanding the turbulent transport processes within them.
