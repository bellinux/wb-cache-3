Background Fracking is the process of recovering natural gas trapped by shale rock by injecting fluids (water, chemicals, proppant) at high pressure into horizontal wells. After a well is fracked, the recovered fluid must be disposed of. Currently, the majority of fracturing companies use open <b>loop</b> <b>systems.</b> The fluid is put into an evaporation pit with the intent of evaporating as much as possible before it is hauled away for processing.

The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage, to which various algorithmic transformations have been applied, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a tape <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds {{in some of his}} collaborations with Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Only ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage. At this time Eno was also affiliating with artists in the Fluxus movement.|$|E

500|$|Forest Park {{is a major}} {{component}} of a regional network of parks, trails, and natural areas managed by Metro. At the southeastern end of the park, Wildwood Trail, the centerpiece of the Forest Park trail system, passes through Macleay Park. This part of the larger park, which includes the Forest Park field headquarters, is heavily used by pedestrians entering Balch Creek Canyon from nearby city streets. [...] Further southeast, Wildwood Trail, while still in Forest Park, passes Pittock Mansion and its panoramic views of Portland and five volcanic peaks: Mounts Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, Hood, and Jefferson. Shortly thereafter, the trail connects to adjoining Washington Park and attractions such as the Oregon Zoo. From this point and from more remote Forest Park trailheads near the St. Johns Bridge, other components of the 40 Mile <b>Loop</b> <b>system</b> of trails encircle the city.

2500|$|In 1946, a consultant's study {{laid out}} {{a plan for a}} hub-spoke-and-wheel system of limited access {{highways}} for the D.C. metropolitan region, centered on the White House. The plan received support from prominent architects like Louis Justement and urban planners like Harland Bartholomew. Four years later, in 1950, the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which had statutory authority to approve planning in the D.C. metro area, issued A Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital and Its Environs. This planning document (written by Bartholomew) incorporated the highways proposed in the 1946 consultant's study. In 1954, the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia signed an agreement to jointly plan transportation in the region with the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission. In 1955, the District government hired a consultant, De Leuw, Cather & Company, to propose a new highway system in the city. They proposed a vast figure-eight centered within the boundaries of the original Federal City. The De Leuw, Cather study proved highly influential, and was incorporated (in modified form) into the plans of the intergovernmental regional planning effort. [...] In 1957, Senator Clifford P. Case introduced legislation that would require the District of Columbia to build a bridge across the Three Sisters connecting D.C. and Virginia.

A crew of one solar plumber and two assistants with minimal training can install a system per day. [...] Thermosiphon installation have negligible maintenance costs (costs rise if antifreeze and mains power are used for circulation) and in the US reduces a households' operating costs by $6 per person per month. Solar water heating can reduce CO2 emissions of a family of four by 1 ton/year (if replacing natural gas) or 3 ton/year (if replacing electricity).

The results are presented in the form of anomaly index diagrams plotted in complex space.

Both approaches show an onset of a strong positive effect at higher frequencies in the responses provided by both horizontal coplanar coil systems and by fixed <b>loop</b> <b>systems.</b> Agreement is also shown on an unanticipated negative effect that a conductive host causes in the responses provided by the vertical coplanar coincident coil system.
