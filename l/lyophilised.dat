They provide a springboard to identify important regulatory sites and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Due to their small size, Arabidopsis seeds pose a technical challenge for such measurements. A set of assays based on a novel enzymic cycling system between glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol- 3 -phosphate oxidase have been developed and optimised for use with growing Arabidopsis seeds. In combination with existing assays they provide a suite of high throughput, sensitive assays for the immediate precursors for starch (adenine diphosphate glucose) and lipid (acetyl coenzyme A, glycerol- 3 -phosphate) synthesis, as well as pyrophosphate, ATP, ADP and most of the glycolytic intermediates. A method is also presented to rapidly quench intact siliques, <b>lyophilise</b> them and then manually separate seeds for metabolite analysis.

40|$|The {{estimated}} antioxidant {{capacity of}} different matrices can vary considerably between research reports. Besides intrinsic factors (not studied here), our work showed {{that may have}} various causes. Firstly, different methods are used to measure antioxidant capacity. Secondly, the results obtained for a single matrix by one method (such as ORAC) can vary with the extraction conditions. Parameters having {{a great impact on}} the amount and composition of antioxidants in extracts, and thus on the measured antioxidant capacity, notably include the extraction solvent composition, temperature, extraction time (duration), solvent-to-solid ratio, and storage conditions. Standardization of the extraction procedure is thus necessary for accurate and reproducible determination of the antioxidant capacity and phenolics in different food matrices by different laboratories. In this study we optimised such a procedure for four fresh plant matrices (orange, apple, leek, and broccoli). The optimised procedure requires extraction in a mixture of acetone/water/acetic acid (70 / 28 / 2, v/v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C, with a solvent-to-solid ratio of 20 mL per 1 g.

40|$|Basidiomycetes present {{specific}} problems {{with regard to}} their preservation, because most of them do not form resistant propagules in culture but exist only as mycelium. Usually these fungi can only be preserved by serial transfer on agar (labour-intensive procedures that can increase the danger of variation or loss of physiological or morphological features), or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (expensive). Cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C and lyophilisation could be good alternatives. In this work we set up and tested six protocols of cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C, and 12 protocols of lyophilisation on 15 isolates of white-rot fungi (WRF) belonging to 10 species. The tested protocols were mainly characterized by the use of different growth media, protectants, time and number of perfusion with protectants and finally by the typology and origin of the samples to be cryopreserved (mycelium/agar plug, whole colony) or to <b>lyophilise</b> (mycelium/agar plug, mycelium fragment, whole colony). Cryopreservation and lyophilisation outcomes were checked, at morphological (macro- and microscopic features), physiological (growth rate and laccase, Mn-independent and Mn-dependent peroxidases activities) and genetic level (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms analysis - AFLP). Vitality of all fungi was successfully preserved by all cryopreservation protocols at - 80 degrees C, and by two lyophilisation methods. Our results showed that cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C did not produce morphological changes in any isolate, while two isolates were affected by lyophilisation. None of the physiological features were lost, even though growth rate and enzyme activities were somehow influenced by all preservation methods. AFLP analysis showed that only the two isolates that varied in their morphology after lyophilisation produced a different DNA fingerprint pattern in comparison with that obtained before lyophilisation. These findings provide evidence that cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C and lyophilisation are suitable alternatives to liquid nitrogen cryopreservation for preservation of some WRF strains.

The putative role of garlic in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and its effects on platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis, blood pressure, and blood lipids are reviewed Chapter 1. From this literature review, a series of hypotheses were generated to test the effect of garlic and other member of the Allium genus in in vitro platelet aggregation, and of <b>lyophilised</b> garlic in in vivo haemostasis and hypertension. The subsequent laboratory experiments and clinical trials were designed to test these hypotheses. Chapter 2 describes the laboratory methods used in the experiments on platelet function and fibrinolysis. The validation of the methods used for assessing platelet function and the statistical methods use are discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 describes four experiments on platelet function. In experiments 3. 1 and 3. 2, an extract of <b>lyophilised</b> garlic was demonstrated to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by five common agonists (ADP, PAF, collagen, AA and collagen) in a dose dependent manner measured as both area under the aggregation curve and serotonin release. In experiment 3. 3, <b>lyophilised</b> garlic and <b>lyophilised</b> extracts of other members of the Allium genus (leeks, onion, chives and spring onion) produced comparable inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by three agonists (ADP, PAF and collagen). In experiment 3. 4, <b>lyophilised</b> garlic, fresh garlic and air-dried garlic showed comparable inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by three agonists (ADP, PAF and collagen). However another preparation, aged garlic, had no inhibitory activity. Chapter 4 provides a discussion of these experiments and outlines possible mechanisms of action of <b>lyophilised</b> garlic in the process of platelet activation. Chapter 5 describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a cross-over design in healthy subjects on the effect of <b>lyophilised</b> garlic versus placebo on platelet aggregation and fibrinolysis. No effects of <b>lyophilised</b> garlic were found. Chapter 6 describes a radomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a three arm parallel group design in hypertensive subjects on the effect of <b>lyophilised</b> garlic, thiazide and placebo on blood pressure, blood lipids, platelet aggregation and fibrinolysis.

METHODS: The turbidities of 20 normal plasmas and 16 reconstituted <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas were determined by comparing a 1 in 4 dilution in distilled water with a standard suspension in an Aminco Fluorocolorimeter (American Instrument Co) in nephelometric mode. The turbidities of five other plasmas were determined before and after lyophilisation. The turbid components of fresh and reconstituted <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas were studied using electron microscopy. The effects of turbidity on five types of coagulometer were determined by adding varying concentrations of a turbidity enhancing material. RESULTS: Reconstituted <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas were more turbid than normal plasmas, because of agglomerated liposomes. Serum depleted of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins was not rendered more turbid by lyophilisation. Three out of five types of automated coagulometer tested gave activated partial thromboplastin times which were appreciably affected by plasma turbidity. One of the instruments was unable to detect a clot in a moderately turbid plasma. A second instrument gave results which were significantly affected by turbidity. Turbidity of the substrate plasma did not affect specific factor VIII assays in two types of coagulometer. CONCLUSIONS: Lyophilisation of plasma induces turbidity due to the agglomeration of lipids.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of a <b>lyophilised</b> calibrant plasma {{procedure}} on the international normalised ratio (INR) and its interlaboratory variation. METHODS: INR equivalent values were assigned to five <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas (one from normal donors and four from coumarin treated patients) by a reference laboratory using three calibrated thromboplastin reagents. The calibrant plasmas and five artificial control blood specimens were mailed to 44 Dutch laboratories for prothrombin time (PT) determination. The assigned INR values were used to calculate calibration lines for each participant laboratory. The calibration lines were then used to translate the PT of the control specimens to INR. RESULTS: For all <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas and control blood samples, there were significant differences between INR values determined with the three thromboplastin reagents. These differences could not be explained by inaccuracy of the international sensitivity index or mean normal PT of the reagents and must, therefore, have been induced by the preparation procedures for the <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas and control blood samples. The interlaboratory variation of the INR obtained with the calibrant plasma procedure had a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging between 2. 1 % and 7. 3 % and tended to be lower than the interlaboratory variation found with the usual methods (3. 0 - 12. 2 % CV). There was a good agreement between the mean INRs obtained with the calibrant procedure and those obtained using the normal methods. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the limitations of some <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas and control blood samples. It is not possible to assign a single INR value to each of these <b>lyophilised</b> plasmas and control specimens that is valid for all thromboplastin reagents. Nevertheless, by using reagent specific INR equivalent values for the calibrant plasma procedure, the interlaboratory variation could be reduced...|$|E
