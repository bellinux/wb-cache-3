5|$|The mid-ground shows a crowd scene {{above the}} group of mourners, {{separated}} by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground {{are reflected in the}} shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> the man to his right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground. Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.|$|E
5|$|In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York {{after she}} reveals {{that she is}} unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the {{encouragement}} of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Sindhu {{really has}} fallen for JKB {{and both of}} them get {{intimate}} with each other. One day, JKB is caught coming out of Sindhu's apartment by Bhairavi. Sindhu is seen as the home wrecker and is forced to quit her association with JKB. He pines for her and <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> alcohol for support, which sadly leads to his downward spiral ending in an embarrassing barter of his musical knowledge for a drink. He even steals money from Bhairavi's grandfather, which leads to his death. Sindhu reenters his life and brings him around, however she has a secret of her own, the secret of her pregnancy. After Sindhu brings back JKB from his alcoholic state, JKB's friends pressurize Sindhu to leave the town and to never come back, which she does the very next day. Both Bhairavi and JKB are distraught as Bhairavi had agreed to marry Sindhu to JKB.|$|E

25|$|Because of his fame, Khufu is {{the subject}} of several modern references, similar to kings and queens such as Akhenaten, Nefertiti and Tutankhamen. His {{historical}} figure appears in movies, novels and documentaries. In 1827, female sci-fi author Jane C. Loudon wrote the novel The Mummy! A Tale of the 22nd Century. The story describes the citizens of the 22nd century, which became highly advanced technologically, but totally immoral. Only the mummy of Khufu can save them. In 1939, Nagib Mahfuz wrote the novel Khufu's Wisdom, which <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> the stories of Papyrus Westcar. In 1997, French author Guy Brachet composed the novel series Le roman des pyramides, including five volumes, of which the first two (Le temple soleil and Rêve de pierre) use Khufu and his tomb as a theme. In 2004, Page Bryant wrote the sci-fi story The Second Coming of the Star Gods, which deals with Khufu's alleged celestial origin. The novel The Legend of The Vampire Khufu, written by Raymond Mayotte in 2010, deals with king Khufu awakening in his pyramid as a vampire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|Ian is pessimistic when Lucy {{decides to}} set up her own {{property}} business and later becomes concerned about her when he discovers she is sleeping with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and is taking cocaine. He confronts her and admits she is the child he is most proud of, but this is overheard by Peter, resulting in Lucy storming out. Ian tries to contact her when she does not return home that night, but is later informed by DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) that Lucy has been found dead. He identifies her body and then shares his devastating news with Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and finally Peter. Struggling with their grief, Ian and Jane share a passionate encounter, giving Ian hope that they might reunite. When Jane dashes his hopes, Ian takes his anger out on Bobby and Jane decides {{it would be best}} if she take Bobby away for a while. Cindy also leaves the Square to return to Devon with her aunt, Gina Williams. Increasingly alone, Ian <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> Phil for support and questions how he can move on from his daughter's death. With Peter's help, he stages an opening for the new and improved restaurant, but during opening night Summerhayes reveals that Lucy's body has been released for burial. Ian leaves early with Peter to see her, but is unable due to his grief. He wants to organise the funeral for as soon as possible but discovers that Max and Lucy were together; Ian angrily attacks Max as he carries Lucy's coffin down the aisle of the church and it is clear that Ian is not coping. Worried, Sharon believes that he is relying on pills to numb the pain of his grief and she and Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) comfort him.|$|E

500|$|While {{recording}} Music Box, Carey {{began to}} alter her songwriting style and genre choices, {{most notably in}} [...] "Dreamlover". The song is different from anything she had recorded on her previous album, as it <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> pop and light R influences. While searching for new record producers for the album, Carey came across Dave Hall, a New York native who was known from his work on Mary J. Blige's debut album, What's the 411? (1992). Carey wanted to incorporate a sampled loop from an older song into [...] "Dreamlover", her second song to do so. The pair reviewed several older tunes and melodies, and chose [...] "Blind Alley", performed by The Emotions in 1972. This song had previously been sampled in Big Daddy Kane's [...] "Ain't No Half-Steppin'", which led Mariah to use the sample for Dreamlover.|$|E
500|$|Another notable {{illuminated}} edition {{had been}} created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one decorative initial per page. Produced by chromolithography, each of its 35 pages was individually designed with two half stanzas in a box surrounded by coloured foliar and floral borders. An additional feature was the cover of deeply embossed brown leather made to imitate carved wood. A little earlier {{there had been a}} compositely illustrated work for which the librarian John Martin had been responsible. Having approached John Constable and other major artists for designs to illustrate the Elegy, these were then engraved on wood for the first edition in 1834. Some were reused in later editions, including the multilingual anthology of 1839 mentioned above. Constable's charcoal and wash study of the [...] "ivy-mantled tower" [...] in stanza 3 is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, as is his watercolour study of Stoke Poges church, while the watercolour for stanza 5, in which the narrator <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> a gravestone to survey the cemetery, is held at the British Museum (see below).|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. [...] "She {{told me to}} pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache. It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the {{audience}} {{to find out that}} she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} Ciara and Timberlake face to face, caressing seductively. The camera cuts to Ciara who appears almost {{impervious}} to gravity. Dressed in lingerie, she maneuvers around a horizontal dance pole; background dancers are veiled in vibrant color schemes and alternating strobe lights. The video then cuts to Ciara in a leotard, posing in abstract and flexible poses. Ciara is then seen {{dressed in a}} tiger-striped catsuit performing solo dance moves on a stage. Timberlake performs his verse seated onstage while Ciara performs intricate tricks, such as snaking under his legs. Then the two begin to lightly move to the track before Ciara forms her body as an armrest as he <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> her. Ciara and the dancers perform choreography and cabaret-style moves on the pole. The bridge of the song puts Timberlake {{on the ground and}} Ciara, standing over him, turns and performs her signature [...] "Matrix" [...] over him as he guides her body toward his with his right hand. The two perform and as Ciara gets up, Timberlake smacks her side as she pops to the beat. The video then cuts to a scene with Ciara in the catsuit portraying a tiger in a cage. In the final scene, Ciara and the dancers perform, dressed in 1970s-inspired tuxedos and colored afros. The video ends with clips of Ciara's multiple performance scenes from throughout the video.|$|E
500|$|Compared to The Battle of Maldon, an Old English {{poem that}} commemorates {{a battle between}} English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its {{nationalist}} overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression {{in the development of}} England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports [...] "the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, [...] "it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style." [...] Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on [...] "uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism". The poem does not treat [...] "personal responsibility" [...] as Maldon does, but <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicles view of contemporary history as the [...] "epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain", as [...] "straightforwardly traditional". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the [...] "sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{she leaves}} the mansion, she exits into [...] "Emancipation Street", a ghetto looking plaza made up entirely of props and hand made stores. With shops named [...] "So So Fetch" [...] and [...] "Pink Yet Lavender", Carey then walks up to a wall, where she passes Jermaine Dupri, who makes a cameo appearance. As she <b>leans</b> <b>on</b> the wall, her coat slips off, and two schoolgirls do a shake dance at the pay phones. Carey then appears in a Lamborghini Murcielago {{speaking}} on her PDA with Chris Tucker, who as a cameo, appeared {{on the set of}} the video shoot, as the man in the passenger's seat. As Carey leaves her lover a second message, he is seen frolicking pool-side with two other women, while she says [...] "with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets." [...] Her phone breaks up as she drives past the [...] "Hollyhood" [...] sign, so she tells him, [...] "Hold on," [...] singing, [...] "Save this recording, because I'm never coming back home." [...] Carey is then shown on bleachers at a high school football game, with Da Brat featured as a cameo act, as she argues with a man in the background. She writes 'MIMI' on one of the bleachers and the letters transform into a large shiny [...] "MIMI" [...] sign made of lights, which appear in large, vibrant lights. Carey walks up to a microphone in front of the large 'MIMI' lights, and dances and sings in front of the camera, wearing a revealing black ensemble and leopard print boots. In the final scene, Carey is seen on a beach, as she slips out of her robe and walks into the sunset, with the glare obscuring whether she's wearing any clothing.|$|E
