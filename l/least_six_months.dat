5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5).

5|$|The Veterans Committee {{election}} process was revised in July 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was {{split into two}} separate ballots—one for managers and umpires {{and the other for}} executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters. Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and three executives were elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must be retired for at least five years, or for at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> if they are age 65 or older, while executives must be either retired or at least age 65.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} aplacental viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos sustained to term by histotroph ("uterine milk") {{produced by the}} mother. Females bear litters of up to four pups every other year, after a gestation period of at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> This species is closely related to, and may hybridize with, the yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). The venomous sting of the crossback stingaree is potentially injurious to humans. This common species is seldom caught by commercial fisheries other than in the northernmost extent of its range. Thus, its population is largely secure and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for English fans attending the final was the acquisition of visas for entry into Russia. However, {{after a period of}} negotiations between representatives of Russia, the United Kingdom, UEFA and the two clubs, it was agreed that fans with tickets for the match would not require a visa, provided they were also able to produce a passport with at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into Russia. The visa-free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 May and 23 May, but this was later extended to an eight-day period lasting from 17 May to 25 May. Because of the difficulty and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa, fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to Moscow by UEFA's William Gaillard, who also warned fans about Russia's strict laws regarding the consumption of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the current}} rules, players must have at least 10 years of major league {{experience}} {{to be eligible for}} induction. In addition, they must be retired {{for at least five years}} if living, or deceased for at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Players meeting these qualifications must pass through a screening committee, and are then voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Each writer may vote for up to 10 players; to be admitted into the Hall of Fame, a player must be approved by 75% of those casting ballots. Players receiving less than 5% approval are removed from future BBWAA ballots. The rules, as revised in July 2016, allow that all individuals eligible for induction but not for the BBWAA ballot—players who have not been approved by the BBWAA election process within 15 years of their retirement, umpires, managers, pioneers, and executives—may be considered by one of four voting bodies that have taken over the role of the former Veterans Committee, based on the era in which each individual candidate made his greatest contribution to the sport. On a few occasions, exceptions have been made to the guidelines in place at the time: Lou Gehrig was elected in 1939 following his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Roberto Clemente was elected shortly after his death in 1972; and Addie Joss was elected in 1978 even though he completed only nine seasons before his death.|$|E
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by the new constitution was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the new constitution mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The new constitution also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E

5|$|For at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> the Mexican Armed Forces {{were trying}} to hunt down Antonio Ezequiel, nearly {{capturing}} him in two occasions. The drug lord managed to avoid capture in several occasions by relying on the armed squadron known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army. Among the first operations to capture the drug lord occurred on 31 March 2010, when the Mexican military confronted Antonio Ezequiel's bodyguards at Tres Culturas neighborhood in Matamoros. On 7 April 2010, there were two shootouts in Matamoros between Mexican marines {{and members of the}} Gulf Cartel. The intelligence information collected in these shootouts allowed the Mexican Armed Forces to locate the domicile of Antonio Ezequiel on 14 September 2010 at Fraccionamiento Río in Matamoros. But heavily armed gunmen of the Gulf Cartel intercepted the raid and protected their leader, who escaped in an armored vehicle. Two military men were killed in the operation, but the government managed to gain more information on the logistics of the inner circle of Antonio Ezequiel. On 1 November 2010, the Mexican authorities learned once again that Antonio Ezequiel was spending the night in a safe house at the Expo Fiesta Oriente neighborhood in Matamoros. But before the authorities got to the location, the drug lord left and avoided his capture.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{set up a}} Defence Committee {{within the}} Cabinet to {{co-ordinate}} the colony's war effort in early 1940. This body comprised the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister Jacob Smit, Tredgold and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest, the Minister of Mines and Public Works, who {{was put in charge}} of the new Air Ministry. About 1,600 of the colony's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when, during the Battle of France, Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities to call up any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and a half and 25 who had lived in the colony for at <b>least</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942.

On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia, the last country to join the EATS, became the first to start operating an air school under it, beating Canada by a week. The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, with No.1 Squadron becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons, namely No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron (in 1940) and No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron (1941), {{in a manner similar to}} the Article XV squadrons from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|E
