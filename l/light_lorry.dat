5000|$|The SD Freighter was in {{production}} from {{the formation of}} Shelvoke & Drewry Ltd. in 1922 until the very last Freighter was manufactured in 1955. Conceived as a <b>light</b> <b>lorry</b> the SD Freighter soon proved to be popular for refuse collection with its low loading height, small turning circle and simple control utilising two handles, known as [...] "Tillers".|$|E
5000|$|Initially only a 10 cwt van {{version was}} made but in 1947 it {{was joined by}} an estate car, the Utility. This {{was little more than}} the van with side windows and rear seats. By 1951 the Utility was offered in two versions: Utility and Utility De Luxe, with the latter having better trim, {{including}} a rear bumper and side footsteps. Both utilities were also offered as a '4-light van', with windows but no rear seats, to avoid the high purchase tax on private cars. The Bradford was also manufactured as a <b>light</b> <b>lorry,</b> as would later be described as a pickup truck.|$|E
50|$|Already {{the very}} first {{production}} lot of Sisu S-323's included customised lorries for the Finnish Defence Forces. During the Second World War lorry production was transferred to another company, Yhteissisu, which {{was set up to}} produce lorries and buses for the military. In 1958 the Defence Forces arranged a thorough test trial comparing lorries of different producers; these tests gave the Sisu K-26, modified from a civil model, a good rating. In 1959 SAT introduced Kärppä-Sisu K-35 for military use but 4×2-driven. Production of military off-road vehicles started in 1964 when SAT presented KB-45, a new light 4×4 lorry. The military vehicle production was moved from Karis to Hämeenlinna when the upgraded A-45 was presented. Medium heavy SA-150 and heavy 6×6-driven SA-240 production followed after. SA-110 was a <b>light</b> <b>lorry</b> prototype which was only produced six units. In 1990 the demining vehicle RA-140 was introduced and they were produced a small series starting from 1994.|$|E
50|$|Sentinel, {{along with}} Foden, {{dominated}} the steam market, but the 1930s saw {{the demise of}} both companies' ranges as new legislation forced the development of <b>lighter</b> <b>lorries,</b> Sentinel surviving the longest.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} road-tested in <b>light</b> <b>lorries,</b> but {{nothing seems to}} have been heard of it after 1937. A claimed {{advantage}} was the lack of a cylinder head gasket, which was a reliability problem for early diesels at this time. Possibly it was successful, but simply its unusual nature led to it being ignored during World War II in favour of concentrating on more established designs.|$|R
5000|$|Some [...] "Series" [...] {{cars are}} found with a floor-type gear change {{replacing}} the (good quality) standard column-mounted gearstick — these are later owner modifications resembling the original factory option, and the parts necessary for this {{were obtained from}} the Commer Karrier Walk-thru-type vans and <b>light</b> <b>lorries</b> which were also made by the Rootes Group at this time. All of the automatic transmission-optioned cars were fitted with the column-type selectors only.|$|R
5000|$|When {{production}} restarted {{after the}} Second World War, the twin-cylinder engine was {{dropped from the}} range of new cars, but continued in 1005 cc form {{to the end of}} production in the commercials, now comprising a <b>light</b> <b>lorry,</b> the Bradford van, two versions of an estate car called the Utility, and chassis front-ends and kits for outside coachbuilders, many abroad. The new cars were a complete change from what had gone before with the streamlined Jowett Javelin designed by a team led by Gerald Palmer. This had such advanced features as a flat four push-rod engine, independent front suspension with torsion bars front and rear and unitary body construction. The car was good for 80 mi/h km/h and had excellent handling. In 1950 the Javelin was joined by the Jowett Jupiter sports with a chassis designed by Eberan von Eberhorst who had worked for Auto Union. Javelins were designed for production levels never before attempted by Jowett with Javelin and Bradford body production out-sourced to Briggs Motor Bodies who built a new plant at Doncaster. Briggs supplied the bodies fully trimmed and ready to be applied to the mechanicals. The Jupiters were always built in-house at Idle. The new mechanicals had teething troubles but Javelin bodies were still being mass-produced to the original schedule leading to them being stockpiled. Export sales collapsed by 75% in 1952 followed by sluggish domestic sales while the nation waited for the removal of a [...] "temporarily" [...] increased purchase tax, finally eased in April 1953 with disastrous long-term consequences for Jowett.Poor business strategy and direction, and over-confidence, were the financially sound company's downfall and, even after the engine and gearbox problems were solved, the Idle plant was never able to build, nor - during 1952 - was the distribution network able to sell, the expected volume. Collapse of the arrangements for the supply of bodies led to suspension of Javelin production in 1953, together with the by now outdated Bradford, though tooling had been completed for new models. Jupiters remained in demand and were built up to the end of 1954. The company did not go broke, but sold their factory to International Harvester who made tractors at the site until the early 1980s. The factory was demolished in 1983.|$|E
50|$|Sisu Auto {{introduced}} {{a new series of}} military designated lorries based on Sisu E-series in 1997, using components supplied by Renault. This series consisted of 6×6- and 8×8-driven vehicles. This led to the re-establishment of Sisu Defence in 2005 as a part of Sisu Auto. A notable milestone was a contract of armoured Sisu E13TP 8×8 vehicles to the Lithuanian Armed Forces. A series of new <b>light</b> <b>lorries</b> Sisu A2045 was produced in 2009-2010 to replace the aged KB-45 and A-45 models.|$|R
50|$|Sisu A-45 is a <b>light</b> {{off-road}} <b>lorry</b> {{made by the}} Finnish {{heavy vehicle}} producer Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT) in 1970-1982. The two-axle, all-wheel-drive vehicle with payload of 4 150 kg was a further development of Sisu KB-45, that was originally developed after an assignment of the Finnish Defence Forces.|$|R
50|$|Sisu KB-45 is a <b>light</b> {{off-road}} <b>lorry</b> {{made by the}} Finnish {{heavy vehicle}} producer Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT) in 1965-1970. The two-axle, all-wheel-drive vehicle with payload of 4 000 kg was developed after an assignment of the Finnish Defence Forces. It was followed by almost similar A-45/AH-45 in 1970.|$|R
50|$|The {{initiative}} for the vehicle development {{came from the}} Finnish Defence Forces which sent an inquiry for a <b>light</b> off-road <b>lorry</b> to Sisu-Auto in April 1983. At the time the Defence Forces was planning to purchase of 1 000 such vehicles. Sisu-Auto handed over a prototype for testing {{at the end of}} year 1986.|$|R
50|$|Sisu SA-110 is a {{prototype}} of a <b>light</b> two-axle off-road <b>lorry</b> made by the Finnish heavy vehicle manufacturer Oy Sisu-Auto Ab in 1986. Total six pieces were made. The vehicle was partly armoured.|$|R
5000|$|The {{costs and}} {{conditions}} {{attached to the}} new licences and vehicle duty were contentious to road users as they were based on axle weight and could be very expensive; many municipal corporations who ran their own fleets, bus companies, vehicle manufacturers, hauliers, showmen, trade unions and the coal industry protested and predicted crippling increases in fees. The former Transport Minister, Herbert Morrison claimed that using: [...] "the weapon of taxation of road transport {{as a means of}} putting the railways right was a foolish and idiotic policy". The new charges were blamed for driving heavier steam traction off the road in favour of the <b>lighter</b> <b>lorries</b> powered by internal combustion engines using imported oil. This was at a time of high unemployment in the British coal industry, when the steam haulage business required 950,000 tons of coal annually.It also introduced an unpopular requirement for hauliers to produce paperwork to show that their drivers were operating safely and not being overworked. Previous attempts to impose safety rules on hauliers had been nearly impossible to enforce. The threat of withdrawing a licence was viewed as the best way of ensuring the new regulations were respected by the industry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{novel is}} heavily {{influenced}} by Goethe's Faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption are prominent. Part of its literary brilliance lies in the different levels on which it can be read, as hilarious slapstick, deep philosophical allegory, and biting socio-political satire critical of not just the Soviet system but also the superficiality and vanity of modern life in general - jazz is a favourite target, ambivalent like so much else in the book in the fascination and revulsion with which it is presented. But the novel is also full of modern amenities like the model asylum, radio, street and shopping <b>lights,</b> cars, <b>lorries,</b> trams, and air travel. There is little evident nostalgia for any [...] "good old days" [...] - in fact, the only figure in the book to even mention Tsarist Russia is Satan himself. In another of its facets, perhaps showing a different aspect of Goethe's influence, {{the book is a}} Bildungsroman with Ivan Nikolayevich as its focus. Furthermore, there are strong elements of magic realism in the novel.|$|R
50|$|The fort was {{commanded}} by an inexperienced reserve captain, who lacked {{the will and}} the determination to fight. Surrender negotiations began on 28 February and on 1 March 1941, the Italian garrison of 11 officers, 18 NCOs and 273 Libyan soldiers (12, 47 and 273, according to French sources) surrendered El Tag and the Kufra oasis to the Free French. During the siege, the Italian garrison had suffered one Italian officer killed, two Libyan soldiers killed and four wounded; the French had 4 dead and 21 wounded. The Italian garrison was permitted to withdraw to the north-west and the French forces took over eight SPA AS.37 Autocarro Sahariano <b>light</b> trucks, six <b>lorries,</b> four 20 mm cannon and 53 machine-guns.|$|R
50|$|The Port Klang flyover above Jalan Kem was {{supposed}} to make driving between Westport and Northport faster and more convenient, but it has instead become a danger to motorists. The two-kilometre flyover has been stripped of its metal barriers at the side. Should an accident occur, chances are the vehicles involved would fall onto the road below. And there is a high probability of an accident happening, especially at night, as most of the street lights on the flyover are not working. Motorists have expressed concern over the danger posed by the missing barriers and the non-functioning <b>lights</b> as many <b>lorries</b> used the flyover. There is also no emergency lane on the flyover and {{in the event of a}} breakdown, an accident could easily happen, especially at night. The Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) was responsible for maintaining the flyover and the Majlis Perbandaran Klang (Klang Municipal Council) (MPKlg) had written to them asking for repair works to be carried out. But the department replied that there was not enough funds to carry out repairs on the flyover.|$|R
