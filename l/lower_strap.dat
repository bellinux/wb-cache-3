2500|$|The skirt {{material}} may {{be almost}} transparent, translucent or opaque. A nearly transparent skirt provides a greater peripheral vision, though somewhat distorted, and {{may reduce the}} feeling of claustrophobia in some divers, {{but in some cases}} the light entering through the sides may cause distracting internal reflections. The skirt also encloses the nose, usually by means of a nose pocket, so that air can be exhaled through the nose into the mask to equalise the internal pressure during descent and thereby avoid possible barotrauma of the enclosed area of the face. [...] The section of the mask covering the nose must allow the wearer to block the nostrils while equalising pressure in the middle ear. All diving masks have means to keep them in position, usually an elastomer strap of similar material to the skirt, but occasionally an expanded neoprene pad with velcro straps is used. Mask straps are usually wider at the back or split into an upper and <b>lower</b> <b>strap</b> {{at the back of the}} head for stability and comfort.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>strap</b> button {{is usually}} {{located at the}} bottom (bridge end) of the body. The upper strap button is usually located near or at the top (neck end) of the body: on the upper body curve, {{at the tip of}} the upper [...] "horn" [...] (on a double cutaway), or at the neck joint (heel). Some electrics, {{especially}} those with odd-shaped bodies, have one or both strap buttons on the back of the body. Some Steinberger electric guitars, owing to their minimalist and lightweight design, have both strap buttons at the bottom of the body. Rarely, on some acoustics, the upper strap button is located on the headstock. Some acoustic and classical guitars only have a single strap button at the bottom of the body—the other end must be tied onto the headstock, above the nut and below the machine heads.|$|E
5000|$|Diving masks {{may have}} a single, durable, {{tempered}} glass faceplate, or two lenses {{in front of the}} eyes. These may be supported by a relatively rigid plastic or metal frame, or they may be permanently bonded to the rim of the skirt, in a construction known as [...] "frameless". In the case of freediving masks, which need to have a low internal volume to minimize the amount of breath needed to equalize the change of pressure that occurs with depth, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic. There is usually a [...] "skirt" [...] of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer to support the frame and lenses and create a watertight seal with the diver's face.The skirt material may be almost transparent, translucent or opaque.

50|$|The semi-parabolic {{bridge is}} made of {{crucible}} steel and consists of riveted connections, stretched over the river bed in a slightly oblique position. The two parallel truss beams are divided by eleven vertical poles and rest on supports made from natural stone. The floor of the bridge, in which the former tram rails lie, is now asphalted. Only the three inner fields of the trusses are reinforced by cross-shaped struts, while the others fields have simple struts between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>straps.</b> In course of an extension to the tram connection, the upper straps were reinforced by transverse bends to stabilize the construction.|$|R

30|$|A {{vertical}} bra strap orientation {{appears to}} be more suitable for women with large breasts due to the significantly <b>lower</b> <b>strap</b> discomfort and the preference for this orientation compared to the cross-back strap orientation. Although the mean static and dynamic mean peak pressure data were not significantly lower in the vertical bra strap orientation compared to the cross-back orientation, participants consistently reported that the vertical orientation did not ‘dig in’ or ‘create pressure or tension on the trapezius muscle’ compared to the cross-back orientation. It is possible that this between-strap orientation difference in perception of pressure, despite the lack of any quantitative difference in strap pressure, may be due to variations in the anatomical structures at the strap/pressure sensor interface. That is, in the vertical orientation, the strap lays across the bone, which is better designed to tolerate compressive forces relative to the muscle tissue at the cross-back orientation strap/pressure sensor interface (upper trapezius muscle) [28]. As the effect of different tissue interfaces on pressure measurements is unknown, this is a recommended topic for future research.|$|E
30|$|The {{significantly}} <b>lower</b> <b>strap</b> {{discomfort and}} the strap preference of the vertical orientation {{compared to the}} cross-back orientation were also in contrast to previous research [5]. It should be noted, however, that the bra strap discomfort VAS scores for both studies were low, confirming that 3 to 5  min of treadmill running is insufficient to assess the long-term impact of bra strap discomfort; as for this cohort, 63 % reported discomfort and problems with the bra straps of their own bras (Tables  1 and 4). Future research should therefore ensure that the duration over which bra strap discomfort and pressure are measured are longer to truly represent times that women wear sports bras while they participate in sport and exercise. Other factors may have also contributed to strap preference, such as the clothing to be worn {{on top of the}} bra, whether it was acceptable for the bra straps to be visible or not, as well as personal preference. We attempted to control these factors in the current study by assessing personal preference and by recruiting an equal percentage of the participants who reported to commonly wear either strap orientation. Interestingly, 80 % of the participants stated that they sacrificed comfort for appearance when changing their bra strap orientation to suit the clothing to be worn over the bra (Table  4).|$|E

50|$|The {{barricade}} webbing {{consists of}} upper and <b>lower</b> horizontal loading <b>straps</b> joined {{to each other}} at the ends. Five vertical engaging straps, spaced 20 feet apart, are connected to each upper and <b>lower</b> load <b>strap.</b> The barricade webbing is raised to a height of approximately 20 feet. The barricade webbing engages the wings of the landing aircraft, wherein energy is transmitted from the barricade webbing through the purchase cable to the arresting engine. Following a barricade arrestment, the webbing and deck cables are discarded and the stanchions are lowered back into their recessed slots. Barricade engagements are rare, as tailhooks are designed to be extremely fail-safe, and an aircraft returning from combat with such severe damage would likely not be able to land. This device has been installed on all American aircraft carriers and on the French Charles de Gaulle while Brazilian CATOBAR, Russian and Indian STOBAR aircraft carriers have only conventional arresting gear installed.|$|R
40|$|Background Bra straps are {{a primary}} source of {{discomfort}} during sport and exercise, particularly for women with large breasts. This study aimed to investigate the effects of altering bra strap orientation and design on bra strap comfort, pressure and breast support in women with large breasts. This is a descriptive laboratory study. Methods Bra strap discomfort (visual analogue scale, 0 to 10), pressure (custom-designed 10 mm 2 calibrated pressure sensor, 0. 5 to 24 kPa range, 50 Hz, S 2011, Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany, placed under the right bra strap at the crest of each participant 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder), preference ranking and vertical breast displacement (VBD; Optotrak Certus® motion capture system, 200 Hz, Northern Digital, Ontario, Canada) data during dynamic treadmill running and static upright standing (pressure only) were collected for 23 active women with large breasts (D+ cup size) while they wore an encapsulation sports bra with six different bra strap conditions (two bra strap orientations: vertical and cross-back; three bra strap designs: standard width, wide and gel). Results Bra strap discomfort was significantly less (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) in the vertical compared to the cross-back strap orientation, which was the most preferred orientation despite {{no significant difference in}} strap pressure. The wide strap design had the lowest discomfort scores, significantly <b>lower</b> <b>strap</b> pressure compared to the standard width and gel strap designs (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 001), and was equally the most preferred design with the gel straps. There {{was no significant difference in}} VBD among the six strap conditions. Conclusions Bra straps that are vertically orientated and wide (approximately 4. 5 cm in width) are preferable for women with large breasts during sport and exercise to minimise bra strap pressure and discomfort. The addition of gel pads under bra straps may also decrease discomfort and prevent straps slipping off the shoulders, although this notion warrants further investigation...|$|E

40|$|What {{option of}} {{anesthesia}} should be preferred {{if there is}} a need for cesarean section in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia remains unanswered so far. Objective: to evaluate the safety of spinal anesthesia (SA) in pregnant women with preeclampsia. Materials and methods. Fifty four cases of spinal anesthesia during cesarean section were analyzed in pregnant females with preeclampsia. Preoperative preparation involved an occult aortocaval compression test; <b>lower</b> extremity <b>strapping</b> up to the upper third of the hip; study of central hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index, end-diastolic volume, total peripheral vascular resistance). Preoperative central hemodynamics was examined by two-dimensional echocardiography using a Shimasonic SD 1 310 apparatus. Standard monitoring of blood pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) was made during anesthesia, by employing a Cardiocap II CG-CS monitor (Datex). BP was measured every two minutes until the fetus was extracted and then every 5 minutes before the puerpera was transferred to a rehabilitative ward. Results. The findings disagree with the traditional view of the negative hemodynamic effects of SA in pregnant females with preeclampsia. No cases of developed arterial hypotension were revealed in the study group. Conclusion. Spinal anesthesia strategy has been proposed, which is effective in preventing hemodynamic complications when anesthetization is made during both elective and emergency cesarean sections in pregnant females with preeclampsia.  </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTwo lateral wedged insoles were compared: one with, and {{the other}} without, {{subtalar}} strapping. MethodsTwenty-one patients (age 58 – 83, mean 72) with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) were enrolled. Thirty-seven knees in the patients were divided into three groups based on the Kellgren and Lawrence OA grading system; grades 2 (cases= 20), 3 (cases= 11), and 4  (cases= 6). The subjects were tested during walking barefoot and during walking with a silicon rubber lateral wedged insole with elevation of 10 mm attached to a barefoot. Gait analysis was performed on a 10 m walkway for each subject under three different walking conditions; barefoot, wearing a conventional insole, and a subtalar strapping insole. Peak knee varus moment during gait was measured under each condition, and compared between the three conditions and between the OA grades. ResultsOn the whole (cases= 37), the peak varus moment was significantly reduced by wearing either of the insoles, compared to walking barefoot. The reduction was more obvious with the strapping insole (− 13 %, P< 0. 01), compared with the conventional insole (− 8 %, P< 0. 05). In moderate OA patients (grades 2 and 3), the moments were significantly <b>lower</b> with the <b>strapping</b> insole, compared with the conventional insole (P= 0. 0048 and 0. 005, respectively). However, no significant difference was detected in severe OA patients (grade 4) between {{the two types of}} insoles (P= 0. 4). ConclusionsBoth lateral wedged insoles significantly reduced the peak medial compartment load during gait. The subtalar strapping insole had a greater effect than the conventional insole, particularly in patients with moderate medial knee OA...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationships between the static electromyographic (EMG) activities of trunk muscles and the angles of trunk flexion in a range of positions. Previous authors have reported trunk muscle activation patterns during the stoop lift movement when trunk position changes relative to an external reference. When bending to prepare for a stoop lift, trunk flexor torque due to upper body weight increases as the trunk is flexed. In this study trunk flexor torque was constant because the upper body was maintained in a horizontal position while the <b>lower</b> body was <b>strapped</b> to a board whose inclination was varied between the horizontal and vertical positions in 10 ° increments. The length of the trunk flexor muscles increased as the trunk was flexed. Twenty young adults (10 male and 10 female) performed a total of 20 isometric contractions; 2 trials in each of 10 different postures while surface EMG of their vertebral extensor (erectores spinae and multifidi) and hip extensor (gluteus maximus and the hamstrings) muscles were recorded bilaterally. There were no significant differences between the normalised EMG values from the right and left sides, indicating that the tasks were performed symmetrically. As the trunk was flexed from 0 o (lower body horizontal) to 90 ° (lower body vertical), the EMG of the vertebral extensor muscles reduced to 50 % of their initial values, while the hip extensor muscles reduced to 20 % of their initial values. Only 4 of the subjects (all male) exhibited flexion-relaxation of the erectores spinae muscles within the range of 0 – 90 °, however all 20 subjects exhibited myoelectric silence of the vertebral extensors at full trunk flexion. The results for all muscles indicate a gradual change from active trunk stabilisation to an increasing contribution from the connective tissue structures. The contributing structures to the passive resistance to vertebral flexion include the thoracolumbar fascia, erector spinae aponeurosis, postvertebral ligaments, and the posterior annulus. It is mainly the connective tissue components of the hip extensor muscles that contribute to passive pelvic stabilisation because all the hip ligaments become slack during hip flexion...|$|R
