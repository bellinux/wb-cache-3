50|$|The period most dense in {{exhibitions}} and retrospectives, {{with the publication}} of important monographs, was the 1980s. In {{the first half of the}} decade an explicitly theatrical dimension began to establish itself with works marked by fragmentation and dispersion (La caduta <b>di</b> <b>Icaro,</b> 1982; Melanconia ermetica, 1983) or distinguished by theatrical figures such as eighteenth century valets de chambre (Trionfo della rappresentazione, 1984). Paolini’s poetics was considerably enriched by literary attributions and mythological references, as well as by the introduction of cosmic images. In the late 1980s the artist's reflections turned mainly on the very act of exhibiting. Starting with his solo show at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Nantes (1987) the concept of the exhibition - its premises and its promises - became progressively configured as the actual subject of the works themselves.|$|R

40|$|V podjetju dajejo vedno večji poudarek pospeševanju prodaje in marketingu ter temu primerno namenjajo tudi vedno več denarnih sredstev. Danes ni več najpomembneje, kakšen izdelek prodajaš, temveč <b>le,</b> <b>ali</b> ga znaš prodati. Vedno bolj postaja pomemben tudi videz embalaže in ne samo izdelek, ki je v njej. Embalaža mora biti privlačna za kupca in ga mora pritegniti ter privabiti v nakup. V diplomskem delu smo predstavili pospeševanje prodaje, pomen embalaže, podjetje Fructal in njegove izdelke, menjavo embalaže dvema izdelkoma ter učinek te menjave. Skozi teoretični del smo na kratko predstavili pospeševanje prodaje ter osnovne funkcije embalaže. Poleg tega teoretični del opisuje zgodovino, pomen, orodja in cilje pospeševanja prodaje ter pomen, funkcijo in kriterije ocenjevanja embalaže. V analitičnem delu pa smo analizirali menjavo embalaže dvema izdelkoma in navedli nekaj lastnih predlogov za izboljšanje. Z analizo podjetja Fructal in njegove menjave embalaže izdelkoma Fructal Classic in Smoothie smo prišli do sklepov in ugotovitev, ki bi morda pomagali podjetju. Na splošno je bila menjava embalaže izdelka Classic dobro ocenjena, medtem ko je bila menjava embalaže izdelku Smoothie slabše ocenjena. Menimo, da bi moralo podjetje Fructal v spremembe bolj vključiti potrošnike in jim te še bolje skomunicirati in približati. The {{companies}} are putting a {{bigger and bigger}} emphasis on the sales improvement and marketing and consequently they are investing more financial resources into those areas. Nowadays {{it is no longer}} important only what type of product you are selling, but also whether or not you know how to sell it. What {{is becoming more and more}} significant is the aspect of the packaging, and not just the product that is inside it. The packaging must be attractive to the consumer and must encourage and allure him to purchase the product. In the thesis we present the sales improvement, the importance of the packaging, the company Fructal and its products, the alternations on two packages, and their effect. Throughout the theoretical part we present the sales improvement and the elementary functions of the packaging. In addition, the theoretical part summarises the history, the importance, the tools and the goals of sales improvement, and the significance, functions and criteria for the evaluation of the packaging. In the analytical part we analyse the changes of the packaging of the two products and indicate some of our own suggestions for the improvement. By analysing the company Fructal and the change of packaging of its products Fructal Classic and Smoothie we came to the conclusions and findings which could help the company. In general the change of the packaging of the product Classic received good evaluations, while the change of the packaging of the product Smoothie was evaluated less positively. In our opinion, the company Fructal should try to involve the consumers more into their modifications by communicating with them and warming them up to the new changes...|$|R
40|$|The book {{presented}} here (Cento M., Radici e <b>ali.</b> Esperienze <b>di</b> una psicoterapeuta transculturale, L'Harmattan Italia, Torino, 2015) consists {{in the first}} part in some theoretical reflections, that are inscribed within the ethnopsychological and the French transcultural psychology theoretical and methodological frameworks. Starting from this model, the author explores the subject of the mutual enrichment between the Person Centered Approach and the French Transcultural Psychiatry, and retraces the thought of Michele Risso, an Italian psychiatrist who pioneered the trans-cultural studies. Then, we enter into a specific context of migration such as that of Cuneo, illustrating a research conducted by the author with Moroccan families, exploring transformations in the new context of migration. The theoretical grounding is designed in the text as a “vertical travel”, which underlies {{at the same time a}} grounding identity path of the author. The “vertical travel” echoed the possibility of an “horizontal travel”. This one brings to “spread the wings” to meet people from other cultures, both by the psychotherapeutic listening of migrants and through the encounter with indigenous populations, decentralizing oneself through the journey. The second and third parts of the text enter into the lively narration of such meetings and geographic travel, and into the experience of African dance as a vehicle of cultural mix. In this article, we focus on the theoretical part of the book and on a research conducted in the context of Cuneo with the Moroccan families...|$|R
