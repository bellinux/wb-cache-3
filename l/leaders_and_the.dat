40|$|We {{investigated}} how employees can, simultaneously, {{speak up}} to leaders {{at different levels}} of the organizational hierarchy. In particular, we examined 2 targets of employees' upward voice on workrelated issues: the direct leader (i. e., <b>the</b> supervisor) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> skip-level <b>leader</b> (i. e., supervisor's boss). Drawing on emerging research on the socially embedded nature of leader-member exchanges and using data from 237 employees and their direct <b>and</b> skip-level <b>leaders,</b> we found that the choice of a particular leader as a target was affected by the quality of the dyadic relationship between that <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> employee. Further, the association between voice to <b>the</b> direct <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quality of the employee's relationship with the direct leader was more positive when the relationship between <b>the</b> direct <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> skip-level <b>leader</b> was stronger. By contrast, the association between voice to <b>the</b> skip-level <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quality of the employee's relationship with the skip-level leader was more positive when the relationship between <b>the</b> direct <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> skip-level <b>leader</b> was weaker.

5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators {{struggled with}} the military <b>leaders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two forces went {{through a number of}} leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control over the area with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E
5|$|J. Jesús Blancornelas (November 14, 1936 – November 23, 2006) was a Mexican {{journalist}} who co-founded the Tijuana-based Zeta magazine, {{known for its}} reporting on corruption and drug trafficking. His work encompassed an extensive research on how the drug industry influences local <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police in the Mexican state of Baja California – topics frequently avoided {{by the rest of}} the Mexican media.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation.

President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) {{broke out in}} 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province {{in a civil}} war, often called the Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition <b>leaders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> position of shugo abolished.|$|E

In the summer of 1934 the Soviet luminary Maxim Gorky invited her to attend the First Congress of Russian Writers, and reportedly singled her out for praise.

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don John {{did not reach}} the Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander {{was well aware of}} the inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of green wood and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed {{for the safety of the}} fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|While {{the revolt}} was {{unfolding}} in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk. Wrawe had considerable {{influence over the}} development of the revolt across eastern England, where there may have been almost as many rebels as in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nature of English law, but any locally recruited men might also have proved unreliable {{in the face of a}} popular uprising.|$|E
5|$|With no {{easy way}} to cross the river, Castañeda and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about 300 yards (300 meters) from the river.

Texian militias generally elected their own <b>leaders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin.
