5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with <b>light</b> <b>microscopy</b> or transmission electron microscopy. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.|$|E

40|$|Phototoxicity and {{photobleaching}} {{are major}} limitations of fluorescence live-cell microscopy. A straightforward way to limit phototoxicity and photobleaching is {{reduction of the}} excitation light dose, but this causes loss of image quality. In confocal fluorescence microscopy, {{the field of view}} is illuminated uniformly whereas in controlled <b>light</b> exposure <b>microscopy,</b> illumination is controlled per pixel on the basis of two illumination strategies. The controlled <b>light</b> exposure <b>microscopy</b> foreground strategy discriminates between bright and weak foreground. Bright foreground pixels are illuminated with a reduced light dose resulting in limited excitation of fluorophores and consequently limited phototoxicity and photobleaching. The controlled <b>light</b> exposure <b>microscopy</b> background strategy discriminates between foreground and background. Pixels that are judged to be background are also illuminated with a reduced light dose. The latter illumination strategy may introduce artefacts due to the stochastic character of photon flow. These artefacts are visible as erratic 'darker pixels' in the foreground with a lower pixel value than the neighbouring pixels. This paper describes a special adaptive image processing filter that detects and corrects most of the 'darker pixels'. It opens the possibility to use controlled <b>light</b> exposure <b>microscopy</b> even in high noise (low signal to noise ratio) imaging to further reduce phototoxicity and photobleachin...|$|R
5|$|The ontogeny, or development, of Mycena stylobates fruit bodies {{has been}} {{investigated}} in detail using <b>light</b> <b>microscopy</b> and scanning electron microscopy. According to Volker Walther and colleagues, the development {{can be divided into}} two phases: in the first, the primordium is established that contains all the structures of the mature fruit body; in the second stage, the primordial stipe elongates rapidly, and the newly exposed hymenium immediately begins spore production. The first detected stage of fruit body formation was an irregularly arranged hyphal structure within the colonized substrate. After rupturing the surface of the substrate and establishing itself there, the structure develops a layer of wrapping hyphae that covers the entire primordium. The structures of the stipe and the cap develop simultaneously. The developing stipe, cap, and basal disc together form a secondary ring-like cavity, in which the gills develop. Gill development initiates with a number of small alveolae on the lower side of the cap, which are covered with a hymenophoral palisade (a group of tightly packed, roughly parallel cells). The margins of these alveolae form the primary gills. The hymenophoral palisade spreads from the developing alveolae to the gill edge; the edge of the primary gills is forked {{in the early stages of}} its development. The secondary gills (lamellulae) are formed by the ridges folding down from the lower side of the cap. In contrast to the primary gills, they are covered with hymenophoral palisade from the beginning. Spore production begins immediately after the stipe elongates.|$|E

40|$|<b>Light</b> sheet <b>microscopy</b> {{facilitates}} rapid, high contrast, {{volumetric imaging}} with minimal sample exposure. However, the rapid divergence {{of a traditional}} Gaussian light sheet restricts the field-of-view that provides innate sub-cellular resolution. We show that the accelerating Airy beam innately yields high contrast and resolution up to a ten-fold larger field-of-view. In contrast to the Bessel beam which also provides an increased field-of-view, the Airy beam’s characteristic asymmetric excitation pattern results in all fluorescence contributing positively to the contrast, enabling a step change for <b>light</b> sheet <b>microscopy.</b> <b>Light</b> sheet <b>microscopy</b> facilitates high contrast, volumetric imaging with minimal sample exposure by using two objectives placed orthogonally to one another that perform the tasks of excitation and detection.

To ensure optimal excitation of the sample and isotropic resolution in all three dimensions, there is a simultaneous need for extended, uniformly thin light sheets in the excitation path.

40|$|Biomedical study {{researchers}} using {{animals to}} model disease and treatment need fast, deep, noninvasive, and inexpensive multi-channel imaging methods. Traditional fluorescence microscopy meets those criteria to an extent. Specifically, two-photon and confocal microscopy, {{the two most}} commonly used methods, are limited in penetration depth, cost, resolution, and field of view. In addition, two-photon microscopy has limited ability in multi-channel imaging. <b>Light</b> sheet <b>microscopy,</b> a fast developing 3 D fluorescence imaging method, offers attractive advantages over traditional two-photon and confocal <b>microscopy.</b> <b>Light</b> sheet <b>microscopy</b> is much more applicable for in vivo 3 D time-lapsed imaging, owing to its selective illumination of tissue layer, superior speed, low light exposure, high penetration depth, {{and low levels of}} photobleaching. However, standard <b>light</b> sheet <b>microscopy</b> using Gaussian beam excitation has two main disadvantages: 1) the field of view (FOV) of <b>light</b> sheet <b>microscopy</b> is limited by the depth of focus of the Gaussian beam. 2) Light-sheet images can be degraded by scattering, which limits the penetration of the excitation beam and blurs emission images in deep tissue layers. While two-sided sheet illumination, which doubles the field of view by illuminating the sample from opposite sides, offers a potential solution, the technique adds complexity and cost to the imaging system. We investigate a new technique to address these limitations: Bessel <b>light</b> sheet <b>microscopy</b> in combination with incoherent nonlinear Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Results demonstrate that, at visible wavelengths, Bessel excitation penetrates up to 250 microns deep in the scattering media with single-side illumination. Bessel light sheet microscope achieves confocal level resolution at a lateral resolution of 0. 3 micron and an axial resolution of 1 micron. Incoherent nonlinear SIM further reduces the diffused background in Bessel light sheet images, resulting in confocal quality images in thick tissue. The technique was applied to live transgenic zebra fish tg(kdrl:GFP), and the sub-cellular structure of fish vasculature genetically labeled with GFP was captured in 3 D. The superior speed of the microscope enables us to acquire signal from 200 layers of a thick sample in 4 minutes.
