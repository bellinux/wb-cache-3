The current methods used to search for Ophiostoma albino strains with the highest degradation rates of wood extractives are labor intensive and require a large amount of resources. The Tween 80 ® Opacity test, an assay designed to measure <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity in filamentous fungi, was studied to verify the feasibility of its application as a methodology to rank Ophiostoma albino strains with deresination capabilities.

Recently, {{the discovery of}} new <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> allowed for extending the original classification to fourteen families (I-XIV). We previously reported that G. thermodenitrificans EstGtA 2 (access no. AEN 92268) belonged to a novel group of bacterial <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Here we propose a 15 (th) family (family XV) and suggest criteria for the assignation of protein sequences to the N' subfamily. Five selected salt bridges, hallmarks of the N' subfamily (E 3 /R 54, E 12 /R 37, E 66 /R 140, D 124 /K 178 and D 205 /R 220) were disrupted in EstGtA 2 using a combinatorial alanine-scanning approach. A set of 14 (R/K→A) mutants was produced, including five single, three double, three triple and three quadruple mutants. Despite a high tolerance to non-conservative mutations for folding, all the alanine substitutions were destabilizing (decreasing T m by 5 to 14 °C). A particular combination of four substitutions exceeded this tolerance and prevents the correct folding of EstGtA 2, leading to enzyme inactivation. Although other mutants remain active at low temperatures, the accumulation {{of more than two}} mutations had a dramatic impact on EstGtA 2 activity at high temperatures suggesting an important role of these conserved salt bridge-forming residues in thermostability of <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> from the N' subfamily.

The first medium contained mainly extract from calf brain and beef heart (BHIB), the second medium contained peptone and yeast extract (NB) and the third one contained peptone and yeast extract {{with the addition of}} 2 % (w/v) glucose (NBG). The highest lipolytic activity (0. 0784 Uml- 1) was measured in NBG medium. Maximum of lipolytic activity was observed {{before the end of the}} exponential phase of BS growth in all the media. Temperature optimum in NBG medium was determined from 30 to 50 °C, pH optimum in the range of 5 to 11 and subsequently the temperature stability of <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> produced by the BS was estimated. The activity value was determined spectrometrically using p-nitrophenyllaurate as a substrate. Produced <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> showed maximum activity at 37 °C in the alkaline pH of 8. 0. Measurement of temperature stability showed that <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> are relatively thermostable enzymes retaining 100 % of the activity even after 1 hour of cultivation at 30 - 50 °C. The presence of 1 % (w/v) olive oil in medium NBG caused a decrease in lipolytic activity by 65 % as well as in pH from 6. 5 to 5. 4 after 14 days of cultivation. After substitution of glucose by fructose in medium NBG, lipolytic activity showed comparable values during the first week of cultivation. On the other hand, the decrease of lipolytic activity by 29 % in the medium with fructose was observed after 14 days of cultivation. A procedure for the identification of <b>lipolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of BS by peptide massfingerprinting was developed to understand the potential of synthetic polyester - poly(e-caprolactone) as a lipase inductor. Degradation study of commercial polyester poly(e-caprolactone) was carried out by submerged cultivation of Bacillus subtilis in NBG medium at initial pH 7. 0 and 30 °C for 14 days. PCL (Mn = 10, 000, Mw = 14 000) was studied in the form of films (1. 0 x 1. 0 cm), which were prepared by melt-pressing, rapid cooling of the melt to 4 °C and evaporation of the solvent from 2 % dichlormethane solution. The evaluation of the films shown occurrence of weight loss (7. 8 - 17. 0 wt. %) together with the formation of numerous holes and cracks in the sample surface in relation to the method of the films preparation. Lipolytic activity values increased by 9 - 17 % in the degradation media compared to control samples. Densitometric monitoring showed also higher increase in cell mass in the degradation medium compared with control samples. Based on the results obtained, the degradation process induced by BS could be suggested...|$|R
