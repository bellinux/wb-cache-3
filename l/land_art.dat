50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>Arts</b> of the American West {{started at}} the University of New Mexico by artist Bill Gilbert in 2000 and {{developed}} as a collaboration between Gilbert and architect Chris Taylor since 2001. From 2002-2008 <b>Land</b> <b>Arts</b> was co-sponsored by the University of New Mexico and the University of Texas at Austin where Taylor taught in the interdisciplinary design program of the Department of Art and Art History. In 2007 Taylor was invited by Incubo to bring together {{a group of students}} and professionals from Chile and the United States for a symposium in Santiago and a <b>Land</b> <b>Arts</b> exploration of the Atacama Desert. In 2008 Taylor began teaching in the College of Architecture at Texas Tech University where <b>Land</b> <b>Arts</b> continues to develop in addition to the programming at the University of New Mexico. The program now operates autonomously from both institutions. Operational funding for <b>Land</b> <b>Arts</b> of the American West is provided in part by Lannan Foundation and Andrea Nasher.|$|R

25|$|Around 1973, {{a meeting}} with the {{architect}} Louis Kahn, led him to compare the relationship between paint and canvas with that of vegetation on trellis. Jean-Max Albert then revisited the tradition of trellis-work, 18th-century utopic architecture and, finally, created vegetal architecture which came close to <b>Land</b> <b>art</b> and Environmental Sculpture. It was comparable to the work of Gordon Matta-Clark, or Nils Udo, his neighbour in the Wissenschaftszentrum exhibition in Bonn in 1979.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, French {{painter and}} {{sculptor}} Jean Vérame used the natural surroundings of the Ehi Kourné, {{a few kilometers}} south of Bardaï, to create multidimensional <b>land</b> <b>art</b> works by painting rocks.

These <b>land</b> <b>art</b> or 'earth art' environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater). Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, and Bruce Nauman, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.|$|E

500|$|Tang was {{the subject}} of one episode of artist Ho Tzu Nyen's {{documentary}} television series 4x4 Episodes of Singapore Art, which was broadcast on Arts Central in October 2005. He {{was also one of the}} four artists representing Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale. He presented an installation, Untitled, consisting of two beds positioned upright, the trunks of plantain trees, a portable ancestral altar, a handmade album of drawings and photographs, and other found objects. Drawings of people and faces were strapped to the beds and wrapped around the tree trunks. The installation was accompanied by a recording by Tang's son, Zai Tang, of sounds captured in Venice during a single day. The work was described by the National Arts Council as suggestive of [...] "the restlessness, rootlessness, spiritual wandering and emotional estrangement that mark the travelling life". In 2007, a work by Tang consisting of ink paintings around a well, and representing the erosion of village communities by urban development, was acquired by the Queensland Art Gallery for its Gallery of Modern Art. From January to June 2016, Tang presented Earth Work 1979 at the National Gallery Singapore, a re-staging of his 1979 exhibition, the first recorded instance of Singapore <b>land</b> <b>art.</b> The exhibition includes [...] "Gully Curtains", where Tang placed large pieces of fabric between gullies and let the rain and sun mark the fabric. His work Tiger's Whip (1991) is also displayed at the National Gallery's DBS Singapore Gallery.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a pioneer}} of <b>Land</b> <b>Art,</b> Agnes Denes created Rice/Tree/Burial in 1968 in Sullivan County, New York. Acknowledged as the first {{site-specific}} performance piece with ecological concerns, it was enacted ten years later on an expanded scale at Artpark in Lewiston, New York. This performance piece involved planting rice seeds in a field in upstate New York, chaining surrounding trees and burying a time capsule filled with copies of her haiku. “It was about communication with the earth,” Ms. Denes said, “and communicating with the future.”" ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s and 1970s <b>land</b> <b>art</b> protested [...] "ruthless commercialization" [...] {{of art in}} America. During this period, exponents of <b>land</b> <b>art</b> {{rejected}} the museum or gallery as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were {{beyond the reach of}} traditional transportable sculpture and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. <b>Land</b> <b>art</b> was inspired by minimal art and conceptual art but also by modern movements such as De Stijl, Cubism, minimalism and the work of Constantin Brâncuși and Joseph Beuys. Many of the artists associated with <b>land</b> <b>art</b> had been involved with minimal art and conceptual art. Isamu Noguchi's 1941 design for Contoured Playground in New York is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of <b>land</b> <b>art</b> even though the artist himself never called his work [...] "land art" [...] but simply [...] "sculpture". His influence on contemporary <b>land</b> <b>art,</b> landscape architecture and environmental sculpture is evident in many works today.|$|E
50|$|Holt is {{associated}} with earthworks or <b>land</b> <b>art.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>art</b> emerged in the 1960s, coinciding with a growing ecology movement in the United States, which asked people to {{become more aware of}} the negative impact they can have on the natural environment. <b>Land</b> <b>art</b> changed the way people thought of art; it took art out of the gallery or museum and into the natural landscape, the product of which were huge works engaging elements of the environment. Unlike much of the commercialized art during this time period, <b>land</b> <b>art</b> could not be bought or sold on the art market. Thus, it shifted the perspective of how {{people all over the world}} viewed art.|$|E
