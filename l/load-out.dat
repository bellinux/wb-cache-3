50|$|The game {{is based}} on the engine used for Activision's MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, and {{requires}} a fair amount of strategy through the course of the game, as the player must balance the vehicle's armor and weapon <b>load-outs</b> appropriately in order to successfully complete the various missions. In the game's story mode, the player must also manage and repair equipment salvaged from the wrecks of opponents.|$|R
50|$|The Peace River Phosphate Mining Company Railroad {{consisted}} of a mainline running south from Arcadia to Liverpool. A few short branches connected the railroad to the Florida Southern (later the Plant System in 1896 and the ACL after 1902) at Arcadia, Hull and Liverpool. At Hull sand was removed by a washing plant. Liverpool housed the drying plant and barge loading facilities. A branch running north for about 3 mi upstream from Arcadia served many <b>load-outs</b> along the river.|$|R
25|$|An {{advantage}} of DFAT testing over reverberant testing is the portability of the DFAT system. This allows {{the test equipment}} to be transported to any location, setup, calibrated, used to perform a High Intensity Acoustic Test and then removed from the test site. The entire process from load-in to <b>load-out</b> can be accomplished in no more than 4 days for a large satellite or similar aerospace structure. The test system uses a “building block” approach to form combinations of equipment to satisfy the environmental requirements. Systems typically include 500 plus speakers, 2 million plus watts of amplification, at least 8 to 16 control microphones, and a closed-loop MIMO acoustic control and data acquisition system. The mobility and “building block” approach allows this method to be tailored for each application {{and to provide a}} more timely and cost effective test solution. This method can also be useful for testing articles that are too large to fit inside a traditional acoustic reverberant chamber.|$|E
500|$|<b>Load-out</b> of {{the massive}} set from venues took as much as [...] days. Sound and light {{equipment}} was packed into the fleet of trucks first during the four hours following the concert; {{the remainder of the}} time was spent deconstructing the steel structures making up the stage using four cranes. The extensive amount of time it took to assemble and disassemble the stage interfered with the development of the schedule for the 2010 Major League Baseball season. U2 was also forced to reschedule what would have been their final Giants Stadium concert, when the NFL changed the start time of a New York Jets game, and <b>load-out</b> time from the concert {{a day and a half}} prior would have been insufficient.|$|E
500|$|For each mission, {{a player}} {{is given a}} {{briefing}} in regards to it, which details relevant information on what the mission is about, what to expect, and what objectives {{are expected to be}} completed, although not all actual situations and objectives are detailed. In between some missions, players are also given a command briefing, stating the current situation of the campaign, as well as information on any new ships and weapons being released for use. Before flying out on a mission, players can modify the ship and weapons load-outs for their own starfighter and those of their own wingmen and other wings for the mission; for some missions, the <b>load-out</b> is either fixed for the mission, or is whatever the player set up in the previous one, while what ships and weapons are available depend on the progress on the mission, with stronger weapons and ships becoming available only in later missions. The level of control over load-outs prior to committing to a mission adds an element of strategy to the campaign. The results of a mission can often affect how later missions play out; for example, an enemy capital ship allowed to flee in a particular mission may return in a later mission. Completing a mission and leaving when given authorisation, leads to a debriefing screen which outlays what was achieved by the player and any aspects that could have been done better; players can get a hint, defined as [...] "recommendations", to see what they could have done better, and can restart a mission to play the mission out differently. Player's can earn medals after some missions, either for completing a specific mission, or achieving certain hidden criteria/bonus objectives, receive promotions depending on the kills and types of alongside the difficulty being played at, and badges for overall total of kills made by them. Furthermore, players can replay any single player mission they complete through the in-game mission simulator.|$|E
50|$|Falcon 4.0: Allied Force has {{a dynamic}} and {{customizable}} campaign. Once a player starts a campaign, {{the game will}} begin executing the campaign in real time. Thus, even when the player is not flying, other aircraft, ships, armies and anti-aircraft sites may still be fighting. This is represented to the player in a 2D map where objects can be displayed or hidden. The player can accelerate the campaign to 64X normal time, set up new flights, select weapons <b>load-outs,</b> view target areas and map waypoints before the time arrives for the next mission.|$|R
50|$|The Peace River Phosphate Co. {{had built}} a narrow gauge {{railroad}} north of Arcadia to their <b>load-outs</b> along the Peace River. Like the Comer & Hull operations, the ore was hauled to the drying plant at Arcadia where it was loaded into the narrow gauge boxcars of the Florida Southern. When the railroad converted its Charlotte Harbor Division to standard gauge in 1892, both the Peace River Phosphate Co. and Comer & Hull operations converted their respective railroads. Joseph Hull of Comer & Hull purchased 50% interest in the Peace River Phosphate Co. about this time.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is planned}} to ever-expand its car range. The {{different}} cars vastly ranges from everyday rides, tuners, exotics, muscle cars to fast supercars with hefty performance. It is also officially announced {{that there will}} be car customization, both in looks and performance. The custom garages and customization options give players tools to build exactly what they want. A variety of <b>load-outs</b> will be available for numerous car models, with new parts and items awarded as players earn more experience during the races. Players who play as a club can get to a stage where if they have enough winnings, they can customize their own track to host races on. The track can be set up with different logos and emblems for the specific racing club.|$|R

2500|$|On 15 May 2008 Fonterra and Eastern Coal Holdings {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to continue to rail coal from Eastern Coal's Takitimu mining operations in the Ohai/Nightcaps district to Fonterra's Clandeboye dairy factory. [...] Under this new contract, approximately 120,000 tonnes of coal will be carried annually by the Ohai line. [...] After infrastructural upgrades such as a new rail <b>load-out</b> system were undertaken, the contract came into effect on 1 September 2008; to fulfil it, trainloads of up to 550 tonnes of coal leave the Branch daily. In 2011, Kiwirail undertook a refurbishment of the line with a large re-sleepering and bridge strengthening projects to allow larger, heavier, containerised coal trains to operate, while allowing {{for an increase in}} speed.

2500|$|On 19 August 2014 a Chinese J-11B intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine warfare {{aircraft}} {{that was over}} the South China Sea. At a press conference on August 22, 2014, Admiral John Kirby, the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense told reporters that “On the 19th of August, an armed Chinese fighter jet conducted a dangerous intercept of a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft, patrol aircraft, that was on a routine mission. The intercept took place about 135 miles east of Hainan Island, in international airspace.” He elaborated on the incident, saying that the Chinese jet: “crossed under the aircraft with one pass having only 50–100 feet separation. The Chinese jet also passed {{the nose of the}} P-8 at 90 degrees with its belly toward the P-8 Poseidon, believed to be displaying its weapons <b>load-out.</b> Afterwards, the J-11 flew directly under and alongside the P-8, bringing their wingtips, as I said, to within 20 feet. And then conducted a roll over the P-8, passing within 45 feet.” ...|$|E
50|$|Moorhead soon {{sold his}} Arcadia Phosphate Co. to Hammond & Hull of Savannah, Georgia a large {{fertilizer}} operation in that city. Moorhead returned to Pennsylvania, where {{he developed a}} phosphate mine in Juniata County, PA and formed the narrow gauge Tuscarora Valley Railroad. Hammond & Hull also owned the Charlotte Harbor Phosphate Co. which had their works at Hull, connecting with the Florida Southern by a short branch line. To connect the two plants, Hammond & Hull built a narrow gauge railroad between Arcadia and Hull circa 1890. The railroad served various <b>load-outs</b> along the river, where the barges carrying pebble were unloaded into ore cars for the journey to the drying plants at Arcadia and Hull. Hammond dropped out around 1890 and the new firm was known as Comer & Hull.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe model {{the problem of}} minimum-cost procurement and allocation of anti-ship cruise missiles to naval combat ships as a two-period chance-constrained program with recourse. Discrete scenarios in two periods define "demands" for missiles (i. e., targets and number of missiles required to kill those targets), which must be met with acceptable probabilities. After the first combat period, ships may replenish their inventories from a depot, if the depot's inventory suffices. A force commander assigns targets to ships based on missile <b>load-outs</b> and target demands. The deterministic-equivalent integer program solves too slowly for practical use. We propose a specialized decomposition algorithm, implemented in MATLAB, which solves the two-period model via a series of single-period problems. The algorithm yields optimal solutions {{for a wide range}} of missile-allocation directives, and usually near-optimal solutions otherwise. We exploit the fact that each single-period problem is a probabilistic integer program, whose solution must be a p-efficient point (PEP) of that period's demand distribution. Our algorithm uses PEP-enumeration techniques developed by Beraldi and Ruszczyski, and a specialized algorithm from Kress, Penn and Polukarov. The algorithm solves real-world problem instances in a few minutes or less. Civilian, Israel Nav...|$|R
