5|$|Stroheim {{was known}} to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and {{military}} record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, {{he had found a}} copy of McTeague in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty</b> in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife. From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Clark {{worked as}} the {{assistant}} to the entomologist on probation in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, but in 1920, he took on this position full-time. He started to publish his first articles about pest insects and ants from 1921; in 1926 he became an entomologist at the National Museum in Melbourne, remaining there for 20 years. Clark continued to publish more articles until he resigned from the National Museum of Victoria in 1944. <b>Living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> Clark lived a reclusive life, publishing his last book in 1951. He died on 1 June 1956 {{at the age of}} 71, survived by his six children. One of Clark's most notable achievements was describing Nothomyrmecia macrops, the most primitive living ant.

5|$|Initially {{supported}} by Irish Catholics {{in his effort}} to regain the thrones, James launched an expedition to Ireland in March 1689. He abandoned it upon his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. During James's campaign, Mary supported his cause throughout the British Isles: she sent three French supply ships to Bantry Bay and £2,000 to Jacobite rebels in Dundee. She financed those measures by selling her jewellery. Money problems plagued the Stuart court-in-exile, despite a substantial pension from Louis XIV of 50,000 livres. Mary tried her best to assist those of her husband's followers <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> and encouraged her children to give part of their pocket money to Jacobite refugees.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor. However, despite of the financial prosperity, {{there was no significant}} {{decrease in the number of}} people <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty,</b> which was 8 to 10 million people, or almost 25% of the country.|$|E

He has managed $200million in Accountability Block Grants {{that were used}} for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet {{the specific needs of}} individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>poverty.</b> Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291million in 2008–09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274million.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this project {{is to create a}} staff {{handbook}} for Northern Star Kids, a non-profit organization in Prince George, BC, that offers free quality recreation opportunities for children <b>living</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>poverty.</b> Research has shown that children <b>living</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>poverty</b> are less likely than their middle class peers to participate in organized recreational opportunities or to remain committed without support. The Northern Star staff handbook will help to address these issues by equipping staff with the tools to deliver a high quality program to the children in the organization's service area. The staff handbook has three main functions: a) to ensure the vision, philosophy, and goals of Northern Star Kids are sustained over time b) to create a culture of consistency in the delivery of programs and staff interactions with youth and c) to articulate a program focused on the unique needs of youth <b>living</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>poverty.</b> The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
