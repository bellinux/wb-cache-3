40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to record the tick species collected from three species of tortoise, each in a different province of South Africa. Ticks were collected from <b>leopard</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Stigmochyles pardalis, in the southern region of the Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga province; from hingeback tortoises, Kinixys zombensis, in the Enseleni Nature Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal province and from angulate tortoises, Chersina angulata, in the West Coast National Park, Western Cape province. Of the 63 <b>leopard</b> <b>tortoises</b> examined, 58 were infested with Amblyomma marmoreum and 49 with Amblyomma hebraeum, and all stages of development of both species were recovered. Amblyomma nuttalli was collected from 25 hingeback tortoises, and all stages of development were present. All 24 angulate tortoises examined were infested with Amblyomma sylvaticum, and large numbers of larvae, nymphs and adults were collected. Three snake species and a sand lizard were also infested with A. sylvaticum.

It is a serene makeshift rainforest that allows visitors of the museum to experience what it’s like to be inside an actual Kenyan rainforest.

40|$|Significant {{increases}} in serum globulins (α₁, α₂, β and γ) {{were observed in}} mountain <b>leopard</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Geochelone pardalis) after they had been immunized with nymphal homogenates of Amblyomma marmoreum. There was a concomitant {{significant increase in the}} numbers of leukocytes (lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes and eosinophils). Resistance to nymphal-challenge infestations was manifested by reduced feeding time, lower engorgement masses, and significantly fewer (P < 0, 0001) numbers of nymphs that moulted. These findings are contrary to the generally reported phenomenon, that ticks do not induce resistance in their natural hosts. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

A log-themed bridge crosses to the black rhino exhibit and a top-notch 3 acre enclosure housing chimpanzees. The chimpanzee observation building allows guests to view a very large area for a troop of 12 chimps to play and explore, and allows visitors to become educated on chimpanzees with a connected classroom. This side of the African plains features Masai giraffes, Grant's zebras, gray crowned cranes, and ostriches.

Rhipicephalus nitens followed by Rhipicephalus glabroscutatum and an Ixodes sp. (near I. pilosus) were the most abundant, while Amblyomma marmoreum infested the widest host range. The larvae of three bot flies were also collected. Gedoelstia sp. and Strobiloestrus sp. larvae were recovered from bontebok and grey rhebok and larvae of Oestrus ovis only from grey rhebok.

[...] The complex of four {{buildings}} includes the TransAlta Rainforest and the African Savannah. The TransAlta Rainforest occupies 2,900 square metres (31,000 square feet) and features a collection of African rainforest flora and fauna.

5000|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>tortoise</b> is a {{widespread}} species and remains common throughout most of its range. Human activities, including agricultural burning, consumption, and especially commercial exploitation in the pet trade, are potential threats but have not yet caused significant population declines. They are increasingly being bred in captivity for the pet trade. For example, most tortoises exported from Kenya and Tanzania originate in captive breeding programs, alleviating collection from the wild.|$|E
50|$|Leopard {{tortoises}} are herbivorous; {{their diet}} {{consists of a}} wide variety of plants including forbs, thistles, grasses, and succulents. They will sometimes gnaw on bones or even hyena feces to obtain calcium, necessary for bone development and their eggshells. Seeds will pass undigested through the gut, so the <b>leopard</b> <b>tortoise</b> plays a significant role in seed dispersal. Normally active during the day, they are less active during hot weather or during the dry season.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in electronic technology have ensured that electric fences offer a viable means {{of reducing the}} chances of wildlife escaping from conservation areas and private game ranches. Electric fencing is even gaining popularity amongst domestic stock farmers in controlling the movement of problem animals into private land. However, {{there is a growing}} concern over the number of electric fence induced mortalities in South Africa. This research project sampled mortality rates in a number of broadly distributed study areas with the aim of determining (1) which species were prone to being electrocuted, (2) the average number of mortalities km- 1, and (3) which aspects of electric fence design contribute to most to the observed number of mortalities. This information would then be used in proposing a variety of means of amelioration. Individuals from 33 species were documented as being killed {{as a direct result of}} electric fencing infrastructure. <b>Leopard</b> <b>Tortoises</b> (Stigmochelys pardalis), Rock Monitors (Varanus albigularis), Southern African Python (Python natalensis) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chelonian intranuclear {{coccidiosis}} {{has been}} reported once, in two radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two radiated tortoises, three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two <b>leopard</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18 S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered {{the cause of death}} in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises...|$|R
