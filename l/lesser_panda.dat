5|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), {{also called the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>panda,</b> the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a {{waddling}} gait due to its shorter front legs; it is {{roughly the size of}} a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.|$|E

Many other languages also use red or variations of shining/gold or lesser/small in their names for this species. For instance, червена панда in Bulgarian, panda roux in French, and panda rojo in Spanish all mean red panda. Since {{at least as}} far back as 1855, one of its French names has been panda éclatant (shining panda). In Finnish, it is called kultapanda (gold panda).

40|$|Since 2006, canine {{distemper}} outbreaks {{have occurred in}} rhesus monkeys at a breeding farm in Guangxi, People’s Republic of China. Approximately 10, 000 animals were infected (25 %– 60 % disease incidence); 5 %– 30 % of infected animals died. The epidemic was controlled by vaccination. Amino acid sequence analysis of the virus indicated a unique strain. Canine distemper is a highly contagious infectious disease of canine and feline species caused by {{canine distemper}} virus (CDV), a member of family Paramyxoviridae (1). Susceptible animals include dogs, wolves, jackals, foxes, mongooses, badgers, raccoon dogs, skunks, minks, and ferrets (2 – 6). Case-fatality rates for these animals has ranged from 30 % to 80 % and even to 100 % of ferrets (7). Natural infection with CDV has occasionally been reported in bears, <b>lesser</b> <b>pandas,</b> and giant pandas (8 – 10). Monkeys are not generally considered susceptible but can be experimentally infected (11, 12). In 1989, the first natural case of canine distemper in a monkey (Macaca fuscata) was reported (13). Recently, natural canine distemper infection was reported in a few monkeys in Beijing, People’s Republic of China, {{with a description of}} the clinical signs and pathogenic changes (14). This outbreak most likely resulted from secondary transmission of CDV originating in a larger outbreak on a Guangxi breeding farm, where a similar disease had occurred 2 – 3 years earlier.

50|$|The {{red panda}} (Latin: Ailurus fulgens), {{also known as}} <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> or red cat-bear, is a small {{arboreal}} mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China that has been classified as Vulnerable by IUCN as its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals. The population continues to decline and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries. The Mannheim sports teams have elected the red panda for their favorite athletics mascot to make {{the problem of the}} declining population of this mammal more visible; in addition, the red panda is one of the visitor magnets at the Heidelberg Zoo which is the next larger zoo to Mannheim.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific classification, taxonomy, and {{geographical}} categorization conventionally include the adjectives greater and lesser, {{when a large}} or small variety of an item is meant, as in the greater celandine {{as opposed to the}} lesser celandine. These adjectives may at first sight appear as a kind of null comparative, when as is usual, they are cited without their opposite counterpart. It should be apparent, however, that an entirely different variety of animal, scientific, or geographical object is intended. Thus it may be found, for example, that the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> entails a giant panda variety, and a gazetteer would establish that there are the Lesser Antilles as well as the Greater Antilles. It is in the nature of grammatical conventions evolving over time {{that it is difficult to}} establish when they first became widely accepted, but both greater and lesser in these instances have over time become mere adjectives (or adverbial constructs), so losing their comparative connotation. Further, Greater indicates the inclusion adjacent areas when referring to metropolitan areas, such as when suburbs are intended. Although it implies a comparison with a narrower definition that refers to a central city only, such as Greater London versus the City of London, or Greater New York versus New York City, it is not part of the [...] "comparative" [...] in the grammatical sense of this article. A comparative always compares something directly with something else.|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) {{is a member of}} the order Carn­vora, there has long been disagreement over whether it should be classified with bears, raccoons or as a single member of its own family. Four independent molecular and genetic measures lead to a consensus phylogeny for the giant and lesser pandas. The <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> diverged from New World procyonids at approximately the same time as their departure from ursids, while ancestors of the giant panda split from the ursid lineage much later, just before the radiation which led to modern bears. The giant panda 2 ̆ 7 s divergence was accompanied by a chromosomal reorganization which can be partially reconstructed from the ursid karyotype, but not from that of procyonids or the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda.</b> The apparently dramatic, but actually limited, distinctions between the giant panda and the bears in chromosomal and anatomical morphology provide a graphic mammalian example of the discordance of molecular and morphological (and chromosomal) evolutionary change...|$|E

40|$|Some taxa in the {{superfamily}} Arctoidea, such as {{the giant}} panda and the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda,</b> have presented puzzles to taxonomists. In the present study, approximately 397 bases of the cytochrome b gene, 364 bases of the 12 S rRNA gene, and 74 bases of the tRNA(Thr) and tRNA(Pro) genes from the giant panda, <b>lesser</b> <b>panda,</b> kinkajou, raccoon, coatimundi, and all species of the Ursidae were sequenced. The high transition/transversion ratios in cytochrome b and RNA genes prior to saturation suggest that the presumed transition bias may represent a trend for some mammalian lineages rather than strictly a primate phenomenon. Transversions in the 12 S rRNA gene accumulate in arctoids at about half the rate reported for artiodactyls. Different arctoid lineages evolve at different rates: the kinkajou, a procyonid, evolves the fastest, 1. 7 - 1. 9 {{times faster than the}} slowest lineage that comprises the spectacled and polar bears. Generation-time effect can only partially explain the different rates of nucleotide substitution in arctoids. Our results based on parsimony analysis show that the giant panda is more closely related to bears than to the lesser panda; the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> is neither closely related to bears nor to the New World procyonids. The kinkajou, raccoon, and coatimundi diverged from each other very early, even though they group together. The polar bear is closely related to the spectacled bear, and they began to diverge from a common mitochondrial ancestor approximately 2 million years ago. Relationships of the remaining five bear species are derived...|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which taste {{receptor}} specificity correlates with, or even predicts, diet choice is not known. We recently reported that the insensitivity to sweeteners shown by species of Felidae {{can be explained by}} their lacking of a functional Tas 1 r 2 gene. To broaden our understanding {{of the relationship between the}} structure of the sweet receptors and preference for sugars and artificial sweeteners, we measured responses to 12 sweeteners in 6 species of Carnivora and sequenced the coding regions of Tas 1 r 2 in these same or closely related species. The lion showed no preference for any of the 12 sweet compounds tested, and it possesses the pseudogenized Tas 1 r 2. All other species preferred some of the natural sugars, and their Tas 1 r 2 sequences, having complete open reading frames, predict functional sweet receptors. In addition to preferring natural sugars, the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> also preferred 3 (neotame, sucralose, and aspartame) of the 6 artificial sweeteners.

30|$|Red panda (Ailurus fulgens), {{also known}} as the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda,</b> is one of earth’s living fossils and its {{ancestors}} {{can be traced back to}} more than ten million years ago across Eurasia (Mayr 1986). Presently red panda populations are sporadically distributed in bamboo forests of Himalayan and Heng-Duan mountains in Nepal, India, Bhutan, Myanmar and Southwestern China (Su et al. 2001; Li et al. 2005). These populations continue to drastically decline across their habitats due to hunting, poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation (Wei et al. 1999; Choudhury 2001; Jha 2011). Red panda is classified as vulnerable by IUCN and is listed in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna) since its wild population is estimated to be less than 10, 000 mature individuals (Wang et al. 2008). Although endemic to eastern Himalayas and a flagship species for conservation of this fragile ecosystem, little is known about the genetic diversity of red panda in the wild, as it is shy, scansorial and dwells in altitudinal ranges of 1500 – 4800  m making it a very difficult animal to study (Choudhury 2001). Recent research on demography, phylogeography and genetic diversity of red panda (Su et al. 2001; Li et al. 2005; Hu et al. 2011) opens more opportunities to study current trends in wild red panda populations.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 20 zoo animals of the Xining Zoo, 16 farm yaks and 42 farm goats in Qinghai province, China was investigated by an immunofluorescence test (IFT). The species and/or genotypes {{were determined by}} nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis of a fragment of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 16 zoo animals, 2 yaks, and 15 goats by IFT. The IFT positive samples were further investigated by PCR, and 16 of them {{were found to be}} positive by that method also. Sequence analysis of the PCR products derived from Cryptosporidium oocysts from Black leopard (Panthera pardus), Heijing He (Grus nigricollis), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), Takin (Budorcas taxicolor), <b>Lesser</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens), and White-eared pheasant (Crossoptilon crossoptilon) fecal samples matched that of Cryptosporidium parvum mouse genotype. Sequence analyses of other PCR products were consistent with cervine genotype Cryptosporidium from Ibex (Capra ibex), a novel Cryptosporidium genotype from a wild yak (Bos mutus), C. bovis–like genotype from one goat sample and also a novel Cryptosporidium genotype from one other separate goat sample.

40|$|Both egg- and cell-adapted canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) vaccines are suspected to retain residual virulence, especially if administered to immuno-suppressed animals, very young pups or to highly susceptible animal species. In the early 1980 s, post-vaccine encephalitis was reported in dogs from various parts of Britain after administration of a particular batch of combined CDV Rockborn strain/canine adenovirus type- 1 vaccine, although incrimination of the Rockborn strain was subsequently retracted. Notwithstanding, this, and other reports, led {{to the view that}} the Rockborn strain is less attenuated and less safe than other CDV vaccines, and the Rockborn strain was officially withdrawn from the markets in the mid 1990 s. By sequencing the H gene of the strain Rockborn from the 46 th laboratory passage, and a commercial vaccine (Candur(®) SH+P, Hoechst Rousell Vet GmbH), the virus was found to differ from the commonly used vaccine strain, Onderstepoort (93. 0 % nt and 91. 7 % aa), and to resemble more closely (99. 6 % nt and 99. 3 % aa) a CDV strain detected in China from a <b>Lesser</b> <b>Panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens). An additional four CDV strains matching (> 99 % nt identity) the Rockborn virus were identified in the sequence databases. Also, Rockborn-like strains were identified in two vaccines currently in the market.

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 1990. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves [10 - 11]). The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is {{a member}} of the Procyonidae family. This group comprises nine genera and eighteen species including the ring-tailed cat (Bassariscus astutus), the central american cacoinistle (Jientinkip suinichrasti), the coatimundi (Nasua nasua), the raccoon (Procyon lotor), the mountain coati (Nasuella. 0. olivacea), the kinkajou (Potus flavus), the olingo (Brassaricyon gabbii), the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens), and the giant panda (Aliuropoda inelanoleuca). Widely distributed throughout North America, the raccoon's range encompasses southern Canada, most of North America and parts of Central America. For habitat, it prefers heavily wooded areas and dense underbrush where it makes dens in trees near sources of water. The encroachment of man on its natural habitat has not significantly effected the raccoon, which can also be found in abundance in suburban and urban settings feeding on garbage and living in attics, chimneys, parks and cemeteries. The raccoon is a nocturnal omnivor feeding, in the wild, on a variety of fish, frogs, small mammals, fruits, berries and seeds. Adults range in weight from 1. 5 to 22 kg, attain a head- body length of 41. 5 to 60. 0 cm, and shoulder height of 25. 5 to 30. 4 cm. The breeding season lasts from January to June.

40|$|Faecal {{nitrogen}} (FN) {{concentration is}} used as a marker for habitat quality and digestive efficiency in free-ranging herbivores. In herbivores, FN can be separated into undigested plant N (analysed as the N concentration of the neutral detergent residue) and metabolic faecal N (MFN). It has been suggested that by differential analysis of the faecal fibre-bound N, the MFN fraction can be further split into a bacterial N and an endogenous N fraction [Hesta et al., Br. J. Nutr. 90 (2003) 1007]. We applied these methods to 96 faecal samples of 48 mammalian herbivore species from zoos. Species were grouped into coprophageous and noncoprophageous hindgut fermenters and ruminating and non-ruminating foregut fermenters. Diet was not controlled. The FN decreased with body mass, possibly reflecting higher proportions of concentrates in diets of smaller animals. The proportion of MFN increased with FN, indicating that higher quality food might enhance the gastrointestinal bacterial flora. The only outlier to this pattern was the <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailurus fulgens), confirming the low relevance of fermentative digestion in this herbivorous ‘carnivore’. No relevant differences between the four digestion types were noted. The proportion of endogenous faecal N (32 – 80 % of FN) was always higher than that of bacterial faecal N (7 – 30 %), which contradicts basal understanding of herbivore digestive physiology. Thus, the method of Hesta et al. (2003) does not appear applicable to herbivores. While the results do not exclude the possibility that detailed differences might occur between digestion types, they indicate a high degree of similarity between herbivores that rely on bacterial fermentation, regardless of their digestion type, with respect to metabolic faecal losses...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the Mammalia {{have been studied}} at various levels. Different sources of genetic information have been evaluated and used as phylogenetic markers. These include the well-known mitochondrial genome, cDNA from housekeeping genes and expressed sequence tags from nuclear genes. Applying RT-PCR on mRNA from nuclear genes is a new approach for collecting nuclear gene data for studying the phylogeny of Placentalia. The sequence analysis of eight housekeeping genes found Glires as sister group to the remaining Placentalia. The evaluation of previously suggested phylogenetic hypotheses requires large amounts of data that cannot be collected from individually selected genes. Whole genome sequencing projects have made the sequence data from numerous placental mammals available. The data from an appropriate outgroup to root the placental mammal tree was initially missing. Therefore expressed sequence tag from a marsupial mouse was made. This increased the amount of sequence data for phylogenetic analysis a hundredfold compared to methods that select individual genes. Phylogenetic analysis recovered a monophyletic Euarchontoglires and Boreoeutheria, thus contradicting {{the results from the}} housekeeping gene dataset. Mammalia contains three subgroups: Prototheria, Metatheria and Eutheria. The analysis of genomic and EST sequence data supported a sister group relationship between Eutheria and Metatheria in accordance with the Theria hypothesis. Molecular estimates of their divergence times suggest a basal divergence of Theria at ? 138 MYA and the basal divergences of Mammalia was estimated to 167 ? 178 MYA. Mitogenomics has been used to study divergences of Caniformia, the dog like carnivores. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a basal divergence between dogs and the remaining caniforms. Within the caniforms, seals and musteloids are sister taxa. Molecular evidence clearly identifies the giant panda as belonging to the bear lineage.

40|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), also called red {{cat-bear}} or <b>lesser</b> <b>panda</b> is a threatened species due to human {{destruction of the}} environment the panda is living in. The red panda is the only species in the family Ailuridae, since they can neither {{be in the same}} family as bears or raccoons, but they do belong in the same superfamily as the raccoon. They are classified as carnivores but their diet mainly consists of bamboo. The red panda lives in the foot of the Himalayas in subtropical and temperate forests. They live on an altitude of around 3000 meters close to water and can often be found in winter green trees. The red panda is a solitary animal outside the breeding season but they can live in family groups and in pairs. They can communicate with different kind of sound signals that could sound like birds singing, whistles and high pitch screams. They also have aggressive sounds like growling, hissing and snorting. The panda also communicates by scent marking. They do not spend much time on social behaviours as play, all grooming or aggressive behaviours. The aim {{of this study was to}} see how the red pandas utilise their enclosure, what kind of social behaviour they perform and also if the two of them are connected. To investigate this an ethological study was conducted on three red pandas at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Enclosure utilisation was studied with scan sampling with an interval of 1 minute and social behaviour with behaviour observation where every social behaviour was noted. Both methods were used at the same time during four hours a day for ten days during 14 - 15 April. The pandas in this study spend most of their time in trees and especially one tree, a tree which at the time of the study had no leafs. The second most used tree was a pine tree which hade pine needles and it was a surprise the pandas did not prefer that tree. They did not perform much social behaviours and the behaviour performed most was scent marking. At two occasions the pandas interacted with each other by body contact and made aggressive sound signals toward each other. It is not possible to see any connection between enclosure utilisation and social behaviour. But it is possible to see a tendency that the social behaviour occurs in trees, which is probably due to the pandas spending so much of their time in in the trees...|$|E
