25|$|Double {{ionization}} is {{a process}} of formation of doubly charged ions when <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> is exerted on neutral atoms or molecules.

25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina.

If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within {{a fraction of a}} second, literally faster than the blink of an eye. Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near infrared range (400-1400nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> with wavelengths less than 400nm and greater than 1400nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.|$|E

25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will {{have to cope with}} space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> at a variety of frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{cannot be}} stored in a {{container}} made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and {{an equal amount of}} the container. Antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, in a device called a Penning trap. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which atomic traps are used. In particular, such a trap may use the dipole moment (electric or magnetic) of the trapped particles. At high vacuum, the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> using a magneto-optical trap or magnetic trap. Small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers, using a highly focused laser beam.|$|E

She resisted immediate exploratory surgery as she was filming the fifth season of Petticoat Junction at the time and feared the show would be affected by her absence. On November 26, she underwent the operation at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, and a tumor was found that could not be removed. Diagnosed with lung cancer, Benaderet underwent six weeks of <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> treatment via a linear particle accelerator at Stanford University Medical Center.

[...] If the polarization in the molecule does not couple to these other possible polarizations, then it will not change the vibrational state that the molecule started in and the scattered photon {{will have the same}} energy as the original photon.

5000|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} {{have achieved}} significantly farther distances using incoherent sources {{of light from}} high-intensity LEDs. One reported 173 mi in 2007. [...] However, physical limitations of the equipment used limited bandwidths to about 4 kHz. The high sensitivities required of the detector to cover such distances made the internal capacitance of the photodiode used a dominant factor in the high-impedance amplifier which followed it, thus naturally forming a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency in the 4 kHz range.

The writing process does not produce indentations (pits); instead, the heat permanently changes the optical properties of the dye, changing the reflectivity of those areas. Using a low laser power, {{so as not to}} further alter the dye, the disc is read back {{in the same way as}} a CD-ROM. However, the reflected light is modulated not by pits, but by the alternating regions of heated and unaltered dye. The change of the intensity of the reflected <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> is transformed into an electrical signal, from which the digital information is recovered ("decoded"). Once a section of a CD-R is written, it cannot be erased or rewritten, unlike a CD-RW. A CD-R can be recorded in multiple sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Gaussian {{beams of}} any beam waist w0 satisfy this wave equation; {{this is most}} easily {{verified}} by expressing the wave at z {{in terms of the}} complex beam parameter q(z) as defined above. There are many other solutions. As solutions to a linear system, any combination of solutions (using addition or multiplication by a constant) is also a solution. The fundamental Gaussian happens to be the one [...] that minimizes the product of minimum spot size and far-field divergence, as noted above. In seeking paraxial solutions, and in particular ones that would describe <b>laser</b> <b>radiation</b> that is not in the fundamental Gaussian mode, we will look for families of solutions with gradually increasing products of their divergences and minimum spot sizes. Two important orthogonal decompositions of this sort are the Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, corresponding to rectangular and circular symmetry respectively, as detailed in the next section. With both of these, the fundamental Gaussian beam we have been considering is the lowest order mode.|$|E
2500|$|In {{classical}} optics, {{light is}} {{thought of as}} electromagnetic waves radiating from a source. Often, coherent laser light is thought of as light that is emitted by many such sources that are in phase. Actually, the picture of one photon being in-phase with another is not valid in quantum theory. [...] <b>Laser</b> <b>radiation</b> is produced in a resonant cavity where the resonant frequency of the cavity {{is the same as}} the frequency associated with the atomic electron transitions providing energy flow into the field. [...] As energy in the resonant mode builds up, the probability for stimulated emission, in that mode only, increases. [...] That is a positive feedback loop in which the amplitude in the resonant mode increases exponentially until some non-linear effects limit it. [...] As a counter-example, a light bulb radiates light into a continuum of modes, and there is nothing that selects any one mode over the other. The emission process is highly random in space and time (see thermal light). In a laser, however, light is emitted into a resonant mode, and that mode is highly coherent. Thus, laser light is idealized as a coherent state. (Classically we describe such a state by an electric field oscillating as a stable wave. [...] See Fig.1) ...|$|E
