Fixed Effects Model was used as pooled regression model to find the relationship between firm performance (ROA, ROE, ROS) and capital expenditure (DTA, EQA, LDA). Results showed that there does exist a relationship but direction of the relationship was mixed.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} between bank rescues, financial fragility and sovereign debt discounts. To that end {{we set up a}} model that contains balance sheet constrained financial intermediaries financing both capital expenditure of intermediate goods producers and government deficits. The financial intermediaries face the risk of a (partial) default of the government on its debt obligations {{due to the fact that}} there exists a maximum level of debt service that is politically feasible ("Fiscal Limit"). First we analyze the impact of a financial crisis, comparing the case of full credibility of government debt with the case of an endogenous sovereign debt discount. We find that the introduction of the default possibility does not in itself have an effect on the equilibrium outcome under the assumption of short <b>term</b> <b>debt</b> finance only. Interest rates on debt reflect higher default probabilities, but because all <b>debt</b> is short <b>term,</b> bank balance sheets are unaffected and no further negative amplification effects arise through the endogenous sovereign debt channel. This changes when <b>long</b> <b>term</b> government <b>debt</b> is introduced due to the impact of capital losses on bank balance sheets. We find that the equilibrium outcome significantly deteriorates with respect to the case where the government uses short <b>term</b> <b>debt.</b> Higher interest rates on new debt lead to capital losses on banks' holding of existing <b>long</b> <b>term</b> government <b>debt.</b> The associated increase in credit tightness leads to a strongly negative amplification effect, significantly increasing the output losses, recession duration and declines in investment after a financial crisis. This raises potential conflicting macroeconomic influences of a debt financed recapitalization of banks after a financial crisis. We investigate the case where the government tackles the financial crisis by announcing a recapitalization of the financial system to occur 4 quarters after announcement. Under the parameter values chosen, the positive effects from an anticipated capital injection dominate the effects of the associated increase in sovereign default risk...|$|R

Nevertheless, the investment growth of manufacturing firms still declined. This condition indicated that fiscal stimulus might be ineffective to prevent investment-growth from declining. The decline of investment might {{be influenced by}} the increase of firm financial constraints to access a source of <b>long</b> <b>term</b> <b>debts.</b> This study aimed to examine the influence of financial constraints in moderating the effect of financing decisions from internal financing sources on investment. The population of the study was all listed-manufacturing firms in Indonesia from 2013 to 2015. Samples were chosen based on the availability of firms’ financial report covering the period of the study. The study concluded that financial constraints significantly weaken the effect of internal funding decision on investment. Unconstrained firms had a higher beta than constrained firms. Although unconstrained firms had an opportunity to choose their source of funding, they preferred to finance their investment from cash flows because the cost of debts might be much higher than the cost of equity. Hence, to help firms to finance their feasible investment opportunity, the government should not only provide tax incentives but also provide a low-interest loan...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{poisonous}} interaction between bank rescues, financial fragility and sovereign debt discounts. In our model balance sheet constrained financial intermediaries finance both capital expenditure of intermediate goods producers and government deficits. The financial intermediaries face {{the risk of}} a (partial) default of the government on its debt obligations. We analyse the impact of a financial crisis, first under full government credibility and then with an endogenous sovereign debt discount. We introduce <b>long</b> <b>term</b> government <b>debt,</b> which gives rise to the possibility of capital losses on bank balance sheets. The negative feedback effects from falling bond prices on the economy are shown to increase with the average duration of the government bonds, as higher interest rates on new debt lead to capital losses on banks' holding of existing <b>long</b> <b>term</b> (government) <b>debt.</b> The associated increase in credit tightness leads to a negative amplification effect, significantly increasing output losses and declines in investment after a financial crisis. We introduce sovereign default risk through the existence of a maximum sustainable level of debt, derived from the maximum level of taxation that is politically feasible. When close to this limit, sovereign discounts emerge reflecting potential defaults on debt, creating a strong link between sovereign default risk and financial fragility emerges. A debt-financed recapitalisation of the financial intermediaries causes bond prices to drop triggering capital losses at the bank under intervention. This mechanism shows the limits to conventional bank bail-outs in countries with fragile public creditworthiness, limits that became very visible during the Great Recession in Southern Europe...|$|R
