This journal article outlines {{the history of the}} policing women’s bodies in Ireland in the context of <b>law,</b> crime <b>and</b> <b>reproduction.</b> It does this by means of three case studies. The first case study explores the policing of women’s bodies in relation to sexuality. The second case study focuses on <b>reproduction</b> <b>and</b> the policing of women’s bodies in relation to <b>reproduction.</b> The third <b>and</b> final case study considers the policing of women’s bodies in relation to abortion. Taken together, these three case studies provide an overview of the capacity, and indeed the readiness, that exists in Irish society to police women’s bodies and to do so particularly in relation to sexuality <b>and</b> <b>reproduction...</b>|$|R

Conditioning on ultimate extinction of the process we analyze the conditional distribution of the cycle length and its expectation.

Such transformations, on the other hand, had propitiated the retaken one of the social control of the capital, in virtue of the process of spalling of the diligent classroom and of the depreciation of the work force, and, for another one, they had created limitations to the accumulation, which had been precariously contouring for intermediary of the magnifying of the accumulation in financial bases. However, such dynamics of accumulation, centered in the finances, comes conforming an increase of the economic dependence and a deepening of the different social picture, mainly in the peripheral countries has seen the conformation of a "new imperialism". ...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the bastard}} daughter, no {{accounting}} {{has been made}} {{in the history of the}} early British novel. Sexing the bastard as male, critics have read illegitimacy principally through Henry Fielding 2 ̆ 7 s Tom Jones and the genre of the picaresque. Once sought, however, the bastard daughter is found throughout the long history of the eighteenth-century British narrative, from Daniel Defoe 2 ̆ 7 s Moll Flanders (1722) to Jane Austen 2 ̆ 7 s Emma (1816). Within this contextual frame, the representation of female illegitimacy in the late eighteenth-century novel by women writers emerges as a concentrated moment of cultural productivity and revision. Thematically, female illegitimacy instantiates a series of shifts in this period: the prominent reclaiming of the novel by women writers; the increasing displacement of identity from a locale or native origin into the anonymity of the metropolis; the consequent move to recuperate and aestheticize that which is most natural or unmediated by culture; and the institutionalization of natural history and naturalized languages of classification as alternate paradigms of identity to genealogy, <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> the family. Discursively, female illegitimacy offered women writers a narrative frame within which operative categories of subjectivity [...] nature and culture, birth and class, sex and gender, family <b>and</b> <b>law,</b> breeding <b>and</b> <b>reproduction</b> [...] could be critically realigned. In Frances Burney 2 ̆ 7 s Evelina (1778) the illegitimate daughter is subject to an incest crisis that restructures patrilineal inheritance within the landed class. In Charlotte Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Emmeline (1788) the natural daughter recasts her exile from the British nation-state through an emerging Romantic aesthetic of the cultural margin. In Mary Wollstonecraft 2 ̆ 7 s The Wrongs of Woman (1798) the female bastard Jemima, classifying herself as a 2 ̆ 2 creature of another species, 2 ̆ 2 inscribes a radical political critique of social exclusion and sexual difference through the taxonomic languages of eighteenth-century naturalism. In Jane Austen 2 ̆ 7 s Emma (1816), the natural daughter Harriet Smith is given the breeding to marry into the gentry class, a mobility harnessed to the new economy of agrarian improvement, until her rise threatens the structure of inherited privilege. As a revisionary figure, the bastard daughter calls forward new relations of class, aesthetic ordering, and cultural discourse in the British novel at the end of the eighteenth century. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} Colombian professionals have developed reproductive <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> policies {{during the past}} century {{in the name of}} being modern. I focus on four moments of reproductive lawmaking from 1936 - 2006, analyzing legal and sociolegal texts that record or inform the lawmaking process. These four moments of reproductive lawmaking are the 1936 Colombian Criminal Code, which increased penalties for men’s sexual crimes as well as abortion; two 1960 s policies that promoted family planning; the 1991 Constitutional Assembly and the debate whether to include a comprehensive reproductive right, libre opción a la maternidad (free motherhood) in the new constitution; and the 2006 Colombian Constitutional Court decision C- 355, which decriminalized abortion in three instances. Studying each moment reveals Colombian professionals – lawyers, politicians, highly educated feminists, doctors, and others – participating in knowledge discourses which construct a particular approach to reproduction as the necessary course of action if Colombia would be modern. In 1936, Colombian lawyer-politicians employed legal positivist science to scrutinize sexual crimes and develop a rule of law in keeping with other liberal, modern states. During the 1960 s, a community of Colombian doctors and politicians developed family planning policies in an attempt to curb rapid population growth. Grounded in the ideas of transnational population studies, the Colombian professionals feared “overpopulation” would undermine Colombia’s ability to prosper socially and economically, leaving Colombia “behind” modern nations. The 1991 Colombian Constitutional Assembly shows a commitment to inclusive democratic politics and women’s equality to counter representations of the country as violent and the state as incapable of governance. Finally, the 2006 Constitutional Court decision decriminalizing abortion portrays Colombia as an equal partner with other states in promoting women’s rights through international human rights. The dissertation shows how Colombian professionals’ understandings of current challenges facing the state interact with knowledges based in other countries or developed in transnational circles; and that the discursive construction of these knowledges as the “modern” approach towards <b>law</b> <b>and</b> women’s <b>reproduction</b> generates both pressure and enthusiasm among professionals to enact these knowledges in reproductive lawmaking. Based in transnational feminisms, I use the term “geopolitics of knowledge” to refer to how social, economic, and political forces shape the circulation of knowledge discourses and effects across transnational space; as well as to how relations of power at a transnational scale affect how knowledges circulate and how, when, and who participates in a given knowledge, or “takes it up. ” The dissertation shows that conceptions of modernity change over time, with implications for legal approaches towards <b>reproduction</b> <b>and</b> women’s reproductive lives...|$|R
