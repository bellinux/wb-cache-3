40|$|RHAPIT was a {{pilot project}} for {{integrated}} <b>inter-urban</b> <b>traffic</b> management {{and focused on the}} Rhine-Main area in the centre of Germany with one of the densest motorway networks in Europe and cities such as Frankfurt, Offenbach, Wiesbaden, Mainz, and Darmstadt. Due to various traffic problems many control systems had been installed and connected with the traffic control centre at Ruesselsheim. A traffic control system with congestion and incident warning, speed control and weather warning via more than 140 variable message signs (VMS) was implemented on the A 5 motorway. At eight major interchanges variable direction signalling systems were installed. More than 1, 200 loop detectors collected traffic and congestion information and transmitted them to the traffic control centre which, after processing the data, transfered the data to radio broadcasters for dissemination by a system called ARIAM (Automatic Radio Information via Actual Measurements).

50|$|When the Kimberley-Klerksdorp {{line was}} {{eventually}} relaid with heavier rails, the Class 10CR were displaced by {{larger and more}} powerful locomotives and transferred to Cape Town, where most of them worked the <b>local</b> <b>inter-urban</b> services. Part of their duties was to haul the weekly mail trains between the East Pier and Monument Station. On Fridays, the Union-Castle Line’s mailship berthed at the East Pier, from where mail trains to Transvaal and Rhodesia would depart. A shunting engine would bring these carriages from the pier via Dock Road to Monument Station, where the mainline locomotive, dining saloon, kitchen car and carriages for local passengers would be attached. They remained in this service until they were later relegated to shunting and goods pickup work {{for the rest of}} their years.|$|R

In the 1990s, some Class 144, 155, 158, 308, 321 and 333s were painted in Metro livery. All were later repainted in Northern Rail livery. Some of the 144s and 155s were originally purchased by the WYPTE but have since been sold to Porterbrook. Metro retain ownership of the 158 and 321s which are leased to the Northern franchise holder.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccurate {{estimation}} of the future state of the traffic is an attracting area for researchers {{in the field of}} Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This kind of predictions can lead to traffic managers and drivers to act in consequence, reducing the economic and social impact of a possible congestion. Due to the <b>inter-urban</b> <b>traffic</b> information nature, the task of predicting the future state of the traffic requires, in most cases, a non-linear patterns search in the input data. In recent years, a wide variety of models has been used to solve this problem in the most accurate way. Due to that, models generated to provide information about the future state of the road are, usually, incomprehensible to a human operator, making impossible to give him/her an explanation about the causes of the prediction. Given the capacity of rule based systems to explain the reasoning followed to classify a new pattern, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} such approaches are explored in this work. To conduct such task, datasets recorded from the California Department of Transportation are created. A 9 -kilometer section of the I 5 highway of Sacramento is used for this research. Two different types of datasets are built for the experimentation. One of them contains the entire information recorded. The other one contains with a simplified version of the information, considering only the first, middle and last monitored points of the road. Twelve prediction horizons, from 5 to 60 minutes, were considered for prediction. An experimental comparative study involving 16 state of the art techniques is performed. Techniques tested include those that fall within the categories of Evolutionary Crisp Rule Learning (ECRL) and Evolutionary Fuzzy Rule Learning (EFRL). These methods were selected since they offer to the final user, not only a prediction, but also a legible model about the way in which the decision was taken. Techniques are compared in terms of accuracy and complexity of the models generated...|$|R
40|$|Summary. This article {{presents}} new empirical {{estimates of the}} impact of two types of policy intervention, tax subsidies and land use planning, on the housing market in Britain. The estimates are derived from a set of models representing the demand and supply sides of the market for the new private housebuilding which include an explicit land supply element. The models are fitted to cross-sectional data at the <b>inter-urban</b> (<b>local</b> authority) level, and then employed in medium-period simulations of alternative policies. Modelling at this level enables estimates to be made of the extent of variation between local markets in the elasticity of supply and also in the impacts of policy measures, including the capitalisation of tax subsidies. 1...|$|R
25|$|A {{couple of}} busy {{intercity}} corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median traffic barriers. Highway 1 on Vancouver Island and Highway 97 through the Okanagan Valley are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds {{that range from}} 50km/h to maximums just slightly lower than the principal grade-separated highways. Numerous traffic lights operate in place of interchanges on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures. Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along <b>inter-urban</b> sections where <b>traffic</b> volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways {{is the responsibility of}} the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|Floating vehicle {{equipped}} floating vehicle {{technology has}} been widely used to collect urban and <b>inter-urban</b> road network <b>traffic</b> data for network evaluation, traffic management and dynamic road guidance purposes. It {{has become one of}} the major technologies of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Most of the commonly used floating vehicle devices receive floating vehicle data in a frequency of 1 Hz. To collect real time traffic data of the road network for the above application, floating vehicle data from floating vehicles has to be transmitted from vehicles to a traffic data management centre in short time intervals. With the increase in the numbers of floating vehicles, the cost on communication increases dramatically. This is often one of the major barriers limiting the application of floating vehicle technologies for real time traffic route guidance and many other applications. This paper proposes a floating vehicle floating vehicle data transmission strategy, which can significantly reduce the data transmission cost with satisfied accuracy for real time traffic management and dynamic road guidance purposes...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction of {{high traffic}} roads {{presents}} considerable challenges to minimizing delays due to traffic incidents. The Pacific Motorway Project was a fast-track reconstruction of 43 km {{of one of}} the most heavily <b>trafficked</b> <b>inter-urban</b> routes in Australia, carrying up to 90, 000 vehicles per day between Brisbane and the Gold Coast in South East Queensland. Reconstruction by the State Department of Main Roads involved upgrading from four to eight lanes, under traffic and along an existing corridor. Keeping traffic flowing route was a priority, and key objectives during the construction and operation phases (with sections progressively opened to traffic) were to ensure smooth traffic flow, minimizing impact on road users; to ensure the Motorway operated safely; and, to limit project cost, balancing design and construction with the operation of the existing roadway, to reduce costs, traffic delays and safety risks to acceptable levels. While these objectives are at times in tension, they were able to be satisfactorily achieved through a range of incident management initiatives, including setting clear objectives and performance standards, building good working partnerships, application of appropriate cost-effective technology and well thought out communication strategies. Successful incident management during the project meant tha...|$|R
