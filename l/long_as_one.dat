5|$|When Sulla {{returned}} in 82BC, {{he was made}} dictator {{for the purpose of}} bringing order to the Republic's politics. Sulla attempted to concentrate political power into the Senate and the aristocratic assemblies, whilst trying to reduce the obstructive and legislative powers of the tribune and Plebeian council. However, his changes were not to last. With significant popular unrest, the tribunate's powers were quickly restored by 70BC. Sulla passed legislation to make it illegal to march on Rome as he had, but having just shown that doing so would bring no personal harm so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> was victorious, this had little effect.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Channel is {{difficult}} to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of adventure, simulation, and digital pet games. The graphics are in 3D, the perspective is first-person, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with a Pikachu, a mouse-like Pokémon. The player, {{who lives in a}} house, can channel-surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the pokémon professor, Professor Oak, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness or anger. The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> real-time day.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, {{one must be}} at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States, and have been a {{resident}} of the state {{for at least two years}} prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election. An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years. Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once. There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years.|$|E

This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels.

25|$|One {{classical}} algorithm, {{which is}} both simple and flexible, is based on finding the next permutation in lexicographic ordering, if it exists. It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates the distinct multiset permutations each once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the factorial number system) and converting those to permutations. To use it, one starts by sorting the sequence in (weakly) increasing order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> is found. The method goes back to Narayana Pandita in 14th century India, and has been frequently rediscovered ever since.|$|E
25|$|Fannia scalaris, {{also known}} as the latrine fly, is a fly species in the Fanniidae family. This species is smaller and more slender than the house fly, Musca domestica, and is similar in {{appearance}} to the lesser house fly, Fannia canicularis. The life cycle of this species can be as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> month. These flies are globally distributed in urban areas as they are drawn to unsanitary environments. F. scalaris is a major cause of myiasis, the infestation of a body cavity by fly maggots. The adults infest bodies that have decomposed, making the species an important part of forensic entomology. The larvae of this fly have adapted protuberances, or feathered appendages, that allow them to survive in such a moist environment. Entomologists continue to research the effects that F. scalaris may have medically, forensically, and on the environment around them.|$|E

25|$|At common law, as for {{all forms}} of misrepresentation, {{innocent}} misrepresentation {{gave rise to the}} right to rescind a contract. It was not possible to get damages, but so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> was not confronted by a bar to rescission, the misrepresentee had a right to escape the contract. When the Misrepresentation Act 1967 was passed, it was decided that this right to rescission could be used {{in a way that was}} unfair on a misrepresentor. So section 2(2) gives the court a discretion about whether it will allow rescission of a contract, or substitute an appropriate award of damages in lieu (instead). In William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC William Sindall plc claimed rescission of a land purchase from Cambridgeshire County Council on the ground that the council falsely (but innocently) stated there were no sewage pipes on the property. This would have cost £18,000 to remove, and the land had been bought for £5m. The real reason that William Sindall wanted to escape from the contract was that land prices had just crashed. The court held that in fact the contract had made the buyer assume any risk of such representations and there was no right to rescind. But if there had been, it would have exercised its discretion under s 2(2) to award a small sum of damages.|$|E
25|$|At Roadblock: End of the Line, Charlotte Flair {{defeated}} Sasha Banks to win {{her record}} fourth Raw Women's Championship, ending their long feud and, as per a post-event stipulation, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of them were champion, the other could not challenge for the title. Charlotte then began a feud with Bayley, {{which resulted in a}} championship match at the Royal Rumble, where Charlotte retained. Also during this time, Sasha entered into a feud with Nia Jax, who defeated Sasha on the Royal Rumble pre-show. The next night on Raw, Bayley pinned Charlotte in a six-person mixed tag team match, thus granting her a rematch for the title on the February 13 episode of Raw, where she defeated Charlotte to become the new Raw Women's Champion, thanks to help from Sasha. The following week, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon asked Bayley to relinquish her title due to Sasha's interference, but Bayley refused and Charlotte invoked her championship rematch for Fastlane, which saw Bayley retain after Sasha, who had just defeated Jax, again interfered, which subsequently ended Charlotte's undefeated streak in singles matches at pay-per-view events. The following night on Raw, Sasha said that she and Bayley should face off for the title at WrestleMania 33 as it was a dream of theirs to face each other at the event. Charlotte came out and demanded that she should have a rematch due to Sasha's interference and said that Sasha interfered due to the Roadblock stipulation. Raw General Manager Mick Foley then scheduled Charlotte to face Sasha in which the winner would challenge Bayley for the title at WrestleMania. However, Stephanie decided to keep Charlotte in the championship match at WrestleMania, but allowed Sasha the opportunity {{to be added to the}} match if she could defeat Bayley that night, which she did. The following week, Sasha defeated Charlotte's ally Dana Brooke, whom Charlotte had ordered to take out Sasha. Charlotte then fired and insulted Dana, who attacked Charlotte in retaliation. Nia Jax was also given the opportunity to challenge for the championship at WrestleMania if she could defeat Bayley. However, Nia lost the match by disqualification as she kept attacking Bayley beyond the referee's five count, but the following week, Nia defeated Bayley in a rematch that was no disqualification, earning her a spot in the championship match at WrestleMania. The following week prior to Raw, the match was turned into a fatal four-way elimination match. On Raw, Bayley and Sasha teamed up and defeated Charlotte and Nia. After the match, Nia laid out her three WrestleMania opponents.|$|E
