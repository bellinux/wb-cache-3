5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath the Tombs, teaching her the instructions to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts her for a <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>After</b> Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones {{as a threat to}} her power.|$|E

Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E

The effect of caffeine on these processes was determined for both normal human and XP cells. Caffeine, which binds to denatured regions of DNA, inhibited DNA chain elongation and joining in irradiated XP cells but not in irradiated normal human or nonirradiated cells.

40|$|The {{violations}} of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem are analyzed for a trap model with a gausssian density of states.

In particular plots of the integrated response versus the correlation function strongly depend on the way they are constructed. Also the definition of effective temperatures in the frequency domain is not unique for the model considered. This may have some implications for the interpretation of results from computer simulations and experimental determinations of effective temperatures.

40|$|Introduction: Disorders {{of balance}} and {{dizziness}} are characteristic symptoms in patients after vestibular schwannoma surgery and often {{have a negative impact}} on their quality of life. This thesis deals with impairment of postural stability particularly in patients at the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> period <b>after</b> surgery. The aim of this study is to observe the longitudinal development of vestibular compensation from acute postoperative period to time of several years after surgery. Another aim is to evaluate the short-term effect of vestibular rehabilitation in a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> period <b>after</b> surgical treatment, and to compare the results of measuring the subjective visual vertical, posturography, score of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory questionnaire, age and tumor size in these patients. Methods: Examined group consisted of 10 patients after resection of vestibular schwannoma (mean age 41. 4 ± 12. 1 years; 2 women and 8 men). All patients underwent intensive rehabilitation program in the acute phase after surgery. 7 patients did exercise with visual feedback, and 3 patients had conventional rehabilitation without visual feedback. In <b>long</b> <b>time</b> period <b>after</b> surgery all patients underwent one exercise unit with visual feedback.

25|$|For this system, when Q> (i.e., {{when the}} system is underdamped), it has two complex {{conjugate}} poles that each have a real part of −α. That is, the attenuation parameter α represents the rate of exponential decay of the oscillations (that is, of the output after an impulse) into the system. A higher quality factor implies a lower attenuation rate, and so high-Q systems oscillate for many cycles. For example, high-quality bells have an approximately pure sinusoidal tone for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>after</b> being struck by a hammer.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically, this {{is readily}} explained. Barbiturate overdoses {{typically}} cause death by {{depression of the}} respiratory center, but the effect is variable. Some patients may have complete cessation of respiratory drive, whereas others may only have depression of respiratory function. In addition, cardiac activity can last for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>after</b> cessation of respiration. Since death is pronounced after asystole and given that the expectation is for a rapid death in lethal injection, multiple drugs are required, specifically potassium chloride to stop the heart. In fact, {{in the case of}} Clarence Ray Allen, a second dose of potassium chloride was required to attain asystole. The position of most death-penalty supporters is that death should be attained in a reasonable amount of time.|$|E
25|$|The cult of {{the mother}} goddess is treated as an {{indication}} of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one, typically associated with Shaktism. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai. Among the early Dravidians the practice of erecting memorial stones “Natukal or Hero Stone had appeared, and it continued for quite a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>after</b> the Sangam age, down to about 16th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.|$|E

25|$|A {{system with}} high quality factor (Qnbsp&>nbsp&) {{is said to}} be underdamped. Underdamped systems combine {{oscillation}} at a specific frequency with a decay of the amplitude of the signal. Underdamped systems with a low quality factor (a little above Q =nbsp&) may oscillate only once or a few times before dying out. As the quality factor increases, the relative amount of damping decreases. A high-quality bell rings with a single pure tone for a very <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>after</b> being struck. A purely oscillatory system, such as a bell that rings forever, has an infinite quality factor. More generally, the output of a second-order low-pass filter with a very high quality factor responds to a step input by quickly rising above, oscillating around, and eventually converging to a steady-state value.|$|E
25|$|In Sicily, Emperor Frederick II {{endorsed}} a deep {{reform of the}} laws culminating with the promulgation of the Constitutions of Melfi (1231, also known as Liber Augustalis), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time and {{was a source of}} inspiration for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>after.</b> It made the Kingdom of Sicily a centralised state and established the primacy of written law. With relatively small modifications, the Liber Augustalis remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819. His royal court in Palermo, from around 1220 to his death, saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo-Romance language, Sicilian, that had a significant influence on what was to become the modern Italian language. During this period, he also built the Castel del Monte, and in 1224, he founded the University of Naples, now called, after him, Università FedericoII.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reasons for}} a 2nd-century date have been argued. The Pastoral Epistles lay out church {{organisation}} concerning {{the character and}} requirements for bishops, elders, deacons, and widows. Some scholars have claimed that these offices could not have appeared during Paul's lifetime. In terms of theology, some scholars claim that the Pastorals reflect more the characteristics of 2nd century (Proto-orthodox) church thought, {{than those of the}} 1st century. In particular, whilst in the 1st century the idea of Christ's return being immediate was current (see parousia, as also described in the non-pastoral epistles), in the 2nd century it was seen as more distant, matching the choice of the pastorals to lay down instructions for a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>after</b> the passing away of the apostles. Lastly, some have argued that the Pastorals condemn forms of Hellenic mysticism and gnosticism, which were seen as not significant in the 1st century; however, recent scholarship into 1st century Gnosticism has suggested an earlier dominance of Gnostic views.|$|E
