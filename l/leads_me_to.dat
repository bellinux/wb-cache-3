25|$|The term fly {{is applied}} by sea {{fishermen}} {{to a certain}} arrangement of feathers, wax, etc., which I am about to describe the manufacture of, and which may be used with considerable success in mackerel, basse, and pollack fishing. I am not disposed to think, however, that such baits are ever mistaken by the fish which {{they are intended to}} capture for flies; but the number used, {{the way in which they}} are mounted, viz., several on one trace, and the method of their progress through the water, rather <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the belief that they are mistaken for a number of small fry, and treated accordingly.|$|E
25|$|On {{the door}} being opened it knocked against a table which {{was close to}} the {{left-hand}} side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two-thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under-linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that the severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at {{the right side of the}} bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner".|$|E
500|$|In January 1689, a Convention Parliament {{summoned by}} the Prince of Orange assembled, and much {{discussion}} {{relating to the}} appropriate course of action ensued. A party led by Lord Danby held that Mary should be sole monarch, as the rightful hereditary heir, while William and his supporters were adamant that a husband could {{not be subject to}} his wife. William wished to reign as a king, rather than function as a mere consort of a queen. For her part, Mary did not wish to be queen regnant, believing that women should defer to their husbands, and [...] "knowing my heart is not made for a kingdom and my inclination <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a retired quiet life".|$|E

She was a speedy vessel, and invariably did the trip from Brisbane to Sydney in 41 or 42 hours. These facts, combined with the knowledge that she was on her second voyage since her last overhaul, <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe that something very remarkable lies contributed to her destruction." ...|$|E

2500|$|At times, his {{contributions}} doubled as theater criticism, such as when, in 1884, he chronicled O scrisoare pierdută, by the Romanian classic Ion Luca Caragiale. His overall negative {{judgment of the}} play was itself judged negatively by later critics. Repeatedly included in retrospectives as one of Caragiale's detractors, he also criticized Caragiale and Paul Gusty for adapting and staging an anti-war play in 1888. However, he applauded their production of Wilbrandt's Tochter des Herrn Fabricius. His competence in the field was doubted early on by columnist Dimitrie Rosetti-Max. When, in 1887, {{it was announced that}} Claymoor would be staff critic for a French troupe touring Bucharest, Rosetti-Max remarked: [...] "This <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> suspect that the troupe doesn't even have costumes yet, and that Claymoor [...] is there to assess whether the artistes' corsages pass midnight inspection".|$|E
2500|$|Less impressed, Rolling Stone {{continued}} to regard Harrison in an unfavourable light after what Elliot Huntley terms its [...] "volte-face" [...] in 1974. The magazine's reviewer, Ken Tucker, noted {{the accessibility of}} [...] "fast, cheerful numbers" [...] such as [...] "Woman Don't You Cry for Me" [...] and [...] "This Song" [...] but lamented both [...] "George's persistent preaching" [...] elsewhere and that Scott's presence rendered the album as [...] "music with the feeling and sincerity of cellophane". NME critic Bob Woffinden admired Harrison's guitar playing but dismissed him as a lyric writer, before concluding: [...] "Harrison's general demeanour is more encouraging... While it is an album of no particular merit in itself, it is one which <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe that his best work {{may not necessarily be}} behind him." [...] Four years later, however, Woffinden offered a more positive assessment, writing that [...] "His spiritual convictions no longer seemed to be cramping his style, but affording him a generous and open heart. An excellent production and frequently inspired guitar work were amongst the other positive qualities which the album could boast." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 1901, at the Malacañan Palace in Manila, Aguinaldo swore an oath {{accepting}} {{the authority of}} the United States over the Philippines and pledging his allegiance to the American government. On April 19, he issued a Proclamation of Formal Surrender to the United States, telling his followers to lay down their weapons and give up the fight. [...] "Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there be an end to tears and desolation," [...] Aguinaldo said. [...] "The lesson which the war holds out and the significance of which I realized only recently, <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the firm conviction that the complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable but also absolutely essential for the well-being of the Philippines." [...] The capture of Aguinaldo dealt a severe blow to the Filipino cause, {{but not as much as}} the Americans had hoped. General Miguel Malvar took over the leadership of the Filipino government, or what remained of it. He originally had taken a defensive stance against the Americans, but now launched all-out offensive against the American-held towns in the Batangas region. General Vicente Lukbán in Samar, and other army officers, continued the war in their respective areas.|$|E

2500|$|Given Schiller's {{view that}} {{the meaning of a}} thought amounts to the {{consequences}} one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt I were to think to myself, [...] "Cerebos is salt", my thought will be true if it consequently <b>leads</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture I were to think to myself, [...] "Cerebos is salt", my thought would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like [...] "Cerebos is salt" [...] means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later ordinary language philosophers, Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.|$|E
