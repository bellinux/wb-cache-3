Single-attribute dispatching rules, which dispatch vehicles based on only one parameter, are used commonly. However, multi-attribute dispatching rules prove to be better in general. In this study, we introduce new dispatching rules and evaluate their performance compared to several good dispatching rules in literature, using the experimental design of a real case study. The performance criteria are minimizing the average <b>load</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> while keeping the maximum <b>load</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> as small as possible and better utilize vehicles.

40|$|PLAYTHROUGH ring {{performance}} is studied with self-similar traffic patterns. Measurements made by others on local networks {{connected to the}} Internet have shown that TCP traffic is self-similar. Self-similar traffic can be generated using heavy-tailed distributions. In particular, others {{have shown that the}} Weibull distribution provides a good fit for TCP connection interarrival times. The Weibull distribution, with specific parameters measured in real networks, is used to simulate the operation of the PLAYTHROUGH ring under self-similar traffic. Simulation results reveal that the mean <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> performance of the PLAYTHROUGH ring under self-similar traffic is markedly worse than that of hitherto assumed traffic patterns using the exponentially distributed interarrival times and geometrically distributed message lengths. Furthemore, it appears that, in general, mean <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> are significantly greater for PLAYTHROUGH ring under exponential interarrival times and Weibull-distributed message lengths than in the case when message interarrival times and message lengths are assumed to be Weibull-distributed and geometrically distributed, respectively. An analytical model is derived for various PLAYTHROUGH ring performance metrics under the assumption of exponential interarrivals and Weibull-distributed message lengths, including the moments of the number of minipackets, control frame round trip time, transmission time, service time, blocking duration, and <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> When Weibull interarrival times are assumed, finding an analytical model for <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> is a seemingly intractable problem because the Laplace transform of the Weibull distribution does not have a closed form. However, it is shown that, under heavy <b>loads,</b> mean <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> under the assumption of exponentially distributed interarrival times and geometrically distributed message lengths are, in general, a lower bound on mean <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> under the assumption of Weibull interarrivals and geometrically distributed message lengths.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of static and real-time scheduling approaches in vehicle-based internal transport (VBIT) systems, {{which can be found}} in manufacturing and warehouse facilities. We propose three heuristic approaches for static VBIT problems (insertion, combined and column generation), extend them to a dynamic, real-time setting and compare their performance over a rolling time horizon. This time horizon can be seen either as a fixed-time interval in which advance information about loads’ arrivals is available, or as a fixed number of loads which are known to become available in the near future. We also propose two dynamic assignment approaches: with and without look-ahead, respectively. Performance (primarily average <b>load</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time)</b> of the above five dynamic scheduling approaches is compared with two nearest-vehicle-first rules (with and without look-ahead), which are the best vehicle dispatching rules known from literature and which are commonly used in practice. Experimental results show that, if sufficient prior information is available, our dynamic scheduling approaches consistently outperform vehicle dispatching rules. Results also reveal that guide-path layout, load arrival rate and variance, and amount of load pre-arrival information have strong impacts on {{the performance of}} vehicle control approaches. Column generation or the combined heuristics are recommended in small or medium-scale VBIT systems, whereas for large scale VBIT systems, both the combined heuristic and the dynamic assignment approach with look ahead perform best...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the study of a simple but {{effective}} media access protocol for high data rate networks are presented. The protocol is {{based on the fact that}} at high data rates networks can contain multiple messages simultaneously over their span, and that in a ring, nodes used to detect the presence of a message arriving from the immediate upstream neighbor. When an incoming signal is detected, the node must either abort or truncate a message it is presently sending. Thus, the protocol with local carrier sensing and multiple access is designated CSMA/RN. The performance of CSMA/RN with TTattempt and truncate is studied using analytic and simulation models. Three performance factors, <b>wait</b> or access <b>time,</b> service time and response or end-to-end travel time are presented. The service time is basically a function of the network rate, it changes by a factor of 1 between no load and full <b>load.</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>time,</b> which is zero for no load, remains small for load factors up to 70 percent of full load. Response time, which adds travel time while on the network to <b>wait</b> and service <b>time,</b> is mainly a function of network length, especially for longer distance networks. Simulation results are shown for CSMA/RN where messages are removed at the destination. A wide range of local and metropolitan area network parameters including variations in message size, network length, and node count are studied. Finally, a scaling factor based upon the ratio of message to network length demonstrates that the results, and hence, the CSMA/RN protocol, are applicable to wide area networks...|$|R

The proposed model approximates the mean <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> for a given class based on the higher and lower priority tasks receiving service prior to the target and the mean residual service time experienced.

The model is evaluated analytically and by simulation. Results confirm its accuracy, with the difference being a factor of two on average in high loads. Comparisons with other algorithms (such as First-Come-First-Served, Round-Robin and Non-Preemptive Priority Ordered) reveal that EDF achieves a better balance among priority classes where high priority requests are favoured while preventing lower priority requests from over-starvation.

He has also given presentations on his research in several international conferences in both Europe and North America. “Intelligent control of vehicle-based internal transport (VBIT) systems” copes with real-time dispatching and scheduling of internal-transport vehicles, such as forklifts and guided vehicles. VBIT systems can be found in warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing plants, airport and transshipment terminals. Using simulation of two realworld environments, dispatching rules described in literature and several newly introduced rules are compared on performance. The performance evaluation suggests that in environments where queue space is not a restriction, distance-based dispatching rules such as shortest-travel-distance-first outperform time-based dispatching rules such as modified-first-come-first-served and using load prearrival information has a significant positive impact on reducing the average <b>load</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Experimental results also reveal that multi-attribute dispatching rules combining distance and time aspects of vehicles and loads are robust to variations in working conditions. In addition, multi-attribute rules which take vehicle empty travel distance and vehicle requirement at a station into account perform very well in heavy-traffic VBIT systems such as baggage handling systems. Besides dispatching rules, the potential contribution of dynamic vehicle scheduling for VBIT systems is investigated. Experiments using simulation in combination with optimization show that when sufficient pre-arrival information is available a dynamic scheduling approach outperforms the dispatching approach.

Introduction Increasing patient <b>load</b> {{and longer}} <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> at the {{emergency}} departments are well-known phenomena. A central function is the so-called triage system for prioritization of the patients. Only a few studies address the question {{if there is a}} gender bias in triaging and <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Aim To quantify gender effects in a large mixed population of patients seeking health care at a large emergency department and, {{on the basis of the}} magnitude of the gender difference in subpopulations draw conclusions regarding possible causes of observed gender effects. Methods The patient material consisted of all cases seeking medical care {{at the emergency}} ward of the Östra Hospital during 2009 - 2012. They were divided into subgroups on the basis of gender, chief complaint, age and socioeconomic status. A standardized formula (RETTSTM) was used in the triaging process and the patients were prioritized with one of five colors. Three time registrations were recorded; time to triage (TTT), time to doctor (TTD) and total lead time (TLT). Results 135 417 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 54, 2 years. They came from all parts of Gothenburg. Men were more often triaged red/orange and women more often green/yellow. There was no gender difference in TTT. The mean TTD and TLT were significantly longer for females than for males in the entire material, with an approximate magnitude of 15 minutes. The gender signal was seen independently of the chief complaint, in both medical and surgical cases. The signal disappeared among old seriously ill patients and among patients from residence areas with high socioeconomic status. Conclusion We observed differences in <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> and triage priority levels that are hard to explain on the basis of presenting symptoms. The magnitude of the gender dependent signal was affected by age and socioeconomic status.

We carry out the comparative studies using two experimental platforms, namely, a hardware testbed consisting of 16 PCs, and a trace-driven discrete-event simulator. Dispatcher and web server service times used in the simulator are determined by carrying out a set of experiments on the testbed. The simulator is validated against stochastic queuing models and the testbed. Experiments on the testbed are limited by the hardware configuration, but our complementary approach allows us to carry out scalability study on the validated simulator. The three dispatcherbased scheduling algorithms analyzed are: round robin scheduling, least connected based scheduling, and least loaded based scheduling. The least loaded algorithm is used as the baseline (upper performance bound) in our analysis and the performance metrics include average <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> average response time, and average web server utilization. A synthetic trace generated by the workload generator called SURGE, and a public-domain France Football World Cup 1998 trace are used. We observe that the round robin algorithm performs much worse {{in comparison with the}} other two algorithms for low to medium workload. However, as the request arrival rate increases the performance of the three algorithms converge with the least connected algorithm approaching the baseline algorithm as at a much faster rate than the round robin.

To this end it has a 3 -layer architecture that involves (i) passenger route choice on a network of transit legs and pedestrian links, (ii) line coordination of service missions, vehicle runs with their link running times and station dwelling times, track occupancy and passenger waiting at stations, (iii) vehicle running, including the alighting and boarding of passengers in relation to run dwelling time at the station, in-vehicle passenger load in relation to seat capacity and total vehicle capacity. Yet the line model is macroscopic both for passenger flows and for vehicles serving a given mission, through a frequency variable per station. The paper brings about a novel, hybrid line model that can be used on a standalone basis at the line level or by inclusion in a three-layered model such as CapTA. In the model, a macroscopic representation of passenger flows is hybridized with a microscopic simulation of vehicles. This enables us to simulate headway (ir-) regularity and derive its consequences on vehicle <b>loads,</b> passenger <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> and on-board comfort, track occupancy and vehicle delay for railway modes. The resulting leg generalized times will be used to better simulate optimal travel strategies for path choice in a network in traffic assignment models such as CapTA.

40|$|Abstract—Scheduling multisource {{divisible}} loads is {{a challenging}} task as different sources should cooperate {{and share their}} computing power with others to balance their loads and minimize total computational time. In this study, we attempt to address a generalized divisible load scheduling problem for handling loads from multiple sources on arbitrary networks. This problem {{is all the more}} challenging as 1) the topology is arbitrary, 2) in such networks, it is difficult to decide from which source and which route a processing node should receive loads, and 3) processing nodes must be allocated to different sources when they become available. We study two distinct cases of interest, static case and dynamic case, and propose two novel strategies, referred to as Static Scheduling Strategy (SSS) and Dynamic Scheduling Strategy (DSS), respectively. Both strategies work in an iterative fashion. In each iteration, they will use a novel Graph Partitioning (GP) scheme to partition the network such that each source in the network gains a portion of network resources and then these sources cooperate to process their loads. We analyze the performance of DSS using queuing theory and derive upper bounds on a <b>load’s</b> average <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and a source’s average queue length. We use simulation to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of SSS and DSS. Our findings reveal an interesting “load insensitive ” property of SSS and also verify the theoretical upper bound of average queue length at each source in the dynamic case.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. In queuing systems, <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and {{idle time}} are {{considered}} nonproductive since <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> limits opportunities to improve productivity, while idle time creates wasteful operation costs. Bulk cement loading {{process is a}} good example to illustrate the problem in logistics distribution system. Reduction of <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and throughput time of cement trucks in cement loading process requires such additional resources as loading machines and operators, which trade off additional operation costs for cement distributors; however, an abundant number of input resources could create idle time. On the other hand, minimizing the input resources can significantly save costs for entrepreneurs; however, <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and throughput time of trucks could be excessive that limits the number of trips that trucks could travel to transport cement. To maximize utilities of cement trucks and input resources, a trade-off between truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and server idle time needs to be resolved. The current practice yields average <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> of 26. 0 minutes per truck and throughput time of 71. 5 minutes per truck. According to the survey conducted by the plant, the current practice reflects the declining in customer satisfaction since the throughput time is high. To say, the current practice causes, on average, 47. 5 minutes of non-productive time per truck, compared to 24. 0 minutes of cement loading time. Consequently, simulations need to be performed for the sake of determining some balance between truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and idle time of servers. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} develop a simulation model that maximizes the utilization factor of truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and machine idle time in cement loading process. In addition, among the models showing maximum utilization factor, the study aims to pick up the potential model that can reduce truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> and queue length, with as lowest machine idle time as possible. By using EZStrobe software, the current approach of the cement loading process was simulated based on the data obtained between August 2012 and June 2013. Model validation was performed by comparing results from the process simulation model with the results obtained from statistics to indicate accuracy of the simulation approach before proceeding to making improvements on the model. Various simulation models were developed by adjusting the process and allocating resources to predict total costs, average idle time of <b>loading</b> machines, average <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> average queue length, and average throughput time of trucks for each model. Sensitivity analysis were performed to determine the best practice that yields the greatest utilization factor and improve the overall performance of the process by minimizing truck <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> queue length, and machine idle time, with reasonable corresponding cost. The research was conducted based on a case study of the cement loading system at Asia Cement Plant by using population data collected during August 2012 -June 2013. The current model and improved simulation models, alongside with their results, were graphically and numerically presented to illustrate potential of the models in terms of maximizing the utilization factor.

30|$|The {{multiplexing}} approach significantly improves PRB utilization. However, {{there are}} certain constraints regarding latency requirements of high priority M 2 M traffic such as accidental information, emergency alerting, and e-health. This {{is due to the}} fact that each packet waits until the size of the buffer B is equal to the available TBS—RN Un protocol overheads. In a highly <b>loaded</b> scenario, the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> is not long due to a high arrival rate. However, in a low loaded scenario, there is a comparatively longer delay due to the low arrival rate. Consequently, the performance of delay sensitive M 2 M applications can be degraded. To tackle this issue, an expiry timer, T_ is introduced. The timer is set with a fixed value such as 10  ms in the current implementation. This means that the buffer serves the multiplexed packet after 10  ms at the latest. The value of the timer could also be adaptive, i.e., it can change its value according to priorities of the incoming packets. For this purpose, the algorithm must be fully aware of various priorities of M 2 M applications.|$|R
40|$|Maximizing {{parallelism}} {{level in}} applications {{can be achieved}} by minimizing overheads due to <b>load</b> imbalances and <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> due to memory latencies. Compiler optimization {{is one of the most}} effective solutions to tackle this problem. The compiler is able to detect the data dependencies in an application and is able to analyze the specific sections of code for parallelization potential. However, all of these techniques provided with a compiler are usually applied at compile time, so they rely on static analysis, which is insufficient for achieving maximum parallelism and producing desired application scalability. One solution to address this challenge is the use of runtime methods. This strategy can be implemented by delaying certain amount of code analysis to be done at runtime. In this research, we improve the parallel application performance generated by the OP 2 compiler by leveraging HPX, a C++ runtime system, to provide runtime optimizations. These optimizations include asynchronous tasking, loop interleaving, dynamic chunk sizing, and data prefetching.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} an {{integrated}} {{approach has been}} proposed to identify and schedule a rail transit corridor in a city which has a potential demand for a new rail based mass transit system besides the street transit system and existing rail-based system (if any). The motivation {{for the present study}} comes from the present Indian context where, because of recent initiatives of Central Urban Development Ministry, many Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and transit agencies need to master plan new rail based systems in an optimum way {{and at the same time}} attempting to integrate them with other existing public transport (PT) modes. While aligning the new rail transit system, the primary focus of the integrated approach is to optimize the origin–destination (O–D) travel time of the user and at the same time attempting to minimize the operators’ cost. The proposed rail corridor identification model consists of three stages: public transport demand forecasting, creation of corridor link set, and optimization of rail corridor using Geographical Information System (GIS). The objective function for train scheduling model is fixed as minimization of sum of operating cost of trains (operator cost) and total <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> cost of passengers boarding the train (user costs) subject to <b>load</b> factor and <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> constraints. The dwell time of train at stations, which is usually considered constant, has been taken as a variable which depends on the actual number of passengers boarding and alighting the train. The model is applied on Thane municipal corporation (TMC) area, a major urban center of the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR), India. The maximum peak hour ridership obtained on the identified corridor was found to be ideal for recommending light-rail transit system (LRT).

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Objective: A <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey (WTS), {{conducted}} in 2007 at 94 % of clinics in Cape Town, measured length of patient <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> (WT) for services and provided recommendations to shorten <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> Whether subsequent implementation of these recommendations occurred was unknown, hence a {{study was conducted}} {{to assess the impact of}} the previous <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey recommendations on stimulating efforts to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> and whether <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> had reduced. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study design assessed the perceptions of 92 % of clinic managers in Cape Town, regarding the 2007 survey, while a before and after study design assessed changes in <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> between 2007 and 2011, using a random sample of 22 clinics. Results: The overall median <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> of all clinics in the sample decreased by 21 minutes in 2011 (95 % CI 11. 77 - 30. 23), a 28 % decrease from 2007. This reduction was manifest at individual clinic level as well, with 55 % of clinics reducing their median <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> by at least 15 minutes. No specific factors, including whether recommendations to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were implemented, were associated with decreases in <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> Implementation of recommendations to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> was 2. 67 times (95 % CI 1. 33 - 5. 40) more likely amongst those who received written recommendations and 2. 3 times) 95 % CI 1. 28 - 4. 19) more likely amongst managers with 5 or more years' experience. Conclusion: The decrease in <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> in primary care urban clinics subsequent to a <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey, demonstrates the utility of <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> surveys, although no specific factors associated with the decrease in <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> were identified...|$|R
30|$|In this {{cohort of}} Ontario women, over 75 % had <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> within current {{clinical}} practice guidelines from diagnosis to definitive surgery or final surgery to postoperative chemotherapy and about 50 % had acceptable <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> to postoperative radiotherapy without chemotherapy. Regardless of {{phase in the}} treatment pathway, <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> {{did not differ significantly}} by detection method. Factors associated with <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> differed by phase of the treatment pathway, except for <b>time</b> period where <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> were consistently significantly longer for women diagnosed in the latter period of study compared to earlier for all phases. Higher stage at diagnosis was significantly associated with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> to definitive surgery, but not with <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> to any post-surgical treatment. Higher income quintile was also significantly associated with longer <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> to surgery, and shorter times to radiotherapy. In addition, there were substantial regional differences in <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> during this period.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To assess <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> {{for three}} groups of {{orthopaedic}} patients in Sweden and to identify factors explaining variations in <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Also examined were factors associated with patients' perceptions that <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were too long. Design. Retrospective study. Setting and study participants. Patients from orthopaedic units at 10 Swedish hospitals participated in the study. A questionnaire was sent to 1336 surgical patients (517 hip replacement, 321 back surgery, and 498 arthroscopic knee surgery) 3 months after surgery. Information extracted from the hospitals' patient administrative systems was also used. Outcome measures. Length of <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> socio-economic variables, hospital type, health-related quality of life, and opinion about <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> The data were analysed mainly using regression analyses. Results. The overall response rate was 79 %. In all pre-operative stages, <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were longest in the hip replacement group. Socio-economic variables were not consistent determinants of variation in <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> except for working status in the back surgery group where. working patients had shorter <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> than non-working patients irrespective of phase of <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Admission to a county/district county hospital, compared with a university/regional hospital, was associated with shorter <b>time</b> on the <b>waiting</b> fist. Patients with better health-related quality of life had significantly longer <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for arthroscopic knee surgery by all <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> measures. The length of wait {{was a significant predictor}} of the patients' acceptance of <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Patients' influence over the date of surgery also appeared to affect their opinion about the <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Conclusions. Hospital-related factors are more important than patient characteristics as explanations of variations in <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for orthopaedic surgery.

40|$|Objectives: In Spain, {{official}} information on <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgery {{is based on}} the interval between the indication for surgery and its performance. We aimed to estimate total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgical procedures, including outpatient visits and diagnostic tests prior to surgery. In addition, we propose an alternative system to manage total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> that reduces variability and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> without increasing the use of health care resources. This system is illustrated by three surgical procedures: cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair. Methods: Using data from two Autonomous Communities, we adjusted, through simulation, a theoretical distribution of the total <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> assuming independence of the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> of each stage of the clinical procedure. We show an alternative system in which the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> for the second consultation is established according to the <b>time</b> previously <b>waited</b> for the first consultation. Results: Average total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair were 331, 355 and 137 days, respectively (official data are 83, 68 and 73 days, respectively). Using different negative correlations between <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for subsequent consultations would reduce maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> by between 2 % and 15 % and substantially reduce heterogeneity among patients, without generating higher resource use. Conclusion: Total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> are between two and five times higher than those officially published. The relationship between the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> at each stage of the medical procedure may be used to decrease variability and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prior {{research}} shows that clinical demand and supplier capacity significantly affect the throughput and the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> within an isolated unit. However, it is doubtful whether characteristics (i. e., demand, capacity, throughput, and <b>wait</b> <b>time)</b> of one unit would affect the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units on the patient flow process. Focusing on cardiac care, this paper aims to {{examine the impact of}} characteristics of the catheterization unit (CU) on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of cardiac surgery unit (SU). METHODS: This study integrates published data from several sources on characteristics of the CU and SU units in 11 hospitals in Ontario, Canada between 2005 and 2008. It proposes a two-layer <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> model (with each layer representing one unit) to examine the impact of CU's characteristics on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU and test the hypotheses using the Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modeling analysis tool. RESULTS: Results show that: (i) <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of CU has a direct positive impact on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU (β = 0. 330, p < 0. 01); (ii) capacity of CU has a direct positive impact on demand of SU (β = 0. 644, p < 0. 01); (iii) within each unit, there exist significant relationships among different characteristics (except for the effect of throughput on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in SU). CONCLUSION: Characteristics of CU have direct and indirect impacts on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU. Specifically, demand and <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of preceding unit are good predictors for <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units. This suggests that considering such cross-unit effects is necessary when alleviating <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in a health care system. Further, different patient risk profiles may affect <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in different ways (e. g., positive or negative effects) within SU. This implies that the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> management should carefully consider the relationship between priority triage and risk stratification, especially for cardiac surgery...|$|R
