5|$|Initially, <b>loitering</b> munitions {{were not}} {{referred}} to as such but rather as suicide UAVs or <b>loitering</b> missiles. Different sources point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli Delilah variants or the failed US AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow program are mentioned by some sources. Alternatively, the late 1980s IAI Harpy which was widely exported is considered by some as the first <b>loitering</b> munition system.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary mission}} of a <b>loitering</b> munition is {{reaching}} the suspected target area, target acquisition during a <b>loitering</b> phase, {{followed by a}} suicide strike, and the munition is optimized in this regard in terms of characteristics (e.g. very short engine life time, silence in strike phase, speed of strike dive, optimization toward <b>loitering</b> time instead of range/speed) and unit cost (appropriate for a one-off strike mission).|$|E
5|$|<b>Loitering</b> munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a <b>loitering</b> munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E

5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} <b>loiter</b> and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to <b>loiter</b> at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential <b>loiter</b> time even when the missile has some <b>loiter</b> capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|In {{military}} flights, such as {{aerial reconnaissance}} or ground-attack aircraft, the <b>loiter</b> phase is time the aircraft has over a target. Cruise {{is the time}} period the aircraft travels to the target and returns after the <b>loiter.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Loitering</b> weapons first {{emerged in}} the 1980s {{for use in the}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, <b>loitering</b> weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that fit in a backpack.|$|E

A documented use of <b>loitering</b> munitions was in 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes in which an IAI Harop was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.|$|E

40|$|General {{techniques}} for constructing vector fields for UAV guidance are provided that incorporate Lyapunov stability properties to produce simple, globally stable vector fields in 3 D. Use of these fields in circular <b>loiter</b> patterns is illustrated, along with simple switching algorithms for circular <b>loiter</b> vector fields to enable following of arbitrary way point paths or loops. Another variation is also developed, where a simple circular <b>loiter</b> is warped into other shapes, preserving global stability guarantees and accurate path tracking. An {{example of this}} technique is provided that produces a “racetrack ” <b>loiter</b> pattern, and three different variations in the warping technique are compared. Finally, tracking of the vector field is considered, using Lyapunov techniques to show global stability of heading and path position for several types of tracking control laws that are compatible with low cost UAV avionics.

5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 11 September 1867, police arrested two men found <b>loitering</b> in Oak Street, Shudehill, suspecting them of {{planning}} to rob a shop. Both were charged under the Vagrancy Act and held in custody.

By the next year, such complaints had dropped 96% from the pre-September 2016 figure. The tablets' use, as a whole, has increased 12%, with more unique users accessing maps, phone calls, and 3-1-1.|$|E
5000|$|In {{aeronautics}} and aviation, <b>loiter</b> is a {{phase of}} flight. The phase consists of cruising for {{a certain amount of}} time over a small region. The <b>loiter</b> phase occurs, for general aviation, generally at the end of the flight plan, normally when the plane is waiting for clearance to land.|$|R

5|$|<b>Loitering</b> munitions have proliferated into use by {{at least}} 14 countries, with several {{different}} types in use as of 2017. The rising proliferation {{and the ability to}} use some systems as lethal autonomous weapons coupled with ethical concerns over such use have led to research and discussion by International humanitarian law scholars and activists.|$|E
5|$|<b>Loitering</b> munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous <b>loitering</b> munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
5|$|Purpose built munitions {{are more}} {{elaborate}} in flight and control capabilities, warhead size and design, and on-board sensors for locating targets. Some <b>loitering</b> munitions use a human operator to locate targets whereas others, such as IAI Harop, can function autonomously searching and launching attacks without human intervention.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>loitering</b> munitions {{may return}} and be {{recovered}} {{by the operator}} if they are unused in an attack and have enough fuel; in particular this is characteristic of UAVs with a secondary suicide mission.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{scattered}} complaints {{in some communities}} that the LinkNYC towers themselves are a nuisance. These complaints mainly {{have to do with}} <b>loitering,</b> browser access, and kiosk volume, the latter two of which the city has resolved.

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's <b>loitering</b> time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E

50|$|For example, these {{aircraft}} {{often do}} not have the <b>loiter</b> time needed for these missions and require aerial refueling support, making their missions more expensive. Additionally, long <b>loiter</b> missions use up an airframe's service life faster than expected, requiring replacement. This may cause issues in the future as some aircraft, such as the A-10, are out of production and cannot be replaced.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and <b>loitering</b> capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with <b>loitering</b> in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E

On 29 occasions between 1 November and 24 April 2015, two Ospreys and a KC-130J aerial tanker assigned to this Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission spent 145 flight hours <b>loitering,</b> ready to perform rescue missions if required.
