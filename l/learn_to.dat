A phenomenographic researchapproach was used to reveal variation {{in relation to the}} act of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with students who had either completed,or were recently completing a university level introductory programming subject. Theanalysis process revealed five different ways in which students go about learning toprogram in introductory university level units. These are captured in categories ofdescription which capture the critical dimensions of what students learn as well ashow they go about learning. Students may go about <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program by: • Following – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as ‘getting through’ the unit. • Coding – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> code • Understanding and integrating – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> write a program through understanding and integrating concepts • Problem solving – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> {{do what it takes to}} solve a problem • Participating or enculturation – where <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> program is experienced as discovering what it means to become a programmer The mapping of the variation constitutes a framework within which one aspect of theteaching and learning of introductory programming, how students go about it, may beunderstood.

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome.

40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> rank is an {{increasingly}} important scientific field that comprises the use of machine learning for the ranking task. New <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> rank methods are generally evaluated on benchmark test collections. However, comparison of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> rank methods based on evaluation results is hindered {{by the absence of}} a standard set of evaluation benchmark collections. In this paper we propose a way <b>to</b> compare <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> rank methods based on a sparse set of evaluation results on a set of benchmark datasets. Our comparison methodology consists of two components: (1) Normalized Winning Number, which gives insight in the ranking accuracy of the <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> rank method, and (2) Ideal Winning Number, which gives insight in the degree of certainty concerning its ranking accuracy. Evaluation results of 87 <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> rank methods on 20 well-known benchmark datasets are collected through a structured literature search.
