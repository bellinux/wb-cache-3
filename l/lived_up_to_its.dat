The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles.

In 1905 the MacBrayne {{steamship}} Clydesdale hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind. The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives. The trawler MFV Solway Firth foundered south of this position in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E

25|$|This article {{details the}} history of Moncton, a city in the Canadian {{province}} of New Brunswick. Moncton's motto is Resurgo, which is Latin for I rise again. This motto was originally chosen in celebration of the city's rebirth in 1875 after {{the recovery of the}} economy from the collapse of the shipbuilding industry. The city again <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> motto in more recent times, when the economy of the city was devastated once more during the 1980s {{as a result of the}} city's largest employers (the CN repair shops, the Eaton's catalogue division, and CFB Moncton) all departing the city in short order. The city has since rebounded due to growth in the light manufacturing, technology, distribution, tourism, and retail sectors of the economy and is now the fastest growing city in Canada east of Toronto.|$|E

25|$|India {{finished}} off their engagements in Group A with an 82 run victory over England at Durban and a 6 wicket victory over Pakistan at Centurion. Paceman Ashish Nehra achieved 6/23 against England to help India defend 250 as England were all out for 168. The Indian batting was bolstered by half-centuries from Dravid (62 from 72 balls, 3 fours and 1 six) and Tendulkar (50 from 52 balls, 8 fours and 1 six), and an attacking cameo from Yuvraj (42 from 38 balls, 4 fours and 1 six). The match against Pakistan, the most anticipated match of the tournament, <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> billing {{and was a}} thriller. It was (and still is) noted for being a match in which Tendulkar played one of his best-ever ODI innings. Chasing 274, Tendulkar (98 from 75 balls, 12 fours, 1 six) pulled off a near century, only to get out after suffering from cramps, to guide India to an unlikely victory, maintaining India's unbeaten record over Pakistan in World Cups. Tendulkar was once again awarded the Man of the Match. With 5 victories and 1 loss from 6 matches, India finished second in Group A and qualified for the Super Six stage.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on {{the surface}} the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> {{expectations}} as a futuristic centre of commerce {{at the heart of}} Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful it really is. Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that they were putting their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and so be responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. Ironically, the announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy {{in the face of a}} fast-changing worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.|$|E

[...] Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. [...] While the horse led {{for much of the}} race, he was hard-pressed throughout by Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario, altering the [...] "complexion" [...] of the race. [...] The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he [...] "knew he was in trouble" [...] by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was coming up on the outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> reputation.|$|E

[...] Fowler also noted, [...] "As a reader of the books with no more books to read, Season 6 {{has been a very}} interesting experience," [...] giving the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the scenes at Castle Black and in Vaes Dothrak, writing [...] "Game of Thrones <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> billing as A Song of Ice and Fire on Sunday, as there was plenty of action in both of the signature halves of the story."
