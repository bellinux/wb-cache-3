Each cargo hold can be fully loaded by a shiploader in a single step with a <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 13,500 tonnes per hour and can carry almost as much iron ore as a small Panamax carrier. In addition the space inside the cargo hold that cannot be reached by grabs during discharging, the so-called [...] "dead spots", is minimized. With a deadweight tonnage of 400,000 tons, a fully laden Valemax vessel is carrying as much iron ore as around 11,150 trucks, enough to produce steel for three Golden Gate bridges. The first 35 Valemax ships were said to be capable of carrying about 15% of the annual iron ore exports from Brazil to all destinations if each ship does four round trips per year.|$|E
2500|$|Post-Independence, the {{development}} of the port gained momentum. In 1959, a passenger station {{on the first floor of}} the transit shed at north quay was commissioned. In 1961, construction of signal station at north quay was completed. In the same year, the port's Jawahar Dock was inaugurated by the then prime minister of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri. In 1964, the Jawahar dock with capacity to berth 6 vessels to handle dry bulk cargoes such as coal, iron ore, fertiliser and non-hazardous liquid cargoes was created on the southern side changing the topography of the port. To handle vessels with as much as [...] draft, the port developed the outer harbour, named Bharathi Dock, for handling petroleum in 1972 and for mechanised handling of iron ore in 1974. In 1972, the first oil jetty was constructed at Bharathi Dock-I capable of handling tankers up to 100,000DWT to handle imports of crude oil destined for the Manali Oil Refinery (later named the Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited). In 1974, the iron ore berth was added to the port for exports to Japan and other countries in the Far East. The second oil jetty was added at Bharathi Dock-III in 1986 capable of handling tankers up to 140,000DWT to meet increasing demands for crude oil and petroleum products. The iron ore terminal is equipped with mechanised ore-handling plant commissioned in 1977 at Bharathi Dock-II capable of handling ore carriers of maximum size 1,45,000DWT, one of the three such facility in the country, with a capacity of handling 8 million tonnes and a <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 6,000 tonnes per hour. The port's share of iron ore export from India is 12 per cent. The dedicated facility for oil led to {{the development}} of oil refinery in the hinterland.

Wastewater requires sufficient contact time with the biofilm to allow for the adsorption, transformation, and reduction of contaminants. Hydraulic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> is an essential design parameter and equates to the volume and of wastewater that a vermifilter can reasonably treat in a given time. For a given system, higher hydraulic loading rates will cause hydraulic retention time to decrease and therefore reduce level of treatment. Hydraulic <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> may depend on parameters such as structure, effluent quality and bulk density of filter packing, along with method of effluent application. Common Hydraulic retention time values in vermifiltration systems range from 1 to 3 hours. Hydraulic loading rates commonly vary between 0.2 m3 m−2 day−1, 3.0 m3 m−2 day−1 [...] or 10-20 g L−1.

All ligaments were tested in the anatomical position corresponding to a fully extended knee. The rate dependence of the structural response of the knee ligaments was investigated by applying loading-unloading cycles at a range of distraction rates. Ramps to failure were applied at knee distraction rates of 0. 016 mm/s, 1. 6 mm/s, or 1, 600 mm/s. Averages and corridors were constructed for the force response and the failure point of the different ligaments and <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> The structural response of the knee ligaments was found to depend on the deformation rate, being both stiffer and more linear at high <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> This rate dependence was found to be more pronounced at high <b>loading</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
