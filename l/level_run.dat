50|$|Work {{began in}} 1835 on a tramway up the valley, but Austen and his steward William Pease {{realised}} {{that it was}} not going to meet their ambitions, so it was abandoned and only a few fragments of the route are visible today. Instead, they built a much larger-scale tramway, with the inclined plane from the canal basin, past the Carmears Rocks, {{to the level of the}} top of the valley, then a <b>level</b> <b>run</b> through Luxulyan and on to its terminus at the Bugle Inn near Mollinis. This required a high-level crossing of the river, for which they built the great viaduct, 650 feet (198 m) long and 100 feet (30 m) high, the most advanced engineering project in the western peninsula. It was built of stone from the Carbeans and Colcerrow quarries, and the lines from the quarries to the viaduct were the first parts of the tramway to be operational. The tramway was completed in 1844.|$|E

He began {{developing}} a tramway from Ponts Mill to Newquay in 1837, constructing tracks to Bugle, which included building a viaduct at Luxulyan, to carry both tramway and water to power his mines.

50|$|Hunt {{departed}} Ulithi 14 March for {{rendezvous with}} carrier FrankIin (CV-13) off the Ryukyu Islands 18 March. The next day Franklin maneuvered {{closer to the}} Japanese mainland than had any other U.S. carrier {{up to that point}} in the war to launch a fighter sweep against Honshū and later a strike against shipping in Kobe Harbor. Suddenly a single enemy plane broke through the cloud cover and made a low <b>level</b> <b>run</b> to drop two semi-armor-piercing bombs on the gallant ship. The carrier burned furiously as the flames triggered ammunition, bombs, and rockets. Hunt closed the stricken ship to assist in picking up survivors blown overboard by the explosions. After rescuing 429 survivors, she joined three other destroyers in a clockwise patrol arjound the stricken ship which had gone dead in the water within 50 miles of the Japanese Coast. Cruiser Pittsburgh (CA-72) took the ship in tow and, after an epic struggle, managed to get her to Ulithi 24 March. Hunt put the survivors ashore and sped to the Ryukyus 5 April to support troops who were struggling to take Okinawa.|$|E

50|$|RIMS is a {{centre of}} quality {{education}} and career making. Classes from Pre-Primary to Secondary <b>level</b> <b>run</b> in the school. It {{can be a}} ladder for the students in reaching the destination of their choices. It has a small canteen and a computer lab. The school has well managed library with various books to broaden the students' mind. Separate computer lab is managed for technical development. Students can join music, art, dance and yoga classes and sports training. There exists provision of scholarships for the students based on academic performance, skill, talent and other factors. The students have been categorized into four shrines i.e. Yellow, Blue, Green and Red and different extra curricular activities are conducted usually on every last Friday of the month according to the shrines. The name of the Yellow shrine is Lumbini, Green is Spiny Babbler, Blue is Mt. Everest and Red is Rhododendron. Students are selected as captain, vice-captain and prefects from each shrine to lead their respective shrines. The present (2073 BS) captain of the school is Bishal Khadka and the vice-captain is Anubhav Ghimire.|$|E
5000|$|Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Air Force, 8th Bombardment Squadron, 3rd Bombardment GroupPlace and date: Near Yangdok, Korea, September 14, 1951Entered service at: Baltimore, Maryland Born: January 7, 1920, Baltimore, MarylandCitation:Capt. Walmsley, {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and beyond the call of duty. While flying a B-26 aircraft on a night combat mission with the objective of developing new tactics, Capt. Walmsley sighted an enemy supply train which had been assigned top priority as a target of opportunity. He immediately attacked, producing a strike which disabled the train, and, when his ammunition was expended, radioed for friendly aircraft in the area to complete destruction of the target. Employing the searchlight mounted on his aircraft, he guided another B-26 aircraft to the target area, meanwhile constantly exposing himself to enemy fire. Directing an incoming B-26 pilot, he twice boldly aligned himself with the target, his searchlight illuminating the area, in a determined effort to give the attacking aircraft full visibility. As the friendly aircraft prepared for the attack, Capt. Walmsley descended into the valley in a low <b>level</b> <b>run</b> over the target with searchlight blazing, selflessly exposing himself to vicious enemy antiaircraft fire. In his determination to inflict maximum damage on the enemy, he refused to employ evasive tactics and valiantly pressed forward straight through an intense barrage, thus insuring complete destruction of the enemy's vitally needed war cargo. While he courageously pressed his attack Capt. Walmsley's plane was hit and crashed into the surrounding mountains, exploding upon impact. His heroic initiative and daring aggressiveness in completing this important mission in the face of overwhelming opposition and {{at the risk of}} his life, reflects the highest credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
