After filtering data to remove floor- or insufficiently large dot clusters, a registration technique with the model of the aircraft is used to estimate the static orientation of the robot. The robot moves and holds this orientation by considering its wheel odometry, its inertial unit and visual odometry.|$|E

30|$|This study {{obtained}} digital {{models of}} the crowns via <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> of poured up casts from the reset appointment. Previous reports {{have found that the}} accuracy of <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> of poured up casts are comparable with intra-oral scans [34 – 38]. However, the accuracy of the digital model obtained from the extra-oral <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> is dependent on an accurate impression and model pouring process. Therefore, to validate the accuracy of the extra-oral <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> used in this study, direct superimposition comparing both the pre-treatment and reset appointment CBCT scan crowns to the reset appointment <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> crowns was performed. Color displacement maps found minimal differences for both superimpositions.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Building Information Models (BIMs) {{have the}} {{potential}} to support various engineering applications (e. g., build-ing energy analysis, renovation and retrofit planning, and facility management) in the facility operation phase. It is im-portant to keep the information stored in as-is BIMs, accurate and up-to-date. Laser-scanning technology is able to cap-ture the as-is geometric condition of a facility in a timely manner. Hence, the <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> data can be used as the refer-ence to construct an as-is BIM. However, due to the occlusions caused by furniture, machinery, and building compo-nents, a single <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> might only capture a partial view of a facility, which limits the value of <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> data in the construction of as-is BIMs. Method In order to overcome this limitation, we propose to perform multiple <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> of a facility during the construction, renovation or retrofit processes, and fuse the <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> data captured at different times to create as-is BIMs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a formal approach to evaluate and compare the progressive <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> data, and identify the value of using progressive <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> data to create an accurate (i. e., the as-is BIM represents the actual as-is geometric condition of the facility) and complete (i. e., the as-is BIM contains all the compo-nents required to be modeled for the facility) as-is BIM. Results & Discussion We conducted a case study to present the process of creating an as-is BIM from progressive <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> data, and identified the tasks that could be automated. We selected a research lab that was recently renovated as the testbed. In the case study, we performed multiple <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> during the renovation process of the research lab to capture the geometric information of the lab at different phas...|$|R
40|$|The {{registration}} process of terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> (TLS) targets {{the problem of}} how to combine several <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> in order to attain better information about features than what could be obtained through single scan. The main goal of the {{registration process}} is to estimate the parameters which determine geometrical variation between the origins of datasets collected from different locations. Scale, shifts, and rotation parameters are usually used to describe such variation. This paper presents a framework for the registration of overlapping terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> by establishing an automatic matching strategy that uses 3 D linear features. More specifically, invariant separation characteristics between 3 D linear features extracted from <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> will be used to establish hypothesized conjugate linear features between the <b>laser</b> <b>scans.</b> These candidate matches are then used to geo-reference scans relative to a common reference frame. The registration workflow simulates the well-known RANndom Sample Consensus method (RANSAC) for determining the registration parameters, whereas the iterative closest projected point (ICPP) is utilized to determine the most probable solution of the transformation parameters from several solutions. The experimental results prove that the proposed methodology can be used for the automatic registration of terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> using linear features...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Navigated and {{robotized}} Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is advancing {{forward in}} research and treatment. MRI-scans or other medical image data are typically used as navigation source. Unfortunately, scanning time is always short and expensive. For many TMSapplications the underlying brain topology is not necessarily needed. Therefore, we generate the subject’s head contour for a precise stimulation from 3 D <b>laser</b> <b>scans.</b> We use the PowerCrust algorithm generating a smooth contour from laser surface points. The mean error found was 0. 289 with an RMS error of 0. 358 mm and a maximum error of 0. 984 mm comparing MRI-scan to <b>laser</b> <b>scan</b> for a head phantom. Currently, we are working successfully with head contours based on 3 D <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> for two ongoing TMS studies. During these TMS-experiments, the overall error found for the robotized TMS system using <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> was < 5 mm. With new and faster laser technologies, {{it will be possible}} to use <b>laser</b> <b>scans</b> as navigation source and for direct head tracking during stimulation when scanner become real time capable. ...|$|R

25|$|A. thaliana is {{well suited}} for light {{microscopy}} analysis. Young seedlings on the whole, and their roots in particular, are relatively translucent. This, together with their small size, facilitates live cell imaging using both fluorescence and confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscopy. By wet-mounting seedlings in water or in culture media, plants may be imaged uninvasively, obviating the need for fixation and sectioning and allowing time-lapse measurements. Fluorescent protein constructs can be introduced through transformation. The developmental stage of each cell can be inferred from its location in the plant or by using fluorescent protein markers, allowing detailed developmental analysis.|$|E

25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E

25|$|There are {{uncertainties}} {{with this}} approach using current microscopy techniques. If {{it is possible to}} replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method {{may not be able to}} access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.|$|E
25|$|Surveying is {{the process}} by which a {{surveyor}} measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface {{in the form of a}} map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.|$|E
