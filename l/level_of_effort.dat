25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> to expend, and whether to persist with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is seen {{to mediate}} {{important}} aspects of how an employee undertakes a given task, such as the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and persistence. An employee with high self-efficacy is confident that effort he or she puts forth has a high likelihood of resulting in success. In anticipation of success, an employee is willing to put forth more effort, persist longer, remain focused on the task, seek feedback and choose more effective task strategies.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, the {{contingent}} wages {{of workers in}} Period 2, in which layoffs do not occur (i.e., wages with γ (p)[*]=[*] 0), do not affect the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> workers in Period 1. This is because workers in Period 1 will necessarily receive the wages without being laid off, regardless <b>of</b> their current <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> Thus, when γ (p)[*]=[*] 0, only the current piece rate can affect the incentives of workers in Period 1. For example, if layoffs occur only in a recession, wages scheduled to be paid during a recession will affect the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> in Period 1, while wages scheduled to be paid during booms will not.|$|R

500|$|A related {{effect was}} {{measured}} by economist Jennifer Brown of the University of California who found that other golfers played worse when competing against Woods than {{when he was not}} in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> but that, when facing a [...] "superstar" [...] competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{consideration}} of {{the relative importance of}} sustainability-related objectives and the inherent nature of sustainable construction projects, this study proposes that the contractor can balance the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> and resources used to improve the overall project sustainability. A multi-objective trade-off model using game theory was established and verified through simulation and numerical example under a moral hazard situation. Results indicate that <b>effort</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the contractor on sustainability-related objectives are positively related to the outcome coefficient while negatively to the coefficients <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> cost <b>of</b> the relevant objectives. High <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the relative importance of sustainability-related objectives contribute to high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> the contractor. With the variation in effort levels and the coefficient of benefit allocation, the project net benefit increases before declining. The function of project benefit has a marked peak value, with an inverted “U” shape. An equilibrium always exists as for the given relative importance and coefficients <b>of</b> the <b>effort</b> costs <b>of</b> sustainability-related objectives. Under this condition, the owner may offer the contractor a less intense incentive and motivate the contractor reasonably arranging input resources. The coefficient of benefit allocation is affected by the contractor characteristic factors and the project characteristic factors. The owner should balance these two types of factors and select the most appropriate incentive mechanism to improve the project benefit. Meanwhile, the contractor can balance the relative importance of the objectives and arrange the appropriate <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and resources to achieve a sustainability-related objective. Very few studies have emphasized the effects of the relative importance of sustainability-related objectives on the benefits of sustainable construction projects. This study therefore builds a multi-objective trade-off model to bridge this research gap. This study sheds significant theoretical and practical insights regarding the objective management of sustainability-related objectives, as well as insights into the improvement of performance in sustainable construction projects...|$|R

The aircraft is relatively difficult to stall outside of substantial mishandling or deliberate intention.
