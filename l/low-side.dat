25|$|The {{frequency}} of the local oscillator fLO is set so the desired reception radio frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the local oscillator frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF±fLO. If the local oscillator frequency {{is less than the}} desired reception frequency, it is called <b>low-side</b> injection (fIF = fRF − fLO); if the local oscillator is higher, then it is called high-side injection (fIF = fLO − fRF).|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that there}} are two choices for : 43000Hz and 47000Hz, called [...] <b>low-side</b> and {{high-side}} injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000Hz will be distributed around 2000Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One reason for that is when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the SSB signal is actually a lower sideband, instead of an upper sideband. But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000Hz) should be used.|$|E

5000|$|Motorcycle Stability Control (MSC) is a {{motorcycle}} electronic brake control system developed by Robert Bosch GmbH. It is a lean-sensitive {{variation of the}} traditional ABS system Anti-lock braking system. The MSC system uses accelerometers and/or gyroscopic sensors to evaluate how close to the limit of adhesion the motorcycle is cornering. It reduces the allowable braking tire slip ratio, reducing the braking force, thus preventing the tire skid, and keeping the motorcycle from falling into the turn, or <b>low-siding.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fred's {{earliest}} {{fishing boat}} design was an 18-footer built {{to meet the}} needs of local fishing guides. It was designed with <b>low-sides</b> and a high bow to fight the choppy waves. [...] At that time, the only boats available to local angles and guides were flat bottomed with high sides so they were not well equipped for the Gulf Coast chop. The Farley boat, on the other hand, was designed to fish the local waters and could handle the choppy water.|$|R

50|$|He {{began his}} 2016 season well, leading at Losail for 6 laps before <b>low-siding,</b> {{allowing}} his team-mate to overtake. The following Grand Prix in Argentina saw Iannone in 3rd before attempting a last lap overtake of his team-mate Dovizioso, resulting in both riders falling. Iannone was penalised by Race Direction with a penalty point and three places on his following starting grid placement. Despite these punishments Iannone finished his first {{race of the}} season on the podium with a 3rd place behind Marc Márquez and Jorge Lorenzo, ending his season-spanning four race long run of race retirements. He raced aggressively at Catalunya, and eliminated Lorenzo from 5th place, effectively giving Marquez the championship lead.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{essential}} to remember that, for N-MOSFETs, the high-side switch must be driven to a higher voltage than Vi. To achieve this, MOSFET gate drivers typically feed the MOSFET output voltage back into the gate driver. The gate driver then adds its own supply voltage to the MOSFET output voltage when driving the high-side MOSFETs to achieve a Vgs equal to the gate driver supply voltage. [...] Because the <b>low-side</b> Vgs is the gate driver supply voltage, this results in very similar Vgs values for high-side and <b>low-side</b> MOSFETs.|$|E
5000|$|The device can be {{configured}} {{to regulate}} the current to a load, rather than the voltage, by replacing the <b>low-side</b> resistor of the divider with the load itself.

5000|$|When a MOSFET is {{used for}} the lower switch, {{additional}} losses may occur during the time between the turn-off of the high-side switch and the turn-on of the <b>low-side</b> switch, when the body diode of the <b>low-side</b> MOSFET conducts the output current. This time, known as the non-overlap time, prevents [...] "shootthrough", a condition in which both switches are simultaneously turned on. The onset of shootthrough generates severe power loss and heat. Proper selection of non-overlap time must balance the risk of shootthrough with the increased power loss caused by conduction of the body diode. Many MOSFET based buck converters also include a diode to aid the lower MOSFET body diode with conduction during the non-overlap time. When a diode is used exclusively for the lower switch, diode forward turn-on time can reduce efficiency and lead to voltage overshoot.|$|E
50|$|A further {{variation}} is the half-controlled bridge, where the <b>low-side</b> switching device {{on one side}} of the bridge, and the high-side switching device on the opposite side of the bridge, are each replaced with diodes. This eliminates the shoot-through failure mode, and is commonly used to drive variable or switched reluctance machines and actuators where bi-directional current flow is not required.|$|E
50|$|A {{complete}} {{design for}} a buck converter includes a tradeoff analysis of the various power losses. Designers balance these losses according to the expected uses of the finished design. A converter {{expected to have a}} low switching frequency does not require switches with low gate transition losses; a converter operating at a high duty cycle requires a <b>low-side</b> switch with low conduction losses.|$|E
50|$|In 1878 {{the church}} was largely rebuilt to designs by the architects H.J. Tollit and Edwin Dolby. They re-used the Norman north doorway, 13th-century south doorway, 14th-century piscina, sedilia and chancel arch {{responds}} and a <b>low-side</b> window in the chancel. There had been a wooden west tower but Tollit and Dolby replaced this with a stone bellcote. They also added a vestry {{on the north side}} of the church.|$|E
50|$|The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has {{developed}} its own unidirectional network called the Network Pump. This {{is in many}} ways similar to DSTO's work, except that it allows a limited backchannel going from the high side to the low side for the transmission of acknowledgments. This technology allows more protocols to be used over the network, but introduces a potential covert channel if both the high- and <b>low-side</b> are compromised through artificially delaying the timing of the acknowledgment.|$|E

There are two choices for the local oscillator frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF ± fLO.

5000|$|In air {{conditioning}} and refrigeration, inHg {{is often used to}} describe [...] "inches of mercury vacuum", or pressures below ambient atmospheric pressure, for recovery of refrigerants from {{air conditioning}} and refrigeration systems, as well as for leak testing of systems while under a vacuum, and for dehydration of refrigeration systems. The <b>low-side</b> gauge in a refrigeration gauge manifold indicates pressures below ambient in [...] "inches of mercury vacuum" [...] (inHg), down to a 30 inHg vacuum.|$|E
50|$|For a {{radio signal}} like SSB with wider {{bandwidth}} than Morse code, <b>low-side</b> injection preserves the relative {{order of the}} frequency components. High-side injection reverses their order, which is often desirable to counteract a previous reversal in the radio receiver. For radio amateurs it is conventional practice to use lower sideband below 10 MHz and upper sideband above 10 MHz, however the 60 metre band is different, using upper sideband. Amateurs have the band as secondary users and that practice retains compatibility with the primary users.|$|E
50|$|Until the English Reformation {{the church}} was {{dedicated}} to Saint Nicholas. The oldest parts are the nave and three-bay south aisle, which may be early 13th-century. The south aisle includes a tomb recess with a Purbeck Marble slab and foliated cross. The arcade of the north aisle is of a different style that suggests a later date, possibly late 13th-century. Authorities agree that the chancel is 14th-century. It has an ornately cusped, ogeed and crocketted piscina and three-bay sedilia, plus a <b>low-side</b> window on each side.|$|E
50|$|The 13th-century chancel has a two-light east {{window of}} c. 1350, and {{just north of}} it is a foliated corbel-capital, of c. 1230. The north wall has a 14th-century square-headed two-light window. In the south wall is a similar window, a 13th-century doorway with {{bracketed}} lintel, a square-headed <b>low-side</b> window, a 13th-century piscina with trefoiled head, and a plain square recess. The arch is of early 16th-century date, of two orders, the inner carried on engaged shafts with moulded capitals and bases. The roof appears to be of late 15th-century date. The altar table is of mid-17th century, with turned legs.|$|E
50|$|The chancel has {{a modern}} east window of three lights. There is a re-set piscina {{on the south}} side of the window and in the north wall are two lockers, one over the other. The eastern window {{on the south side}} is of the 15th century, of two cinquefoiled lights under a quatrefoiled {{spandrel}} in a four-centred head. The western window on this side and that opposite to it are of the date of the rebuilding of about 1400. They are each of one cinquefoiled light which has been carried down below a transom to form a <b>low-side</b> window. In both cases the <b>low-side</b> window retains its shutter, but on the north side this has been plastered internally. The window on the north side has some glass contemporary with the rebuilding of about 1400 which consists of quarries and a border of crowns. Between the windows on the south side is a 15th-century doorway with a four-centred head. The chancel arch belongs to the early 12th-century church. It is semi-circular, of two bold moulded orders springing from half-round shafts with richly carved capitals and moulded bases. The 15th-century rood screen is of five bays. The open panels above have trefoiled ogee heads and the close panels below have cinquefoiled heads with carved foliated spandrels. The screen was formerly in a dilapidated condition and was repaired by the Rev. A. R. Pain with his own hands, after he was appointed to the living in 1845.|$|E
50|$|The chancel is lit only by its east window, {{which is}} of two pointed lights with a round reararch and {{probably}} dates from the 13th century, though its head was altered at a much later period. Near {{the west end of}} the north wall is a <b>low-side</b> window of one square-headed light, now blocked, and on the south, opening to the chapel, is a pointed arch supported by semi-octagonal responds with moulded capitals and bases. This arch is pierced in the north wall of the chapel, which, in order that it might directly abut the nave arcade, was built against but independently of the chancel wall, {{the western part of the}} latter being then entirely removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{is similar}} enough that a voltage divider {{can be used}} {{in the same way as}} with the LM317 and the output follows the same formula, using the regulator's fixed voltage for Vref (e.g. 5 V for 7805). However, the 78xx device's quiescent current is substantially higher and less stable. Because of this, the error term in the formula cannot be ignored and the value of the <b>low-side</b> resistor becomes more critical. More stable adjustments can be made by providing a reference voltage that is less sensitive than a resistive divider to current fluctuations, such as a diode drop or a voltage buffer. The LM317 is designed to compensate for these fluctuations internally, making such measures unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that there}} are two choices for : 43000 Hz and 47000 Hz, called <b>low-side</b> and {{high-side}} injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000 Hz will be distributed around 2000 Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One reason for that is when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the SSB signal is actually a lower sideband, instead of an upper sideband. But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000 Hz) should be used.|$|E
50|$|The chancel, c. 1150, has {{a modern}} east window with {{internal}} splays of the 15th century. The north wall has an original window, a blocked square-headed two-light window, a blocked door perhaps opening into a former vestry, a blocked squint, {{and a large}} blocked locker. The south wall has an original window, two 15th-century two-light windows, one with a square head and one with a four-centred arch and a transom forming a <b>low-side</b> window, and a 15th-century piscina. The arch, of c. 1100, has two plain orders resting on simple imposts; it is much depressed, and under it is a 15th-century oak screen. The roof, dated 1642, is of low pitch. There is an ancient gable cross, but the parapets have been rebuilt partly with brick, and have lost the fillings of their merlons.|$|E
50|$|Rapid {{subglacial}} erosion produced overdeepenings, {{which have}} the glacier bed rising {{in the direction of}} the ice flow, may form in cirques near glacier heads. The concave amphitheatre shape is open on the downhill side corresponding to the flatter area of the stage, while the cupped seating section is generally steep cliff-like slopes down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge from the three or more higher sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl shaped as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and their accompanying rock burdens, hence experiences somewhat greater erosion forces, and is most often scooped out somewhat below the level of cirque's <b>low-side</b> outlet (stage) and its down slope (backstage) valley. A tarn will form in the overdeepened region once the glacier has melted.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{considered}} proven that the Black Forest was heavily glaciated {{during the peak}} periods of at least the Riss and [...] glaciations. (up to about 10,000 years ago).

Apart from that, it is only discernible from a large number of cirques mainly facing northeast. Especially in this direction snow accumulated on the shaded and leeward slopes of the summit plateau to form short cirque glaciers that made the sides of these funnel-shaped depressions.

50|$|The 14th-century chancel has a four-light east {{window with}} {{original}} jambs, but a late-15th-century depressed four-centred head; {{on the north}} side of it a 13th-century capital (now mutilated) has been built in as a bracket. The north wall has two original three-light windows with intersecting tracery in a two-centred head; a late-15th-century three-light window with a depressed four-centred head; and a 13th-century locker with trefoiled head and stone shelf. The south wall has three windows similar to those on the north; a small late-15th-century doorway; a blocked original doorway, only visible inside; a blocked <b>low-side</b> window; a reset 13th-century double piscina having one whole and two half semicircular intersecting arches with interpenetrating mouldings, carried on a central shaft and two detached jamb-shafts with moulded capitals and bases. The 13th-century chancel arch is two-centred, of two chamfered orders, the lower order resting on triple attached corbel-shafts with moulded capitals and modern corbels. The roof is modern, but the moulded principals of 1626 remain. The weathering of the earlier roof remains above the chancel arch.|$|E
5000|$|In {{refrigeration}} and {{air conditioning}} systems, the suction pressure (also called the <b>low-side</b> pressure) is the intake pressure generated by the system compressor while operating. The suction pressure, along with the suction temperature and the wet bulb temperature of the discharge air are {{used to determine the}} correct refrigerant charge in a system.If some solute is dissolved in water its diffusion pressure decreases. The difference between diffusion pressure of pure water and solution is called diffusion pressure deficit (DPD). [...] When a plant cell is placed in hypotonic solution, water enters into a cell by osmosis and as a result turger pressure develops. The cell membrane get stretched and osmotic pressure of cell decreases. As cell absorbs more and more water its Total Pressure increases and Osmotic Pressure decreases. When a cell is fully turgid, its OP is equal to TP and DPD is zero. Turgid cells cannot absorb any more water. Thus, with reference to plant cell, the DPD can be described as actual thirst of cell for water and can be expressed as DPD=OP-TP.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} simulation, the empirically {{observed}} general <b>low-side</b> limit of ~ 0.5 ST for intervals between adjacent SOAEs (Braun 1997) was simulated as follows. First, the smallest interval {{in the real}} ear was determined, e.g., 0.67 ST in the right ear of subject BD. Second, from this value a <b>low-side</b> limit for the simulated intervals of this ear was derived by using the nearest <b>low-side</b> multiple of 0.10 ST, such as 0.50 ST, 0.60 ST, 0.70 ST, etc., as the exclusion criterion. Thus for this ear the <b>low-side</b> limit was 0.60 ST, leading to a rejection of intervals < 0.61 ST. Third, after random generation, the higher SOAE frequency of all pairs whose interval fell into the rejection zone, i.e. was too small, was deleted and replaced by a new random-generated SOAE frequency. Fourth, the replacement procedure was repeated until the <b>low-side</b> criterion was satisfied for all intervals of this ear, e.g., no interval was < 0.61 ST.|$|E
