5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line</b> or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E

Some of these additional elements are derived from an Old French lai of Graelent, itself borrowing from Marie's Lanval.|$|E

25|$|Although Warner had {{intended}} to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, {{they were unable to}} do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line</b> {{in order to get a}} more pitch-perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, where you can often hear a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} {{localized}} by Aksys Games; Chunsoft {{was first introduced}} to Aksys through Spike, when Chunsoft {{was looking for a}} company that could publish the first game in the United States. During Aksys' evaluation period of it, many people at the company did not believe in the game and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. Eventually, they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company. They worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting to make dialogue sound like what a native speaker would say rather than strictly adhering to the Japanese wording. Ben Bateman, the editor of the first two games' localizations, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, examining it <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line</b> or scene by scene, rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same idea in English. Most parts of the games that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese versions, but a different one; Bateman did try to make similar types of jokes with similar contents and ideas. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add to the writing, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Ah, how fleeting, ah how insignificant), is a chorale fantasia. The {{instruments}} play concertante music, {{to which}} the soprano sings the cantus firmus <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line.</b> The lower voices act as a [...] "self-contained group", mostly in homophony, and [...] "declaim the individual lines of text in unison {{at the end of}} each choral passage, using a melodic formula derived from the beginning of the hymn." [...] Bach illustrates the imagery of the text, [...] "fleetingness and insubstantiality" [...] in motifs such as [...] "abrupt chords separated by pauses and... hurrying scale figures". Gardiner comments: [...] The Musicologist Julian Mincham compares the instrumental music to [...] "mist and fog, images which imply movements of wind and air" [...] and hears the lower voices as [...] "evincing a feeling of primeval power and solidarity".|$|E

500|$|To {{demonstrate}} his feelings on the subject, Erskine asked {{the jury to}} consider him a fellow defendant, since he intended to publish the pamphlet himself as soon as possible; he then went through the Dialogue <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line,</b> showing that not only would most people agree with it, {{but that it was}} the foundation of Pitt's Reform Bill. After Erskine concluded his arguments, again stating that the jury should feel free to debate whether the material constituted libel, Mr Justice Buller began his summing up, instructing the jury that they were only allowed to decide on whether Shipley had published the work. The jury retired, and after half an hour of discussion returned to declare Shipley [...] "guilty of publishing only". After a long and [...] "confounding" [...] debate between Erskine, Buller, and the jury, Buller declared Shipley guilty on all counts.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{appeared}} at the Magistrates Court in Eastbourne for an initial hearing. He was not represented by either a solicitor or a barrister, and pleaded not guilty. On his way {{to and from the}} court Williams's head was again covered with an apron to prevent him from being photographed; the press accordingly dubbed him [...] "the hooded man." [...] The police decided that Seymour should take the witness stand as soon as possible to avoid her going back on what she had told the police. As such she was called to the witness box by Cecil Whiteley (who was Treasury Counsel at the time) to go through her statement <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line.</b> She was physically exhausted and fainted four times in the witness box; this and other interruptions meant that the initial hearing took four days. Eventually the case was referred to the Assizes for trial.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{movement}} is a duet of soprano and tenor, [...] "" [...] (Compassionate heart of eternal love). It is {{in two ways}} connected to the chorale which closes the work. The melody is played <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line</b> as a [...] by the oboe, embellished and in a dancing 6/4 time instead of 4/4. The first interval in the voices and the continuo {{is the same as}} in the chorale. The countersubject is the inversion of the theme, in German [...] "" [...] (reflection in a mirror). iIt reflects the theme as human mercy should reflect divine mercy. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, comments in his diary of the project: [...] "Cast as a siciliano for soprano and tenor with cello continuo, there is a warm glow to this opening duet, with trills on each of the main beats to signify the flickering flame of love, and a plea to 'come melt my heart'. Agricola's chorale tune [...] is meanwhile intoned by a clarino hovering above the two amorous vocal lines.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills. While in the studio, {{the three men}} were just [...] "fooling around" [...] and [...] "freestyling". When Danja began playing a guitar riff, it caught Timberlake's attention. Timberlake started humming to the melody, and then the lyrics came. Timbaland, who was at his keyboards beside Danja, added drums to the melody. Danja commented that [...] "everything was coming together at the same time". After {{coming up with the}} music, Timberlake never wrote down the lyrics and, in an hour, he was ready to record it. By the time Timberlake was in the vocal booth, the basic track was done, then Timbaland produced a prelude of the song. Timberlake sang the song in a couple of takes and went back <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line</b> to fill up the gaps. During the recording sessions, Timbaland and Danja added everything else, including the basses and strings. Danja compared the process to scoring to a movie, thinking the song was like a horror flick.|$|E
500|$|Star Treks creator, Gene Roddenberry, who wielded {{significant}} influence despite his ill health, hated the script. Meyer's {{first meeting with}} Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming {{out of the room}} within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous Star Trek film (The Wrath of Khan), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought {{there was no evidence that}} bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century. When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of Saavik, Meyer replied that [...] "I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't like what I plan on doing with her, maybe he should give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say." [...] After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line,</b> and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns. By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.|$|E
500|$|Upon publication, [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] and {{the other}} poems in Poe's {{collection}} drew harsh criticism because of {{how difficult it was}} to understand. Among the early reviewers was John Hill Hewitt, who wrote of Poe that [...] "no man has been more shamefully overestimated". In trying to explain the title poem, he wrote, [...] "all our brain-cudgeling could not compel us to understand it <b>line</b> <b>by</b> <b>line</b> or the sum total". A reviewer for the Baltimore Minerva and Emerald asked, [...] "Has the poet been struck dumb with palsy?" [...] Before publication, Poe had sought the advice of William Wirt, who had earned a reputation as a distinguished man of letters in Baltimore. On [...] "Al Aaraaf", Wirt wrote that he was not the best judge of poetry but believed that it might be accepted by modern-thinking readers. As he wrote, [...] "but to deal candidly... (as I am bound to do) I should doubt whether the poem will take with old-fashioned readers like myself". Sarah Josepha Hale of Godey's Lady's Book noted that [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] must have been written by a young author because it was [...] "boyish, feeble, and altogether deficient in the common characteristics of poetry". Nevertheless, she still called the author a genius. A reviewer for the American Ladies' Magazine also commented on the poet's age: [...] " [...] author who appears to be very young, is evidently a fine genius, but he wants judgment, experience, tact".|$|E
