40|$|After having {{explored}} the articles by Orley Ashenfelter and George Johnson, and Martin Paldam and Peter Pederson, {{it was discovered}} that there existed a strong relationship between strike activity and economic performance, But, how and to what extent that relationship existed was unknown., The original belief was that there existed a positive relationship between economic performance and strike activity. That was sufficient from a philosophical point of view, to allow for a more comprehensive study of the relationship. It was quickly learned that it would be an impossible task, given all the econometric limitations, to prove that this relationship existed. However, it was soon discovered that strikes result, in principle, from a breakdown in the collective bargaining process, an impass at the negotiation stage. Since it was also known, that both sides prepare vast amounts of information during the pre-negotiation stage, it was assumed that when labour and management, or labour, management and government, as the case may be, enter into the collective bargaining process they utilize accumulated economic information as a basis for offers and counter-offers. Given the nature of these negotiations, particularly, in Canada, there would eventually be an impasse, and a resulting strike or lockout. Therefore, it was concluded that the economic variables utilized in the pre-negotiation stage of the collective bargaining process would be related, in some way, to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict.</b> Thus, the development of this study was initiated. The study would explore the relationship between economic performance and strike activity through the use of an econometric model, as well as an analysis of the historical development of industrial relations institutions in each of the eight countries that will be analysed in this study I Australia, Austria, Canada, Japan, Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. Later in the study, an entire chapter will be devoted strictly to Canada...|$|E
40|$|Some {{myths of}} Icelandic society are {{examined}} and empirically tested in this thesis. The myths are variants of two basic themes: firstly, {{the idea that}} the Icelandic social structure is funda- mentally unique, and, secondly, the belief that the contemporary society is exceptionally egalitarian in many respects. The uniqueness theme is reflected upon by maintaining an international comparative perspective throughout the presentation, and by examining the characteristics and degree of modernization in Icelandic society. In relation to the equality theme, some important aspects of socio-economic advantages are examined. Opportunities of individuals and class formation are also assessed, and then the analysis moves to the level of organizations and labour market relations, i. e., to unionism, conflict, and inflation. The findings seriously question or discard the themes which are considered. Thus, we show that Iceland has modernized to a very high level, sharing most of the basic social structural features which have been found to produce a "family resemblance" amongst advanced societies. Iceland is also found to have an inequality structure with familiar characteristics. The degree of income inequality seems to be on level with the Scandinavian societies, but when other related advantages are also considered, such as welfare and security aspects, the net outcome is that inequality appears to be greater in Iceland. Upward mobility has been extensive, mainly due to changes in the occupational structure, but the patterns are fairly typical. The structure of the industrial relations system has signifi- cant affinities with comparable Scandinavian systems, but the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> has been extensive in Iceland. Inflation has similarly prevailed at a very high level for a long period. By relating inflation to distributional conflicts and the inequality structure, we offer a novel interpretation of this outstanding characteristic. Lastly, the relatively poor showing in the welfare league arid the intense distributional conflicts are explained by relating them to the distribution of political power in the society. Unlike the Scandinavian societies, Iceland has not been dominated by a large social-democratic party. The conservative Independence Party is the largest political party in the country and it has been the dominant force in governments for most of the post-war period. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of employees captured by centralised wage-negotiations. It is empirically shown that centralised institutions are correlated with compressed wages, {{which in turn}} accumulates several types of conflicts. A centralised unions’ association face similar conflicts of interest as within a plant union. The employees of different skills and crafts have distinct demands towards the employer, representing their importance for the final product. Within this bargaining, no person or group can raise specific demands without creating some sort of externality onto the other employees. Compressed wages lead to higher wages for the least productive employees and lower wages for the most productive employees. This in turn makes the employers demanding the latter better off, as the wage bill becomes lower with compressed wages. With centralisation a potential conflict arises within the employers’ confederation; between the skilled labour employers and the low-skilled labour employers, demanding the distribution of productivity among the labour. By letting the wages in a society be based on norms, I implement the described conflicts into a game-theoretic approach, similar to the Battle of the Sexes. In a game between a more than average productive employee and an employer demanding this specific labour, both players need to coordinate on a wage-contract. As the employee receives a lower wage with a centralised wage-contract, the employee would prefer if they coordinated on a decentralised contract. However, the employer has opposite preferences. He/she has a lower wage-bill in the centralised case and prefers on coordinating on a centralised wage-contract. If they cannot coordinate, they receive nothing. One may argue that the productive employee carries an opportunity cost. This cost is similar to what he/she would have made in a decentralised system, with negligible compression of wages. The game is played many times. The probability of the other player playing a specific contract is based on information the players gather through previously played stage-games, games with other players, word-of-mouth or other sources of information. By using this information both players calculate their best response strategy. If all employers are expected to play the strategy of centralised wage-contract, the employee’s best response strategy becomes to coordinate. When the players are expected to coordinate on this specific contract, and the expectations become self-enforcing, the strategy becomes a convention. This suggests that the most productive employees voluntarily participate in the centralised wage-bargaining, due to their best-response strategy. If the opportunity-cost change, {{the expectations of the}} players change. This could be caused by movements in the economic environment, such as economic depression, booms, high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> etc. This may modify the players’ best responses and the system may flip towards a decentralised wage-contract bargaining. Considering individuals being able to make random behavioural mistakes, some players will play non-best-responses. This theory suggests that only a few players not able to coordinate on the expected strategy may switch expectations from one convention to the other. An increase in the opportunity cost associated will impose enhanced pressure on the “satisfied” groups. In the centralised system, this implies the high-technological employers and the least productive employees. The convention becomes more accessible and tolerates fewer non-best responses. These non-best responses can be either stochastic or intentional. When the model is stochastic, the convention flips by the satisfied players playing “wrong”. This may seem unlikely. When the satisfied groups are able to coordinate, the system can only change through intentional non-best responses by the most dissatisfied groups. Equipped with this theory and the historical background of the Nordic countries, this thesis provides an explanation of the implementation of the centralised system in these countries. Further, this thesis discusses forthcoming difficulties in sustaining these institutions. First is the role of migration. Because of free trade-agreements of services within Europe, migrants are faced with fewer problems of moving across the borders. This may alter the contextual best responses by either the most productive employees or the least productive employers. Second is a change of equality preferences within the unions’ association. When unions accelerate their sense of actuarial fairness the system may be altered through intentional collective actions. However, by using theory of collective action, I find that the centralised system may persist, rather than imposing a conventional flip of best-response play. This is because the preference shock may not lead to collective action, but rather alter the distribution of power among the unions participating in the unions’ association. It has been argued by labour economists that the Nordic or Scandinavian model has been evolutionary rather than coerced politically. This thesis adds weight to the argument using models of evolutionary change through game-theory...|$|E
40|$|In Australia {{there have}} been few {{empirical}} studies into the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> disputation and the role of trade unions in the clubs and gambling sector of the tourism and hospitality industry.

40|$|Allan Flanders {{was one of}} {{the leading}} British {{industrial}} relations academics and his ideas exerted a major influence on government labor policy in the 1960 s and 1970 s. But as well as being an Oxford academic with a strong interest in theory and labor reform, he was also a lifelong political activist. Originally trained in German revolutionary ethical socialism in the early 1930 s, he was the founder and joint editor of Socialist Commentary, the leading outlet for ‘revisionist’ social democratic thinking in Britain in the 1950 s and 1960 s. He was also the leading figure in the influential 1950 s ‘think tank’ Socialist Union and played a key part in the bitter factional struggles inside the Labour Party. The main argument of the book is that Flanders’ ethical socialist ideas constituted both his strength and his weakness. Their rigor, clarity and sweep enabled him to exert a major influence over government attempts to negotiate labor reforms with the trade unions. Yet he proved unable to explain the failure of the reforms amidst rising <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict,</b> as his intellectual rigor turned into ideological rigidity.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> intelligence of the remote factors responsible for conflicts {{and the nature of}} unorganized protests by individuals in the Nigerian banking sector. The dwindling government commitment to social services, anti-working class policies of the government, the nature of labour laws, failure to recognize good industrial relations practices, lack of trained personnel in Human resources management, relegation of the advice of trained personnel in industrial relations, the use of management prerogative as sword, threat to security of tenure, improper handling of intra-union disputes, physical environment of the work place, and separatist negotiation are some of the remote causes <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts.</b> There is a relationship between the remote causes <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> action and unorganized protests by individuals.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is broader than that of most others on <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> and {{encompasses}} individual and employer-initiated forms of conflict as well as stoppages. <b>Industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> is a complex concept and there is consequently a need for an explicit ordering of ideas. Our theoretical discussion in Part 1 is aimed at providing a general framework for later empirical analysis. It begins with a conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> which embraces many causes, settings, parties and forms. The more important of these forms are outlined before factors influencing the distribution <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> are surveyed. It ends with an investigation {{of the ways in which}} the economic effects of such conflict may be observed and to some extent measured. Three industries, meat freezing, building and construction, and waterfront, account for a disproportionate amount <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> in New Zealand and it is on these that the empirical analysis of this thesis centres. In order to understand the context of conflict in these industries, their economic, technical and organisational environments are outlined in Part 2. Part 3 contains the empirical investigation itself, beginning with the place of these three industries in the national perspective and then dealing with the industries in turn. In each case, both official statistics and material obtained by interviews and questionnaires are used to analyze conflict in detail and to evaluate possible factors shaping it. No simple conflict patterns are found. These industries are, for example, stoppage prone but all contain several units which are virtually stoppage free. But in each industry certain fundamental features are found to be influential in shaping the patterns. Of prime importance is the technology, although economic features, such as the nature of worker remuneration, ownership patterns and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> throughput, are also important. These conclusions are summarised in Part 4 where it is noted that, while the three industries have features predisposing them toward conflict, our understanding of and command over these features can be improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to find {{indicators}} of the substantive incentives for <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict.</b> We argue that collective decision-making models can be helpful in developing such a measurement tool. These indicators will enable scholars in industrial relations to distinguish the substantive incentives from other reasons for calling out strikes, e. g. union internal political incentives or trade union competition for members. The models we use are the expected utility model of Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and the exchange model of Frans Stokman and Reinier van Oosten. These models differ in their assumptions on how the collective bargaining process proceeds. The expected utility model is based on the assumption that actors reach collective decisions after threats and conflict. The exchange model is based on a cooperative strategy. Our indicators <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> are tested on a data set with information on 29 collective agreement negotiations in which 90 trade unions are nested. The data set contains instances <b>of</b> both <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> and peaceful settlements of collective agreements. The results show that the indicator based on the expected utility model is a good indicator <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict,</b> whereas that based on the exchange model is a poor one. This seems to contradict findings in previous applications of both models of collective bargaining, in which the exchange model provided the most accurate predictions of the bargaining outcomes. We conclude that although the exchange model provides better predictions at the aggregate level (the collective outcome), the expected utility model generates superior predictions of the individual positions after bargaining...|$|R

So far, no proposals for legislation specifically directed to this issue have been forthcoming. Some of the general changes in the law <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> from 1980 - 1990 have, however, had a particular significance for some workgroups who most probably fall within the essential services area. Of equal if not greater significance have been fundamental, radical changes in the organisation of and practices within these services, some of which have been transferred out of the public sector.
