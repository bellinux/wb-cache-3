5|$|Polo related {{his memoirs}} orally to Rustichello da Pisa while both were prisoners of the Genova Republic. Rustichello wrote Devisement du Monde in Langues d'Oil, a <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> of crusaders and western merchants in the Orient.

5|$|Chad's {{official}} {{languages are}} Arabic and French, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to {{the important role}} played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, Chadian Arabic has become a <b>lingua</b> <b>franca.</b> Chad submitted an application to join the Arab League as a member state on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>lingua</b> <b>francas</b> {{has existed}} since antiquity. Latin and Koine Greek were the <b>lingua</b> <b>francas</b> of the Roman Empire and the Hellenistic culture.

Examples of <b>lingua</b> <b>francas</b> remain numerous and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is English, but there are many other <b>lingua</b> <b>francas,</b> including French, Hindi, Arabic, Mandarin and Swahili.|$|R

5|$|Jurisprudence {{was taught}} in Latin, {{even in the}} law schools of the East, but {{toward the end of}} the fourth and the {{beginning}} of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut, which was the long-established <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.

5|$|Through the {{worldwide}} {{influence of the}} British Empire, modern English spread around {{the world from the}} 17th to mid-20th centuries.

5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. Thanks {{in large part to the}} British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial <b>lingua</b> <b>franca.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{adults in}} the {{community}} are considered semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words. Their children, the grandchildren of the elders, understand very little Wagiman and speak none. Apart from Mayali, Kriol, a creole language based on the vocabulary of English, is the <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> of the area. All members of the Wagiman ethnic group, {{as well as all}} other ethnic groups represented in the area, are native speakers of a moderate grade of Kriol.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{distinct}} Angevin or Plantagenet {{culture that}} would distinguish or set {{them apart from}} their neighbours in this period. Robert of Torigni recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy, England, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine and Torraine. However this patronage had no distinctive style except {{in the use of}} circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type. Similarly amongst the multiple vernacularsFrench, English and Occitanthere was not a unifying literature. French was the <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> of the secular elite and Latin or the church.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} assumed that when multiple languages {{exist in a}} setting, there must therefore be multiple language barriers.

50|$|Colonial {{languages}} {{also play}} a pivotal cultural and political role, being adopted as the official languages of most countries in the region, as well as <b>linguae</b> <b>franca</b> in communication between the region's various ethnic groups.

5|$|Like the {{national}} language, {{the people of}} Sandakan mainly speak Malay, with a distinct Sabahan creole. The Malay language in Sandakan {{are different from the}} Malay language in the west coast which resembles Brunei Malay. In Sandakan, this language has been influenced by many words from the Suluk language. As Sandakan had also been dominated by the Hakka and Cantonese Chinese, Hakka and Cantonese widely spoken, while today Mandarin dominates as the <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> among both dialect subgroups. While for the east coast Bajau, their language has similarities with the Sama language in the Philippines and also borrowed many words from the Suluk language which is different from the west coast Bajau who had been influenced by the Malayic languages of Brunei Malay.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Roman Empire was in {{language}} and civilization a Greek society. Linguistically, Byzantine or medieval Greek is situated between the Hellenistic (Koine) and modern phases of the language. Since {{as early as the}} Hellenistic era, Greek had been the <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> of the educated elites of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken natively in the southern Balkans, the Greek islands, Asia Minor, and the ancient and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy, the Black Sea, Western Asia and North Africa. At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: κοινή) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Kota Kinabalu mainly speak Malay, with a {{distinct}} Sabahan creole. However, as almost 50% of Kota Kinabalu residents are of Chinese descent, Chinese is also widely spoken. Among the Chinese, the most commonly spoken varieties are Huiyang Hakka (Simplified Chinese: 惠阳客家话; Traditional Chinese: 惠陽客家話) and Mandarin. Additionally, most Chinese can speak Cantonese, although with widely varying levels of fluency. Almost all residents are also able to speak English, especially the younger generation. However, some {{find it difficult to}} speak fluently due to a limited vocabulary and the general lack of usage of the English language as a conversational <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> among Sabahans as a whole.|$|E

50|$|Trade {{languages}} are another age-old {{phenomenon in the}} Caribbean linguistic landscape. Cultural and linguistic innovations that spread along trade routes, and languages of peoples dominant in trade, developed into languages of wider communication (<b>linguae</b> <b>francae).</b> Of particular importance in this respect are French (in the central and east Caribbean) and Dutch (in {{the south and east}} Caribbean).|$|R
50|$|A person's second {{language}} or L2, is {{a language that}} is not the native language of the speaker, but that is used in the locale of that person.

Some languages, often called auxiliary languages, are used primarily as {{second language}}s or <b>lingua</b> <b>francas.</b>|$|R
