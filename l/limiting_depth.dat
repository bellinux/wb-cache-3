50|$|At first sight, the {{defining}} feature of a mere is its breadth {{in relation to}} its shallow depth. This means {{that it has a}} large surface in proportion to the volume of water it contains. However, there is a <b>limiting</b> <b>depth</b> beyond which a lake does not behave as a mere since the sun does not warm the deeper water and the wind does not mix it. Here, a thermocline develops but where the limiting dimensions lie is influenced by the sunniness and windiness of the site and the murkiness of the water. This last usually depends on how eutrophic (rich in plant nutrients) the water is. Nonetheless, in general, with the enlargement of the extent of a mere, the depth has to become proportionately less if it is to behave as a mere.|$|E

40|$|Dense {{bathymetry}} surveys {{obtained by}} LIDAR at 13 small to medium coastal inlets {{of the continental}} United States were analyzed to quantify limiting (maximum) bottom slopes of ebb shoals and entrance channels. The LIDAR data were supplemented with conventional bathymetry measurements from five large inlets to obtain predictive relationships for the limiting (minimum) depth over crest of the ebb shoal. The sites, all located on sandy coasts, were chosen to cover a range in tidal amplitude, tidal prism, and average annual wave height. Wave-dominated inlets exhibited steeper slopes on their seaward margins than tide-dominated inlets. Slopes on ebb shoals typically do not exceed 4 – 6 j, with seaward slopes being 1 – 2 j steeper than landward slopes. Dredged entrance channels have steeper slopes than natural channels, with maximum slopes immediately after dredging reaching 6 – 8 j. At one inlet having a series of LIDAR surveys, entrance channel maintenance dredging created 3 – 5 j side slopes that decreased 0. 5 – 1 j/year for the next 2 years to achieve a typical slope of 3 j along much of the channel. Greatest bottom slopes are found in scour holes near jetties (10 – 12 j) and at the entrance bars (8 – 10 j) of (tideless) Great Lakes harbors. <b>Limiting</b> <b>depth</b> over crest of the ebb shoals is predicted well by the parameter (HSP) 1 / 4, whereHS is the average annual significant wave height, and P is the spring tidal prism.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The work of the author {{was to investigate the}} static, dynamic and machining behaviour of some new designs of slug damped boring bars with a 10 to 1 overhang ratio. The bars were mounted on a centre lathe. The static behaviour of a boring bar in relation to the geometric form errors that might be produced during boring was studied both analytically and experimentally. Specifically, two types of errors were considered, namely, a) errors that arise on entry of the boring tool into the workpiece) known as the "bell-mouth" errors; and b) reproducibility of eccentricity errors, known as the "copying" errors. The theory for "bell-mouth" errors did not seem to fit the results well; however, the theory did prove that such errors could exist. The theory for “copying” errors agreed remarkably well with the results provided that the initial eccentricity was small compared with the depth of cut. The dynamical behaviour of the slug damped boring bar was modelled by a mathematical analogue. Despite its inability to properly account for the compressibility effect of the gaseous damping fluid, the model revealed the possibility of design improvements. In consequence, the optimally-tuned slug-damped tungsten-bunged bar was conceived, Manufactured and tested along with a solid bar for comparison purposes, a slug-damped recessed bar and a slug-damped steel-bunged bar. The machining behaviour of a boring bar was studied in terms of the maximum depth of cut that it could cope before the occurrence of chatter. At first, a stability model was developed based on the mathematical analogue formulated {{in the study of the}} dynamical behaviour. But since this analogue did not fit the results accurately, a second and more precise model was set up using the frequency response obtained from dynamic experiments instead. The concept of negative damping coefficient was used; and a one-to-one correspondence between the asymptotic value of the negative damping coefficient and the <b>limiting</b> <b>depth</b> of cut was found to exist. By virtue of this, it is in principle possible to predict the <b>limiting</b> <b>depth</b> of cut of any machine tool system whose frequency response characteristics are known. Compared with other bars tested, the optimally-tuned tungsten-bunged bar was found to have the best dynamic and machining characteristics as reflected in the <b>limiting</b> <b>depth</b> of cut of 0. 10511 (2. 67 mm) to 0. 110 " (2. 79 mm) at the feed of 0. 0065 "/rev (0. 165 mm/rev) and the speed of 500 rprn on a 3. 5 " dia. bore (140 m/min) of EN 8 steel.

40|$|Abstract We have {{analyzed}} the Bouguer anomaly (BA) of ~ 1200 complex craters in the lunar highlands from Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory observations. The BA of these craters is generally negative, though positive BA values are observed, particularly for smaller craters.

The Bouguer anomaly of craters larger than 93 þ 4719 km in diameter {{is independent of}} crater size, indicating {{that there is a}} <b>limiting</b> <b>depth</b> to impact-generated porosity, presumably from pore collapse associated with either overburden pressure or viscous flow.

40|$|Vibration {{absorbers}} {{have been}} widely used to suppress undesirable vibrations in machining operations, with a particular emphasis on avoiding chatter. However, {{it is well known that}} for vibration absorbers to function effectively their stiffness and damping must be accurately tuned based upon the natural frequency of the vibrating structure. For general vibration problems, suitable tuning strategies were developed by Den Hartog and Brock over 50 years ago. However, the special nature of the chatter stability problem means that this classical tuning methodology is no longer optimal. Consequently, vibration absorbers for chatter mitigation have generally been tuned using ad hoc methods, or numerical or graphical approaches. The present article introduces a new analytical solution to this problem, and demonstrates its performance using time domain milling simulations.
