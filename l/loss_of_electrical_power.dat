5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s aft harmonic filter room. This {{resulted in the}} shutdown of all four propulsion motors and a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> throughout the ship. Within an hour, the ship's main generators were restarted and {{it was able to}} resume passage. The later investigations finding revealed that an explosion was caused by electrical arcing within the aft harmonic filter igniting leaked dielectric fluid vapour.|$|E
25|$|Unit 1 was {{equipped}} with a different, entirely passive cooling system, the Isolation Condenser (IC). It consisted {{of a series of}} pipes run from the reactor core to the inside of a large tank of water. When the valves are opened, steam flows upward to the IC where the cool water in the tank condenses the steam back to water, and it runs under gravity back to the reactor core. For unknown reasons, Unit 1's IC was operated only intermittently during the emergency. However, during a 25 March 2014 presentation to the TVA, Dr Takeyuki Inagaki explained that the IC was being operated intermittently to maintain reactor vessel level and to prevent the core from cooling too quickly which can increase reactor power. Unfortunately, as the tsunami engulfed the station, the IC valves were closed and could not be reopened automatically due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power,</b> but could have been opened manually. On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that cooling systems for Units 1–4 were beyond repair.|$|E
25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the electrical signalling protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As {{a result of this}} standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Navy {{deployed}} {{some of its}} battlecruisers {{during the}} Norwegian Campaign in April 1940. The [...] and the [...] were engaged during the Action off Lofoten by Renown in very bad weather and disengaged after Gneisenau was damaged. One of Renowns 15-inch shells passed through Gneisenaus director-control tower without exploding, severing electrical and communication cables as it went and destroyed the rangefinders for the forward 150mm (5.9in) turrets. Main-battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> Another shell from Renown knocked out Gneisenaus aft turret. The British ship was struck twice by German shells that failed to inflict any significant damage. She was the only pre-war battlecruiser to survive the war.|$|E
500|$|Prien {{turned his}} {{submarine}} and attempted another shot via his stern tube, but this too missed. Reloading his bow tubes, he doubled back and fired a salvo of three torpedoes, all at Royal Oak, This {{time he was}} successful: at 01:16 all three struck the battleship in quick succession amidships and detonated. The explosions blew {{a hole in the}} armoured deck, destroying the Stokers', Boys' and Marines' messes and causing a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> Cordite from a magazine ignited and the ensuing fireball passed rapidly through the ship's internal spaces. Royal Oak quickly listed some 15°, sufficient to push the open starboard-side portholes below the waterline. She soon rolled further onto her side to 45°, hanging there for several minutes before disappearing beneath the surface at 01:29, 13 minutes after Prien's second strike. 833 men died with the ship, including Rear-Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the Second Battle Squadron. Over one hundred of the dead were Boy Seamen, not yet 18 years old, the largest ever such loss in a single Royal Navy action. [...] The admiral's wooden gig, moored alongside, was dragged down with Royal Oak.|$|E
2500|$|The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, {{primarily}} the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, {{and the associated}} evacuation zones affecting {{hundreds of thousands of}} residents. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen gas that had built up within their outer containment buildings after cooling system failure resulting from the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> Residents within a [...] radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a [...] radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} force generated by pressing the brake pedal is used {{only as a}} sensor input to the computer unless a catastrophic failure occurs including a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 12-volt <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> The brake actuator has an electric pump that provides the hydraulic pressure for the system, and valves to pressurize each wheel caliper to apply the friction brake when required by the system.|$|R

500|$|Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin faced several {{difficulties}} {{during the}} mission. These included {{the most severe}} fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a backup oxygen-generating device), failures of various on board systems, a near collision with a Progress resupply cargo ship during a long-distance manual docking system test and a total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> station <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> The power failure also caused a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> attitude control, which led to an uncontrolled [...] "tumble" [...] through space.|$|R
2500|$|A {{civilian}} passenger jet, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, {{was shot}} down over Hrabove on 17 July, killing all 298 people on board. DPR-affiliated insurgents blamed the Ukrainian government for the disaster, whereas the government blamed Russia and the insurgents. This disaster followed two similar incidents earlier in the week, when two Ukrainian Air Force planes were shot down. Meanwhile, fighting in Luhansk resulted in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> and water services across the city. Shelling damaged an electrical substation in the district Kamennobrodskiy, causing the power loss. An oil refinery in Lysychansk was also set alight. At least twenty civilians {{were killed in the}} shelling of Luhansk, according to a statement by the city administration. The statement said that a barrage of rockets hit [...] "virtually every district". The shelling forced OSCE monitors to flee from their office in Luhansk, and move to Starobilsk. Government forces went on to capture the south-eastern section of the city. Another sixteen people died overnight, and at least sixty were wounded. According to a government report, Luhansk airport was secured by government forces amidst the battle.|$|E
2500|$|On October 28, 2015, {{one of two}} JLENS aerostats {{being used}} to conduct a test over Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, became untethered. It was escorted by two fighter jets as it drifted at an {{altitude}} of approximately 16,000 feet towards Pennsylvania. About three hours later, it was reported by NORAD to be approaching the ground near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles north of Aberdeen. Its dragging [...] tether reportedly downed many power lines in the area, with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> to as many as 20,000 area residents. The Pennsylvania State Police reported less than an hour later that the aerostat was [...] "contained". It was found tangled in trees in Anthony Township, Pennsylvania. The Pentagon suspended trials of the system after the incident until the Army completed its investigation of how the aerostat broke free. The program was said to be [...] "hanging by a thread" [...] after the incident. By February 2016, the investigation had found that a malfunctioning pressure sensing device caused a loss of air pressure in the tail fins, leading to the loss of aerodynamic efficiency which, along with increased wind drag, exacerbated tension on the tether to the point of breakage. [...] Following the incident, the military initially decided that the JLENS should continue with its operational exercise because of the unique cruise-missile defense capability it provides, determining that changes and procedures will enable it to safely fly again.|$|E
50|$|The warning sirens in Panora {{failed to}} sound {{due to the}} nearly {{concurrent}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> and the sudden occurrence of the storm: {{only a couple of}} minutes between the release of the tornado warning during the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> before the impact of the tornado did not provide enough time for the town to bring online electrical power from Panora's backup desiel-powered generator. Luckily, no loss of life occurred.|$|E
25|$|The Olympus entered {{service as}} a peak demand {{industrial}} power generator in 1962 when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) commissioned a single prototype installation at its Hams Hall power station. Power was provided by an Olympus 201 exhausting through a two-stage turbine powering a Brush synchronous alternator providing 20 MW at 3000 rpm. By 1972, the CEGB had installed 42 Olympus generating sets. Olympus engines are also used to provide backup power in case <b>of</b> a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> grid <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> at some <b>of</b> Britain's nuclear power stations.|$|R
2500|$|A ram {{air turbine}} (RAT) is {{a special kind of}} small turbine that is fitted to some aircraft. When deployed, the RAT is spun by the {{airstream}} going past the aircraft and can provide power for the most essential systems if there is a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all on-board <b>electrical</b> <b>power,</b> {{as in the case of}} the [...] "Gimli Glider".|$|R
5000|$|While living {{aboard the}} space station, Linenger {{and his two}} Russian crewmembers faced {{numerous}} difficulties: the most severe fire ever aboard an orbiting spacecraft, failures of onboard systems (oxygen generator, carbon dioxide scrubbing, cooling line loop leaks, communication antenna tracking ability, urine collection and processing facility), a near collision with a resupply cargo ship during a manual docking system test, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> station <b>electrical</b> <b>power,</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> attitude control resulting in a slow, uncontrolled [...] "tumble" [...] through space. In spite of these challenges and added demands on their time (in order {{to carry out the}} repair work), they still accomplished all mission goals-spacewalk, flyaround, and one-hundred percent of the planned U.S. science experiments.|$|R

2500|$|On 6 May 1981, USAF EC-135N, (AF Serial Number 61-0328), crashed {{during a}} {{scheduled}} Advanced Range Instrumented Aircraft (ARIA) navigator and Primary Mission Electronic Equipment (PMEE) training mission from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. For an unexplained reason, the aircraft pitch trim {{was moved to}} the full nose-down position, which exceeded the ability of the autopilot to control, and the aircraft pitched over abruptly. [...] The abrupt pitch over caused the generators to trip off line and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> AC <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> prevented the pitch trim from being operated normally. [...] The aircraft became uncontrollable and exploded at about 1,500ft MSL. [...] The crash occurred near Walkersville, MD at 10:50L.

The captain's decision was adversely affected by self-imposed psychological factors which led him to assess inadequately the aircraft's battery endurance after the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> generator power and {{the magnitude of the}} risks involved in continuing to the destination airport. Contributing to the accident was the airline management's failure to provide and the FAA's failure to assure an adequate company recurrent flight crew training programme which contributed to the captain's inability to assess properly the battery endurance of the aircraft before making the decision to continue, and led to the inability of the captain and the first officer to cope promptly and correctly with the aircraft's electrical malfunction." ...|$|R

With the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> supply, the low-pressure core spray, the residual heat removal and low-pressure coolant injection system main pumps, and the automatic depressurization systems all failed (most of the emergency core cooling system). Only the steam-powered pump systems (isolation condenser in reactor 1, high-pressure coolant injection and reactor core isolation cooling system in reactors 2 and 3) remained available. A subsequent investigation by NHK would later reveal that the isolation condenser units had not been tested or operated in over 40 years. [...] Later, as the temperature rose, a system started that used steam-powered pumps and battery-powered valves.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Even though India {{being the}} world's third largest {{electricity}} producer and consumer after the United States and China, the nation still suffers from frequent power outages that {{last as long}} as 10 hours. Further, about 25 % of the population, about 300 million people, have no electricity at all. Efforts are underway to reduce transmission and distribution losses and increase production further. The term blackout is used to describe a widespread cutoff or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power,</b> especially {{as a result of a}} shortage, a mechanical failure, or overuse by consumers. It is well known that blackouts happen only rarely and they are usually caused by a sequence of low probability outages...|$|R
50|$|High voltage is {{used for}} {{electric}} power transmission to reduce the energy lost in {{the resistance of the}} wires. For a given quantity of power transmitted, doubling the voltage will deliver the same power at only half the current. Since the power lost as heat in the wires is proportional to the wires' resistance as a share of the total resistance, and doubling voltage allows for the quadrupling of non-transmission resistance without losing power, doubling the voltage reduces the line <b>losses</b> per unit <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> delivered by approximately a factor of 4. While power lost in transmission can also be reduced by increasing the conductor size, larger conductors are heavier and more expensive.|$|R
2500|$|The 1986 {{disaster}} in Chernobyl, USSR {{is generally considered}} to be the worst nuclear disaster, to date. On 25 April 1986, during routine maintenance, the crew at Chernobyl began preparing for a test of the reactor's turbine. During the test, the site experienced a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> their main <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> supply [...] Because <b>of</b> this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> power, the automatic shutdown mechanisms failed, and the reactor started to become unstable. As the Chernobyl operators tried to cool the rods by inserting them into the reactor core, a large power surge occurred. This is generally believed to be from a design flaw in the rods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> {{can occur}} {{suddenly}} and can damage or undermine equipment. To prevent damage, motor-generators can {{be tied to}} flywheels that can provide uninterrupted electrical power to equipment for a brief period.

50|$|The basic {{philosophy}} of a three-person flight deck in many flight operations, should an abnormality or emergency arise, {{is for the}} captain {{to hand over the}} actual flying of the aircraft to the first officer (co-pilot). The captain and FE together review and carry out the necessary actions required to contain and rectify the problem. This spreads the workload and ensures a system of cross-checking which maximizes safety. The captain is the manager and decision maker (pilot not flying, PNF), the first officer, or co-pilot, is the actual flier of the aircraft (pilot flying, PF), and the FE reads the check-lists and executes actions required {{under the auspices of the}} captain. There can be occasions when the roles of the pilots during an emergency are reversed, i.e. the copilot becomes the PNF and the captain becomes the PF; one such example was on the A300 B-Series aircraft when there was a complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> generator-supplied <b>electrical</b> <b>power,</b> whereupon the standby instruments that were powered were on the captain's side only, requiring the captain to be PF and the PNF and FE to resolve the issue.|$|R
50|$|Sighting a dogfight over Savo Island, Aaron Ward tracked {{a closer}} group of Japanese planes heading south over Tulagi; while {{swinging}} to starboard, the ship suddenly sighted three enemy planes {{coming out of}} the sun. Surging ahead to flank speed and putting her rudder over hard to port, Aaron Ward opened fire with her 20 mm and 40 mm guns, followed shortly afterwards by her 5-inch battery. Bombs from the first three planes struck on or near the ship, and the mining effect of the near-misses proved devastating; the first bomb was a near miss, which tore holes {{in the side of the}} ship, allowing the forward fire room to ship water rapidly; the second struck home in the engine room, causing a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> all <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> on the 5 inch and 40 mm mounts. Shifting to local control, however, the gunners kept up the fire. A third bomb splashed close aboard, holing her port side, near the after engine room. Having lost power to her rudder, the ship continued to swing to port as another trio of dive bombers loosed their loads on the now-helpless destroyer. While none of these bombs hit the ship, two landed very near her port side. Twenty men died, 59 were wounded, and seven went missing.|$|R
500|$|Lucid's stay aboard Mir {{ended with}} the flight of Atlantis on STS-79, which {{launched}} on 16 September. This, the fourth docking, saw John Blaha transferring onto Mir {{to take his place}} as resident US astronaut. His stay on the station improved operations in several areas, including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle, [...] "hand-over" [...] procedures for long-duration American crew members and [...] "ham" [...] amateur radio communications, and also saw two spacewalks to reconfigure the station's power grid. Blaha spent four months with the EO-22 crew before returning to Earth aboard Atlantis on STS-81 in January 1997, at which point he was replaced by physician Jerry Linenger. During his flight, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian-built Orlan-M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev, flying EO-23. All three crew members of EO-23 performed a [...] "fly-around" [...] in Soyuz TM-25 spacecraft. Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin faced several difficulties during the mission, including the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a malfunctioning Vika), failures of various systems, a near collision with Progress M-33 during a long-distance TORU test and a total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> station <b>electrical</b> <b>power.</b> The power failure also caused a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> attitude control, which led to an uncontrolled [...] "tumble" [...] through space.|$|R
