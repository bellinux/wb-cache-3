500|$|The {{last letter}} from Ross is dated 4 April 1916. He reports: [...] "there's lots of {{fighting}} {{where we are}} at present, and just now {{we are in the}} German trenches, so have a busy time... I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> all again..." [...] For the next two days, the Canadian front line was under almost continuous bombardment. The 27th Battalion fared particularly badly, and on the night of 5–6 April, the 29th began relieving them, slowed down by the mud, extra equipment and a congestion of troops.|$|E
500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come... I think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{comprehensive}} {{success of the}} Battle of Megiddo, Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) at the War Office encouraged Allenby {{with the idea that}} the EEF could do anything: [...] "There is much talk here of the usual kind some saying you could go to Petrograd and some saying that all your force should now be transported to France, and some again who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> march east to Baghdad!" [...] He continued: [...] "Your success being so complete, I should like you to consider the possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, to be supported by infantry or not as the situation developed and as opportunities offered." [...] He added that the War Cabinet was prepared to take full responsibility for any unsuccessful outcomes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Eh, an' what's thee got thy best cloose on for {{to go to}} th' Hall Farm? The Poyser folks see'd thee in 'em yesterday, I warrand. What dost mean by turnin' worki'day into Sunday a-that'n? It's poor keepin' company wi' folks as donna <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee</b> i' thy workin' jacket." ...|$|R
5000|$|But I {{would have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> doing an {{analysis}} of spontaneous religious sentiment or, more exactly, of religious feeling, which is (...) the simple and direct fact of {{the feeling of the}} ‘eternal’ (which can very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and like oceanic, as it were).|$|R
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Thiệu's {{aversion to}} public {{appearances}} {{was attributed to}} a fear of hostility from South Vietnamese who believed that he failed them. He acknowledged his compatriots’ low esteem of his administration in a 1992 interview, but said, [...] "You say that you blame me for the fall of South Vietnam, you criticize me, everything. I let you do that. I [...] <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> do better than I." [...] Thiệu continually predicted {{the demise of the}} Vietnamese Communist Party's grip on power and warned against the United States establishing diplomatic relations with the communist regime. [...] (Relations between the U.S. and the communist regime in Hanoi were formally established in 1995.) Thiệu said that when the communists were deposed and when [...] "democracy is recovered" [...] that he would return to his homeland, but their hold on Vietnam remained unchallenged during his lifetime. He futilely offered to represent the refugee community in reconciliation talks with Hanoi to allow exiles to return home.|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No indeed, you couldn't go to Kitty." [...] He {{smiled at}} her hard as he added: [...] "I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> go <b>to</b> Kitty! Therefore exactly is it that I've set you adrift--that I've darkened and {{poisoned}} your days. You're paying with your comfort, with your peace, for having joined so gallantly in my grand remonstrance." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{movement}} {{for the sake}} of being in sight of her was more direct than usual rather late in the evening, when Gwendolen had accepted Klesmer as a partner; and that wide-glancing personage, who saw everything and nothing by turns, said to her when they were walking, [...] "Mr. Grandcourt is a man of taste. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> dancing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} break down, dear," [...] she said quietly. [...] "For months I {{have felt that}} it was so; and, but for your sake, I did not care to live. I thank God that I have been spared <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> growing up all that I could wish; and though I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> fairly started in life, I feel that you may now make your way, unaided.|$|R
60|$|ACRES By my valour, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> fight first! Odds life! I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{kill him}} {{if it was}} only to get a little lesson.|$|E
60|$|FELLOWS. Not yet, sir. The Jackmans would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> sir.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I {{should not}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> unite your destiny {{with that of}} a very unfortunate, if not a very unhappy, person.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Olive Chancellor," [...] Miss Birdseye murmured. [...] "I don't want to stay, though I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> will see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may seem}} strange to you, sir," [...] {{returned}} Gridley; [...] "I {{should not have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{if this had been}} the first time of our meeting. But you know I made a fight for it, you know I stood up with my single hand against them all, you know I told them the truth to the last, and told them what they were, and what they had done to me; so I don't mind your seeing me, this wreck." ...|$|R
60|$|CANDIDA. That's very gallant; but I think I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>you</b> do it first. (Turning to Morell.) James: you've {{not been}} looking after the house properly.|$|R
6000|$|... "If what you've {{been doing}} means shamming weak, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> coming out strong," [...] {{observed}} Miles, {{with a short}} laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, Mr. Laverick. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again very soon. You have heard me sing in Samson and Delilah?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--for my sake. I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> place {{yourself}} {{at a disadvantage}} toward another man; I don't like you to disappoint me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't Chauncey. This {{man would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>you,</b> Polly Ann. He--" [...] here I braced myself,--"he knew Tom McChesney. He {{called him a}} good-for-nothing scamp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is my}} denomination," [...] said Babbie, cheerfully. [...] "Some day, though, I am {{coming to}} hear you preach. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>you</b> look in your gown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh," [...] said Lisbeth, {{not willing}} to show that she felt the real bearing of Adam's words, [...] "and' who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee</b> i' thy best cloose better nor thy mother? An' when thee'st got thy face washed as clean as the smooth white pibble, an' thy hair combed so nice, and thy eyes a-sparklin'--what else is there as thy old mother should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> look at half so well? An' thee sha't put on thy Sunday cloose when thee lik'st for me--I'll ne'er plague thee no moor about'n." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "DEAR MR. NOEL--Sad {{news has}} reached me from Switzerland. My beloved brother is dying and his medical {{attendant}} summons me instantly to Zurich. The serious necessity of availing myself {{of the earliest}} means of conveyance to the Continent leaves me but one alternative. I must profit by the permission to leave England, if necessary, which you kindly granted {{to me at the}} beginning of my brother's illness, and I must avoid all delay by going straight to London, instead of turning aside, as I should have <b>liked,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> first at St. Crux.|$|R
