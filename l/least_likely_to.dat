5|$|Among women, some of {{the strongest}} support for {{feminism}} was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those {{in the middle of}} the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).|$|E
5|$|European {{settlers}} on the North American Prairies {{found that}} the sod <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs. Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses may still be found. A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.|$|E
5|$|Munir Sheikh, Canada's Chief Statistician {{appointed}} on Harper's advice, resigned on July 21, 2010, {{in protest}} of the government's change in policy. Ivan Fellegi, the former Chief Statistician of Canada, criticized the government's decision, saying {{that those who are}} most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> respond to a voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.|$|E

5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of}} the least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|One {{quarter of}} men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), agreed very much they defined {{themselves}} as feminist. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{integrating}} is easiest with two rats of young age, generally {{less than six}} months old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always keep them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Least</b> <b>likely</b> (safest) <b>to</b> release free {{gadolinium}} ions Gd(III) (also written Gd3+) in {{the body}} have a macrocyclic structure: gadoterate (Dotarem), gadobutrol (Gadavist) and gadoteridol (ProHance) ...|$|R
50|$|One of the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> {{structures}} <b>to</b> be overlooked—easily {{visible from}} a few blocks south of the neighborhood looking up Madison Street, is Tudor Hall. Its distinct architecture resembles the namesake period of the late 15th-early 17th centuries.|$|R
50|$|Demographically African Immigrants and Americans born of African {{immigrants}} tend to typically congregate {{in urban}} areas, moving to suburban areas {{over the next}} few generations as they try to acquire economic and social stability. They are also one of America's <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> groups <b>to</b> live in racially segregated areas.|$|R
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver {{is not a good}} alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
50|$|Only {{a fourth}} of the {{variance}} consisted of optical ballots. Most of the variation occurred in Votomatic overvotes, the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> ballots <b>to</b> yield votes in a recount. Among the nearly 85,000 Votomatic overvotes in the sample, there were only 721 reclaimable votes confirmed in the NORC study.|$|R

60|$|The skipper was {{understood}} {{to say that}} his ship was not a several adjectived hospital, but Austin only smiled, for he was acquainted {{with that kind of}} man, and aware that he was, at <b>least,</b> as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> do him a kindness as an elaborately got up mailboat's skipper.|$|R
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> distort his own life.|$|E
5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> benefit from the diet, {{and the use of}} the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

25|$|Teens from non-white, low-income {{families}} are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive abstinence-only sex education, {{according to the}} National Survey of Family and Growth. Teens with intact families are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive comprehensive sex education than those living with a single parent. Disadvantaged youth are the shown <b>to</b> be the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> social strata <b>to</b> benefit from formal sex education programs.|$|R
50|$|Between 1871 and 1876, McGeary also {{developed}} {{a reputation as one}} of the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> batters <b>to</b> strikeout at the plate. During those six seasons, he struck out only six times in 1,518 plate appearances. He led his league in at bats per strikeout ratio on three occasions, with ratios of 275 in 1873, 310 in 1875, and 276 in 1876.|$|R

25|$|In 2013 the British indie pop duo The Boy <b>Least</b> <b>Likely</b> <b>To</b> made song {{tribute to}} Yayoi Kusama, writing a song {{specially}} about her.

25|$|The {{social costs}} of {{transport}} include road crashes, air pollution, physical inactivity, time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> own and drive cars. Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people's time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{tetraplegia}} (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, {{because their}} muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs {{on one side of}} the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
40|$|Sexual assaults {{are less}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{reported}} to the police than physical assaults, while sexual assaults by a current partner are the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> of all <b>to</b> be reported, even compared to other types of sexual assaults. Despite indications of a high prevalence rate of spousal sexual violence, {{there seems to be}} more reluctance on the part of victim/survivors to report or discuss spousal sexual violence compared to other types of sexual assaults. There is also reluctance to disclose sexual violence even when physical violence may be identified. This means that sexual assault may remain a hidden aspect of abuse in relationships, even where physical assaults are disclosed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics personal safety data also indicated that sexual assaults are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be reported to}} the police than physical assaults, while sexual assaults by a current partner are the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> of all <b>to</b> be reported, even compared to other types of sexual assaults...|$|R

50|$|An {{estimated}} 520,000 {{people were}} murdered in 2000 around the globe. Another study estimated the worldwide murder rate at 456,300 in 2010 with a 35% increase since 1990. Two-fifths {{of them were}} young people {{between the ages of}} 10 and 29 who were killed by other young people. Because murder is the <b>least</b> <b>likely</b> crime <b>to</b> go unreported, statistics of murder are seen as a bellwether of overall crime rates.|$|R
