40|$|AbstractThe {{expansion}} of products of generalized <b>Laguerre</b> <b>polynomials</b> Lνn(x) {{in terms of}} a series of generalized <b>Laguerre</b> <b>polynomials</b> is considered. The expansion coefficients, which are equal to triple-product integrals of generalized <b>Laguerre</b> <b>polynomials,</b> are expressed {{in terms of a}} three-index recurrence relation. This is reduced to a one-index relation which facilitates computation of the expansion coefficients. The results are useful in the solution of nonlinear differential equations when it is desired to express products of generalized <b>Laguerre</b> <b>polynomials</b> as a linear series of these functions. As an application, we use the results to compute a spectral solution of a nonlinear boundary-value problem, namely the Blasius equation on a semi-infinite interval.
