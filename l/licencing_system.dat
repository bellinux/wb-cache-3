40|$|The {{majority}} of organisations {{in the construction}} industry are small organisations, how ever their safety performance is still far behind their larger counterparts. Therefore, it is important to focus on improving safety performance of small organisations so that the overall industry performance may be improved. Using a questionnaire survey, this research collected data from construction organisations based in New South Wales, Australia. Data analysis results have identified key barriers faced by small organisations when implementing safety. These barriers include the use of lowest bid price to evaluate tender submissions, lack of safety commitment from construction clients, and fierce competition. The analysis results have also revealed potential strategies for overcoming the barriers, such as including safety as an indicator in tender evaluation, more effective safety regulation enforcement by inspection and linking safety performance with insurance premium and <b>licencing</b> <b>system,</b> and subsidising safety training for small organisations. Improving safety performance in this sector cannot be done in isolation. The government, clients, and large organisations have important roles to play to change the norms and culture in the industry so that small organisations are supported in their effort to improve their safety performance...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Federal Government has {{recently}} passed reforms to the shipping industry. These reforms {{are aimed at}} removing barriers to investment in Australian shipping, fostering global competitiveness and securing a stable maritime skills base. The shipping reform package adopts a two pronged approach designed to achieve its stated goals by providing both a ‘stick’ and ‘carrot’ to industry participants. First, the ‘stick’ is delivered via the provision of tighter regulation of coastal trading operations through a new <b>licencing</b> <b>system,</b> along {{with the introduction of}} a civil penalty regime and an increase in existing penalties. Second, the ‘carrot’ is delivered via taxation incentives available to vessels registered in Australia where the registrant meets certain specified criteria. These incentives, introduced through amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Act 2012, provide five key tax incentives to the shipping industry. From 1 July 2012, amendments give effect to an income tax exemption for qualifying ship operators, accelerated depreciation of vessels, roll-over relief from income tax on the sale of a vessel, an employer refundable tax offset, and an exemption from royalty withholding tax for payments made for the lease of certain shipping vessels...|$|E
40|$|Water {{pollution}} of coastal waterways {{is a complex}} problem due to the cocktail of pollutants and multiplicity of polluters involved and pollution characteristics. Pollution control therefore requires a combination of policy instruments. This paper examines the applicability of market-based instruments to achieve effective and efficient water quality management in Darwin Harbour, Northern Territory, Australia. Potential applicability of instruments is examined {{in the context of}} biophysical and economic pollution characteristics, and experience with instruments elsewhere. The paper concludes that there is potential for inclusion of market-based instruments as part of an instrument mix to safeguard water quality in Darwin Harbour. It recommends, in particular, expanding the existing <b>licencing</b> <b>system</b> to include quantitative pollution limits for all significant point polluters; comprehensive and independent pollution monitoring across Darwin Harbour; public disclosure of water quality and emissions data; positive incentives for landholders in the Darwin Harbour catchment to improve land management practices; a stormwater offset program for greenfield urban developments; adoption of performance bonds for developments and operations which pose a substantial risk to water quality, including port expansion and dredging; and detailed consideration of a bubble licensing scheme for nutrient pollution. The paper offers an analytical framework for policy makers and resource managers tasked with water quality management in coastal waterways elsewhere in Australia and globally, and helps to scan for MBIs suitable in any given environmental management situation...|$|E

40|$|Efforts to {{improving}} {{safety in the}} construction industry have mainly been adopted by large organisations. As a result, these organisations have managed to substantially improve their safety performance. The construction industry, however, is dominated by small organisations. These organisations are facing difficulties to implement safety and, as a result, their safety performance is worse than their larger counterparts. Due to their large proportion {{in the construction industry}}, a small improvement among small organisations should have considerable impacts on the overall safety performance of the industry. This research aims to identify potential strategies to improve safety in small organisations {{in the context of the}} Australian construction industry. A questionnaire was developed based on a list of barriers and strategies identified from the existing literature. The questionnaire was then distributed to construction practitioners in Australia, particularly those working in small construction organisations, to obtain the perceived importance of each barrier and strategy. Open-ended questions were also included allowing the respondents to add additional barriers and strategies. Many perceived that external environmental factors are the key barriers that hinder safety implementation in small organisations. Improving safety, therefore, requires the support from influential stakeholders in the industry. Clients should consider safety as one of the key project objectives and include safety as one of the criteria in tendering. The government and regulatory bodies need to enforce safety regulations effectively and subsidise safety training for qualified small organisations. Safety performance should also be linked to insurance premium and <b>licencing</b> <b>system</b> in the construction industry. Finally, existing mandatory safety training needs to be evaluated and revised, while safety compliance for small organisations should be simplified and made practical...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{urban centres}} of Mozambique, {{charcoal}} {{is the major}} energy source for cooking. Growing demand drives high wood extraction rates over increasing areas of miombo and mopane woodlands. Charcoal production can lead to changes in ecosystem service provision and woodland degradation while also significantly contributing to rural income and, possibly, poverty alleviation. As such, understanding charcoal production and trade {{has important implications for}} rural areas and for the sustainable development of woodland resources. Here, we investigate charcoal production and trade through empirical research conducted in Gaza Province, the main charcoal supply area for Maputo, Mozambique. We analyse the present structure of the main charcoal supply chains from Gaza province to Maputo and the profit distribution along them. Seven villages in the Mabalane district, Gaza, at different stages of engagement with the charcoal industry, were selected for investigation. We conducted household surveys and semi-structured interviews with key informants (village leaders, charcoal producers, licence holders, wholesalers, transporters and forest technicians), from May to October 2014. Our results highlight two main charcoal supply chains comprising four main actor groups a) Local small-scale operators producing charcoal on a small-scale with household labour, who sell to wholesalers b) Large-scale operators producing and commercialising large volumes of charcoal using migrant labour, who sell their own production to wholesalers. While charcoal production constitutes an important income source for rural households in Mabalane, under supply chain a) more than 90 % of the monetary benefits do not reach local communities and remain with external agents. Two of the main factors impeding the generation of greater revenues at community level are: 1) bureaucratic burdens in obtaining charcoal commercialisation rights in the form of licences; and 2) weak institutional capacities for woodland resource governance. We conclude that access to markets and control over woodlands is key if local communities are to generate greater benefits from charcoal production while aiming at sustainable charcoal production. Strong local institutions for obtaining commercialisation rights and managing woodland resources have to be developed, while the restructuring of the <b>licencing</b> <b>system</b> in favour of small-scale producers and more rigorous control of the regulations could support this process...|$|E
40|$|Profit-driven {{innovation}} is crucial, argues Tony Healy, responding to John Quiggin’s recent article on APO JOHN QUIGGIN argues that social collaboration can replace profit-driven development of intellectual property. He cites {{the internet as}} evidence. In reality, profit-driven intellectual property continues to develop the content and the tools that matter on the internet. Newspaper sites {{are among the most}} popular, and even provide the basis for most commentary on blogs. Google, the search tool that transformed information work, was created by IP. Google’s work is patented and its source code tightly guarded. As a result, it is a US $ 50 billion economic powerhouse providing 2, 300 rewarding jobs for researchers and creating exciting new capabilities for all of us. Similarly, the internet was an academic curiousity until the 1995 release of Microsoft’s Windows 95 which, for the first time, provided transparent access to modems, vastly expanding the population that could access the internet. Even today, more than 90 percent of people accessing the internet do so using Windows. The success of the internet thus owes as much to commercial innovation as to academia. Commercial software developers including Microsoft have been the main proponents of the empowered individual, implemented by intelligent client software such as writing, spreadsheet, art and browser tools. Although they’re common now, in the 1980 s and early 1990 s they represented a departure from older centralised computing models. Movies and songs created by IP-driven studios are among the most popular items on the internet, even if obtained illegally. These are not arguments for the free culturist approach which Professor Quiggin espouses, and which was popularised by Professor Lawrence Lessig of Stanford. The central problem with the free culture approach is that it avoids the question of payment and reward. When pushed on this issue, free culturists sometimes fall back on a system of taxing consumables, creating problems of assigning revenue fairly. Academics seem to ignore this, befitting their own public funding. In fact, the free culture model implies funding by a central body such as government or universities, which in turn implies lack of choice for customers. Our best literature, movies and software are not created by academics or government departments. They are created by creative professionals and entrepreneurs. Intellectual property is an important means by which customers can have the freedom to select their true interests from those offerings. Professor Quiggin also lauds the trendy new <b>licencing</b> <b>system</b> called creative commons {{which is part of the}} free culture movement. Creative commons is a more fine tuned version of conventional copyright, but essentially it’s an artifice. Academics and commentators mostly use it to make their views available so long as there’s atttribution, and then argue that all work should be released in the same fashion. In doing so, they pretend their views are as valuable as creative work or R&D that might have involved months or years of work and significant investments. They’re not.

40|$|M. Comm. The Taxi Recapitalisation Programme (TRP) {{was first}} {{announced}} by the Government in 1999. It was originally recommended by the National Taxi Task Team (NTTT) as a strategy to transform and regulate the South African Combi-Taxi Industry (SACTI) into a “new” taxi industry. Its aims were {{to improve the quality}} of combi-taxi transport in South Africa by taking a number of steps, including institutionalising the industry, changing the <b>licencing</b> <b>system,</b> regulating the industry and replacing old vehicles with new ones. Since that time, however the TRP has been plagued by controversy and its implementation has fallen behind schedule. The study‟s key research aim has been to investigate and assess perceptions of taxi associations (taxi owners) with regard to the TRP. The study took place in Temba, near Hammanskraal, approximately 55 kilometres north of Pretoria. Temba is taken as a “microcosm” of SACTI in that it can be regarded as typical of many other areas in the country. A background is provided to the regulatory legislation of the public transport system of the apartheid Government and the general historical and economic development of the SACTI prior to 1994. It deals with the periods from 1930 - 1976, 1977 - 1985 and 1986 - 1993, and then explores the legislative and policy framework of the public transport system of the post- 1994 democratic government up to 2008. It introduces the NTTT and its recommendations before analysing the economic effects likely to be felt by taxi associations following implementation of the TRP. The study then presents the results of a brief demographic profile of a sample of taxi owners and operators in the Temba area and identifies a number of factors that influence their attitudes towards the industry in general and their perceptions of the TRP in particular. It assesses the progress made with the implementation of the TRP since its inception and identifies critical issues that have delayed the project. Having been scheduled to span the five years from 2001 to 2005, the date of completion of the TRP was later extended to 2007. By 2010 the project was still only partially complete. Due to repeated delays, the project appeared to be running aground and was perceived by many as a fruitless and wasteful exercise. Indeed, these delays have undermined the goals of transport regulation which, inter alia, were intended to promote the welfare of the public (safety, security, satisfaction, health and protection of property) and {{to improve the quality of}} public transport generally. By linking the demographic profile of the taxi owners with the various perceptions, the study has been able to draw conclusions and make findings intended to contribute towards the successful implementation of the TRP and thereby assist SACTI to play a more effective role in the overall transport situation in South Africa. The study concludes that taxi associations in Temba have perceived the TRP to be a good proposal but difficult to implement. It therefore makes a number of recommendations that will hopefully assist in the transformational process of changing SACTI “old” taxi industry into a “new” taxi industry, and so enhance the economic strength of taxi owners and operators, as well as improve the welfare of the users of taxi transport services, not only in Temba but throughout the country...|$|E
