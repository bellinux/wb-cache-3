5|$|She {{was first}} {{published}} as a serial story in the Graphic, a <b>large</b> <b>folio</b> magazine printed weekly in London, between October 1886 and January 1887. The serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by E. K. Johnson. An American edition was published by Harper and Bros. in New York on 24 December 1886; this included the Johnson illustrations. On 1 January 1887, an English edition was published by Longmans, Green, and Co., but without any images. It was the first publication of She in book format, and featured significant textual revisions from the Graphic serial made by Haggard. He made further revisions for an 1888 edition, which included illustrations by Maurice Greiffenhagen and C. H. M. Kerr. In 2006 a Broadview publication of She became the first edition to reproduce the Graphic serial text since 1887.|$|E

This hypothesis is not universally accepted and John Williams argues that all the work's folios belong to the same manuscript.|$|R
25|$|Challoner devoted {{much energy}} {{and time to}} {{revising}} the English Catholic Bible. He had long perceived a need to update {{the language of the}} Douay–Rheims Bible that had appeared over the years 1582–1610. Challoner did not set out to make a new translation; his aim was to remove antiquated words and expressions so that the Bible would be more readable and understandable by ordinary folk. While still at University of Douai, {{he was one of the}} approving prelates for a revision of the Rheims New Testament published in 1730 by the college president, Robert Witham. After returning to England, he and Francis Blyth published in 1738 another revision of Rheims in an attractive <b>large</b> <b>folio</b> edition.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{printing}} used a black letter typeface {{instead of}} a roman typeface, which itself made a political and a religious statement. Like the Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible, the Authorized Version was [...] "appointed to be read in churches". It was a <b>large</b> <b>folio</b> volume meant for public use, not private devotion; {{the weight of the}} type mirrored the weight of establishment authority behind it. However, smaller editions and roman-type editions followed rapidly, e.g. quarto roman-type editions of the Bible in 1612. This contrasted with the Geneva Bible, which was the first English Bible printed in a roman typeface (although black-letter editions, particularly in folio format, were issued later).|$|E

VI - Metaphysica Defensiva seu Critica (Explicative Metaphysics or Criteriology; c.1935-40) - This is most {{incomplete}} of Pirotta’s {{series of}} manuscripts {{related to his}} Summa Philosophiæ Aristotelico-Thomisticæ. The philosopher worked very little on it as a whole, though then segments of it are actually finalized.

The price of the book was two guineas for each part with 5 coloured plates. During the last dozen years its price at auctions runs about £250 to £300.

50|$|Vast {{destruction}} of the broad quartos of the early centuries {{took place in the}} period which followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire, but palimpsests were also created as new texts were required during the Carolingian Renaissance. The most valuable Latin palimpsests are found in the codices which were remade from the early <b>large</b> <b>folios</b> in the 7th to the 9th centuries. It has been noticed that no entire work is generally found in any instance in the original text of a palimpsest, but that portions of many works have been taken to make up a single volume. An exception is the Archimedes Palimpsest (see below). On the whole, Early Medieval scribes were thus not indiscriminate in supplying themselves with material from any old volumes that happened to be at hand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} lithographs shared similar {{characteristics in}} inking and paper, and adhered to folio sizes. Sizes {{of the images}} were standard (trade cards, very small folios, small <b>folios,</b> medium <b>folios,</b> <b>large</b> <b>folios),</b> and their measurement {{did not include the}} title or borders. These sizes are one of the guides for collectors today in determining if the print is an original or not. [...] "Currier used a cotton based, medium to heavy weight paper depending on the folio size for his prints until the late 1860s. From about 1870, Currier & Ives used paper mixed {{with a small amount of}} wood pulp." [...] In addition, Currier's inking process resembled a mixture of elongated splotches and dashes of ink with a few spots, a characteristic that modern reproductions would not possess.|$|R
5000|$|The Duchess of Malfi {{was first}} {{performed}} between 1613 and 1614 by the King's Men, an acting group to which Shakespeare belonged. The printer was Nicholas Okes and the publisher was John Waterson. However, {{the play was}} not printed in quarto (a smaller, less expensive edition than the <b>larger</b> <b>folio)</b> until 1623. The title page of this particular edition {{tells us that the}} play was printed privately. The title page also informs readers that the play text includes numerous passages that were cut for performance. The 1623 quarto is the only substantive version of the play in circulation today, and modern editions and productions are based on it. Notable is that, on the title page of the 1623 quarto, a clear distinction is drawn between the play in performance and the play as a text to be read.|$|R

A Birmingham tradesman of the name of Pott, an opulent man, was induced by his earnestness to begin a subscription for the publication of Carey's pamphlet, which showed wonderful acquaintance with the state of the countries it mentioned, and manifested talent of a remarkable order. In truth, Carey had been endowed with that peculiar missionary gift, facility for languages. A friend gave him a <b>large</b> <b>folio</b> in Dutch, and was amazed by his returning shortly after with a translation into English of one of the sermons which the book contained.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{relieved}} his anxiety, by telling him the coach {{had not yet}} appeared. The old gentleman, apparently conscious of his own want of punctuality, did not at first feel courageous enough to censure that of the coachman. He took a parcel, containing apparently a <b>large</b> <b>folio,</b> from {{a little boy who}} followed him, and, patting him on the head, bid him go back and tell Mr. B----, that if he had known he was to have had so much time, he would have put another word or two to their bargain,--then told the boy to mind his business, and he would be as thriving a lad as ever dusted a duodecimo. The boy lingered, perhaps in hopes of a penny to buy marbles; but none was forthcoming. Our senior leaned his little bundle upon one of the posts {{at the head of the}} staircase, and, facing the traveller who had first arrived, waited in silence for about five minutes the arrival of the expected diligence.|$|E
60|$|Oh, pray, now I {{think of}} it, {{be so kind}} to step to my aunt, and take notice of my great-grandfather's picture; you know he has a ring on his finger, with a seal of an anchor and dolphin about it; but I think there is besides, {{at the bottom of}} the picture, the same coat of arms {{quartered}} with another, which I suppose was my great-grandmother's. If this be so, it is a stronger argument than the seal. And pray see whether you think that coat of arms was drawn at the same time with the picture, or whether it be of a later hand; and ask my aunt what she knows about it. But perhaps there is no such coat of arms on the picture, and I only dreamed it. My reason is, because I would ask some herald here, whether I should choose that coat, or one in Guillim's <b>large</b> <b>folio</b> of heraldry,(4) where my uncle Godwin is named with another coat of arms of three stags. This is sad stuff to rite; so nite, MD.|$|E

Of the thirty-eight quarto volumes issued by the club, fourteen were produced under Stuart's editorship. Prominent among these were the two <b>large</b> <b>folios</b> on The Sculptured Stones of Scotland, published in 1856 and 1867, and regarded by antiquarians {{as one of their}} most important books of reference. Another of the Spalding volumes is The Book of Deer, published in 1869, a reproduction by Stuart of a manuscript copy of the Gospels which belonged to the abbey of Deer—of great historical and linguistic value, especially with regard to the Celtic history of Scotland.At the final meeting, on 23 Dec. 1870, Stuart was presented by the club with a piece of plate and his portrait, the work of Mr. (now Sir) George Reid.|$|R
50|$|A minor {{literary}} work of Abercromby's was {{a translation of}} Jean de Beaugué's Histoire de la guerre d'Écosse (1556) which appeared in 1707. But the work with which his name is permanently associated is his Martial Atchievements sic of the Scots Nation, issued in two <b>large</b> <b>folios,</b> vol. i. 1711, vol. ii. 1716. In the title-page and preface to vol. i. he disclaims the ambition of being an historian, but in vol. ii., in title-page and preface alike, {{he is no longer}} a simple biographer, but an historian. Even though, read in the light of later research, much of the first volume must necessarily be relegated to the region of the mythical, nonetheless, the historian was a laborious and accomplished reader and investigator of all available authorities, as well manuscript as printed; while the roll of names of those who aided him includes every man of note in Scotland at the time, from Sir Thomas Craig and Sir George Mackenzie to Alexander Nisbet and Thomas Ruddiman.|$|R
60|$|I was debating with myself, {{whether this}} hint of {{producing}} a small pamphlet to give notice of a <b>large</b> <b>folio,</b> was not borrowed from the ceremonial in Spanish romances, where a dwarf is sent out upon the battlements to signify to all passengers, what a mighty giant {{there is in the}} castle; or whether the Bishop copied this proceeding from the fanfarronade of Monsieur Boufflers, when the Earl of Portland and that general had an interview. Several men were appointed at certain periods to ride in great haste toward the English camp, and cry out, Monseigneur vient, Monseigneur vient: Then, small parties advanced with the same speed and the same cry, and this foppery held for many hours, until the mareschal himself arrived. So here, the Bishop (as we find by his dedication to Mr. Churchill the bookseller) has for a long time sent warning of his arrival by advertisements in Gazettes, and now his Introduction advances to tell us again, Monseigneur vient: In the mean time, we must gape and wait and gaze the Lord knows how long, and keep our spirits in some reasonable agitation, until his Lordship's real self shall think fit to appear in the habit of a folio.|$|E
6000|$|In his Epistle to Prince Posterity, prefixed to the [...] "Tale of a Tub," [...] Swift, in the {{character}} of the dedicator, declares, [...] "upon the word of a sincere man, that there is now actually in being a certain poet called John Dryden, whose translation of Virgil was lately printed in a <b>large</b> <b>folio,</b> well-bound, and, if diligent search were made, for aught I know, is yet to be seen." [...] In his [...] "Battle of the Books," [...] he tells us, [...] "that Dryden, who encountered Virgil, soothed the good ancient by the endearing title of 'father,' and, by a large deduction of genealogies, made it appear, that they were nearly related, and humbly proposed an exchange of armour; as a mark of hospitality, Virgil consented, though his was of gold, and cost an hundred beeves, the other's but of rusty iron. However, this glittering armour became the modern still worse than his own. Then they agreed to exchange horses; but, {{when it came to the}} trial, Dryden was afraid, and utterly unable to mount." [...] A yet more bitter reproach is levelled by the wit against the poet, for his triple dedication of the Pastorals, Georgics, and Aeneid, to three several patrons, Clifford, Chesterfield, and Mulgrave.[16] But, though the recollection of the contemned Odes, like the spretae injuria formae of Juno, still continued to prompt these overflowings of Swift's satire, he had too much taste and perception of poetry to attempt, gravely, to undermine, by a formal criticism, the merits of Dryden's Virgil.|$|E
60|$|But to Georgiana {{the most}} engrossing volume was a <b>large</b> <b>folio</b> from her husband's own hand, {{in which he}} had {{recorded}} every experiment of his scientific career, its original aim, the methods adopted for its development, and its final success or failure, with the circumstances to which either event was attributable. The book, in truth, was both the history and emblem of his ardent, ambitious, imaginative, yet practical and laborious life. He handled physical details as if there were nothing beyond them; yet spiritualized them all, and redeemed himself from materialism by his strong and eager aspiration towards the infinite. In his grasp the veriest clod of earth assumed a soul. Georgiana, as she read, reverenced Aylmer and loved him more profoundly than ever, but with a less entire dependence on his judgment than heretofore. Much as he had accomplished, she could not but observe that his most splendid successes were almost invariably failures, if compared with the ideal at which he aimed. His brightest diamonds were the merest pebbles, and felt to be so by himself, in comparison with the inestimable gems which lay hidden beyond his reach. The volume, rich with achievements that had won renown for its author, was yet as melancholy a record as ever mortal hand had penned. It was the sad confession and continual exemplification of the shortcomings of the composite man, the spirit burdened with clay and working in matter, and of the despair that assails the higher nature at finding itself so miserably thwarted by the earthly part. Perhaps every man of genius in whatever sphere might recognize the image of his own experience in Aylmer's journal.|$|E
5000|$|Aglaura {{was entered}} into the Stationers' Register on 18 April, 1638 and {{published}} later that year, in an edition printed by John Haviland for the bookseller Thomas Walkley [...] - [...] a vanity edition subsidized by Suckling. Instead of the quarto format then standard for individual plays, Aglaura was printed in the <b>larger</b> <b>folio</b> format, normally restricted for serious works. (Stage plays were then treated largely as ephemera with little claim as serious literature.) Critics [...] - [...] Richard Brome was prominent among them [...] - [...] mocked the folio edition of Aglaura, especially the unusually broad page margins that compensated for the limited text. (For modern readers, the pleasing innovation of the 1638 edition is that it abstained from the fulsome and verbose titles fashionable in the 17th century, and employed a title of one word.) The play was reprinted by Humphrey Moseley in his octavo collection of Suckling's works, Fragmenta Aurea, in 1646 and 1648, and was included in subsequent collections. An early manuscript of the work also exists, {{in the collection of}} the British Museum (Royal MS. 18 C. 25).|$|R
60|$|Lydia's {{intention}} of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary {{agreed to go}} with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, {{at the request of}} Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the <b>largest</b> <b>folios</b> in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.|$|R
