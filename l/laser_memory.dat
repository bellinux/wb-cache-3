40|$|Quantum dots (QD) {{of various}} kinds {{are one of the}} most {{important}} entities in nanotechnology due to their potential applications as <b>lasers,</b> <b>memory</b> storage devices or building blocks for quantum computation. Understanding the electronic structure of QDs is not only important for such application, but also of great interest in fundamental physics. As a consequence, there have been a number of studies of electronic properties using mainly optical or capacitance spectroscopy techniques. Investigating a single QD not fabricated by lithography techniques, such as a self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot or a nano particle, is challenging because of the extremely small dot dimensions. Spectroscopic techniques based on scanning probe microscopy (SPM) have been employed, in particular scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). The latter has been applied to the investigation of a single QD by measuring the tunneling current flowing in the double tunneling barrier junction which is formed by the tip, the QD and the back electrode. In STS the acquired tunneling spectra feature the Coulomb staircase or/and the discrete energy states of the QD depending on the size of the QD and the tunneling barrier thickness [1 - 3]. However, these measurements are limited to substrates with adequate conductivity since a measurable tunneling current of typically 1 pA or more is usually required. Alternatively, the detection of the electrostatic force caused by the charging of QDs has also been tried with atomic force microscope (AFM). Single electron charging has thus been observed in small metallic islands [4 - 5] and in a discontinued single carbon-nanotube QD [6]. 2...|$|R

In this work wavelength dependent remote power supply for SMA is presented to avoid electrical cables from the working area of the structure and to demonstrate the selective addressing of a high number of micro-actuators placed in a small space. Low power (100 mW) continuous mode laser diodes are used as remote power supply sources. A thermal numerical model is presented to visualize the temperature evolution in a Nitinol sample (3 mm 1 mm 100 mm) irradiated by 785 nm laser source. A series of experiments are performed to validate the modelling results, to estimate the response time under different loadings (15 g and 20 g) and to demonstrate the wavelength dependent deformation in SMA samples for selective addressing which is realized by depositing thin layers having specific optical filtering properties directly over the SMA sample and using laser diode sources with different wavelengths (785 nm and 658 nm).

40|$|The {{formation}} of well-controlled circular {{patterns on the}} nanoscale {{is important for the}} fabrication of a range of devices such as sensors, <b>memories,</b> <b>lasers,</b> transistors, and quantum devices. Concentric, smooth ring patterns with tunable dimensions have been formed from a cylinder-forming poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-PDMS) diblock copolymer under confinement in shallow circular trenches. The high etch selectivity between PS and PDMS facilitates pattern transfer, illustrated by the fabrication of arrays of ferromagnetic cobalt rings with a density of 1. 1 × 109 /cm 2. The effects of confinement diameter and commensurability on the diameter and period of the concentric rings are analyzed using a free energy model that includes interfacial, strain, and bending energies. This work provides a simple process for the fabrication of nanoscale circular patterns with very narrow line width using a much coarser-scale template, and may facilitate the miniaturization of a variety of microelectronic devices. Self-organization of macromolecular materials can provide an alternative pathway to conventional lithography for the fabrication of devices on the nanometer scale. In particular, the self-assembly of the microdomains of diblock copolymers within lithographically defined templates to create patterns with long-range order has attracted considerable attention...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, {{the small}} and {{lightweight}} HP 7470 introduced the [...] "grit wheel" [...] mechanism, {{eliminating the need for}} perforations along the edges, unlike the Calcomp plotters two decades earlier. The grit wheels at opposite edges of the sheet press against resilient polyurethane-coated rollers and form tiny indentations in the sheet. As the sheet is moved back and forth, the grit wheels keep the sheet in proper registration due to the grit particles falling into the earlier indentations, much like the teeth of two gears meshing. The pen is mounted on a carriage that moves back and forth in a line between the grit wheels, representing the orthogonal axis. These smaller [...] "home-use" [...] plotters became popular for desktop business graphics and in engineering laboratories, but their low speed meant they were not useful for general printing purposes, and different conventional printer would be required for those jobs. One category, introduced by Hewlett Packard's MultiPlot for the HP 2647, was the [...] "word chart", which used the plotter to draw large letters on a transparency. This was the forerunner of the modern Powerpoint chart. With the widespread availability of high-resolution inkjet and <b>laser</b> printers, inexpensive <b>memory</b> and computers fast enough to rasterize color images, pen plotters have all but disappeared.

The value of access to locked data and services makes Smart Cards a desirable attack target for hackers of all sorts. The range of attacks a Smart Card and its environment can be subjected to ranges from social engineering to exploiting hardware and software bugs and features. This research has focused on several hardware related attacks and potential threats. Namely, power glitch attack, power analysis, laser attack, the potential effect on security of memory power consumption reduction techniques and using a re-configurable instruction set as method to harden opcode interpretation. A semi-automated simulation environment to test designs against glitch attacks and power analysis has been developed. This simulation environment can be easily integrated within Atmel’s design flow to bring assurance of their designs’ behaviour and permeability to such attacks at an early development stage. Previous power analysis simulation work focused on testing the implementation of part of the cryptographic algorithm. This work focuses on targeting the whole algorithm, allowing the test of a wider range of countermeasures. A common glitch detection approach is monitoring the power supply for abnormal voltage values and fluctuations. This approach can fail to detect some fast glitches. The alternative approach used in this research monitors the effects of a glitch on a mono-stable circuit sensitive to fault injection by glitch attacks. This work has resulted in a patented glitch detector that improves the overall glitch detection range. The use of radiation countermeasures as laser countermeasures and potential sensors has been investigated too. Radiation and laser attacks have similar effects on silicon devices. Whilst several countermeasures against radiation have been developed over the years, almost no explicit mention of laser countermeasures was found.

Current and future device applications for semiconducting polymers include light-emitting diodes, thin-film transistors, photovoltaic cells, chemical and biological sensors, photodetectors, <b>lasers,</b> and <b>memories.</b> The performance of conjugated polymer devices depends on two major factors: the chain conformation in polymer film and the device architecture. Highly ordered chain structure usually leads to much improved performance by enhancing interchain interaction to facilitate carrier transport. The goal {{of this research is}} to improve the performance of organic devices with the nanoimprint lithography. The work begins with the controlling of polymer chain orientation in patterned nanostructures through nanoimprint mold design and process parameter manipulation, and studying the effect of chain ordering on material properties. After that, step-and-repeat thermal nanoimprint technique for large-scale continuous manufacturing of conjugated polymer nanostructures is developed. The actual chain orientation of molecular groups in polymer micro- and nanostructures patterning by nanoimprint is complicated. However, this information is crucial for intelligently controlling the electrical and photophysical properties of conjugated polymers by nanoimprint. Systematic investigation of polymer chain configuration by Raman spectroscopy is carried out to understand how nanoimprint process parameters, such as mold pattern size, temperature, and polymer molecular weight, affects polymer chain configuration. The results indicate that chain orientation in nanoimprinted polymer micro- and nanostructures is highly related to the nanoimprint temperature and the dimensions of the mold structures. The ability to create nanoscale polymer micro- and nanostructures and manipulate their internal chain conformation establishes an original experimental platform that enables studying the properties of functional polymers at the micro- and nanoscale and understanding their fundamental structure-property relationships. In addition to the impact on basic research, the techniques developed in this work are important in applied research and development. Large-area conjugated polymer micro- and nanostructures can be easily fabricated by thermal step-and-repeat nanoimprint for organic flat-panel displays, organic circuits and organic solar panels. The ability to manipulate chain orientation through nanoimprint presents a new route to fine-tune the electrical and photophysical properties of conjugated polymers, which can lead to improved performance for all organic electronics. The techniques developed here also allow for easy incorporation of other micro- and nanoscale soft functional polymers in miniaturized devices and systems for new applications in electronics, photonics, sensors and bioengineering...|$|R

In the first section, packaged live DDR 3 die were tested using automatic test equipment using high-resolution shmoo plots. It {{was found that the}} best timing and voltage margin was obtained using the lead-bonded microBGA, followed by the wire-bonded FBGA with the FCBGA exhibiting the worst performance of the three types tested. In particular the flip-chip packaged devices exhibited reduced operating voltage margin. In the second part of this work a test system was designed and constructed to mimic the electrical environment of the data bus in a PC’s CPU-Memory subsystem that used a single DIMM (Dual In Line Memory Module) socket in point-to-point and point-to-two-point configurations. The emulation system was used to examine signal integrity for system-level operation at speeds in excess of 6 Gb/pin/sec in order to assess the frequency extensibility of the signal-carrying path of the microBGA considered for future high-speed DRAM packaging. The analyzed signal path was driven from either end of the data bus by a GaAs laser driver capable of operation beyond 10 GHz. Eye diagrams were measured using a high speed sampling oscilloscope with a pulse generator providing a pseudo-random bit sequence stimulus for the <b>laser</b> drivers.

40|$|Quantum dots (QDs) are a {{semiconductor}} nanostructure {{in which}} a small island of one type of semiconductor material is contained within a larger bulk of a different one. These structure are interesting {{for a wide range}} of applications, including highly efficient <b>LASERs,</b> high-density novel <b>memory</b> devices, quantum computing and more. In order to understand the nature of QDs, electrical characterisation techniques such as capacitance-voltage (CV) profiling and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) are used to probe the nature of the carrier capture and emission processes. This is limited, however, by the nature of QD formation which results in a spread of sizes which directly affects the energy structure of the QDs. In this work, I sought to overcome this by using Si substrates patterned with a focused ion beam (FIB) to grow an array of identically-sized Ge dots. Although I was ultimately unsuccessful, I feel this approach has great merit for future applications. In addition, this thesis describes several unusual characteristics observed in InAs QDs in a GaAs bulk (grown by molecular beam epitaxy-MBE). Using conventional and Laplace DLTS, I have been able to isolate a single emission transient. I further show an inverted relation between the emission rate and the temperature under high field (emissions increase at lower temperatures). I attribute this to a rapid capture to and emission from excited states in the QD. In addition, I examine a metastable charging effect that results from the application of a sustained reverse bias and decreases the apparent emission rate from the dots. I believe this to be the result of a GaAs defect with a metastable state which acts as a screen, inhibiting emission from the dots due to an accumulation of charge in the metastable state. These unusual characteristics of QDs require further intensive work to fully understand. In this work I have sought to describe the phenomena fully and to provide hypotheses as to their origin.

40|$|The {{exciting}} thermomechanical {{properties of}} nickel-titanium shape memory alloys have sparked significant research efforts seeking to exploit their exotic capabilities. Until recently, the performance capabilities of nickel-titanium devices have been inhibited by {{the retention of}} only one thermomechanical characteristic. However, laser processing technology promises to deliver enhanced material offerings which are capable of multiple functional responses. Presented in this thesis, is {{an investigation of the}} effects of laser processing on the thermomechanical behaviour of nickel-titanium shape memory alloys. In the context of this work, laser processing refers to removal of alloy constituents, {{as in the case of}} laser ablation, or alternatively, addition of elements through laser alloying. The effects of laser ablation on the composition, crystallography and phase transformation temperatures of a nickel-titanium strip have been studied. Application of laser energy was shown to ablate nickel constituents, induce an austenite-martensite phase change and cause an increase in phase transformation onset temperatures, which correlated well with reported findings. Laser processing of a nickel-titanium wire was shown to locally embed an additional thermomechanical response which manifested as unique shape memory and pseudoelastic properties. Localized alloying of ternary species via laser processing of nickel-titanium strip was investigated. Synthesis of a ternary shape memory intermetallic within the laser processing region was achieved through melting of copper foils. Results from thermoanalytical testing indicated that the ternary compound possessed a higher phase transformation temperature and reduced transformation hysteresis in comparison to the reference alloy. Indentation testing was used to demonstrate the augmented thermomechanical characteristics of the <b>laser</b> processed shape <b>memory</b> alloy. In order to demonstrate the enhanced functionality of laser processed nickel-titanium shape memory alloys, a self-positioning nickel-titanium microgripper was fabricated.

40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic {{electrical}} behaviour, the electrical conductivity, the macroscopic viscosity and the optical transmission characteristics of side chain polysiloxane liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) have been studied. Particular emphasis {{has been placed}} on the study of the molecular dynamics using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and the low field (AC) and high field (DC) conductivity, with the intention of relating structural variations to the behaviour of these materials, and of identifying the most appropriate LCPs for use in practical optical storage devices. The effect on the molecular dynamics of the polymer backbone and the core, spacer and end groups of the mesogenic units was investigated. The LCP responses were shown to be broadly similar to those of low molar mass liquid crystals, though with longer relaxation times. The dynamic responses of structurally different LCPs were shown to be related when these were observed at a temperature referenced to the glass transition temperature. Values of the static permittivity of several LCPs have also been measured and tabulated. Low field electrical conductivity measurements were used to show that the magnitude of the conductivity was comparable to that of commercial liquid crystals. A method was identified whereby the conductivity of different LCPs could be compared. The texture of the measuring electrode surface was found {{to play an important role}} in determining the impedance of electrical double layers formed near the surface of the sample, with smooth polymer based surfactants reducing the formation of space charge. High field DC conductivity measurements showed that Schottky-type charge emission occurred at the electrodes at elevated temperatures, except when the smooth polymer based surfactants were present. This was probably a result of the reduction in the local field near the electrode due to a better physical match at the LCP/surfactant interface. The bulk viscosity of mixtures of an LCP and commercial liquid crystal were also measured and the results extrapolated to the viscosity of the LCP. The relationship between electrical conductivity and bulk viscosity was examined. The optical absorption spectra of blue pleochroic dyes have been measured to identify appropriate dyes for use with LCPs in <b>laser</b> written optical <b>memories.</b> The stability of the alignment of selected LCPs with time and temperature was also observed optically...|$|R
