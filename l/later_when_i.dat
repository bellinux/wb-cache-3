25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

500|$|Steinman {{had secured}} a {{contract}} with Meat Loaf's recording label MCA for Lorraine Crosby, a club singer from North East England whom he was managing. While visiting the company's recording studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love". Crosby recalls, [...] "I went and sang it twice and I never thought anything more of it until six months <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{got a phone call}} saying, 'Would you mind if we used your vocals?'" [...] Cher, Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Tyler had been considered for the role. However, as Crosby had recorded her part as guide vocals, she did not receive any royalties from the song.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film Souls at Sea. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper {{referred to it as}} his [...] "almost picture", saying, [...] "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." [...] In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, [...] "It {{was one of the best}} roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't see myself as quite that dashing, and <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Babel later recalled, [...] "My journalistic work {{gave me a}} lot, {{especially}} {{in the sense of}} material.

I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. <b>Later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> began writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective.

2500|$|When he was eight, Adams {{began writing}} {{short stories and}} limericks on his grandmother's typewriter.

[...] At the age of 14 Adams began {{learning}} to play the electric guitar that his mother and stepfather had bought him, and shortly afterward joined a local band named Blank Label. Although Blank Label did not stay together long, a three-track 7" [...] record exists, dated 1991 and lasting less than seven minutes in total.|$|E

2500|$|Lorraine Crosby, {{a singer}} from England, was the guest singer, though AllMusic {{incorrectly}} attributes the female vocals to Ellen Foley. Crosby {{and her partner}} Stuart Emerson had moved to Los Angeles to work with Jim Steinman, who became their manager. He secured them a contract with Meat Loaf's recording label MCA. While visiting the company's recording studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love". Crosby recalls, [...] "in I went and sang it twice and I never thought anything more of it until six months <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{got a phone call}} saying, 'Would you mind if we used your vocals?'"

2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why did you call me, {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} out in Sydney once {{having to}} respond to some complimentary toast, and my one desire was to turn in my tracks like any other worm--and run, for it. I was remembering that occasion at a <b>later</b> date <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had to introduce a speaker. Hoping, then, to spur his speech by putting him, in joke, on the defensive, I accused him in my introduction of everything I thought it {{impossible for him to}} have committed. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> finished there was an awful calm. I had been telling his life history by mistake.|$|R
2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go. <b>Later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was told that I would receive good {{attention}} and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom I had never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled to defend myself often.|$|E
2500|$|However, one film {{in which}} Orbison {{refused to allow}} his music to be used was Blue Velvet. Director David Lynch asked to use [...] "In Dreams", and Orbison {{initially}} declined Lynch's request. Lynch used it anyway. The song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth (played by [...] Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, [...] "I was mortified because {{they were talking about}} the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal... I thought, 'What in the world...?' But <b>later,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the moderates on Congress politics began to wane after Gokhale died in 1915. Anti-moderate leaders such as Annie Beasant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak {{took the opportunity to}} call for a national movement for Home Rule. But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action. Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league. Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former. He remarked later: [...] " [...] had a very powerful influence on me in my childhood... even <b>later</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> entered political life her influence continued." [...] Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of Hindu-Muslim unity with the Lucknow Pact {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress in December 1916. The pact had been initiated earlier in the year at Allahabad at a meeting of the All India Congress Committee which was held at the Nehru residence at Anand Bhawan. Nehru welcomed and encouraged the rapprochement between the two Indian communities.|$|E
