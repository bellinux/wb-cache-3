Friedrich Baumann set up his own business called «Baumann-Grütter», which was taken on by his sons Willy and Fritz in 1930. Willy was responsible for the finances, whilst Fritz looked after manufacture and distribution. Step by step they built up exports. After the Second World War, the enterprise was split into two; an upholstery fabric manufacturing plant and a linen weaving mill. Fritz Baumann took charge of the linen weaving mill, which later developed into the trademark «Création Baumann». In 1951 the entreprise, which meanwhile was also producing curtain fabrics, relocated to new buildings at the Bern-Zürich-Strasse in Langenthal, at which Création Baumann's headquarters are still today. The company achieved continuous growth and exports flourished. In 1976 the third generation took charge of the company with Joerg Baumann. Création Baumann already numbered 200 employees. The trademark was promoted worldwide and in 1985 turnover reached the 40 million Swiss franc mark for the first time. Since 2000, the management has been under the stewardship of Philippe Baumann, the fourth generation Baumann entrusted with the management of the company. In the last few years export accounted for between 73 and 75 percent of sales.|$|E
50|$|As {{the century}} progressed, the Philips brothers' {{personal}} and business ties with Manchester grew closer despite their continuing links with London; by its end, they had greater {{interests in the}} northern city than in Staffordshire. The relationships are, however, obscure, in part because names were shared across generations. Chapman says that the hatting business was established around 1750 at Dolefield in Manchester and was known as Thomas Philips & Co. He says that the business also manufactured tape. Watson and Mann say that this business was known as Thomas & Nathaniel Philips by the early 1770s. Chapman notes a smallwares manufacturer called Nathaniel & Falkner Philips, operating on two sites not far from Manchester, in Radcliffe and Whitefield. The Nathaniel involved in this was the uncle of the partners in J. & N. Philips, while Falkner refers to his son, Thomas Falkner Philips (1744-?). Watson and Mann differ from Chapman regarding the origin of these two operations, which they say were established by the Tean partnership, although they do agree that N. & F. Philips were manufacturing smallwares in Manchester in the 1770s. They add that the Tean partnership of J. & N. Philips also operated from a warehouse in Manchester {{at that time and}} refer also to a business called Nathaniel & John Philips, who manufactured silk and <b>linen</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E

The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia.
