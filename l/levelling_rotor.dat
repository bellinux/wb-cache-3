50|$|Rotor {{dynamics}} is {{a specialized}} branch of applied mechanics {{concerned with the}} behavior and diagnosis of rotating structures. It is commonly {{used to analyze the}} behavior of structures ranging from jet engines and steam turbines to auto engines and computer disk storage. At its most basic <b>level</b> <b>rotor</b> dynamics is concerned with one or more mechanical structures (rotors) supported by bearings and influenced by internal phenomena that rotate around a single axis. The supporting structure is called a stator. As the speed of rotation increases the amplitude of vibration often passes through a maximum that is called a critical speed. This amplitude is commonly excited by unbalance of the rotating structure; everyday examples include engine balance and tire balance. If the amplitude of vibration at these critical speeds is excessive then catastrophic failure occurs. In addition to this, turbo machinery often develop instabilities which are related to the internal makeup of turbo machinery, and which must be corrected. This is the chief concern of engineers who design large rotors.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 Recent {{experience}} {{in solving the}} shaft breakage and seal rub problem of a vertical, eight-stage liquid nitrogen pump at a plant site is documented. Several initial field tests conducted to diagnose the vibration problem are described in detail. The pump is modelled as a dual <b>level</b> <b>rotor</b> bearing system, {{to account for the}} vibration characteristics of the support structure and pump casing bundle. A subsynchronous mode associated with the cantilever bending of the pump casing bundle was correctly predicted by this dual level analytical model. This subsynchronous mode would remain undetectable, if the pump were modelled as a single level system with rigid pump casing bundle and inflexible support structure. Also included in the analysis are pertinent representations for throttle bushings, wear rings, bearing bushings, and stator-impeller forces, based on empirical models selected from the open literature. The pump model was calibrated with vibration data of the support structure and the pump shaft. A comprehensive parametric study produced four cost effective solutions, one of which was chosen for implementation. Subsequent field tests confirmed the reduction of shaft vibrations predicted by the analysis. The pump continues to operate satisfactorily. The combined experimental and analytical approach outlined should be of interest to engineers responsible for solving the vibration problems of vertical multistage pumps...|$|R

40|$|Being in {{his late}} twenties, the doctor of law Joachim P. Küttner {{systematically}} searched for atmospheric uplift, {{which could be used}} for soaring flight, a sport of growing popularity during the 1930 s in Germany. Within three years he published no less than six papers dealing with convective up-draughts over Northern Finland {{as well as in the}} Balkans, with uplift at the tropopause level during cyclogenesis and with a classification of terms contributing to the quantity of dynamic pressure. However, his broad observational documentation of wave clouds connected with flow across mountain ridges and the experimental description of the vertical motion field during a regional gliding contest at the lee side of the Riesengebirge constituted the landmark paper that made his name known to a wider community. He postulated an intrinsic connection between highly turbulent flow in low <b>levels</b> <b>rotors</b> and often smooth motion in mountain waves aloft. In a companion paper, he also aimed at a theoretical explanation of the available observations. This presentation attempts to recall the essence of Küttner's first surge of publications.

40|$|LecturePg. 49 - 58 Stringent {{stability}} {{screening criteria}} by the American Petroleum Institute (API) result in higher <b>level</b> <b>rotor</b> stability analyses {{to be performed}} on more intermediate-pressure compressor rotors and in more detail. These high-level stability analyses include predictions of impeller and seal rotordynamic forces and even extra effort on design and analysis of special damping devices as a backup, such as damper bearings and seals. Several moderate-pressure compressors were selected here to discuss the use of stability screening diagrams and the proposed API screening criteria. These compressors are operating successfully {{with or without a}} deswirl mechanism. However, most of them fail to pass the proposed new API screening. Furthermore, rotor aerodynamic logarithmic-decrements (log-decrements or log-dec) were predicted by implementing equivalent aerodynamic destabilizing forces that were calculated using Wachel?s equation, the API proposed equation, and the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) empirical method, respectively. In practice, shunt injection and swirl-brakes are standard tools to enhance rotor stability if the predicted log-decrement is relatively low. When adopted with balance pistons or center seals, the swirl brakes are typically installed behind the impeller and outside the labyrinth seal. However, the deswirl effect of the swirl brake is sometimes limited due to its locations away from the entrance of the balance piston or center labyrinth seal. Meanwhile, the implantation of the swirl brake would change the flow pattern behind the final stage impeller backwall. A unique antiswirl brake device was developed to integrate with typical labyrinth seals for improving high-performance compressor stability. The effectiveness of the antiswirl brake mechanism was experimentally investigated when used with the labyrinth seals on a rotating test rig. The gas flow circumferential velocity was measured at the swirl-brake upstream and downstream locations. Test results show the labyrinth seal was converted into a damping device by reducing the preswirl velocity to zero or even negative...|$|R

After freezing the geometry of the Arn cage or subunit at the equilibrium structure (preceding paper), we carry out nonadiabatic five-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations on two coupled potential energy surfaces, using {{an extension of the}} method previously applied to closed-shell ArnHFclusters [J.

The method is based on a discrete variable representation (DVR) for the translational motion of OH relative to Arn, combined with a finite basis representation of the OH hindered rotation and electronic structure, including spin–orbit effects. The pattern of OH hindered <b>rotor</b> <b>levels</b> in clusters is similar to that in Ar–OH itself, though extended over three to four times the energy range for n= 4 to 9. Ar 12 OH has a nearly spherical shell of Ar atoms around the OH, so the anisotropic splitting is very small.

This is generally true both at the single particle level, like in the Fermi acceleration mechanism of charged particles reflected by magnetic mirrors, and for complex systems in everyday devices. Notable exceptions are known in noninteracting systems of particles moving in periodic potentials. Here the phenomenon of dynamical localization can prevent heating beyond certain threshold.
