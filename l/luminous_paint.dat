5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a <b>luminous</b> <b>paint,</b> {{containing}} a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, {{which are used}} in <b>luminous</b> <b>paint,</b> atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a fission product.|$|E
25|$|Clocks, watches, and {{instruments}} {{dating from the}} first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive <b>luminous</b> <b>paint.</b> They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{friction}} between the Western Allies and Soviets was steadily rising. The Soviets even took to marking out their border by stationing armed soldiers along it at intervals of a few metres, day and night, in all weathers. Since there was not, as yet, a fixed marker, the borders were prone to abuse, which eventually resulted (in August 1948), in white lines in <b>luminous</b> <b>paint</b> appearing across roads and even through ruined buildings to try to deter the Soviets from making unauthorised incursions into the American and British zones. These measures were only partially successful: after further skirmishes in which shots were fired, barbed wire entanglements were stretched across some roads, a foretaste of things to come.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, uranium ore was {{recovered}} as {{a byproduct of}} mining in Saxony, Bohemia, and Cornwall. The first deliberate mining of radioactive ores took place in Jáchymov, a silver-mining city in the Czech Republic. Marie Curie used pitchblende ore from Jáchymov to isolate the element radium, a decay product of uranium. Until World War II uranium was mined primarily for its radium content; some carnotite deposits were mined primarily for the vanadium content. Sources for radium, contained in the uranium ore, were sought for use as <b>luminous</b> <b>paint</b> for watch dials and other instruments, {{as well as for}} health-related applications, some of which in retrospect were certainly harmful. The byproduct uranium was used mostly as a yellow pigment.|$|E
500|$|... {{is known}} as tritium and {{contains}} one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years. It is so radioactive {{that it can be}} used in <b>luminous</b> <b>paint,</b> making it useful in such things as watches. The glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out. Small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests. It is used in nuclear fusion reactions, as a tracer in isotope geochemistry, and in specialized self-powered lighting devices. Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel.|$|E

2500|$|Radium was {{formerly}} used in self-luminous paints for watches, nuclear panels, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium.

The dial painters routinely licked their brushes {{to give them a}} fine point, thereby ingesting radium. Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, anemia, and bone cancer. This is because radium is treated as calcium by the body, and deposited in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells.|$|E

Thinks I to myself, “I must find some way of fixing it so for Master Case.” And the next moment I had my idea.|$|E

To the left, before Tengga's enclosure, the loom of fire had changed into a pillar of smoke.

Some vague forms were still moving there and she could picture them to herself: Daman, the supreme chief of sea-robbers, with a vengeful heart and the eyes of a gazelle; Sentot, the sour fanatic with the big turban, that other saint with a scanty loin cloth and ashes in his hair, and Tengga whom she could imagine from hearsay, fat, good-tempered, crafty, but ready to spill blood on his ambitious way and already bold enough to flaunt a yellow state umbrella at the very gate of Belarab's stockade--so they said.|$|R
