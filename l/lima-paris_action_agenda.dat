40|$|Through {{an eclectic}} {{theoretical}} approach drawing on theory on regime complexes and transnational climate governance, orchestration {{theory and the}} schools of new institutionalism, this research paper presents a qualitative assessment on how non-state actors engagement in transnational climate governance is steered by the initiative of the UN Secretary General, the UNFCCC Secretariat and the COP presidents of Peru and France, <b>Lima-Paris</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Agenda</b> (LPAA). Further it evaluates what forms of climate governance that are promoted by the climate initiatives under the LPAA umbrella. It concludes that LPAA {{can be regarded as}} an orchestrator in the sense that it, by convening actors and existing initiatives form different sectors, steers non-state actors to engage in different forms of multi-stakeholder “cooperative initiatives" by providing incentives and an institutional framework that legitimizes the actions of the initiatives and the actors involved. The forms of climate governance that are promoted are mainly steering through information sharing and constitution of good climate practices and through capacity building and implementation based on voluntary goal setting and public reporting on progress...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} governance landscape {{on climate}} change mitigation is increasingly complex across multiple governance levels. Climate change mitigation initiatives by non-state stakeholders {{can play an important}} role in governing global climate change and contribute to avoiding unmanageable climate change. It has been argued that the UNFCCC could and should play a stronger role in "orchestrating" the efforts of these initiatives within the wider climate regime complex and thus inspire new and enhanced climate action. In fact, the <b>Lima-Paris</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Agenda</b> supporting cooperative climate action among state and non-state actors was supposed to be a major outcome of COP 21. There is little doubt that successful mitigation initiatives can create a momentum for climate protection. What is missing, is a systematic analysis of how this momentum can feed back into the UNFCCC negotiation process, inspiring also enhanced and more ambitious climate mitigation by states in future iterations of the cycle of nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement. This paper aims to close this gap: building on a structurational regime model, the article [1] develops a theory of change of how and through which structuration channels non-state initiatives can contribute to changing the politics of international climate policy; [2] traces existing UNFCCC processes and the Paris Agreement with a view to identifying entry points for a more direct feedback from non-state initiatives; and [3] derives recommendations on how and under which agenda items positive experiences can resonate within the UNFCCC negotiation process...|$|E
40|$|The " 4 ‰" Initiative was {{launched}} at the COP 21 {{as part of}} the <b>Lima-Paris</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Agenda.</b> It aims to improve the organic matter content of soils and promote soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration to increase soil fertility and thereby contribute to food security, to foster adaptation to climate change and contribute to mitigating climate change. The initiative focuses primarily on agricultural soils, because of their frequent poor soil organic carbon content and degradation and of their crucial role in food provision but also considers forest soils and the preservation of existing SOC stocks. The objectives of the initiative are: (i) to promote research on the knowledge needed for the initiative (mechanisms and potential of organic C sequestration in soils; SOC sequestering management agricultural and forestry practices; adoption and transition to these practices; monitoring SOC stocks) and to (ii) to foster initiatives, by a variety of actors, to better manage SOC in the field via agricultural practices. The gouvernance of the " 4 ‰" Initiative is organised in to three bodies, which will interact closely with each other: the consortium of all members, who elect {{the president and vice president}} of the initiative, the forum of partners and the scientific and technical committee (STC). The work of all these bodies is facilitated by the executive secretary. The STC has the mission to support SOC sequestration programs initiated by a wide variety of actors by setting reference criteria for the evaluation of SOC management projects and actions. The committee will give advice on these actions and formulate proposals for the orientations of international scientific research and cooperation programs. The advice given by the STC is founded on the principles and goals of the Initiative and coherent with the Sustainable Development Goals. This presentation will present the on-going work of the STC on the sustainable SOC sequestration indicators. The challenge is to identify easily utilizable indicators relative to SOC storage itself, but also to mitigation of GHG emissions, improved productivity and food security, better adaptation to climate change, but also relative to other impacts of SOC sequestration strategies (on water quality or land tenure for example) ...|$|E

40|$|Thank {{you for the}} {{opportunity}} to review and provide comments on the Draft 2020 <b>Action</b> <b>Agenda</b> for Puget Sound. This is a very comprehensive document with significant and achievable actions in each of the priority areas. Many of the priority areas identified in the Draft <b>Action</b> <b>Agenda</b> are of course priorities for Environment Canada and other agencies north of the border. Given that the Puget Sound and Georgia Basin share a common airshed, common watersheds, a common home for migratory birds and fish, and common urban growth pressures, we recognize the importance of continued transboundary collaboration in addressing our shared challenges. To this end, we are pleased to see that one of the actions under Priority D is to “work cooperatively with Canada on management and scientific investigations to increase collaborative problem solving and information sharing ” (D. 3. 8). A good example of this collaboration is the Joint Statement of Cooperation on the Georgia Basin and Puget Sound Ecosystem, signed in 2000 by Environment Canada and the US Environmental Protection Agency (Region 10). We are also encouraged by the efforts to engage other “partners ” (cities, state agencies, Puget Sound tribes, etc.) in implementing <b>Action</b> <b>Agenda</b> priorities and look forward to exploring opportunities to share information and lessons learned with agencies and groups on this side o...|$|R
