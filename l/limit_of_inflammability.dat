40|$|Abstract: Natural gas {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuels because of its high thermal efficiency and lower harmful emissions, including CO 2. Although the high octane value of natural gas increases engine output and efficiency due to the high compression ratio, this fuel is prone to such difficulties as a narrow <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflammability</b> and a slow combustion speed in the lean burn operation domain, leading to unstable combustion and higher emissions of harmful exhaust gases. Hydrogen blended with natural gas can extend the lean burn limit while maintaining stable, efficient combustion and achieving lower NOx, hydrocarbon and green house gas emissions. In this study, the effect of hydrogen addition on an engine performance and NOx emission characteristics was investigated in a heavy duty natural gas engine. The results showed that thermal efficiency was increased and NOx emissions were reduced due to the expansion of lean operation range under stable operation. NOx emission can be significantly reduced with the retard of spark advance timing...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{spontaneous}} acceleration of premixed flames propagating in open horizontal tubes with smooth walls is revisited. It is proved that in long tubes, this {{process can be}} considered quasi-steady, and an equation for the flame front position is derived using the on-shell description. Numerical solutions of this equation are found which show that {{as in the case}} of uniform flame movement, there are two essentially different regimes of flame propagation. In the type I regime, the flame speed and its acceleration are comparatively low, whereas the type II regime is characterized by significant flame acceleration that rapidly increases as the flame travels along the tube. A detailed comparison of the obtained results with the experimental data on flame acceleration in methane-air mixtures is given. In particular, it is confirmed that flames propagating in near-stoichiometric mixtures and mixtures near the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflammability</b> belong to the types II and I, respectively, whereas flames in transient mixtures undergo transitions between the two regimes during their travel.

40|$|Analytical {{treatment}} of premixed flame propagation in vertical tubes with smooth walls is given. Using the on-shell flame description, equations describing quasi-steady flame {{with a small}} but finite front thickness are obtained and solved numerically. It is found that near the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflammability,</b> solutions describing upward flame propagation come in pairs having close propagation speeds, and {{that the effect of}} gravity is to reverse the burnt gas velocity profile generated by the flame. On the basis of these results, a theory of partial flame propagation driven by the gravitational field is developed. A complete explanation is given of the intricate observed behavior <b>of</b> <b>limit</b> flames, including dependence <b>of</b> the <b>inflammability</b> range {{on the size of the}} combustion domain, the large distances of partial flame propagation, and the progression of flame extinction. The role of the finite front-thickness effects is discussed in detail. Also, various mechanisms governing flame acceleration in smooth tubes are identified. Acceleration of methane-air flames in open tubes is shown to be a combined effect of the hydrostatic pressure difference produced by the ambient cold air and the difference of dynamic gas pressure at the tube ends. On the other hand, a strong spontaneous acceleration of the fast methane-oxygen flames at the initial stage of their evolution in open-closed tubes is conditioned by metastability of the quasi-steady propagation regimes. An extensive comparison of the obtained results with the experimental data is made. Comment: 30 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMagnesium (Mg) and its alloys are now {{becoming}} the promising choice for various structural applications {{due to their}} low density and high specific strength compared with other light metals such as aluminum and its alloys. Among all Mg alloys, AZ (aluminum and zinc) series is {{the most widely used}} alloy system for various structural applications.

Particularly, alloys with considerable amount of secondary phase may exhibit different machining characteristics during metal cutting operations. In the present study, two AZ series alloys AZ 31 and AZ 91 were selected and drilling operation was performed to assess the effect of the secondary phase amount and distribution on machining characteristics. Drilling operation was carried out at different sets of process parameters and cutting forces were obtained and the chips which have been produced during drilling were analyzed. From the results, it can be clearly understood that the presence of secondary phase (Mg 17 Al 12) has a significant influence on cutting forces.

40|$|The {{idea behind}} the article is how to define fire behaviour. The work {{is based on an}} {{analytical}} study of fire origin, its development and spread. The study is based on thermodynamics, heat transfer and the study of hydrodynamics and combustion, which represent the bases of fire dynamics. The article shows a practical example of a leak of hazardous chemicals from a tank. Because <b>of</b> the <b>inflammability</b> <b>of</b> the fluid, fire may start. We have tried to model fire propagation around the Krško power plant, and show what extended surrounding area could be affected. The model also considers weather conditions, in particular wind speed and direction. For this purpose we have used the computer code Safer Trace, which is based on zone models. That means that phenomena are described by physical and empirical equations. An imperfection in this computer code is the inability to consider ground topology. However {{in the case of the}} Krško power plant, topology is not so important, as the plan is located in a relatively flat region. Mathematical models are presented. They show the propagation of hazardous fluid in the environment considering meteorological data. The work also shows which data are essential to define fire spread and shows the main considerations of Probabilistic Safety Assessment for external fire event. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{the study}} area, the {{occurrence}} of grass ignition is accidental and depends on man, but the area of fire spread is essentially determined by climatic parameters {{and the presence of}} inflammable material, i.e., dry grass. High March temperatures cause a rapid snowmelt and then a low sum of precipitation in April increases the <b>inflammability</b> <b>of</b> the abundant dry grasses on the former fields: the less the density of the tree layer, the higher the abundance of grass and the quantity of inflammable material. Similar results were obtained in studies on savanna–grassland communities in Africa and south-central Brazil: tree cover was found {{to be one of the}} main factors limiting fire there and the predominance of grassy fuel was the primary cause <b>of</b> the high <b>inflammability</b> <b>of</b> these communities (Archibald et al. 2009; Hoffmann et al. 2012; Baudena et al. 2015). A strong association of wildfire risk with an earlier spring snowmelt, and increasing spring and summer temperatures, was also shown for mid-elevation Northern Rockies forests (USA) (Westerling et al. 2006), where grassy inflammable material may be scarce, but the ignition process is similarly related to climatic parameters. Prichard et al. (2017) showed for several fire-prone ecosystems that fire odds are higher in places burnt before. For the Mediterranean region, Moreria et al. (2011) concluded that with increase of fire frequency, homogeneous landscapes covered by fire-prone vegetation are formed. Our results indirectly confirmed these findings: in our area, fire odds increased along the series A 12 -A 13 -A 14, and in that sequence also the area of burning and the frequency of fires increased; fire odds also increased with the extent of the patch size (log transformed) and the increase in the number of burnt patches in the surroundings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Lotus-type porous metals {{with long}} {{cylindrical}} pores aligned {{in one direction}} are fabricated by unidirectional solidification through thermal decomposition method (TDM). The pores are evolved from insoluble gas when the molten metal dissolving the gas is solidified. In the conventional pressurized gas method, hydrogen pressurized in a high-pressure chamber is used to dissolve hydrogen in the melt. However, the use of high-pressure hydrogen is not desirable because <b>of</b> its <b>inflammability</b> and explosive nature. This is particularly true when scaling up to mass production of lotus/Gasar metals. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the thermal decomposition method was developed. Gas-forming compounds such as hydrides were added into the molten metal to fabricate lotus/Gasar metals.
