40|$|This final {{project was}} made for the Broadband/Implementation {{department}} of TeliaSonera Finland. The question to be examined is if the operator should replace multiple ADSL connections implemented over a <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> with Multi-Dwelling <b>access</b> based on an Ethernet/Optical Fibre access network. The project starts with describing the technology related to these access network solu-tions and presents the technology that is used in TeliaSonera Finland's access network. It continues from the technology to describe the problem {{with some of the}} ADSL implemen-tations of TeliaSonera. The problem is the implementations done over a <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> that can cost TeliaSonera over years as much as a possible investment to extend network when there is several <b>lines</b> <b>leased</b> to the same building. The project proposes a Multi-Dwelling access as a solution to this problem and defines the circumstances when to use it. After a satisfactory solution has found the project takes a view how implementation of the solution might alter the network and a new problem is found. When used commonly to replace need of ADSL implementation Multi-Dwelling access would significantly increase optical cable congestion near operators POP. As a final deed this project also proposes a technical change to existing way to implement multi-dwelling access with EPON technology...|$|R

50|$|<b>Leased</b> <b>lines</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} than alternative connectivity services including (ADSL, SDSL, etc.) because they are reserved exclusively to the leaseholder. Some internet service providers have therefore developed alternative products that aim to deliver leased-line type services (Carrier Ethernet-based, zero contention, guaranteed availability), with more moderate bandwidth, over the standard UK national broadband network. While a <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> is full-duplex, most <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> alternatives provide only half-duplex or in many cases asymmetrical service.|$|R

50|$|ATMs {{typically}} connect {{directly to}} their host or ATM Controller on either ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or directly on a <b>leased</b> <b>line.</b> <b>Leased</b> <b>lines</b> are preferable to {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) lines because they require {{less time to}} establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a <b>leased</b> <b>line,</b> since a <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet VPN connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include SNA over SDLC, TC500 over Async, X.25, and TCP/IP over Ethernet.|$|R

50|$|An Internet <b>leased</b> <b>line</b> is {{a premium}} {{internet}} connectivity product, normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical speeds with full duplex. It {{is also known}} as an ethernet <b>leased</b> <b>line,</b> dedicated line, data circuit or private line. For example, a T1 can be leased and provides a maximum transmission speed of 1.544 Mbit/s. The user can channelize the T1 to separate the 24 DS0 circuits for voice communication, partial the T1 for data and voice communications, or multiplex the channels into a single data circuit. <b>Leased</b> <b>lines,</b> as opposed to DSL, are being used by companies and individuals for Internet access because they afford faster data transfer rates and are cost-effective for heavy users of the Internet.|$|R

40|$|Security {{decisions}} {{are based on}} a number of foundational assumptions. The effectiveness of any decision depends on the soundness of the underlying assumptions. To ensure that security is adequate and will work, these assumptions need to be examined. Any time we hear that "A" is secure (or insecure) because of "B", we need to ask some questions. Why that is true? How do we know? What do we know about "B" that makes "A" secure or not? This questioning must be done without bias and without assuming that the conclusion is known in advance. One assumption frequently heard is that a wide area network (WAN) is secure because its sites are linked using dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> Many people believe that these lines are inherently secure. Some providers of these lines certainly advertise them as secure. It is unsound to assume without question that dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> are secure. This paper examines the properties of <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and the reality about their security. The main focus is the risk of loss of secrecy of information transmitted on dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines.</b> (The discussion of other aspects of security of dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the analysis and risk-mitigation related to loss of service, will be left to others.) This paper reviews the evolution of dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>lines</b> and discusses how this influences their security. It examines the decisions made by telephone companies in response to competitive pressures and how these decisions may impact security. The examples here are commonly used point-to-point services with DS 1 and DS 3 lines (T 1 and T 3). Not discussed is the security of the end-points, which is essentially the same irrespective of the line type.
