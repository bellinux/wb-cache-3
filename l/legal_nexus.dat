This book, in particular, is a Research Handbook on Human Rights and the Environment and such a title announces a particular aim. The title ‘research handbook’ implies a kind of authoritative overview – {{a certain degree of}} expert epistemic stability and validity. The term ‘frames’ the contribution of the book in a particular way: surely, a reader might think a ‘research handbook’ provides a relatively comprehensive and thoroughgoing initiation into a body of well-accepted, soundly constructed knowledge, covered by experts in its field. It might be comforting to think so – and certainly, many of the contributors to this handbook are world-leaders in the general field of ‘human rights’, and specifically, in the field of the deeply troubled, increasingly important <b>legal</b> <b>nexus</b> between ‘human rights’ and the ‘environment’ – yet matters are not nearly so stable as the term ‘handbook’ implies. For a start, even the term ‘human rights’ (so central to our subject matter) is fraught with ambiguities – as this handbook fully suggests...|$|E
40|$|A THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY. Oil and gas {{exploitation}} and production in Nigeria, {{particularly in the}} Niger Delta region, is awash with pollution incidents with its attendant impact {{on the health of}} locals as well as foreseeable damage on the biodiversity of the region. Owing to this development, victims of environmental pollution have repeatedly instituted legal actions against transnational corporations (TNCs) and the Federal Government with a view to recovering damages and enforcing rights via statutory claims (which basically reflects traditional English common law rules on liability). Notwithstanding, it is observed that such claims have not availed victims of pollution with the basic reliefs sought, and this is seemingly traceable to the ‘economic interest’ which government retains in oil and gas activities, the technicalities in proving negligence on the part of TNCs; as a vast majority of oil pollution incidents are caused by ‘acts of third parties’, and under such scenarios, TNCs will only be liable where they neglect to protect oil facilities, and the lack of direct legal provisions to provide for fundamental rights to a clean environment, although even before Nigeria attained her independence in 1960 the Oil Pipelines Act of 1955 addressed some oil-related environmental problems. These challenges, amongst others have prompted victims of environmental pollution in Nigeria, in recent years, to seek for legal redress in foreign jurisdictions. The current research opted for turnaround in the environmental justice system by considering whether there is any <b>legal</b> <b>nexus</b> between environmental pollution and breach of fundamental rights (‘rights to a healthy environment’) of the people, and whether such right will generate an absolute liability against TNCs? It is recognised that ‘fundamental rights’ which are found in the Nigerian Constitution have higher status over other rights as contained in statutes, and where these rights are violated, liability will be either strict or absolute as the case may be; this is pursuant to findings in the current research that the defence of ‘act of third parties’ and others may not be sustained in fundamental rights enforcement proceedings, and owing to this, victims of environmental pollution incidents in Nigeria {{will be able to get}} adequate redress and secure higher standards of environmental quality. This conclusion is reached through a close examination of legal instruments, case-law and opinions of experts in Nigeria and a limited number of other jurisdictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the thesis are – (a) to identify the problems in water-energy-food nexus from ICT and Law {{point of view and}} to propose theoretically a legal knowledge framework for water-energy-food nexus in order to reduce those problems technologically, (b) to construct and implement <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus</b> extracted from EU water, energy and food Regulations in OWL 2 language, which {{is a part of the}} grater work of implementing legal knowledge framework for water-energy-food nexus proposed through the compilation of objective (a). Considering these objectives, this thesis presents total five chapters. First chapter investigates current start of art of nexus in order to identify (1) major knowledge gaps in the nexus and (2) ontological existence of the nexus in the EU regulations, particularly in the legal definitions accommodated in EU Regulations and Directives associated with nexus domains. It also rationalizes the need for <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus.</b> Second chapter evaluates existing perspectives and methodologies available for constructing legal ontology. The purpose of such evaluation was to select correct perspective and methodology for constructing <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus.</b> It, at the end, justifies the need for developing new methodology for constructing the <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus.</b> Third chapter explains the methodology used for engineering legal definitional knowledge extracted from the selected EU regulations in order to construct the <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus.</b> Fourth chapter explains in detail the <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus</b> while fifth chapter evaluates <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus.</b> In addition, conclusion of the thesis shares critical issues faced throughout this doctoral thesis work. Furthermore, annexes contain a list of all formulas of restrictions implemented in <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus</b> and links of all modules of <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus.</b> LODE documentation of the <b>legal</b> ontology for <b>nexus</b> is available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The higher {{education}} system in Europe is currently under stress and the debates over its reform and future are gaining momentum. Now that, for most countries, {{we are in}} a time for change, in the overall society and the whole education system, the legal and political dimensions have gained prominence, which has not been followed by a more integrative approach of the problem of order, its reform and the issue of regulation, beyond the typical static and classical cost-benefit analyses. The two classical approaches for studying (and for designing the policy measures of) the problem of the reform of the {{higher education}} system - the cost-benefit analysis and the legal scholarship description - have to be integrated. This is the argument of our paper that the very integration of economic and legal approaches, what Warren Samuels called the legal-economic nexus, is meaningful and necessary, especially if we want {{to address the problem of}} order (as formulated by Joseph Spengler) and the overall regulation of the system. On the one hand, and without neglecting the interest and insights gained from the cost-benefit analysis, or other approaches of value for money assessment, we will focus our study on the legal, social and political aspects of the regulation of the higher education system and its reform in Portugal. On the other hand, the economic and financial problems have to be taken into account, but in a more inclusive way with regard to the indirect and other socio-economic costs not contemplated in traditional or standard assessments of policies for the tertiary education sector. In the first section of the paper, we will discuss the theoretical and conceptual underpinning of our analysis, focusing on the evolutionary approach, the role of critical institutions, the legal-economic nexus and the problem of order. All these elements are related to the institutional tradition, from Veblen and Commons to Spengler and Samuels. The second section states the problem of regulation in the higher education system and the issue of policy formulation for tackling the problem. The current situation is clearly one of crisis with the expansion of the cohorts of young students coming to an end and the recurrent scandals in private institutions. In the last decade, after a protracted period of extension or expansion of the system, i. e., the continuous growth of students, universities and other institutions are competing harder to gain students and have seen their financial situation at risk. It seems that we are entering a period of radical uncertainty, higher competition and a new configuration that is slowly building up is the growth in intensity, which means upgrading the quality of the higher learning and getting more involvement in vocational training and life-long learning. With this change, and along with other deep ones in the Portuguese society and economy, the current regulation has shown signs of maladjustment. The third section consists of our conclusions on the current issue of regulation and policy challenge. First, we underline the importance of an evolutionary approach to a process of change that is essentially dynamic. A special attention will be given to the issues related to an evolutionary construe of policy analysis and formulation. Second, the integration of law and economics, through the notion of <b>legal</b> economic <b>nexus,</b> allows us to better define the issues of regulation and the concrete problems that the universities are facing. One aspect is the instability of the political measures regarding the public administration and on which the higher education system depends financially, legally and institutionally, to say the least. A corollary is the lack of clear strategy in the policy reforms. Third, our research criticizes several studies, such as the one made by the OECD in late 2006 for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education, for being too static and neglecting fundamental aspects of regulation such as the logic of actors, groups and organizations who are major players in the system. Finally, simply changing the legal rules will not necessary per se change the behaviors that the authorities want to change. By this, we mean that it is not only remiss of the policy maker to ignore some of the critical issues of regulation, namely the continuous non-respect by academic management and administrative bodies of universities of the legal rules that were once promulgated. Changing the rules does not change the problem, especially without the necessary debates form the different relevant quarters that make up the higher education system. The issues of social interaction remain as intact. Our treatment of the matter will be organized in the following way. In the first section, the theoretical principles are developed in order to be able to study more adequately the higher education transformation with a modest evolutionary theory and a <b>legal</b> and economic <b>nexus</b> of the interactions of the system and the policy challenges. After describing, in the second section, the recent evolution and current working of the higher education in Portugal, we will analyze the legal framework and the current regulatory practices and problems in light of the theoretical framework adopted. We will end with some conclusions on the current problems of regulation and the policy measures that are discusses in recent years...|$|R
