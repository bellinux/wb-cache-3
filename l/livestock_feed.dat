Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of <b>livestock</b> <b>feed</b> in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, the English Cart Horse Society was formed, and in 1884 {{changed its}} name to the Shire Horse Society. The Society {{published}} a stud book, with the first edition in 1878 containing 2,381 stallions and records dating back to 1770. Between 1901 and 1914, 5,000 Shires were registered each year with the society. The first Shires were imported to the United States in 1853, with large numbers of horses being imported in the 1880s. The American Shire Horse Association was established in 1885 to register and promote the breed. The Shire soon became popular in the United States, and almost 4,000 Shires were imported between 1900 and 1918. Approximately 6,700 Shires were registered with the US association between 1909 and 1911. Around the time of Second World War, increasing mechanisation and strict regulations on the purchase of <b>livestock</b> <b>feed</b> reduced the need for and ability to keep draught horses. Thousands of Shires were slaughtered and several large breeding studs closed. The breed fell to its lowest point in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1955 fewer than 100 horses were shown at the annual British Spring Show.|$|E

Using profits from his early business ventures, he purchased a business wardrobe that earned him the title of best dressed member of his senior class. He graduated from high school in 1959, but the poor curriculum there left him without the credits he needed to gain admission to the University of Kentucky's engineering program. He began selling <b>livestock</b> <b>feed</b> in Scottsville, Kentucky, and also worked at a venetian blind factory while taking classes at Campbellsville College to earn the credits he needed. In 1962, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and enrolled at the University of Kentucky. While in college, he worked at Kennedy Book Store in Lexington. Later, he and two friends borrowed money to open the Kentucky Paperback Gallery in Lexington; Wilkinson left school later that year to attend to the business full-time. At the time, Kentucky high school students were required to purchase their own textbooks, but there was no marketplace for buying and selling used books; Wilkinson's business catered to this market and was highly successful.|$|E

However, some corvids, especially the crows, have adapted well to human conditions and {{have come to}} rely on anthropogenic foods. In a US study of American crows, common ravens and Steller's jays around campgrounds and human settlements, the crows appeared to have the most diverse diet of all, taking anthropogenic foods such as bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and <b>livestock</b> <b>feed.</b> The increase in available anthropogenic food sources is contributing to population increase in some corvid species.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of animal production vary with the method of production. A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pest problems with less pesticides through rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a desertification process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than {{the same kind of}} soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans. Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, <b>livestock</b> <b>feed,</b> or some combination of these.|$|E
25|$|A major use of {{formic acid}} is as a {{preservative}} and antibacterial agent in <b>livestock</b> <b>feed.</b> In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) {{to promote the}} fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value. Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer, {{and so it is}} widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle. In the poultry industry, it is sometimes added to feed to kill E. coli bacteria. Use as preservative for silage and (other) animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.|$|E

40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the magnitude of the}} effects of <b>livestock</b> <b>feeding</b> operations on residential property values, we constructed a new dataset that merges data on home sales with data on the location and size of <b>livestock</b> <b>feeding</b> operations in five rural counties of Iowa. We estimated a hedonic model to explain variations in residential sales price with standard house attributes, such as number of bedrooms and square feet of living space, as well as the effects of distance and density of <b>livestock</b> <b>feeding</b> operation. We find that livestock operations have an overall statistically significant effect on property values. Predicted negative effects are largest for properties that are downwind and close to livestock operations. In addition, feeding operations that are moderate in size have more impact than do large-scale operations, most likely reflecting age, type, and management practices of the moderate-sized operations. The limited size of the estimated effects suggest that common sense rulesâ€”such as not locating feeding operations close to and upwind of residencesâ€”combined with modest compensatory payments could help rural residences co-exist with modern feeding operations. hedonic model, livestock, property values. ...|$|R
