Under consideration were eliminating the [...] "Omnibox" [...] URL bar and combining the two <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> which has tabs on one line and navigation buttons, menu and URL bar {{on a second}} line into one single line, thus freeing up more screen space for content. (Such a layout was later adopted by Internet Explorer 9.) Chang acknowledged that this would result in URLs not always being visible to the user, that navigation controls and menus may lose their context and that the resulting single line could be quite crowded. Other proposed changes include being able to log into multiple accounts in different windows and improved URL suggestions from the user's history. By the middle of 2011, after some experimentation, the developers decided that eliminating the URL bar was too risky and shelved the idea.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{customization}} production {{increases the}} difficulty of the production <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> planning. The material distribution process for variety of parts is very complex, which greatly increases the cost of material handling and logistics. In response to this problem, this paper presents an approach of production <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> planning based on complexity measurement. Firstly, by analyzing the influencing factors of equipment layout, the complexity model of production line is established by using information entropy theory. Then, the cost of the part logistics is derived considering different variety of parts. Furthermore, the function of optimization including two objectives of the lowest cost, and the least configuration complexity is built. Finally, the validity of the function is verified in a case study. The results show that the proposed approach may find the layout scheme with the lowest logistics cost and the least complexity. Optimized production <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> planning can effectively improve production efficiency and equipment utilization with lowest cost and complexity...|$|E
