They {{spent most of the}} first two weeks concealed in a house on the floor of their cage. As they adapted, they spent less time hid-ing and more time higher in the cage. The cats were inactive for approximately 90 per cent of the time observed, and they received little human contact. Compared with the first day, the cats ' cortisol to creatinine ratios were significantly lower from their second month in quarantine. THE issues of rabies and quarantine have been widely debated in recent years. In 1994, the Agriculture Select Committee of Her Majesty's Government produced a report which called for major changes in the quarantine regulations. The rabies working group of the BVA published its report on rabies and quarantine in July 1997, and in October 1997 the Minister for Agriculture announced a review of Britain's rabies control arrangements. Attention has been directed primarily towards import controls, identification and vaccination of animals. Concerns have also been expressed about the standards of quarantine premises, and the effects of quarantine on the welfare of animals and on the rela-tionship between pets and their owners (British Medica...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Combined {{effects of}} temperature, {{relative}} humidity and litter pH {{in the presence}} or absence of organic matter on the survival of S. typhimurium over time was studied. The litter (L: 30 cm x W: 25 cm x D: 6 cm aluminum trays filled with wood shavings) was inoculated with S. typhimurium at initial concentration of 4. 8 x 10 CFU/ml, then <b>litter</b> <b>trays</b> were placed in a room with microclimate similar to that of a naturally 7 ventilated poultry house. The periodical measurement of S. typhimurium population in poultry litter in relation to the ambient environmental conditions revealed that: in the absence of organic matter; there was a non-significant (p< 0. 99) negative correlation (- 0. 07 at confidence level 95 %) between ambient temperature and survival of S. typhimurium, a non-significant (p< 0. 53) positive correlation (+ 0. 04 at confidence level 95 %) between relative humidity and survival of S. typhimurium population and a highly significant (p< 0. 005) positive correlation (+ 0. 67 at confidence level 95 %) between litter pH and survival.

50|$|Grooming is {{a natural}} {{behavior}} for cats. Cats spend 5%-25% of their waking hours grooming. Grooming becomes excessive when it takes precedence over other activities or no longer seems functional. Excessive grooming, {{which can lead to}} hair loss, skin wounds, and ulceration, can result from chronic stress or develop in cats who already exhibit nervous temperaments. Even when the source of stress is resolved or removed, excessive grooming may continue. There may be some genetic basis for the behavior, and it predominantly affects purebred cats of oriental breeds, but can develop in any feline. Female cats appear more susceptible. Environmental factors suspected of causing over grooming include flea allergy, boredom, food allergy, dust or pollen causing an allergic reaction, constipation and/or urinary tract infection caused by avoidance of a dirty <b>litter</b> <b>tray,</b> dermatitis, anxiety caused by inconsistent meal times. Deprivation of sunlight could be the part of the problem for indoors only cats.|$|R
50|$|Feral kittens {{around two}} to seven weeks old can be socialized usually {{within a month}} of capture. This period of time is the kitten’s {{socialization}} period {{and is the only}} time a cat can socialize with humans. Some species of cats cannot be socialized towards humans because of things like genetic influence and in some cases specific learning experiences. The best way to get a kitten to socialize with you is to handle the kitten for about 5 hours a week according to some studies. The process is made easier if there is another socialized cat present but not necessarily in the same space as the feral. If the handler can get a cat to urinate in the <b>litter</b> <b>tray,</b> then the others in a litter will usually follow. Initial contact with thick gloves is highly recommended until trust is established, usually within the first week. It is a challenge to socialize an adult. Socialized adult feral cats tend to trust only those who they trusted in their socialization period, and therefore can be very fearful around strangers.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative reconstructions of {{terrestrial}} climate are highly sought after but rare, particularly in Australia. Carbon isotope discrimination in plant leaves (Δleaf) is an established indicator of past hydroclimate because the fractionation of carbon isotopes during photosynthesis is {{strongly influenced by}} water stress. Leaves of the evergreen tree Melaleuca quinquenervia have been recovered from the sediments of some perched lakes on North Stradbroke and Fraser Islands, south-east Queensland, eastern Australia. Here, we examine the potential for using M. quinquenervia ∆leaf as a tracer of past rainfall by analysing carbon isotope ratios (δ 13 C) of modern leaves. We firstly assess Δleaf variation at the leaf and stand scale and find no systematic pattern within leaves or between leaves due to their position on the tree. We then examine the relationships between climate and Δleaf for a 11 -year time series of leaves collected in a <b>litter</b> <b>tray.</b> M. quinquenervia retains its leaves for 1 – 4 years; thus, cumulative average climate data are used. There is {{a significant relationship between}} annual mean ∆leaf and mean annual rainfall of the hydrological year for 1 – 4 years (i. e. 365 – 1460 days) prior to leaf fall (r 2 = 0. 64, P = 0. 003, n = 11). This relationship is marginally improved by accounting for the effect of pCO 2 on discrimination (r 2 = 0. 67, P = 0. 002, n = 11). The correlation between rainfall and Δleaf, and the natural distribution of Melaleuca quinquenervia around wetlands of eastern Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia offers significant potential to infer past rainfall {{on a wide range of}} spatial and temporal scales...|$|R

40|$|A 7 -month-old, entire female, {{domestic}} shorthair cat {{was referred to}} our behavioural service owing to soiling {{in the house and}} a play-related problem. The owners’ complaints were that the cat had never used the <b>litter</b> <b>tray,</b> and it {{did not know how to}} play. After reviewing the behavioural history, a problem of substrate preferences acquisition was suspected with regard to the elimination problem. During the consultation, the physical examination was unremarkable, but the neurological examination revealed a moderate and hypermetric ataxic gait, and a bilateral lack of menace response. Some degree of visual impairment was suspected. The problem was located in the central nervous system (CNS); specifically, an intracranial and multifocal problem was diagnosed. After a complete work-up (complete ophthalmological examination, complete blood count and a complete biochemistry panel, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus test, thorax radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, brain magnetic resonance imaging [0. 2 T], cerebrospinal fluid analysis and a urinary metabolic screen test), a degenerative CNS problem was suspected. No treatment was prescribed for the neurological problem. Regarding the problem of soiling in the house, reward-based training with a clicker was used, and the cat partially improved in a few weeks. Three months later, the cat was referred to the neurology service in status epilepticus. A symptomatic treatment was prescribed, with a mild response. After 2 years of treatment and a progressive worsening, the cat was euthanased. Necropsy revealed spongiform polioencephalomyelopathy. In order to rule out prion aetiology a PrPsc inmunohistochemistry assay was performed, and the results were negative. Congenital spongiform polioencephalomyelopathy (CSP) was diagnosed. We strongly suggest that the cat’s behavioural clinical signs were caused by the CSP, causing learning impairment. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first case in which a congenital degenerative disease affected a cat’s capability to learn, leading to behavioural signs as the main complaint of the owners, even before neurological signs are detected by the owners...|$|R

40|$|The welfare {{assessment}} of owned pet cats has been neglected in research. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess owners' perception and recognition of impaired welfare in their own cats. One hundred ninety-four cat owners were interviewed face-to-face by a veterinary behaviorist, completing a 42 -item questionnaire. Most owners (71. 1 %/N = 138) correctly included both physical and psychological features within their definition of stress, but 9. 8 % (19) thought that stress had no consequences for the cat. When asked to rate the overall stress level of their own cats in a nonnumerical scale based on frequency, 56. 7 % (N = 110) chose low, 38. 1 % (N = 74) chose medium, and 5. 2 % (N = 10) chose high. Owners whose cats played little or not at all were more likely to rate the level of stress of their cats as high (90. 0 %) than to rate it as low or medium (33. 2 %/ 64; χ 2 = 13. 290; P < 0. 001). Similarly, owners whose cats showed overgrooming were more likely to rate the level of stress of their cats as high (30. 0 %/ 58 vs. 7. 6 %/ 15; χ 2 = 4. 948; P = 0. 015). The display of aggression or house soiling was not associated with the owner's rating of stress level. The number of signs recognized by respondents as potential indicators of stress in cats and the rating of the level of stress in their own cats were weakly correlated (ρ = 0. 217; P = 0. 002). This may be due to possible biases in the interviews as well as to an overall good welfare in the cat sample associated to a moderately good understanding of feline signs of stress in owners. A principal components analysis applied to the listed signs of stress identified 4 components which were termed: body posture, social avoidance, house soiling, and self-directed behavior. However, some of the signs that behaviorists regard as crucial in their anamnesis, such as scratching the furniture, freezing, mydriasis, and recurrent cystitis, were the least recognized signs of stress by cat owners. Only very prominent, common, or potentially disturbing behaviors such as excessive vocalization, posture with the ears back, and urinating out of the <b>litter</b> <b>tray</b> were regarded as potential signs of stress by more than two-thirds of owners. These findings suggest that owners tend to overlook certain signs and that owners' perception of stress partially depends on their false preconceptions about cat normal ethology (e. g., playfulness, social relationships, aggression, etc.). This ill-informed perception is likely to prevent owners from correctly indentifying, and intervening in, situations of poor welfare...|$|R

40|$|Job {{losses and}} {{organisational}} restructuring at Fairfax continue {{to transform the}} landscape of Australian media It’s clear that newspapers in their traditional form are approaching a point of no return, as news consumption habits are changing for good. It’s {{all too easy to}} blame (or praise) the internet for this transformation of the media landscape; the simple fact is that it now plays an important role as a medium through which news is accessed and shared by the general public. One side effect of this shift is that traditional metrics for tracking the market share and influence of media companies no longer provide the full picture. Newspaper circulation figures are no longer a relevant or reliable metric (if they ever were). But what measures of importance are really available to us in the online space? Particularly when news is now distributed across a variety of platforms from aggregators like Google News and Flipboard to social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter? Indeed, how do we understand “importance” in this context – is it important for a website simply to attract visitors, or should we also take into account how those visitors react to what they encounter, for example by sharing links to the content through their own social networks? New measures Only a very limited amount of independently verified information is available on how Australian news websites perform in this context; what internal click-through data they may gather is rarely available to the general public. To add to the mix, and to generate a reliable, comparative index of the resonance for the major Australian online news and commentary sites, my colleagues and I at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation at Queensland University of Technology have developed a tool which tracks the circulation of links to these sites on the social media platform Twitter. Day by day, we track all tweets which contain links to any of the country’s leading national and regional news sites, {{as well as to the}} various opinion and commentary sites such as Crikey and The Conversation; we capture those tweets even if the original link has been converted into a short URL (using bit. ly, t. co, or any other shortening service). The only tweets we are unable to capture at this point are “button” retweets, but we do track “manual” retweets (e. g. “RT @user …”), which serve as a reasonable basis for extrapolation. Counting these links for each of the sites is a measure half-way between newspaper circulation figures and TV ratings: link circulation figures on Twitter don’t simply indicate the size of these sites 2 ̆ 7 audiences (as paper circulations do), but also point to readers 2 ̆ 7 levels of engagement with the content they encounter (as TV ratings can). It’s one thing to read a story on a news Website – it’s another to go to the trouble of sharing it with your social media followers. A measure of engagement As with print circulations and TV ratings, though, there remains room for interpretation here, too: what users share and what they read may diverge to some extent. As a professional on Twitter, for example, I may not want to let my followers know about all the sports news I read; conversely, I may pass on links to stories which I haven’t read fully (or at all) myself, just because they sound interesting. But such margin of error exists in most ratings systems – the newspaper we buy to put under the cat’s <b>litter</b> <b>tray</b> still adds to The Sunday Mail’s circulation figures; the TV running while we make dinner still adds to the ratings for ABC News. What’s unique about our Twitter news circulation index, though, is that it’s neither based on simple sales figures (like print circulations), nor on an extrapolation from the media consumption patterns of a small number of more or less representative households (like ratings). Rather, apart from “button” retweets, we capture all tweets that contain links to Australian news and opinion sites – that is, we track active, visible, deliberate engagement with Australian news content. 18 - 25 June 2012 The first weeks of this Australian Twitter News Index (ATNIX) were momentous for the Australian media industry, of course; Fairfax announced some major job cuts, and News Ltd revealed plans to follow suit. This may well have boosted the circulation of links to Australian news sites on Twitter – and especially perhaps to Fairfax properties themselves. Over the course of the week from 18 to 25 June, we captured some 150, 000 tweets: ATNIX week 25 / 2012 – news sites CCI; [URL] In a week of bad news for Fairfax, that’s a very strong result for its two major sites, the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

In experiment II; MIC use-dilution test was used to evaluate the five disinfectants against S. typhimurium (~ 107 CFU mL - 1) in the absence of organic matter. Results: Hourly samples were collected for the bacterial counts. Maximum efficacy (100 % killing efficacy against S. typhimurium) was achieved for Green Work after 16 h (p&# 8804; 0. 0001), with Sanidate RTU after 8 h (p&# 8804; 0. 0001), with Hi-yield ® Consan ® and Kreso ® D after 2 h at (p&# 8804; 0. 0001) and with Tektrol ® after 4 h (p&# 8804; 0. 0001). In presence of organic matter Green work and Sanidate RTUachieved 100 % killing efficacy against S. typhimurium after 16 h (p&# 8804; 0. 0001), Hi-yield ® Consan ® and Kreso ® D after 2 h at (p&# 8804; 0. 0001); Tektrol ® after 8 h (p&# 8804; 0. 0001). When disinfectants were compared to each other in relation to time; we found that there was no kind of significance between their efficacies. When compared to other tested disinfectants, Kreso ® D which is a phenolic compound revealed superior activity against Salmonella typhimurium in the two experiments. Conclusion: The study showed that many disinfectants regardless to their constituents continues to give a very powerful efficacy against the most virulent bacterial strains, but the question remain can they be used in the presence of live birds. Further studies are required to explore the safety and the efficacy of these compounds when applied in poultry farms in the presence of live birds. </font...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether the {{provision}} of small amounts of peat to piglets would influence behaviour and production. At approximately 5 days of age, nine <b>litters</b> received a <b>tray</b> of peat as enrichment, while nine others did not. All piglets had access to solid feed, which was used to compare substrate-directed behaviour. Piglets were weaned at week 4, and half of the pens in the nursery again received peat. The other half did not. This resulted in the following experimental design: peat/peat (PP), peat/no peat (PN), no peat/peat (NP) and no peat/no peat (NN). Each pen was observed for 4 × 1 min in the morning and also in the afternoon. During every minute the behaviour of each piglet was recorded continuously. The main behavioural categories were: foraging, exploration, playing, locomotion, resting, sleeping, biting and fighting. At 9 weeks of age the pigs were moved to the fattening unit, where no peat was provided. However, observations continued until the pigs reached slaughter age, i. e. until about week 24. Production results (weight, weight gain) and skin lesions were recorded from start to end. Piglets with access to peat performed foraging behaviour significantly more often than piglets without peat (P < 0. 0001). After weaning, the results suggested a greater influence of present enrichment than previous experience in the farrowing pen. NP and PP piglets showed significantly less manipulation of pen mates (P < 0. 005), less fighting (P < 0. 001) and less inactivity (P < 0. 0001). No effect on fighting or manipulation of pen mates was found in the fattening phase. Sleeping was observed more in the NP and PP groups (P < 0. 05). Lying was seen less in the NN group than in the other treatment groups (P < 0. 0001). No treatment effect was found on the frequency and severity of skin lesions. Weaning weight of P piglets did not differ from that of the control piglets (N). At the end of the weaning phase, PP piglets had a higher weight than NN piglets (P < 0. 05). PP piglets also had a higher weight gain during weaning than NN and NP piglets (P < 0. 05). The results suggest that providing small amounts of peat to suckling and weaner pigs could be an effective enrichment strategy to increase explorative behaviour and possibly reduce aggression time post weaning. It also had a beneficial effect on weight and weight gain of piglets. The removal of the peat during fattening led to more inactive behaviour, and differences in aggressive behaviour were no longer significant. Hence, a long term effect of peat supply was not observed. status: publishe...|$|R
