50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (<b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat)</b> and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|E
50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam. The <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster <b>spring</b> <b>seating</b> is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> beam.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> sits on the washers. The <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle box guide. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide works as a piston in the <b>Lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the <b>Lower</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>seat</b> and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement of the Axle box guide puts pressure on the oil in the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|E

50|$|The coaches {{come to the}} {{workshop}} once in a year. During examination of these coaches, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers have not only damaged the axle box housing but also the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{as well as the}} Protective tube.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the axle box guide has a guide cap with {{perforations}} so that during the downward movement of the axle guide in the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> the oil in the dashpot rushes in the axle box guide. This provides the dampening of vibration in a running coach.|$|E
50|$|A look at {{the drawing}} of the dashpot {{arrangement}} will suggest that this problem is universal for all the coaches, whether a new coach or an old coach.

50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of Axle box housing increased. The reason was the axle box wing cracks.

50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the wheel tread. Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels. This diameter is also not sacrosanct and is changed depending upon the supply position of the wheels. The maximum variation in the wheels on the same axle is permitted up to 0.5 mm, between two wheels of the same bogie up to 5 mm and among the four wheel sets of the same coach up to 13 mm. The diameter of a new wheel is 915 mm. Hence maximum wheel tread wear allowed is (915 mm - 819mm) = 96 mm. In order to adjust for {{the difference in the}} wheel tread, a packing is placed under the flange of the <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> This packing ring is generally made up of NFTC(Natural Fiber Thermosetting COMPOSITE) or UHMWPE (Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) material. The thickness of the NFTC packing ring is equal to 50% of the difference between the dia of a new wheel and the wheel in question.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{operating}} conditions of “side-load” springs, which are typically employed in McPherson suspensions, were analysed by finite element analysis. The finite element model, including {{the spring and}} {{the upper and lower}} spring seats, is firstly described in the paper; the spring geometry was accurately obtained by a reverse engineering procedure based on two video cameras and a video projector. Surface to surface contact elements were defined between spring and seats; the initial assembling phase of the spring between the seats was also included in the finite element analysis. The experimental rig, employed for spring characterisation, and the performed numerical analyses are then presented; results are discussed in comparison with experimental data, in terms of spring characteristic, side-load force and thrust axis spatial position, as a function of spring compression. A fully satisfactory agreement was generally observed between numerical results and experiments. The effect of <b>lower</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> orientation on results was also investigated by numerical analysis. A higher inclination of the lower seat appeared to increase the side-load force; at the same time, for a given configuration, the thrust axis orientation, remained almost constant during suspension compression...|$|E

30|$|After {{assembly}} of the bogie, {{the upper end of}} the lever-type damper fits closely with one side of the bolster. In application, the lever-type damper rotates by a slight angle around the pivot because of irregularities in the track, and thus only requires a small space for installation. In practice, cracks in the side frame mainly occur on the top of the side frame pedestal and the brake chutes [18]. The lever-type damper is located on the side-frame <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> which, whilst it would slightly decrease the static strength of the <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> would not significantly weaken the fatigue strength of the side frame.|$|R
