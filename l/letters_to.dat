5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with <b>letters)</b> <b>to</b> Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah.|$|E

5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of <b>Letters</b> <b>to</b> William Pitt and <b>Letters</b> <b>to</b> Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus now sent <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> the Senate denouncing Elagabalus as the False Antoninus and {{claiming}} he was insane. Both consuls and other high-ranking members of Rome's leadership condemned Elagabalus, and the Senate subsequently {{declared war on}} both Elagabalus and Julia Maesa.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> the monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered {{with his own}} <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.|$|E
