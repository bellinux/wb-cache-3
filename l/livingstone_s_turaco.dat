40|$|In Europe, {{the number}} of {{reported}} sporadic human cases of Salmonella Livingstone infection is low, and outbreaks are rare. We report the largest <b>S.</b> <b>Livingstone</b> outbreak described in the literature having an identified source of infection. In February 2001, an increased incidence of infection caused by <b>S.</b> <b>Livingstone</b> was observed in Norway and Sweden. By July 2001, 44 cases were notified in Norway and 16 in Sweden. The median age was 63 years, and 40 were women. There were three deaths, and 22 patients were hospitalized. Based on standardized questionnaires and retrospective studies of <b>S.</b> <b>Livingstone</b> strains in Norway and Sweden, food items with egg powder were suspected, and <b>S.</b> <b>Livingstone</b> was subsequently recovered from a processed fish product at the retail level.
