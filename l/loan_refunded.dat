50|$|As of 2011, no U.S. federal {{consumer}} protection law specifically addresses rent-to-own transactions, but through litigation, {{efforts have been}} made in attempt to bring rent-to-own agreements under the definition of “credit sale” in the Truth in Lending Act. However, courts have not, as of 2011, ruled in favor of making this change at a federal level. In 2006, the United States Department of Defense labeled rent-to-own a predatory lending practice, defining it as an “unfair or abusive loan or credit sale transaction or collection practice,” along with payday <b>loans,</b> title <b>loans,</b> <b>refund</b> anticipation <b>loans</b> and other similar practices. In 2007, the United States Government Accountability Office raised concerns with the methodology and structure of this research. Later in the same year, the Department of Defense ultimately concluded that rent-to-own was not a form of credit and excluded it from its regulation on predatory lending practices.|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{protection}} in financial services has failed.

Consumer protection was a traditional element of states 2 ̆ 7 regulatory power until federal preemption ousted states from almost all direct regulation of federally chartered banks without substituting equivalent protections and enforcement. This Article argues that one avenue may remain to permit states to engage in consumer-protection regulation of federally chartered banks. Recent changes in financial markets have placed the majority of consumer debt {{in the hands of}} secondary-market entities, such as securitization trusts and debt collectors, which are not protected by federal preemption.

5000|$|RALs {{began in}} 1985 when Ronald Smith, an Accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the {{practice}} of <b>Refund</b> Advance <b>Loans</b> at his accounting firm, Action Accounting & Taxes located at 5441 Virginia Beach Blvd. This service of <b>Loans</b> On Tax <b>Refunds</b> was advertised widely through WYAH, TV and on Cox Cable in the Hampton Roads area by Action Accounting & Taxes in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The Advance <b>Refund</b> <b>Loans</b> became a huge business success from the start and a sensation {{in the area in}} 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS. In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk's Auto on Virginia Beach Blvd, where today Town Centre now exits, asked Mr. Smith if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting & Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases. Mr. Smith agreed to this idea and {{that was the beginning of}} <b>Loans</b> on Tax <b>Refunds</b> being used in conjunction with car financing and that practice then quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States. Mr. Smith was the first one to invent, organize and pioneer the process of Tax <b>Refund</b> <b>Loans</b> in this way and went on to make millions in this business. The financing was originally fully handled by Joel S. Coplon and Company, a small private financing company closely connected with Mr. Smith at the time. Action Accounting and Taxes, the firm that Mr. Smith owned, was one mile from where John Hewitt was just starting a new business venture. Mr. Hewitt had just recently purchased Mel Jackson's Tax Service which was a run down group of offices throughout the Hampton Road's area. Mr. Hewitt began to offer <b>Refund</b> Anticipation <b>Loans</b> in 1988 and built a national franchise out of the idea which funded and built Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Then in 1989 H & R Block joined in the industry and it became a billion dollar industry across the United States being coopted into thousands of different accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and abroad. It was reported in 1989 that H & R Block had doubled it's business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new <b>Refund</b> <b>Loan</b> Service. It later spread to Canada as well through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company moved into the United States market as well offering the same service. The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing which IRS introduced electronic filing as a way to decrease its cost of operation. Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why the <b>Loan</b> on Tax <b>Refund</b> also known as <b>Refund</b> Anticipations <b>Loan</b> business flourished. In 1988, Mr. Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond State Court for charging usurious interest. Mr. Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State's Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was [...] "not culpable".|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} effect of student aid system on {{equality}} of opportunities and graduation times in {{higher education in the}} Nordic countries based on the existing literature and empirical research. The topic is relevant and current issue especially in Finland due to recent cuts made by the government to the student aid system which have raised many critical opinions regarding these cuts. The purpose of this thesis is to make an objective evaluation on {{the effect of}} the past reforms made to student allowance and student loan in the Nordic countries in the past decades. The main observations are that loan based incentives have had the biggest positive effect on decreasing graduation times in higher education. The studies also show that there isn’t enough evidence to support the claim that students with lower income families would be more risk averse regarding taking up student loans. Also {{there seems to be no}} evidence backing the statement that increasing student allowance increases the equality of opportunities. If the goal of the policymaker is to create incentives for decreased graduation times through student aid system, then a loan based system with <b>loan</b> <b>refund</b> based incentives for students graduating on time seems to be a much better instrument comparing to increasing the proportion of student allowance. I also conclude that there are no simple answers or single truths regarding a perfect student aid system which leads to the point that the goodness of the outcome of the system is dependent on the goals of the policy makers and every student aid system is a compromise made to optimize the goals of the policy makers...|$|R

40|$|A {{large and}} growing number of low-to-moderate income U.

The rapid growth of this segment of the financial services industry over the past decade has been quite controversial. One aspect of the controversy involves the location decisions of AFSPs. This study examines the determinants of the locations of three types of AFSPs [...] payday lenders, pawnshops, and check-cashing outlets. Using county-level data for the entire country, I find that the number of AFSP outlets per capita is significantly related to demographic characteristics of the county population (e. g., racial/ethnic composition, age, and education level), measures of the population's credit worthiness, and the stringency of state laws and regulations governing AFSPs.

40|$|This Article {{introduces}} {{a method of}} research that we term “legal participatory action research” or “legal PAR” {{as a way for}} legal scholars and activists to put various strands of critical legal theory into practice. Specifically, through the lens of legal PAR, this Article contributes to a rapidly developing legal literature on the “fringe economy” that comprises “alternative lending services” and products, including but not limited to pawnshops, check cashers, payday lenders, direct deposit <b>loans,</b> (tax) <b>refund</b> anticipation <b>loans,</b> and car title loans. As importantly, this article also contributes to the related fields of critical race theory, feminist legal theory, and critical race feminism by advocating legal PAR as a form of critical race/feminist praxis, which we employ, specifically, to address the ways in which race and gender remain inextricably linked to poverty and ever-widening economic inequalities and disparities. To demonstrate how legal PAR works in practice, we describe in this Article a local, community-based research project on predatory lending practices that we undertook from fall 2012 through summer 2013 in partnership with Public Allies Cincinnati, an AmeriCorps program whose goal is to identify, develop, and train a new “generation” of diverse community leaders and organizers. Further, we explain in this Article how and why our ongoing community-based research is grounded in theoretical commitments and values represented by critical race/feminism and the established, interdisciplinary field of participatory action research. Finally, we examine and reflect upon the challenges and benefits involved in doing legal PAR—both in practical and theoretical terms—in the context of our specific project, in the hopes that interested legal researchers, scholars, teachers, students, and activists will be inspired to develop legal PAR research projects of their own...|$|R

40|$|Risk {{classification}} is {{an important}} part of the financial processes. In small business loans, there is always a risk for nonpayment or non-refunding of loans though very detailed examinations are made about the company. In this study, behaviors that increase the risk in loans or causing non-refunding are tried to be determined by using the rough Set (RS) approach and logistic regression (LR). For this purpose, 121 regularly refunded and 121 irregularly <b>refunded</b> <b>loans,</b> drawn from a bank in 2006 year, were randomly selected and their attributes were examined in 2007. Examination is made in three sections for qualitative variables, for quantitative variables and for both qualitative and quantitative variables. As a result, RS model is applicable to a wide range of practical problems pertaining to loan payment prediction, but LR does not classify refund or non-refund of loan payment as good as RS, so LR can not be used for prediction. Moreover, the results show that the RS model is a promising alternative to the conventional methods for financial prediction. In fact, RS gives the attributes that affect the results negatively or positively with their measures which are used for predictions...|$|R
40|$|Governmental {{public debt}} is {{determined}} by the State’s financial needs that display a permanent character. The State’s financial needs are covered by cashed incomes coming from taxes and other contributions. The State’s incomes and the opportunity of obtaining them are almost never enough large in order to cover all the expenditures of a period (as a rule, one year). Such a lack of resources determines the turning up of certain budget deficits whose covering is done owing to internal or external loans. All the sums <b>loaned</b> and not <b>refunded</b> at a certain moment determines the appearance of the public debt of a country. Public debt consists in the total sums borrowed by the central public authorities, by the administrative and territory units, and contracted or guaranteed by the other public entities, from natural or juridical persons on the internal market or from abroad and not refunded at a certain moment. Governmental public debt represents the State’s total financial obligations at a certain moment coming from refunding financings directly contracted or guaranteed by the Government on financial markets. During a period when most of the countries have to face the challenges determined by the lack of sustaining internal and external public debt, we consider that the problems generated by administrating public debt mainly focus upon the impact of the present financial crisis upon the level of the public debt and upon the manner of administrating it...|$|R
