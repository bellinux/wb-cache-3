5|$|Realizing {{something}} is not right with the dog, Julie takes him to a dog trainer, Carruthers (Burl Ives), who tells her to kill the dog. Another dog trainer named Keys (Paul Winfield), who is black himself, undertakes re-educating the dog as a personal challenge. He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure,</b> taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure {{he is the only}} one to feed or care for the dog.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, the zoo {{opened the}} Land of the Tiger. It is a beautifully {{designed}} exhibit with naturalistic surroundings and built-in enrichment for the animals. As the guest enters the Land of the Tiger, {{two species of}} hornbills can be seen. Visayan warty pigs live in a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The Asian small-clawed otter and the babirusa pigs share an exhibit with a heated pool.|$|E

25|$|An {{approximate}} {{realization of}} a black surface is {{a hole in the}} wall of a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Any light entering the hole is reflected indefinitely or absorbed inside and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. The radiation confined in such an enclosure {{may or may not be}} in thermal equilibrium, depending upon the nature of the walls and the other contents of the enclosure.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} mixer is a kitchen appliance used for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It typically {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> containing the motor, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. The first {{electric mixer}} was invented by Rufus M. Eastman in 1885. U.S. patent #330,829 for the first electric mixer was filed by Eastman on March 6, 1885, and issued on November 17, 1885.|$|E
25|$|Launceston {{has many}} parks {{throughout}} the city including City Park, located next to the city centre. City Park is home to Albert Hall. The park also has a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> for Japanese macaque monkeys, a gift from sister city Ikeda, Japan. The Launceston General Post Office {{dates back to the}} 1880s, with a clock tower added in the early twentieth century. The GPO clock chime chimes every quarter-hour. Tasmania Zoo, which is known for its wildlife conservation work, including a breeding program for Tasmanian devils, is located near the city.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the finest}} zoos in France is not far away. Zoorama in the Forest of Chizé, commune of Villiers-en-Bois, {{contains}} 600 animals in <b>large</b> <b>enclosures,</b> which can be observed from Hides and ditches.|$|R
25|$|Recent archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the area}} around Ashbourne have revealed evidence of settlement back to neolithic times. In the townland of Rath, {{to the north of the}} town centre, a Bronze Age settlement was found during the construction of the M2 motorway. Excavations in the vicinity of the cemetery Killegland revealed the extent of the early Christian settlement, with souterrains, house sites and a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> centred around the remains of the church that is visible in the cemetery. This would link the townland name of Killegland - meaning Declan's Church - to pre-Patrician settlement {{in the area}}. Archaeological excavations on the site of Lidl supermarket revealed the original medieval town, with several house remains, associated field systems, fish traps and mill races.|$|E
25|$|Pridelands and African Savannah – Giraffes, zebras and {{ostriches}} are all {{found in}} one <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> which is first viewed from above on a boardwalk, while springbok and white rhino share the opposite enclosure. An expansive walk-through aviary located {{next to the}} giraffe enclosure is home to masked lovebirds, meerkats and leopard tortoises. This area also offers ground level views looking out over a watering hole to the giraffes and zebras, and is themed to resemble a rocky escarpment tumbling down onto the savannah. Continuing along the path, is the lion enclosure which is home to four female lions. The Pridelands area of the zoo also features Greater flamingos, Hamadryas baboons, two cheetah brothers and servals. An African themed cafe named 'The Watering Hole', is located in this precinct next to the lions and flamingos.|$|E
25|$|Tiger Territory – Auckland Zoo {{has three}} rare Sumatran tigers; male Jaka, female Molek {{and her son}} named Berani. There are two {{separate}} tiger enclosures. Jaka is usually housed in his own enclosure, completed in 2006. Molek and Berani are in a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> which dates back to 1922 and originally housed up to two prides of lions. It previously housed Molek's sister, Nisha, before her death, and has been extensively renovated. Facilities allow the tigers to swap enclosures at times. On 12 June 2008, Molek gave birth to three tiger cubs who were sired by Oz. The male cubs were named Jalur (meaning stripes), and Berani (meaning spirited, brave or courageous) and their sister was named Cinta (meaning love). Jalur and Cinta have since been transferred to Symbio Wildlife Park in NSW, Australia. In November 2013 Oz moved to Hamilton Zoo to swap homes with Jaka, Molek's brother.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{can be kept}} as a pet, though {{providing}} suitable care {{is expensive}} and requires extremely <b>large</b> <b>enclosures.</b> In many countries, permits or licenses are necessary and most veterinarians have little experience of these exotic animals.|$|R
50|$|This {{species of}} rhino is {{relatively}} new at White Oak, which welcomed its first calf in July 2011. Facilities like White Oak that provide <b>large</b> <b>enclosures</b> have had the most success in breeding. Another calf was born in May 2013.|$|R
50|$|Opened in August 2014, Project Polar Reserve houses four male {{polar bears}} named Victor, Pixel, Nissan, and Nobby. These {{are the only}} polar bears in an English zoo. The <b>largest</b> <b>enclosure</b> is ten acres in size and {{features}} two pools, the largest of which is eight metres deep and contains 25.5 million gallons of water. This {{is one of the}} <b>largest</b> polar bear <b>enclosures</b> in the world.|$|R
25|$|Plato {{may have}} {{traveled}} in Italy, Sicily, Egypt and Cyrene. Said to {{have returned to}} Athens {{at the age of}} forty, Plato founded one of the earliest known organized schools in Western Civilization on a plot of land in the Grove of Hecademus or Academus. The Academy was a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> of ground about six stadia outside of Athens proper. One story is that the name of the Academy comes from the ancient hero, Academus; still another story is that the name came from a supposed former owner of the plot of land, an Athenian citizen whose name was (also) Academus; while yet another account is that it was named after a member of the army of Castor and Pollux, an Arcadian named Echedemus. The Academy operated until it was destroyed by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 84 BC. Neoplatonists revived the Academy in the early 5th century, and it operated until 529 AD, when it was closed by Justinian I of Byzantium, who saw it {{as a threat to the}} propagation of Christianity. Many intellectuals were schooled in the Academy, the most prominent one being Aristotle.|$|E
500|$|The clock chime can {{be heard}} {{striking}} the quarter chimes on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th bells of the ring of 12 with the hours being struck on the largest 50cwt (12th) tenor bell. The clock chime strikes the [...] "Cambridge Chimes", {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Westminster Chimes", every quarter of an hour daily from 7 a.m. to 11pm. The chimes are disabled outside of these hours. If the bells are in the 'up' position, the chimes are also disabled (normally during the day on Sundays). The clock was fully converted to electric operation during the 1960s. It is now driven by a Smith's of Derby synchronous motor. The old pendulum, gravity escapement and weights, etc., were removed when the clock was automated. What remains of the clock movement and electrified chiming barrel is housed in a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> in the ringing room. The clock face is approximately 3m in diameter and is on the northern elevation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{body that}} {{interfaces}} with another medium which both has [...] and absorbs all the radiation incident upon it, {{is said to}} be a black body. The surface of a black body can be modelled by a small hole in the wall of a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> which is maintained at a uniform temperature with opaque walls that, at every wavelength, are not perfectly reflective. At equilibrium, the radiation inside this enclosure follows Planck's law, and so will the radiation coming out of the small hole.|$|E
2500|$|While Farasi {{has been}} [...] "saved" [...] from being Basel-lion food, ironically, he was {{attacked}} by a lion in South Africa. As Farasi was at first too small to defend himself against predators, he was kept in a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure</b> on the reserve. However, in 2011, Farasi broke out of this protected area and was eventually attacked by a lion during a night on land. The wounds were not severe, but a veterinarian was called; Farasi had to be tranquilized and was brought back to safety in an enclosure with an electric fence. According to Sylvia Sussens, of the reserve, Farasi should have been large enough to defend himself by 2012 and {{was scheduled to be}} released into the wild.|$|E

"After halting at Palel {{for some}} hours a start was made, at eleven o'clock at night; and at daybreak {{we came upon}} some villages, each house in which was {{standing}} alone in a <b>large</b> <b>enclosure,</b> surrounded by a wall, ditch, and hedge. We went at them and carried them, one by one, without any great loss to ourselves. Issuing on the other side, we came upon a plain about a thousand yards across. Beyond this was a bridge, on fire. The enemy were strongly posted in trenches and behind hedges.|$|E
50|$|Givskud Zoo is {{best known}} for its <b>large</b> <b>enclosures,</b> which the guests can drive through in their own cars.
