40|$|Abstract. Although data {{forwarding}} algorithms and protocols {{have been}} among the first set of issues explored in sensor networking, how to reliably deliver sensing data through a vast field of small, vulnerable sensors remains a research challenge. In this paper we present GRAdient Broadcast (GRAB), a new set of mechanisms and protocols which is designed specifically for robust data delivery in face of unreliable nodes and fallible wireless links. Similar to previous work [12, 13], GRAB builds and maintains a cost field, providing each sensor the direction to forward sensing data. Different from all the previous approaches, however, GRAB forwards data along a band of interleaved mesh from each source to the receiver. GRAB controls the width of the band by the amount of credit carried in each data message, allowing the sender to adjust the robustness of data delivery. GRAB design harnesses the advantage of large scale and relies on the collective efforts of multiple nodes to deliver data, without dependency on any individual ones. We have evaluated the GRAB performance through both analysis and extensive simulation. Our analysis shows quantitatively the advantage of interleaved mesh over multiple parallel paths. Our simulation further confirms the analysis results and shows that GRAB can successfully deliver over 90 % of packets with relatively low energy cost, even under the adverse conditions of 30 % node failures compounded with 15 % <b>link</b> <b>message</b> losses...|$|E

50|$|Link 22 transmits {{tactical}} data in {{fixed format}} messages, {{and uses the}} same data element definitions as Link 16. This provides standardization between the two tactical data <b>links.</b> Tactical <b>messages</b> are composed of from one to eight Tactical Message Words (TMWs). Each TMW is 72 bits in length.Link 22 messages are called F-Series messages and {{are part of the}} J-Family of messages. The F-Series consists of two types of messages, the Unique F messages and the FJ messages. The Unique F-Series messages are more compact versions of <b>Link</b> 16’s <b>messages,</b> or messages that do not exist in Link 16. The FJ <b>messages</b> encapsulate <b>Link</b> 16 J-Series <b>messages</b> within <b>Link</b> 22 <b>messages,</b> enabling <b>Link</b> 16 tactical <b>messages</b> to be transmitted without modification within Link 22.The DLP requests transmission of a <b>Link</b> 22 tactical <b>message</b> with a Transmission Service Request (TSR). Each request for transmission utilizes a unique identifier and defines the required Quality of Service (QoS).The DLP creates the <b>Link</b> 22 tactical <b>messages</b> from tactical data and the defined transmission requirements of STANAG 5522. Alternatively, the tactical messages may be created by the TDS and then passed to the DLP. The DLP, however, is the component responsible for passing all <b>Link</b> 22 tactical <b>messages</b> to be transmitted to the NCE. Likewise, the DLP is the destination for all tactical messages received by the NCE. The DLP may perform limited processing of the received tactical messages or may simply pass them on to the TDS for processing. Each message, as mentioned above, can be defined with different QoS.The DLP performs other tactical functions, such as track management, correlation, reporting responsibility, conflict resolution, data filtering, and data forwarding STANAG 5616 Volumes II and III. These functions are a national responsibility, and they may be performed either by the DLP or the TDS. The DLP can perform minimal tactical message processing, or it can be a complete multilink Command and Control (C2) system.|$|R

40|$|With the {{inclusion}} of 406 MHz transponders on the Galileo satellites and the new search and rescue (SAR) return <b>link</b> <b>message</b> (RLM) on the open service E 1 B signal, the availability of distress beacons equipped with a Galileo or combined GPS/Galileo receiver will be very important {{in the future to}} take advantage of the SAR RLM, thereby facilitating the rescue operations and helping to identify and reject false alerts. Consequently, this paper provides the status of the development of a flexible Galileo L 1 receiver platform as well as an analysis and comparison of acquisition schemes suitable to be implemented in 406 MHz Cospas-Sarsat distress beacons. For each considered acquisition scheme, we compare the acquisition performance that can be obtained using GPS L 1 C/A or Galileo E 1 B or E 1 C signals and consider and discuss the following main constraints: a very short time to first fix (TTFF) in cold start conditions (the beacon’s GNSS receiver may not be powered on for years before it is activated in an emergency); a low energy consumption per position fix (the beacon and GNSS receiver are battery powered); a possibly long coherent integration time to achieve synchronization and tracking in harsh environments (e. g., when some or all of the satellite signals are blocked or attenuated by an obstruction); the ability to demodulate the satellites signals in the presence of a 406 MHz/ 5 W and a 121. 5 MHz/(up to 100 mW) beacon transmitters; and a low complexity (low price) ...|$|E
40|$|The current Search and Rescue (SAR) service, {{which is}} based on the Cospas-Sarsat system, suffers from major {{limitations}} such as poor position accuracy, long alert times and high false alarm rate. Two types of distress signals are used, the first 121. 5 MHz/(up to 100 mW) and the second 406 MHz/ 5 W, the latter being able to carry digitally encoded identification and position data. The Galileo system will importantly contribute to the improvement of the SAR system. Indeed, the Galileo satellites will include a transponder in order to re-broadcast the 406 MHz message, which will allow a better coverage (27 Galileo satellites plus the current seven Cospas-Sarsat satellites) and also a shorter alert time. They will also include a return <b>link</b> <b>message</b> (RLM) in the Galileo E 1 b open service signal, which will reduce the number of false alarms. The Galileo system is therefore a great opportunity {{for the development of a}} new generation of beacons which will include a Galileo receiver and therefore be able to take advantage of the better coverage provided by the Galileo constellation to provide shorter alert times and of the RLM to reduce the number of false alarms. One of the major issue when designing a Galileo receiver to be operated in a distess beacon is to design a front-end that is sensitive enough to pick the very weak Galileo signals and on the same time rejects the strong distress messages. Indeed, when the beacon is turned on, the Galileo receiver is in cold start conditions and a short amount of time is left to the receiver to get a first fix before any distress message is actually emitted. However, in some cases, the receiver is not able to determine its position sufficiently fast and the front-end therefore has to acquire the satellites in the presence of the distress signals. This paper presents a Galileo radio frequency front-end designed in order to operate in the presence of such signals...|$|E
