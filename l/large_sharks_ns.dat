40|$|The species {{composition}} {{and number of}} sharks used by the <b>shark</b> fi <b>n</b> trade were estimated from a partial set of daily auction records for the world's <b>largest</b> <b>shark</b> fi <b>n</b> trading centre in Hong Kong for the period October 1999 to March 2001. More than 10 000 lot descriptions of <b>shark</b> type, fi <b>n</b> position, fi n size and fi n weight were translated and statistically modeled using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (WinBUGS). These methods allowed a robust estimation of missing information in individual auction records, {{as well as of}} entire auctions for which no data are available, through a hierarchical model with uninformative priors. The model provides estimates of the complete data set for the sampled period, including the total auctioned weights of fi <b>ns</b> by <b>shark</b> type and fi n position. Separate studies, undertaken in Hong Kong to genetically map trade names to species names, are be-ing used to align the estimates with particular taxa. This paper demonstrates how the traded quantity estimates can be converted to the weight and number of sharks represented based on preliminary conversion factors from the literature and from this research. A potentially more robust Bayesian conversion algorithm, involving fi n size-classes and stochastic relationships between fi n lengths and fi n weights, is outlined for future implementation...|$|R

40|$|Large predators often play {{important}} roles in structuring marine communities. To understand the role that these predators play in ecosystems, {{it is crucial to}} have knowledge of their interactions {{and the degree to which}} their trophic roles are complementary or redundant among species. We used stable isotope analysis to examine the isotopic niche overlap of dolphins Tursiops cf. aduncus, <b>large</b> <b>sharks</b> (> 1. 5 m total length), and smaller elasmobranchs (sharks and batoids) in the relatively pristine seagrass community of Shark Bay, Australia. Dolphins and <b>large</b> <b>sharks</b> differed in their mean isotopic values for δ 13 C and δ 15 N, and each group occupied a relatively unique area in isotopic niche space. The standard ellipse areas (SEAc; based on bivariate standard deviations) of dolphins, <b>large</b> <b>sharks,</b> small sharks, and rays did not overlap. Tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier had the highest δ 15 N values, although the mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of pigeye sharks Carcharhinus amboinensis were similar. Other <b>large</b> <b>sharks</b> (e. g. sicklefin lemon sharks Negaprion acutidens and sandbar sharks Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dolphins appeared to feed at slightly lower trophic levels than tiger sharks. In this seagrass-dominated ecosystem, seagrass-derived carbon appears to be more important for elasmobranchs than it is for dolphins. Habitat use patterns did not correlate well with the sources of productivity supporting diets, suggesting that habitat use patterns may not necessarily be reflective of the resource pools supporting a population and highlights the importance of detailed datasets on trophic interactions for elucidating the ecological roles of predators...|$|R
