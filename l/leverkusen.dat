5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Liverpool {{returned}} to the European Cup, now called the UEFA Champions League, {{for the first time}} since the Heysel disaster. A 2–0 victory over Roma in the second group stage meant they progressed to the quarter-finals. They faced German club Bayer <b>Leverkusen</b> and won the first leg 1–0. The outlook for the second leg appeared to be to Liverpool's advantage, as their counter-attacking style of play had served them well during away matches throughout the season; however, they lost the second leg 4–2 and were eliminated 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool were {{appearing}} in their tenth final they had won seven (1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2001, 2003) and lost two (1978, 1987). This was Chelsea's fourth {{appearance in the}} final.

5|$|Given again {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Steve Harper {{during the following}} season. After a 5–0 qualifying round win, Newcastle progressed to the group stages of the Champions League. He played {{in the first three}} group matches, all of which Newcastle lost. Given found himself out of the team for the next two games, as Harper replaced him in goal. Given returned for the final group match against Feyenoord in the Netherlands, and Newcastle's 3–2 win meant that they qualified for the second round. Internazionale scored four times past Given as Newcastle lost 4–1 in their opening match in the second group stage. Newcastle conceded a further three times away to Barcelona, beat Bayer <b>Leverkusen</b> at home and in Germany (with Given saving an Oliver Neuville penalty in the home tie), and drew with Inter at San Siro, however a 2–0 loss at home against Barcelona meant that the club finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages. Given played every game in the second round. Given played all 38 league games for the club, as well as his 12 European appearances, as the team finished in third place in the Premier League, meaning the club would enter the Champions League qualifying round in 2003–04.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Bayern won the 2012 DFL-Supercup 2–1 against rivals Borussia Dortmund. Bayern {{became the}} first team in history to win their first eight matches in the Bundesliga after their 5–0 away win to Fortuna Düsseldorf.

The group stages were contested as eight double round-robin groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the knockout stages. Knockout ties were decided based on home and away matches.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season {{proved to}} be the turning point in the history of Maribor. The club stormed the Slovenian league and became {{national}} champions {{for the first time in}} their history. During this season average home attendance was 5,289spectators, which is still a record in the Slovenian League. The final match of the season was played on 1 June 1997, against Beltinci and attracted a crowd of 14,000, which is also a record of the Slovenian top league. In that season Maribor also won the 1996–97 Slovenian Cup, thus winning the domestic Double, a feat also repeated in the 1998–99 season. After their first title in 1996–97 Maribor went on to win six more titles, bringing their total number to seven consecutive titles by 2003. During this period the team also won three Slovenian cups and in the 1999–2000 season, the club, led by head coach Bojan Prašnikar, defeated Genk of Belgium (5–1, 0–3) and French powerhouse Lyon (1–0, 2–0) and qualify for the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions league.

5|$|In the 2000–01 season Liverpool {{won three}} {{competitions}} {{to complete a}} unique treble of trophies. The first trophy was the League Cup, when they beat Birmingham City 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 1–1. They then won the FA Cup, as Owen scored two goals {{in the last ten}} minutes to overturn a one-goal deficit to win the match against Arsenal 2–1. The final trophy the club won was the UEFA Cup. An own goal in the last minute of extra time by Delfí Geli secured a 5–4 victory over Spanish team Alavés. Liverpool finished the league in third place, securing a return to the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) {{for the first time since}} the Heysel Stadium disaster. Liverpool's participation in the UEFA Champions League in the 2001–02 season saw the club reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by German team Bayer <b>Leverkusen</b> 4–3 on aggregate. The season was Liverpool's best in the league in recent years, as they finished second, seven points behind Arsenal. Despite their improved performance in the league, Liverpool were unable to defend the FA and League Cup, exiting in the fourth and third rounds respectively. The season was overshadowed by Houllier's heart problems. He suffered chest pain at half-time during a match with Leeds at Anfield. He had an eleven-hour operation to fix an acute dissection of the aorta and did not return until February. His assistant Phil Thompson took charge of the team in the interim.|$|E

In the semi-finals against Chelsea, Barcelona would be {{defeated}} 1–0 in London after a Didier Drogba strike in the 45th minute. The second leg, meanwhile, at the Nou Camp finished 2–2, thus eliminating Barcelona from European contention. In the penultimate game of the season at home to Real Madrid, perhaps the most important game of the Catalan club's season, Barça would collapse 1–2 to Real Madrid with a strike each from Sami Khedira and Cristiano Ronaldo, winning Los Blancos the match. On 27 April, coach Pep Guardiola announced in a tearful press conference in Barcelona that he would be stepping down as coach of the Catalan club {{at the end of the}} season, citing that he needed a break from football; he was to be replaced by Tito Vilanova.

He finished with a record of 44 wins, 26 draws and 14 losses at Bayer <b>Leverkusen.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the final}} matchday of the season, visiting Bayer <b>Leverkusen</b> needed only a draw in Unterhaching {{to secure their}} first {{national}} title, but instead went down to defeat to the determined home side.

Their title hopes ended when Haching midfielder Markus Oberleitner made the score 2:0 in the 72nd minute. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich beat Werder Bremen 3:1 at home {{and were able to}} overtake <b>Leverkusen</b> on goal difference to snatch away the title. With a 10th-place result, Unterhaching finished ahead of long-established sides Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04.
