40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} solid scientific understanding of the creation and characteristics of surface fractures formed during the grinding and polishing of brittle materials, specifically glass. In this study, we have experimentally characterized the morphology, number density, and depth distribution of various surface cracks as a function of various grinding and polishing processes (blanchard, fixed abrasive grinding, loose abrasive, pitch polishing and pad polishing). Also, the effects of load, abrasive particle (size, distribution, foreign particles, geometry, velocity), and <b>lap</b> <b>material</b> (pitch, pad) were examined. The resulting data were evaluated in terms of indentation fracture mechanics and tribological interactions (science of interacting surfaces) leading to several models to explain crack distribution behavior of ground surfaces and to explain the characteristics of scratches formed during polishing. This project has greatly advanced the scientific knowledge of microscopic mechanical damage occurring during grinding and polishing and has been of general interest. This knowledge-base has also enabled the design and optimization of surface finishing processes to create optical surfaces with far superior laser damage resistance. There are five major areas of scientific progress {{as a result of this}} LDRD. They are listed in Figure 1 and described briefly in this summary below. The details of this work are summarized through a number of published manuscripts which are included this LDRD Final Report. In the first area of grinding, we developed a technique to quantitatively and statistically measure the depth distribution of surface fractures (i. e., subsurface damage) in fused silica as function of various grinding processes using mixtures of various abrasive particles size distributions. The observed crack distributions were explained using a model that extended known, single brittle indentation models to an ensemble of loaded, sliding particles. The model illustrates the importance of the particle size distribution of the abrasive and its influence on the resulting crack distribution. The results of these studies are summarized in references 1 - 7. In the second area of polishing, we conducted a series of experiments showing the influence of rogue particles (i. e., particles in the polishing slurry that are larger than base particles) on the creation of scratches on polished surfaces. Scratches can be thought of a as a specific type of sub-surface damage. The characteristics (width, length, type of fractures, concentration) were explained in terms of the rogue particle size, the rogue particle material, and the viscoelastic properties of the lap. The results of these studies are summarized in references 6 - 7. In the third area of etching, we conducted experiments aimed at understanding the effect of HF:NH{sub 4 }F acid etching on surface fractures on fused silica. Etching can be used as a method: (a) to expose sub-surface mechanical damage, (b) to study the morphology of specific mechanical damage occurring by indentation, and (c) to convert a ground surface containing a high concentration of sub-surface mechanical damage into surface roughness. Supporting models have been developed to describe in detail the effect of etching on the morphology and evolution of surface cracks. The results of these studies are summarized in references 8 - 9. In the fourth area of scratch forensics or scratch fractography, a set of new scratch forensic rule-of-thumbs were developed in order to aid the optical fabricator and process engineer to interpret the cause of scratches and digs on surfaces. The details of how these rules were developed are described in each of the references included in this summary (1 - 9). Figure 2 provides as a summary of some of the more commonly used rules-of-thumbs that have been developed in this study. In the fifth and final area of laser damage, we demonstrated that the removal of such surface fractures from the surface during optical fabrication can dramatically improve the laser damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of developing a}} high temperature capacitor for 1100 F operation which is as small and light as conventional capacitors for normal operating temperatures is discussed. Pyrolyic boron nitride (PBN) was selected for the dielectric. The PBN capacitors were made by slicing and <b>lapping</b> <b>material</b> from thick blocks and then sputtering thin film electrodes. These capacitors had breakdown strengths of 7, 000 volts per mil and a dissipation factor of less than 0. 001 at 1100 F. Additional processing improvements were made after testing a multi-layer or stacked PBN capacitor for 1, 000 hours at 1100 F. Sputter etching the wafers before depositing electrodes resulted in a reduction in dissipation factor. A sputtered boron nitride film applied to the outer electrode surfaces produced a more stable capacitor. A design for a 0. 1 mu F capacitor and a summary of PBN wafer fabrication costs are given...|$|R
40|$|This book {{evolved from}} several stacks of lecture notes written {{over a decade}} and given in classes at {{slightly}} varying levels. In transforming the over­ <b>lapping</b> <b>material</b> into a book, I aimed at presenting {{some of the best}} features of the subject with a minimum of prerequisities and technicalities. (Needless to say, one man's technicality is another's professionalism.) But a text frozen in print does not allow for the latitude of the classroom; and the tendency to expand becomes harder to curb without the constraints of time and audience. The result is that this volume contains more topics and details than I had intended, but I hope the forest is still visible with the trees. The book begins at the beginning with the Markov property, followed quickly by the introduction of option al times and martingales. These three topics in the discrete parameter setting are fully discussed in my book A Course In Probability Theory (second edition, Academic Press, 1974). The latter will be referred to throughout this book as the Course, and may be considered as a general background; its specific use is limited to the mate­ rial on discrete parameter martingale theory cited in § 1. 4. Apart from this and some dispensable references to Markov chains as examples, the book is self-contained...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the motion of diamond grains on the material removal rate and surface roughness in the lapping of Mn-Zn polycrystalline ferrite using a Sn lapping plate and 0. 3 μm diamond abrasives. The diamond grains can be classified into fixed and loose grains. The grains fixed to a lapping plate were confirmed by SEM and AFM observations. Among many experimental parameters, the change of the pitch of fine grooves on a lapping plate formed by the facing operation has a significant effect on the removal rate. This agrees well with the calculated number of loose grains under various pitches of groove. The average removal rate with fixed and loose grains was found to be about 2. 7 times higher than that with only fixed grains. These results indicate that during <b>lapping,</b> the <b>material</b> is mainly removed by loose grains. It is evident from AFM images that the <b>lapped</b> surface with <b>material</b> removed by fixed grains differs very much from that with material removed simultaneously by fixed and loose grains...|$|R

Investigation on the wear uniformity of uncertain eccentricity plane lapping {{was carried out in}} this research. The relative velocity function of the plate to the workpiece is obtained through kinematic analyses in the mode of uncertain eccentricity plane <b>lapping,</b> and <b>material</b> removal rate (MRR) function and wear uniformity function were deduced based on Preston equation. Effects of the ratio and eccentricities on the wear uniformity are discussed in detail through MATLAB simulation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the ratio k 1 of workpiece revolution speed to lapping plate is the key to decide whether the lapping plate is lapped uniformly. Theoretically, when k 1 1, Besides, a bit bigger eccentricity e 1 is propitious to the lapping uniformly of the lapping plate, and bigger eccentricity e 2 are also helpful to lapping uniformly of the lapping plate.

40|$|Background: Tularemia is {{a disease}} caused by a Gram-negative {{coccobacillus}} Francisella tularensis. This bacterium may cause different types of clinical pictures owing to acquisition route and entrance site, such as ulceroglandular, oropharyngeal, glandular, pneumonic, typhoid and ocular forms. Oropharyngeal tularemia (OPT) {{is the most common}} form of tularemia in some regions. OPT may cause tonsillopharyngitis followed by cervical lymphadenopathies (LAPs). Without treatment LAP may persist for several months and may mimic other diseases causing cervical <b>LAPs.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: A total of six cases of OPT, five male and one female, between 21 and 31 years old, diagnosed serologically and clinically recorded in GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital were included in this study. Detailed story including the region they lived for last 6 months, their occupation, family and neighborhood story with similar complaints were obtained. Patient data were also obtained from manually written patients files and electronical patient file system. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks of all biopsy material were submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study for F. tularensis. Results: A total of six cases with head and neck mass following a story of tonsillopharyngitis admitted to different clinics including infectious diseases, ear-nose-throat and internal medicine in our tertiary care hospital. Physical examination revealed immobile, hard, conglomerated unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy in all cases. Histopathological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation in four cases. Acute suppurative inflammatory changes were also seen in two cases. Large necrotic areas mimicking casseifying necrosis were seen in two cases. PCR amplification of F. tularensis genom from isolated deoxyribonucleic acids was successful in five cases. Conclusion: Tularemia should be kept in mind in patients with tonsillopharyngitis not responding to penicillins and beta lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, persisting LAPs mimicking tumor with or without the story of previously experienced sore throat or tonsillopharyngitis in past few days or weeks should be evaluated for glandular or OPT. At this point, easily applicable serological tests such as tularemia micro-agglutination tests will confirm the diagnosis of OPT. However, if lymph node were already sampled to exclude especially malignancy or T cell lymphoma, tularemia PCR test may be used to make a certain diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} lapping has been long {{considered}} an art {{due to the}} tremendous amount of variability and subjectivity involved. The quality of lapping differs from operator to operator {{and the results are}} highly inconsistent. The material removal rate, surface finish, and flatness all depend on the proper control of lapping parameters such as lapping pressure, lapping speed of rotation, <b>lap</b> ring <b>material,</b> weight and size, abrasive size and type, workpiece material and hardness. To attain the desired outcomes, it is imperative to select proper values for the lapping control parameters. Moving the art of lapping into a science and quantifying the results can solve many of the above problems. In this research, a portable mechanical lapping tool was designed and tested along with manual lapping. Lapping processes were studied by conducting designed experiments, literature search, and consulting experts. The results from the experiments were explored in detail using various statistical techniques to explain the relationships among potential parameters and to see the possibility of lapping model development.

Ultrasonic measurements of plate-modes propagating for large distances [1] are a promising method for fast detection of these defects in a commercial environment. There is a need to predict the waveforms of such waves in order to analyze the results of the experimental data. Analytic solution cannot always be found for general cases, therefore, numerical prediction of elastic wave propagation for long distances is desired. However, the large problem size and the long propagation time that is involved require careful attention to the discretization. Small mesh size discretization which is needed for accurate solutions can no longer be practical because of the memory limitations and the high computational costs. On the other hand, a large mesh size can cause severe errors especially when long propagation time is concerned. This paper describes a new method which successfully deals with this issue...|$|R

The model can offer the capability for predicting the extent of corrosion within the joint in terms of thickness loss at the internal surfaces of the skins from the amplitude of the pillowing of the outer skin. Three-dimensional finite element model of a bolted joint have been developed in the non-linear finite element code MSC.
