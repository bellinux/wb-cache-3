40|$|We {{study the}} {{environmental}} regulation of industrial {{activities that are}} organized as projects. Applications arise in construction, ship and aircraft building, and film making, among other industries. Relative to manufacturing, environmental regulation is different in project‐based industries, due to the uniqueness and geographical diversity of projects, {{and a lack of}} product takeback programs. Because the amount of waste and pollution generated by project companies can be large, regulators need environmental policies to ensure reduction of waste and pollution. We consider a regulator who attempts to maximize social welfare. We model this problem as a bilevel nonlinear program. The upper <b>level</b> <b>regulator</b> specifies waste reduction targets, which the lower level project companies meet using waste stream reduction and remediation of pollution, while attempting to control their project costs. We find that high waste diversion targets lead to outcomes with little pollution, but excessive project costs and only modest waste stream reduction. Projects that have lower task precedence density, or that have pollutants with different environmental impacts, show larger increases in project cost and time resulting from regulation. We describe a subsidy for waste stream reduction that coordinates the system, and we estimate the value of coordination. We also describe a bonus that encourages truthful reporting by project companies, and evaluate the relative cost and effectiveness of the subsidy and the bonus. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Solar {{radiation}} {{should be}} avoided in melanoma patients. Nevertheless, this is the main {{means by which the}} body produces vitamin D. Evidence suggests a protective role against cancer for vitamin D. Since vitamin D performs its function by binding the receptor encoded by the vitamin D-receptor gene (VDR), most studies have focused on polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene. However, the gene encoding the vitamin D-binding protein (GC) appears in recent studies as {{a major player in the}} role of a serum vitamin D <b>level</b> <b>regulator</b> and in Cutaneous Melanoma (CM) predisposition. METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 12 polymorphisms on GC and 9 on VDR among 530 cases and 314 controls from Spanish population. RESULTS: We found association between SNP rs 12512631, located 3 'downstream of GC, and risk of CM that seems to fit a dominant model (OR 1. 63 95 %CI 1. 23 - 2. 17 p-value 7 × 10 (- 4)). This association remained Bonferroni's correction and after adjustment for potential confounders (p-value 3 × 10 (- 3)) and even after increasing the sample size to 1729 individuals (p-value 0. 0129). Moreover, we confirmed evidence of an association between CM susceptibility and the linkage disequilibrium block marked by tag-SNP rs 222016 (p-value 0. 032). This block covers the GC intron 1 region, with probable regulatory functions. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first vitamin D pathway-related polymorphism study in melanoma risk conducted in the Spanish population. Furthermore, we show an association between polymorphisms in GC and melanoma risk, confirming recent studies in different populations...|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{metabolism}} plays {{a prominent}} role in the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in both the macrophage and mammalian hosts. A central question in the reconstruction of lipid metabolism in MTB is the key regulatory programs responsible for changes in this metabolism under different conditions. One of the most studied conditions is hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) as adaptations to hypoxia are thought {{to play an important role}} in MTB pathogenesis and latency. To identify temporal trends during a hypoxic time course and associate them with possible regulators, expression data was clustered into paths using DREM algorithm and available ChIP-Seq data for over 80 transcription factors (TFs). The degree to which expression patterns might reflect the direct action of transcription factors was assessed by evaluating the consistency between the path, the expression of each TF binding genes in the path, and the predicted regulatory role of the TF from the regulatory network. DosR was correctly identified as an activator of the path corresponding almost entirely to its regulon. Rv 0081 was found to be a candidate high <b>level</b> <b>regulator</b> broadly predictive of the overall expression of sets of genes during hypoxia and re-aeration. An essential part of the continued survival of MTB in the host is due to its adaptation to the phagosomal compartment of the macrophage where the bacterium faces hypoxic as well as other stresses. Using the same approach and several time course expression data sets available for MTB in macrophage cultures, macrophage temporal expression models were built and compared to the hypoxia model. Similar trends were found in the expression of genes involved in respiration, cholesterol catabolism and methylcitrate cycle. In contrast, a group of genes responsible for the synthesis of complex cell wall lipids (PAT/DAT and SL- 1) were up-regulated in the macrophage models and downregulated in the hypoxic model. PhoP was predicted as a potential main regulator of these genes as a result of pH change which takes place in the macrophage environment but not during hypoxia...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to improve the}} productivity and lower the expense of existing vacuum blasting technology. This technology is used to remove radioactive contamination, PCBs, and lead-based paint and provides worker protection by continuously recycling the material and dust for the decontamination tasks. The proposed work would increase the cleaning rate and provide safe and cost-effective decontamination of the DOE sites. This work focuses on redesigning and improving existing vacuum blasting technology including blast head nozzles, ergonomic handling of the blast head by reducing its weight; brush-ring design, vacuum <b>level</b> <b>regulator,</b> efficiency of the dust separator, and operational control sensors. The redesign is expected to enhance the productivity and economy of the vacuum blasting system by at least 50 % over current vacuum blasting systems. There are three phases in the project. Phase I consists of developing and testing mathematical models. Phase II consists of pre-prototype design and fabrication and pre-prototype unit testing. Phase III consists of prototype design and field verification testing. In phase I, mathematical models are developed and analyzed for the nozzle, blast head, wind curtain, and dust separator, first as individual devices and then combined as an integrated model. This allows study of respective airflow and design parameters. The Contractor shall, {{based on the results of}} the mathematical modeling studies, design experimental models of the components and test these models. In addition, the Contractor shall develop sensors to detect the relationship of the blast head to the blast surfaces and controls to minimize the dependency on an operator's skill and judgment to obtain optimum positioning, as well as real-time characterization sensors to determine as the blast head is moving the depth to which coatings must be removed, thereby improving production and minimizing waste. In phase II, the Contractor shall design and construct a pre-prototype of the nozzle, blast head with wind curtain, sensors, and dust separator and test this system to assess the performance of the new design under controlled conditions at the contractor's facility. In phase III, the Contractor shall design and construct a prototype of the High Productivity Vacuum Blasting System, based on the results of the pre-prototype design and testing performed. This unit will be a full-scale prototype and will be tested at a designated Department of Energy (DOE) facility. Based on the results, the system performance, the productivity, and the economy of the improved vacuum blasting system will be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Manifolded {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in existing refrigeration systems such as cold rooms, display windows and ice machines. Scroll compressors are increasingly used in refrigeration systems, hence manifolded scroll compressors are easily found in the current market. The manifolding of two, three or even four compressors provides many benefits. It can provide capacity modulation; it can offer lower starting load of the system; it also enables the change of one compressor when it is tripped without shutting down the whole system. The key success factor of design of the manifold is to ensure the right balance of the oil between compressors in different running conditions. It is vital for the compressor to maintain the proper level and quantity of oil for its reliability. Two kinds of oil management solutions are predominant. One is the active solution which includes a mechanical or electronic oil level control device (oil <b>level</b> <b>regulator)</b> to control the oil feeding {{in order to maintain}} the oil level inside of the compressor crankcase. This solution is maturely used in the market. The other is the passive solution which relies on the piping design to achieve a good oil balance. The passive one is more interesting for its cost effectiveness and robustness due to fewer components, however, it is more difficult to handle. In this paper, three different passive oil management solutions for even tandem systems are studied. The first solution is that each compressor has its own respective oil separator; oil separated in the oil separator is returned back to the corresponding compressor crankcase, and the oil balance line is installed to avoid that one compressor oil level is much higher than the other if OS(oil separator) efficiency is different or any OS is blocked. The second solution consists of two compressors sharing one common oil separator; oil separated from the OS is fed back to the common suction line, and is then led back to each compressor with refrigerant gas. The oil return has to be split equally between the running compressors; the oil state could be as spray with the gas and as droplets along the length and bend of the piping. Since the oil is returning back together with the suction gas, gas balance is critical and gas velocity in the suction line is very important. Suction header and suction branch design is described in detail in the paper to ensure the gas balance and oil return. The oil balance line is installed between two compressors in order to balance the oil level. The third solution is that two compressors share one oil separator; oil is returned back to one compressor crankcase and then through the oil balance line to feed another compressor’s crankcase. All of the above three passive solutions are working but have their own advantages and disadvantages. Test results for each solution are shown in the paper. Also, the vibration analysis and the tests are described to optimize the piping design for good acoustic result...|$|E
