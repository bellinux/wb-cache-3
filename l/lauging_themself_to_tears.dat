50|$|Voluntary {{commitment}} is the act or practice {{of a person}} admitting <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> a psychiatric hospital, or other mental health facility, voluntarily. Unlike in involuntary commitment, the person is free to leave the hospital against medical advice, though a period of notice, or the requirement that the leaving take place during daylight hours, is sometimes required.|$|R

50|$|Social {{exclusion}} {{results in}} a perceived loss of meaningfulness in life. Furthermore, the four needs for meaning (sense of purpose, efficacy, value and sense of positive self-worth) {{were found to be}} mediators in the perception of meaningfulness of life. When an individual thinks <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> be socially excluded, one's sense of purpose, efficacy, value, and self-worth are all indirectly diminished.|$|R
50|$|Social {{comparison}} {{is regarded as}} {{the way in which we}} compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.|$|R

Following this evolution fault tree analysis techniques have been extended with concept for dynamic adaptation but resulting techniques such as dynamic fault trees or state event fault trees analysis are not widely used as expected. In this report we describe a controlled experiment to analyze these two techniques with regard to their applicability and efficiency in modeling dynamic behavior of ambient assisted living systems. Results of the experiment show that DFTs are easier and more effectiv...|$|R

The teaching method {{was based on a}} method developed in 1994 by the University of Calgary. [...] Basic sciences are coupled with clinical sciences so that the students have a more comprehensive and practical foundation for each medical discipline. The curriculum design emphasizes clinical competencies which allows students to enter residency programs with greater experience with chronic disease than students educated in the majority of tertiary care-oriented academic health centers.|$|R

40|$|Adaptive agents {{provide a}} natural and clean {{way to deal with}} heterogeneous, {{distributed}} and unpredictably evolving environments, such as Internet. In this paper, we present a model of agents that are able <b>to</b> adapt <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> their environment by several ways. Using a middleware approach, our agents, called Guest, can run, communicate and move between different multiagent platforms, which are a priori incompatible. Guest agents can also change dynamically their capabilities, based on the concept of plug-ins. To build multiagent applications, Guest agents are able to organize themselves into centralized or distributed hierarchies. These agents can even change automatically their organizational models to adapt to their evolving environment, using metamodeling technique. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{whether a}} fuzzy logic rulebased {{decision support system}} {{could be used to}} detect potentially abnormal health conditions, by processing physiological data collected from vital signs monitoring devices. An application of the system to predict postural status of a person was demonstrated using real data, to mimic the effects of body position changes while doing certain normal daily activities. The results gathered in this experiment achieved accuracies of> 85 %. Applying this type of fuzzy logic approach, a decision system could be constructed to inform necessary actions by caregivers or for a person <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> make simple care decisions to manage their health situation. ...|$|R

30|$|This {{is also an}} {{important}} opportunity for mathematics teachers since a high demand of these skills are required from them with the implementation of the new K to 12 curriculum of the Department of Education (DepEd) that set changes in the framework of the mathematics learning in the Philippines. With this curriculum, teachers assigned in a year level will prepare <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> teach all contents (Number and Number Sense, Measurement, Geometry, Patterns & Algebra and Statistics and Probability) since the competencies are designed in spiral where concepts for a particular field is taught in increasing level of difficulty. Thus, studying a RL and designing a lesson plan together will enhance the teachers’ content and pedagogical knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{ascendant}} {{is specific}} {{to a particular}} time and place, to astrologers it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason astrologers believe that the ascendant is also concerned with how a person has learned <b>to</b> present <b>themself</b> <b>to</b> the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations. To astrologers, in some circumstances, it can function as a shield or mask to guard a person's real nature - in other words the 'defense mechanism' every person has to cope with unfamiliar or uncomfortable situations. Astrologers believe the ascendant also has a strong bearing on a person's physical appearance and overall health.|$|R
