A set of 35 polarization filtergrams of NOAA active region 4662 (June 9, 1985) were obtained with the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) vector magnetograph. These filtergrams measured the Stokes I, Q, U, and V intensities averaged over the instrument's filter bandpass (0. 0125 nm) for wavelengths from 0. 017 nm in the red wing to 0. 017 nm in the blue wing of the Lambda 525. 22 nm spectral <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>steps</b> of 0. 001 nm.

These structures are of interest for the implementation of resonant-type metamaterial transmission lines and for the design of planar microwave circuits based on such complementary resonators. The paper presents a method to generate the layouts of CSRR- and OCSRR-loaded microstrip lines from the elements of their equivalent circuit models. Using the so-called aggressive space mapping, a specific implementation that uses quasi-Newton type iteration, we have developed synthesis algorithms that are able to provide the topology of these CSRR- and OCSRR-loaded <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> few <b>steps.</b> The most relevant aspect, however, is that this synthesis process is completely automatic, i. e., it does not require any action from the designers, other than initiating the algorithm.
