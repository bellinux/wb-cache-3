5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a <b>lot,</b> <b>that</b> she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

Ground was broken on December 15, 2010, and the work was completed in December 2011. Work on the second phase, to expose the river in the Mill Street Courtyard, began on March 19, 2014 and was completed by August 2016. The project stimulated real estate investment in the area.|$|E
5|$|The city of Sacramento also {{wished to}} modify its section of SR 275, which, while not a freeway, was still {{designed}} for motor vehicle traffic. Capitol Mall east of postmile 0.11 (the {{east end of}} the Tower Bridge) was relinquished to the city effective January 1, 2006. A ramp from the bridge to N Street was closed in July 2007, allowing the block it had cut diagonally through to be sold. The ramp's counterpart, from L Street to the Tower Bridge, remained open, though the <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> includes it was sold to the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency in 2005. The ramp finally closed to traffic in 2016 {{in conjunction with a}} project to connect 2nd Street in Old Sacramento to Capitol Mall.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E

Renovations at the artesian well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles.

25|$|In {{downtown}} Chapel Hill, Dulaney {{talked to}} {{the owner of a}} towing service who had the contract for the Thrill's parking lot. He had set up a system of security cameras to monitor activity in the club's parking <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> might have possibly recorded anything that happened outside of the club involving Hedgepeth and Rosario while they were there that morning, or after they left. The police did not ask to see it until shortly before Dulaney wrote the article, almost 19 months after the crime.

25|$|The Church and convent of the Society of Jesus in Antigua Guatemala is a {{religious}} complex that was built between 1690 and 1698.

There were only a maximum of 13 Jesuit priest at any given time in the building, but they also hosted Jesuit brothers and secular students.

25|$|The First Baptist Church in Sycamore, Illinois {{is within}} the {{boundaries}} of the Sycamore Historic District and considered a contributing property to the historic district. As of 2007 the old First Baptist Church building was occupied by the Bethel Assembly of God. The First Baptist Church's congregation was founded in 1852. In their early years they met in Franklin Township and then, later at Sycamore's schoolhouse and in the DeKalb County Courthouse. Finally the church decided it needed a permanent building. The First Baptist Church building, erected in 1899, stands at the corner of Maple and Elm Streets in Sycamore, on a <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> was originally purchased from local citizen Hosea Willard. Built in the Gothic Revival style the church features prominently arched windows. On both the west and south facades it feature large stained glass windows.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} Brazil Squadron, Boarman succeeded Captain William D.

In the four-year period he and his family were stationed in Brooklyn one of his daughters, Mary Jane Boarman, began a relationship with William Henry Broome, longtime deputy collector of the New York Custom House; the two may have been introduced through Broome's brother John L. Broome who was serving as a marine lieutenant at the navy yard. They were married in a modest ceremony at the Commandant's House, officiated by Archbishop John Hughes, on October 18, 1853; the family regularly attended Sunday Mass at St. James' Cathedral, in all kinds of weather, where Boarman was a pew holder. Boarman later bought the house and <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> Mary Ann lived at in Brooklyn and, after her husband's death in 1876, left the property to her in his will.|$|E
25|$|Turner kept {{ownership}} of MGM from March 25 to August 26, 1986. He racked up huge debts and Turner {{simply could not}} afford to keep the studio under those circumstances. To recoup his investment, Turner sold the production/distribution assets and trademarks of MGM to United Artists, while retaining the pre-May 1986 MGM, Associated Artists Productions (the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library and Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios Popeye cartoons) and RKO Radio Pictures libraries as well as Gilligan's Island and its animated spin-offs. The studio lot was sold to Lorimar-Telepictures, which was later acquired by Warner Bros.; in 1990, the lot was sold to Sony Corporation's Columbia Pictures Entertainment in exchange for the half of Warner's <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> it had rented since the 1970s. Also in 1990, the MGM studio was purchased by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, who then merged the former Cannon with the MGM purchase to create the short-lived MGM-Pathé Communications. Parretti defaulted on the loans he'd used to buy the studio, leaving the studio {{in the hands of the}} French bank, Credit Lyonnais. Credit Lyonnais invested significant sums to revive the moribund studio and eventually sold it back to Kerkorian in 1996. Kerkorian soon expanded the company, purchasing Orion Pictures, The Samuel Goldwyn Company and Motion Picture Corporation of America from John Kluge's Metromedia in 1997, and bought a majority to the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library from its parent Philips, which was in process to sell PolyGram to Seagram.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 2000, Metro-North {{restored}} service between Dover Plains and Wassaic, a {{move the}} railroad billed {{as its first}} service expansion since it was created in 1983. As part of the project, the trailhead of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was moved from milepoint 81.6 to milepoint 82. 6,152 feet of right-of-way had to be acquired from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historical Preservation. To make up for this loss, $490,800 was received by the Transportation Enhancement Program to design and construct an access pathway from Wassaic station to the new trailhead. Wassaic was designed as and is a regional transportation hub for people living and going to Dutchess County in New York, Litchfield County in Connecticut and for Western Massachusetts. The station was built with a 250-space parking <b>lot</b> <b>that,</b> with expansion, could have 1000 parking spaces, and with a layover yard, and a light maintenance facility. One {{of the goals of}} the expansion was to provide additional parking capacity for the line. Prior to the opening of the yard at Wassaic, trains terminating at Dover Plains had to deadhead 23 miles to get to the yard at Southeast, reducing capacity on the line, while being very costly. A station was also opened at Tenmile River to serve the Taconic Developmental Disabilities Service Office. Under an alternative plan, this would have been the terminus of the line. In order to build ridership, the extension has received the same amount of service as has the line south of Dover Plains, with four AM and four PM rush hour trains with direct service to Grand Central.|$|E
