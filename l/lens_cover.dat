25|$|In 1974 Minox {{introduced}} a very compact (100mm × 61mm × 31mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, {{the first one}} in Minox 35mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob. The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|E
50|$|A single button also selects play mode, {{for viewing}} {{pictures}} and videos. This {{can turn the}} camera on and off without the need to open and close the front <b>lens</b> <b>cover.</b> The sliding <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> {{is similar to the}} W1 cover but is enhanced by a projection that makes opening and closing it easier.|$|E

50|$|The 17-35mm 2.8D ED-IF AF-S Nikkor is an F-mount {{zoom lens}} {{manufactured}} and sold by Nikon. For 35mm format cameras, this <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> a wide-angle range, and {{is well known}} as a photojournalists' lens. For Nikon DX format cameras, this <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> a wide-to-normal range.|$|R
50|$|Most Nikon F-mount <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the {{standard}} 36×24mm area of 35mm format and the Nikon FX format, while DX designated <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the 24×16mm {{area of the}} Nikon DX format, and industrial F-mount lenses have varying coverage. DX lenses may produce vignetting when used on film and FX cameras. However, Nikon lenses designed for film cameras will work on Nikon digital system cameras with the limitations noted above.|$|R

50|$|Since modern {{camera lenses}} differ {{considerably}} from older lenses, the rephotographer {{also has to}} take into account the area that the <b>lens</b> <b>covers,</b> and the depth of field available.|$|R
50|$|The AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 18-70mm 3.5-4.5G ED-IF is an F-mount {{zoom lens}} {{manufactured}} and sold by Nikon. Designed exclusively {{for use on}} Nikon DX format cameras, this <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> from wide-angle to medium-telephoto range.|$|R
50|$|Both Venera 11 and Venera 12 had landers {{with two}} cameras, each {{designed}} for color imaging. Each failed to return images when the <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> did not separate after landing {{due to a}} design flaw.|$|R

50|$|Both N95-3 and N95-4 {{have also}} some {{additional}} changes, {{such as the}} removal of the sliding <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> for the camera, improved battery life, and doubling of RAM from 64 to 128 MB.|$|E
500|$|Tube sights look {{similar to}} {{standard}} telescopic sights, with a cylindrical tube containing the optics. Many tube sights offer {{the option of}} interchangeable filters (such as polarizing or haze-reducing filters), glare-reducing , and conveniently protective [...] "flip-up" [...] <b>lens</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|DX — Lens {{designed}} for the smaller Nikon DX format. Vignetting may occur if used on a 35mm format or Nikon FX format camera in full-frame mode, although some DX <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the full 135 frame at longer focal lengths.|$|R
50|$|Transported to the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Coca {{underwent}} {{plastic surgery}} and a cosmetic <b>lens</b> <b>covered</b> her now-blind {{eye for the}} rest of her career, which resumed with her long stint in Broadway's On the Twentieth Century beginning in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Many {{incorporate}} a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom. In most models, an auto actuating <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> protects the lens from elements. Most ruggedized or water-resistant models do not retract, and most with (superzoom) capability do not retract fully.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} small {{cosmetic}} changes from the W800, but most noticeable {{is the absence}} of the classic joystick that has been found on the majority of Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the T68i. This {{has been replaced by a}} D-pad designed to improve ease of use when listening to music and to provide a longer life to the keypad (as the classic joystick tended to fail due to dust). The casing color has changed from burnt orange and cream to [...] "Satin Black" [...] or [...] "Fusion White". The sliding camera <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> has also been omitted completely. However, a K750i or W800 back cover (with <b>lens</b> <b>cover)</b> will fit with minor modifications.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> or {{lens cap}} {{provides}} protection from scratches and minor collisions for camera and camcorder lenses. Lens covers come standard with most cameras and lenses. Some mobile camera phones include lens covers, {{such as the}} Sony Ericsson W800, the Sony Ericsson K750 and the Sony Ericsson K550.|$|E
25|$|Scleral lenses are {{sometimes}} prescribed for cases of advanced or very irregular keratoconus; these <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> {{a greater proportion}} of the surface of the eye and hence can offer improved stability. Easier handling can find favor with people with reduced dexterity, such as the elderly.|$|R
50|$|Various {{companies}} sell sliding <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> and stickers {{that allow}} users to retrofit a computer or smartphone to close {{access to the}} camera lens as needed. One such company reported having sold more than 250,000 such items from 2013 to 2016. Prominent users include FBI director James Comey.|$|R
5000|$|CP.2 lenses are {{a series}} of Zeiss [...] "CompactPrime" [...] cinema lenses which present F-mount as one of three {{mounting}} options. The <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the 36×24 mm area of the 35mm format or Nikon FX format, and lenses 28 mm and longer share a common T-stop (T/) of 2.1.|$|R
5000|$|Others {{with the}} {{original}} N97 had speed problems with the built in GPS lock. These phones too easily lose track of the current location, making the free turn by turn navigation software provided by Nokia unusable. Users can have both the <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> and GPS issues fixed under warranty at an official Nokia service centre.|$|E
50|$|This {{mobile phone}} has a 2.0 {{megapixel}} camera, {{similar to that}} in the Sony Ericsson K550i but without the <b>lens</b> <b>cover.</b> As with previous Sony Ericsson models, it offers an auto-focus feature and uses a photo light instead of a flash. For this model, the focal length of the camera's lens has been reduced from 4.8mm to 3.8mm.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 {{built-in}} cameras. For {{high quality}} imaging, the main 3.2 MP camera provides the above features. Also, there is horizontal user interface for easier camera handling. The active <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> and the illuminable camera icons {{contribute to the}} intuitive operation of the K810i camera. The phone is also equipped with a VGA video call camera.|$|E
5000|$|Most Nikon F-mount <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the {{standard}} 36×24 mm area of 135 film, while [...] "DX" [...] designated <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the 24×16 mm {{area of the}} Nikon DX format DSLR sensors, {{commonly referred to as}} APS-C format. While [...] "DX" [...] lenses can be physically mounted on any Nikon film or digital SLR that support the [...] "AI" [...] exposure indexing feature (produced from 1977), there will be some degree of vignetting when used on film cameras, depending on zoom setting. All Nikon full-frame [...] "FX" [...] DSLRs have a DX-compatible mode that, by default when a DX-format lens is attached, crops the captured frames to the DX format and adjusts the viewfinder to reflect the smaller capture area. This can be overridden by the user if desired.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{photochromic}} {{eyeglass lens}} (polymer film), after exposure to sunlight {{with part of}} the <b>lens</b> <b>covered</b> by paper. Note the two levels of coloration around the dark-light interface, arising {{from the fact that}} the photochromic molecules are located in two thin films (on the front and back surfaces of the lens).|$|R
50|$|For digital EOS cameras with APS-C sensors, the EF-S 18-55mm <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> {{the same}} range. This {{is due to}} crop factor. EF-S lenses only work with Canon 1.6x crop cameras, which results in an angle of view roughly {{equivalent}} {{to that of a}} 29-90mm lens on a 35mm camera. Like the 28-90mm, the 18-55mm is also a kit lens.|$|R
5000|$|The Fujifilm FinePix Z-series {{of digital}} cameras {{consists}} of the company's ultra-slim and lightweight point-and-shoot digital cameras. [...] All Z-series camera feature non-protruding folded optics design lenses and sliding lens covers excluding the waterproof Z33WP, which has no <b>lens</b> <b>cover.</b> Early Z-series cameras featured Fujifilm's Super CCD sensor, while later ones use other CCD sensors. Some newer models (Z700EXR, Z800EXR Z900EXR and Z1000EXR) use the EXR-CMOS sensors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{routine for}} taking a {{photograph}} with a Stereo Realist is elaborate, compared to a modern camera. One must lift the <b>lens</b> <b>cover,</b> focus, manually set the aperture and shutter speed, cock the shutter and then take the picture. The wind release button must be depressed briefly while beginning to wind the film to the next frame. [...] The film winding is then completed so that the camera is ready to shoot another pair of images.|$|E
50|$|The Canon ELPH 490Z, sold as the IXUS Z90 in Europe and IXY G in Japan, was {{a compact}} Advanced Photo System {{point and shoot}} camera {{introduced}} in June 1996. The second model in the ELPH line, it featured a large circular flip-up <b>lens</b> <b>cover</b> with a built-in electronic flash and the same hybrid autofocus system used in the first ELPH. While larger than the original ELPH, the 490Z had a longer zoom lens (22.5-90mm f/5.6-8.9) and other more advanced features.|$|E
50|$|In Oculus Artificialis, Zahn's {{comprehensive}} {{description of the}} magic lantern (along with twelve other different lanterns) includes some of these lanterns showing {{for the first time}} <b>lens</b> <b>covers.</b> This was a very important evolution {{in the history of the}} camera, because it meant that the screen could be kept dark while the operator changed the slide.|$|R
