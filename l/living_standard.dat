The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{simulate}} {{the effect of}} an increase in the Superannuation Guarantee Levy (SGL) by 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively, on average <b>living</b> <b>standards.</b> We apply the Guest-McDonald model of optimal national saving for a small open economy. The simulations account for the projected age structure of the population, the differences in productivity of workers of different ages and the differences in consumption demands of young and older consumers. In this way we account for the impact of population ageing on <b>living</b> <b>standards.</b> To the extent that an increase in the SGL increases national saving beyond what it would otherwise have been, there are two effects on <b>living</b> <b>standards.</b> One is an intergenerational redistribution of <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> from the present to future generations.

The key conclusions of the paper are twofold. First, a focus on improving Canada’s productivity growth performance, and in particular, eliminating the Canada-US productivity gap, is by far the most important and effective way to attain the objective of Canadian <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> exceeding US <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> by 2016. Second, an objective for Canada of matching or exceeding the US productivity level is probably a better societal objective than equaling or exceeding US <b>living</b> <b>standards,</b> as measured by GDP per capita. Attaining this objective would certainly give Canadians the opportunity to have the same level of per capita income as Americans, but it would also give Canadians the option of choosing more leisure time, a component of economic well-being that is currently not incorporated into GDP.

25|$|Forestry has an {{important}} part {{to play in the}} amelioration of the conditions in semi-arid and arid lands. If properly planned, forestry can make {{an important}} contribution to the general welfare of the people living in desert areas. The <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> {{of the people in the}} desert is low. They can not afford other fuels like gas, kerosene etc. Fire wood is their main fuel, of the total consumption of wood about 75 percent is firewood. The forest cover in desert is low. Rajasthan has a forest area of 31150km2. which is about 9% of the geographical area. The forest area is mainly in southern districts of Rajasthan like Udaipur and Chittorgarh. The minimum forest area is in Churu district only 80km2. Thus the forest is insufficient to fulfill the needs of firewood and grazing in desert districts. This diverts the much needed cattledung from the field to the hearth. This in turn results into the decrease in agricultural production. Agroforestry model is best suited to the people of desert. Some Institutes have done good work in Agroforestry.|$|E

Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using ireal=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1-0.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation's currency in 2008–2010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best to talk of the 806,272 as being '13.43 years of retirement age salary'. It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available. It is common to not include any house value in the calculation of this necessary lump sum, so for a homeowner the lump sum pays primarily for non-housing living costs.|$|E
