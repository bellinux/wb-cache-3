40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} : This study explored nurses 2 ̆ 7 attitudes, views {{and beliefs about}} their role in long-term condition self-management. Background : Nurses are well-placed to assist individuals in long-term condition self-management. Yet, there is limited research exploring underlying beliefs of nurses regarding their role in long-term condition self-management and how those beliefs may impact on the practice of self-management. Design : A descriptive, cross-sectional qualitative design. Participants : A purposive sample of nurses (n = 14) working in primary care and secondary care settings in New Zealand. Methods : One focus group and two interviews were conducted. Data were analysed through thematic analysis by the three authors. Results : All nurses interviewed described promoting patient self-management of long-term conditions and the approaches they took {{to do so in}} practice. The nurses described a strong sense of accountability in relation to their practice. They worked to ensure patient follow-up and referrals as necessary and described themselves as <b>lynch</b> <b>pins</b> in the management of long-term conditions.

Conclusions : Nurses described both understanding of the importance of promoting patient self-management but also a strong sense of professional accountability to provide quality care.

Relevance to clinical practice : In order for nurses to work as an advocate to support optimal care it is vital that nurses recognise where patient 2 ̆ 7 s boundaries and capabilities lie.

On the August 31 episode of Raw, Charlotte overcame fellow Team PCB members' records in the first ever Divas Beat the Clock challenge, and was named the new number one contender to Nikki Bella's Divas Championship. Her title match against Nikki Bella, initially advertised for Night of Champions, took place on the September 14 episode of Raw, so Charlotte could stop Bella from surpassing AJ Lee's record and becoming the longest-reigning Divas Champion. Charlotte won the match by disqualification after she pinned Brie due to the twins switching places, causing Nikki to retain her title.

The activities of his father and brothers might have cast a shadow on Henry Tucker's political career, but he was advantageously married to Frances Brueure, the daughter of the wartime Governor, Lieutenant-Colonel George James Bruere. Brueure was Bermuda's longest serving Governor, having been appointed in 1764. His death in office in 1780 was thought to have resulted from the stress of governing a colony that was almost in rebellion. He was succeeded by his son, Lieutenant George Brueure (1744-1786), of the 18th Regiment of Dragoons, who had been wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

40|$|On August 5, 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) entry capsule {{successfully}} entered Mars' {{atmosphere and}} landed the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater. The capsule used a reaction control system (RCS) consisting of four pairs of hydrazine thrusters {{to fly a}} guided entry. The RCS provided bank control to fly along a flight path commanded by an onboard computer and also damped unwanted rates due to atmospheric disturbances and any dynamic instabilities of the capsule. A preliminary assessment of the MSL's flight data from entry showed that the capsule flew much as predicted. This paper will describe how the MSL aerodynamics team used engineering analyses, computational codes and wind tunnel testing in concert to develop the RCS system and certify it for flight. Over the course of MSL's development, the RCS configuration underwent a number of design iterations to accommodate mechanical constraints, aeroheating concerns and excessive aero/RCS interactions. A brief overview of the MSL RCS configuration design evolution is provided. Then, a brief description is presented of how the computational predictions of RCS jet interactions were validated. The primary work to certify that the RCS interactions were acceptable for flight was centered on validating computational predictions at hypersonic speeds. A comparison of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions to wind tunnel force and moment data gathered in the NASA Langley 31 -Inch Mach 10 Tunnel was the <b>lynch</b> <b>pin</b> to validating the CFD codes used to predict aero/RCS interactions.
