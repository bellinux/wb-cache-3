25|$|In his new role, Robinson {{exercised}} unprecedented {{control over}} the Navy Department bureau system. For over eighty years, the various bureaus - Ordnance, Supplies and Accounts, Medicine and Surgery, etc. - had functioned more or less autonomously, and the decentralized bureau system had acquired a reputation for parochialism and inefficiency. Bureau chiefs reigned supreme within their own domains, reporting only to the secretary or undersecretary of the Navy, and jealously guarded their statutory prerogatives against repeated attempts to consolidate uniformed authority {{in the person of}} the chief of naval operations. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the two-ocean Navy, by now scheduled to arrive in 1944, suddenly was needed immediately. To maximize construction speed, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox created a new Office of Procurement and Material and placed Robinson at its head. The new office worked through the existing bureaus to coordinate all Navy procurement, giving Robinson supervisory authority over all the bureau chiefs, a change in Navy Department governance as sudden and sweeping as the simultaneous consolidation of <b>line</b> <b>authority</b> {{in the hands of the}} commander in chief of the United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J.

50|$|Nearly {{a decade}} later after Richmond stepped down from OEO, former OEO {{official}} Joseph Califano, now President Jimmy Carter’s Secretary of DHEW, asked {{him to return to}} Federal service as Assistant Secretary for Health (July 1977).

50|$|Cycles of {{administrative}} upheaval accompanied these dramatic changes at PHS. The {{first of two}} major reorganizations reflected nearly a decade’s worth of planning, articulated in terms of operations research and functionally oriented management theory (known as program planning and budgeting). In contrast, the second was a dramatic reshuffling of the organizational deck by Acting Secretary of DHEW and Medicare program architect Wilbur Cohen. When Stewart became Surgeon General, he inherited an agency over which he, a career officer in PHS’s Commissioned Corps, exerted <b>line</b> <b>authority.</b> PHS enjoyed strong relationships with state health departments, the American Medical Association, and budgetary largesse for the National Institutes of Health. As {{a result of the}} two reorganizations, his successor would report as a senior advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, a political appointee, and would not even be appointed until well into President Nixon’s first term.|$|E
50|$|The patrol {{is divided}} into troops, or sections, each headed by a captain. Each of these Troops has either limited {{geographic}} jurisdiction or Statewide functional jurisdiction with some Troops having law enforcement functions while others have support functions. The thirteen field Troops are the primary the field activities of the patrol and are where {{the bulk of the}} patrol's troopers are assigned. These Troops are primarily responsible for the traffic enforcement and vehicle collision investigation along the state's roadways. The Turnpike Troops have the same mission as the Field Troops but have sole jurisdiction over the state's Turnpike System. The Specialized Troops, often called Sections, perform either a specialized law enforcement activity, such as the Marine Enforcement Section, or provide support to the various Field Troops. The various Troops and Sections are organized into nine Zones, each headed by a major. A tenth major serves as the patrol's inspector general. The thee deputy chiefs have <b>line</b> <b>authority</b> over these ten majors.|$|E

Multilevel management of industrial explosion hazards makes objectives and duties clear and authorities more accountable. Some sectors and companies have applied this management method in their operation, which has produced favorable results in return.|$|R

A limited survey was also conducted to ascertain opinions held of OR/MS practitioners by the end users.

The main difficulties encountered by the practitioners appear to be communication with a lack of <b>line</b> <b>authority</b> over the user. ...|$|E

If you sense this is happening to you, a frank discussion with your supervisors is in order, but you should be willing to take constructive criticism; it behooves all of us to continually work on self improvement. On the other side of the coin, I have known good scientists who were rewarded with a promotion into a management position where they failed miserably. Agencies have the authority to temporarily place a person in a position and they should exercise this authority more often to get a better handle on whether making the move permanent would be a win-win situation; allowing individuals to return to their previous position if it becomes apparent that the new move is not a good fit, can also be a win-win situation providing the ‘domino effect’ doesn’t come into play [...]...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. (Education Management) The {{problem of}} the exercisinq of {{authority}} by the headmaster, is twofold in nature. Firstly, many headmasters {{seem to be in}} doubt as to the limits of their authority. Secondly, {{the way in which the}} headmaster exercises his authority, has an effect on the motivation and work satisfaction of the staff and the pupils. Formal <b>line</b> <b>authority</b> is delegated to the headmaster in order to carry out the responsibilities concerning his post. This authority includes executive and legislative functions. The legislative function is related to the competence of the headmaster to create internal order in the school by the formulation and implementation of a school policy and rules. School policy and rules must be compatible with the government policy regarding educational affairs and must satisfy the requirements of law enforcement and legal practice. Headmasters' uncertainty about the extent and limitations of their formal authority is the result of the magnitude of statutory stipulations and prescriptions contained in official educational policy. Many headmasters also lack knowledge of law enforcement and legal practice. The dynamic nature of an authority relationship brought about by delegation, can also lead to the headmasters' uncertainty about the limits of their authority. Informal authority can be invested in the headmaster by the staff and the pupils, on account of their respect for and confidence in the headmaster. Two types of informal authority are identified: authority of competence and personal authority. It is of vital importance for the headmaster to achieve a high standard of informal authority, as the effective application of his formal authority is dependent on the quality of his informal authority...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to history, national values can also influence the way organizational innovations develop. Although the US input was substantial, TQM, Lean, and TPS originated and developed initially in Japan, and one relevant {{question is whether}} Japanese national values favored {{the development of the}} prevailing Quality Management/Production Systems. The initial rapid introduction of quality principles has been explained by a strong motivation to catch up after World War II, in combination with the Japanese pragmatism that introduced new ideas that had been shown to work in practice (cf. the Meiji Restoration in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s). Many of these ideas originated in the USA or Europe but were first combined and tested in a Japanese context. What was unique in the Japanese Quality Management/Production Systems approaches was expressed in TPS as a focus on the “reduction of cost through elimination of waste,” on “treat[ing] workers as human beings,” and on “build[ing] a system that will allow the workers to display their full capabilities by themselves”—including “having the right to make an improvement on waste” (Sugimori et al. 1977). In TQC, this was expressed in terms of involving everyone in continuous improvement and thoroughly applying learning cycles and standards. Ishikawa (1985 p 91) pointed out that “in Japan the vertical <b>line</b> <b>authority</b> relationship is too strong for staff members such as QC [quality control] specialists to have much voice…our approach has always been to educate everyone in every division and to let each person implement and promote QC.” Summarizing the characteristics of Japanese TQC, Ikezawa et al. (1987) also emphasized top leaders’ involvement, policy deployment, the use of QC circles and QC audits, and what once was perceived as unique to Japan (Ishikawa 1985 p 5)—namely, a national agenda (conferences and quality awards) promoting the diffusion of the organizational innovation. However, even this national approach was emulated both in the USA and in other Western economies.|$|E
