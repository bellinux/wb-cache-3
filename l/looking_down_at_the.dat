5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located {{in front of the}} retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a bald man <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.|$|E
25|$|An ebook {{version was}} {{released}} in July 2011 by Ridan Publishing and also contained the foreword by John Scalzi and introductions by Haldeman and Robin Sullivan (President of Ridan Publishing). The cover art depicts a soldier in a war torn setting <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helmet of a fallen comrade.|$|E

25|$|Sebastian de Belalcazar's {{monument}}: It is {{the most}} visited and popular monument in the city located in the hills overlooking the city. The monument is famous due to its pointing finger which is pointing to {{the opposite direction of}} the valley, while its face is <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{monument to}} La Fontaine {{was set up}} {{at the head of}} the Parisian Jardin du Ranelagh in 1891. The bronze bust designed by Achille Dumilâtre was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) before being placed on a high stone pedestal surrounded by various figures from the fables. The work was melted down, like many others during World War II, but was replaced in 1983 by Charles Correia’s standing statue of the fabulist <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fox and the crow on the steps and plinth below him.|$|E
25|$|Gorytus' final race of {{the season}} was the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 October, {{in which he was}} matched against the unbeaten Middle Park Stakes winner Diesis. Gorytus started the 1/2 {{favourite}} with Diesis on 2/1, while the other two runners, Gordian and Tough Commander started at odds of 33/1 and 200/1 respectively. Carson settled Gorytus in third place behind the two outsiders, with Lester Piggott restraining Diesis in last place. The favourite appeared to be going well until half way but then began to struggle and quickly dropped out of contention with Carson <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> horse's legs as if he had sustained an injury. Diesis won easily by five lengths, with Gorytus finishing last of the four runners, thirty lengths behind the third-placed Tough Commander.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous image of the Tet Offensive, a photo that was taken by Eddie Adams, was the {{photograph}} that depicted a Vietnamese man being executed by the Southern Vietnamese General, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The photo shows the moment of death for the young man. Adams won a prize for his iconic photo, which {{was said to be}} more influential than the video that was released of the same execution. The impact that the photos had on the American public was astounding. Support for the war plummeted, and though two hundred thousand troops were requested {{at the beginning of the}} Offensive, the request was denied. Adams had another photo published that, while not making as big as an impact as his other photo, was certainly gruesome. The image depicted a soldier, who appears to be a child, dead and lying on the side of the road, with a group of civilians <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> body. It was published on May 5, 1968.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Hetherington created Mr. Squiggle, a moon-dwelling {{marionette}} with {{a pencil}} for a nose, and the character first appeared on the Children's TV Club on ABC TV, as Mister Jolly Squiggle by [...] "Heth". Hetherington was granted the copyright (no.8027) for Mr. Squiggle in 1962; and his application stated that he had first created [...] "Mr. Squiggle" [...] on 1 August 1958). The marionette had a very heavy head, {{and it was always}} manipulated by and voiced by Hetherington himself as the sole operator. Since the images were drawn upside down, Hetherington would lie above the set in the rafters above <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> drawing whilst operating the marionette. The gentle politeness of Mr. Squiggle, and the gentle strength of Hetherington's well-modulated voice was immediately attractive to children, {{at a time when most}} of the other Australian TV channels had violent, raucous, and brash ventriloquist acts associated with their children's shows.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main deck}} level is seven storeys, {{some of which}} are open to the public.

2500|$|Foreman {{remained}} inactive during 1975. In 1976, {{he announced}} a comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent {{was to be}} Ron Lyle, who had been defeated by Muhammad Ali in 1975, via 11-th round TKO. At {{the end of the}} first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed. Lyle remained on the canvas and was counted out, giving Foreman the KO victory. The fight was named by The Ring as [...] "The Fight of the Year." ...|$|E
