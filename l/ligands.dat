5|$|Reducing metal {{complexes}} in {{the presence}} of a suitable coligand in excess under nitrogen gas. A common choice include replacing chloride <b>ligands</b> by dimethylphenylphosphine (PMe2Ph) to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen <b>ligands</b> attached than the original chlorine <b>ligands.</b>|$|E
5|$|As for all metals, {{molecular}} {{compounds and}} polyatomic ions of cobalt {{are classified as}} coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several <b>ligands.</b> The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness {{of a series of}} <b>ligands</b> can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co+3 complexes tend to have ammine <b>ligands.</b> Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine <b>ligands</b> tend to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).|$|E
5|$|Iron(II) {{complexes}} {{are less}} stable than iron(III) complexes but {{the preference for}} O-donor <b>ligands</b> is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They {{have a tendency to}} be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific <b>ligands</b> used.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} metrics {{which can be}} useful during hit to lead optimization: group {{efficiency}} (GE), lipophilic efficiency/lipophilic <b>ligand</b> efficiency (LipE/LLE), <b>ligand</b> lipophilicity index (LLEAT) <b>ligand</b> efficiency dependent lipophilicity (LELP), fit quality scaled <b>ligand</b> efficiency (LE_scale), size independent <b>ligand</b> efficiency (SILE).|$|R
50|$|The anionic <b>ligand</b> can be: H− (hydride), R− (alkyl), acyl, Ar− (aryl), or OR− (alkoxide). The {{ability of}} these groups to migrate is called their migratory aptitude. The neutral <b>ligand</b> can be CO, alkene, alkyne, or in some cases, even carbene. Diverse {{reactions}} apply to the migratory insertion. One mechanism involves the attack of the anionic <b>ligand</b> on the electrophilic part of the neutral <b>ligand</b> (the anionic <b>ligand</b> migrates to the neutral <b>ligand).</b> The other mechanism involves the neutral <b>ligand</b> inserts itself between the metal and the anionic <b>ligand.</b>|$|R
25|$|Binding {{affinity}} is {{most commonly}} determined using a radiolabeled <b>ligand,</b> {{known as a}} tagged <b>ligand.</b> Homologous competitive binding experiments involve binding competition between a tagged <b>ligand</b> and an untagged <b>ligand.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{a method for}} estimating <b>ligand</b> binding to a macromolecular sample under conditions where this binding is of low affinity and must be measured under equilibrium conditions, without removal of the unbound <b>ligand.</b> The method is based on centrifugal ultrafiltration through a membrane with a molecular mass cut-off intermediate between that of the <b>ligand</b> {{and that of the}} target, and the amount of bound <b>ligand</b> is calculated from the difference between the (total) <b>ligand</b> in the concentrated sample and the (free) <b>ligand</b> in the ultrafiltrate. Centrifugal ultrafiltration makes it possible to separate free <b>ligand</b> from bound <b>ligand</b> (without changing its concentration) and to simultaneously concentrate the target (such that the proportion of bound <b>ligand</b> becomes significant, even under low-affinity binding conditions). We applied this technique, using Centricon 10 (Amicon) devices, to several cases (soluble proteins, intact membranes, detergent-solubilized proteins, and pure detergent micelles) and assessed its value with respect to the common artifacts that occur in other protocols involving protein retention on nitrocellulose filters (nonspecific <b>ligand</b> adsorption and protein denaturation).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of surface <b>ligand</b> {{distribution}} pattern (<b>ligand</b> clustering and density) on the internalisation of nanoparticles by a bronchial epithelial in vitro model (Calu- 3 cells cultured as polarised layers). Control of <b>ligand</b> clustering and its surface density was achieved {{through the use of}} ovalbumin as an intermediate species to anchor the <b>ligand</b> to the nanoparticle surface. The model particulate system consisted of polystyrene nanoparticles surface-decorated via the adsorption of ovalbumin with conjugated folate <b>ligand.</b> The density of the displayed <b>ligand</b> was manipulated by controlling the conjugation level of folate to ovalbumin, while <b>ligand</b> clustering was achieved by co-adsorption of varying mixtures of folate-ovalbumin conjugate (at different <b>ligand</b> density levels) and unconjugated ovalbumin. Increasing overall <b>ligand</b> density on the nanoparticle surface resulted in increased internalisation of modified nanoparticles by the cells, up to a saturation level. Surface <b>ligand</b> density also affected the cellular uptake pathway; from predominantly clathrin to predominantly caveolae-mediated as the <b>ligand</b> density is increased. We further demonstrate that surface clustering of the folate <b>ligand</b> enhances cellular internalisation of nanoparticles, relative to its dispersed surface distribution. Our work suggests a simple way to prepare a model system where surface manipulations of <b>ligand</b> density and its distribution are possible and which can be used to study nanoparticle-cell interaction processes...|$|R

25|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive biophysical states. The binding of <b>ligands</b> to the receptor may shift the equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three types of <b>ligands</b> exist: Agonists are <b>ligands</b> that shift the equilibrium in favour of active states; inverse agonists are <b>ligands</b> that shift the equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and neutral antagonists are <b>ligands</b> that do not affect the equilibrium.
