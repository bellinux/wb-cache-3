5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> friend Baljeet that a tool {{they need}} for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E

He became concerned that the US did not have many experienced fighter pilots. This gave him an idea: since Polish squadrons had proved to be capable within the RAF and since he himself was of Polish origin and spoke Polish, he offered {{to serve as a}} liaison officer to the Polish squadrons to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> experience. The idea was approved, and he left Hawaii for Washington, D.C. in September 1942, where he was promoted to captain.|$|E

Tour groups including officials from the Ministries of Health, Public Security, Justice, Education and Finance, Commissions of Development and Reform, and Population and Family Planning, as well as law and policymakers from the State Council, visited many places, including Australia, the United States, Brazil, Thailand, Europe, and Africa.

25|$|Kamui's {{decisions}} reflects one of X main themes {{which is}} {{caring for the}} humans even if does not help the Earth. While Ohkawa considers it common sense that people care about protecting the planet, {{it is more important}} loving friends and relatives. Ohkawa also applied to Kamui and Fuma ideas she had during middle school such as the fact that both possess a dual nature as she states people can be considered good or evil. As a result of Kamui losing Kotori and all his relatives, Ohkawa placed emphasis on Kamui's friendship with Fuuma as she believes his feelings have become stronger. Across the manga, Kamui meets Subaru Sumeragi whose rivalry with Seishiro Sakurazuka serves as parallel to Kamui's rivalry with Fuma Monou. Clamp referred to Kamui and Subaru as siblings; Kamui is supposed to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> Subaru's final fight with Seishiro and avoid his final fight against Fuuma have the same tragic conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Hiroshi Hiraoka, {{who was in}} the United States {{studying}} engineering, {{introduced the}} game to his co-workers at Japan’s national railways in 1878. He and his co-workers created the first baseball team, the Shimbashi Athletic Club, and dominated other teams which popped up in Japan. However, it wasn't until 1896 when a team from Ichikō, the elite University of Tokyo preparatory school, defeated a team from the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club 29 to 4 that the sport took a dominant hold in Japanese popular culture. The match was the first recorded international baseball game in Asia. After that victory, several other universities in Japan adopted the sport, and it quickly spread throughout Japan. Since then, teams from Japan have traveled to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> American counterparts. Waseda University {{was one of the first}} teams to cross the ocean to improve their skills. In 1905, the team traveled to the United States, where it played college teams from around the country. Other universities in Japan made similar trips, and U.S. teams traveled to Japan to play.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{leadership of the}} British Army during the World War I was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army were blind {{to the realities of}} trench warfare, ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties ('lions led by donkeys'). However, during the 1960s historians such as John Terraine began to challenge this interpretation. In recent years as new documents have come forth and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as Gary D. Sheffield and Richard Holmes observe that the {{military leadership}} of the British Army on the Western Front had to cope with many problems that they could not control such as a lack of adequate military communications, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war culminating in the Hundred Days Offensive advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} cadets {{choose the}} Citizen-Leader Track to pursue civilian careers or officer training or officer candidate training programs after graduation, or attend professional or graduate schools. Eighty-three {{percent of the}} Citizen-Leader Track cadets had a job or graduate school offer in hand upon graduation in May 2016. Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or Military-Leader Track cadets not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track cadets participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior cadets learn to write a job description, freshman and sophomore cadets apply to those jobs, the upperclass cadets review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with the underclass cadets, so they can <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass cadets learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well. The Rice Center Board of Advisors, made up from executives from organizations like Northrop Grumman, Union Pacific, Dell, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, advise the Corps staff on curriculum and skill sets cadets need to develop to be more employable after graduation.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his {{managerial}} career, Wenger has trusted {{his players}} to perform and <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> own mistakes, a quality Vieira regards as his biggest strength and weakness. Wenger encourages sportsmen to show intuition, and makes observations rather than explicitly giving orders. Campbell reflected that his former manager [...] "puts {{a lot of}} onus on players to change the game" [...] and [...] "he wants certain players – especially in the last third – {{to be able to}} produce it and give something different". When Wenger joined Arsenal, he spoke of his desire to see [...] "real, modern football. That means compact lines, of zones, of quick, coordinated movements with a good technique." [...] He characteristically focuses on the strengths of his teams, rather than looking for areas to exploit the opposition.|$|E
500|$|Wipeout Pure was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis). Pre-production of the game began in August 2003 and full production occurred in October of that year, with only two staff members working on the game at that time. The team received development kits for the PlayStation Portable in August 2004; {{by this time the}} development team had grown to twenty people. Dave Burrows, one of the original two staff members who conceptualised the game, reflected in a retrospective [...] "post-mortem" [...] that the studio had to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> previous mistakes with their predecessor, Wipeout Fusion. Burrows cited that one of the principal difficulties the development team faced was that the team's artists and designers were [...] "fighting almost all of the time"; designers would first design a track for the game, then pass it over to the artists whilst the former were still making adjustments to it. Burrows also recalled that the developer's editing kits required many hours worth of [...] "tweaking", which ultimately did not result in a smooth workflow.|$|E
500|$|Kelso and Phelps {{eventually}} <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> {{investigations that}} the Fund {{is merely a}} front to conceal its true purpose: to defraud the US Federal Government. Run by several local businessmen, dignitaries, as well as Monroe and the Chief of Police, the syndicate had learnt about the proposed route for the Whitnall Parkway through the Wilshire district of the city, and thus bought the land it would run through. Monroe then built communities of [...] "matchstick" [...] houses, while Fire & Life falsely claimed the land was a higher value, knowing {{that the government would}} pay whatever the land was worth in order to gain eminent domain over it. Further investigations reveals that Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter), a headstrong corpsman of Phelps and Kelso's former unit, had been involved in the theft of the morphine. The remainder of the morphine had been given to Sheldon's mentor and pop-psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine (Peter Blomquist), who sold it on to finance the Fund and murdered Sheldon after he began questioning the syndicate's plans. Following a shoot-out at Monroe's mansion, Kelso discovers that the SRF had used Ira Hogeboom (J. Marvin Campbell), a former flamethrower operator from Phelps' and Kelso's unit, to help them with their plans. Hogeboom, suffering from PTSD and schizophrenia after inadvertently killing a large number of civilians on Phelps' orders during the Battle of Okinawa, had been unknowingly manipulated by Fontaine to torch the houses of holdouts who refused to sell out to the SRF, until eventually going insane after he inadvertently incinerates a house with an entire family inside.|$|E

2500|$|Direct tuition (differential reinforcement): The first {{concept is}} {{represented}} through direct tuition, {{also known as}} differential reinforcement. Early in a child’s development, parents are already encouraging gender-appropriate activities and discouraging cross-gender activities. Adults reward children when they display gender-appropriate behavior and punish children when they display cross-gender behavior. The idea of direct tuition expresses that gender-typed behavior begins with the child adopting views they <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> parents. Therefore, parents reinforce the developmental of gender stereotypes by providing gender-appropriate toys and activities. Adults influence a child’s gender identification when they encourage gender-typed behaviors like teaching “boys how to be boys and girls how to be girls”.|$|E

Entertainment Weeklys TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as [...] "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings".

2500|$|According to a {{research}} paper done by Radboud University, creating positive emotions help to build motivation, relationships, {{and cope with}} failure. It also helps to monitor negative emotions such as anger, frustration or anxiety and control these emotions {{in order to achieve}} a goal (Isabela Granic, Adam Lobel, and Rutger C.M.E. Engels). By learning to motivate themselves, students could push themselves to achieve goals and improve their performance academically as they would improve their performance similarly in their video games. Also, social games that rely on interactions with other people would promote healthy relationships and better communication between their fellow students, teachers and others outside of school. This could also benefit the students to work harder in class to achieve better grades and <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> mistakes and improve rather than become frustrated. [...] As video games are a favored pastime among many students, having a game that promotes positive emotions will help to alleviate stress in the classroom, making the environment fun and sociable.|$|E
