40|$|Abstract. C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific {{inflammatory}} marker, {{is widely}} used to monitor treatment of cardiovascular diseases (high serum CRP levels indicate poor outcome of heart disease). A healthy lifestyle decreases serum CRP levels, while obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking increase them. CRP, a stable pentameric protein, has a half-life of 19 hr, {{is not subject to}} diurnal variation, and can serve as a marker of wellness and a candidate for future direct access testing for people monitoring their health after adopting a healthier lifestyle. The CRP level may be influenced more by lifestyle than by genetics. Monozygotic twins may not have the same CRP level; within each twin pair, the one with higher adiposity generally has a higher CRP level than the one with low adiposity. Chronic diseases generally have a lower prevalence among Asians than among Westerners. Asians also have <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> than Westerners. In large population studies, the median CRP level of Asians is only one-tenth that of Westerners. Is there a factor in the lifestyle or diet of Asians that accounts for <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels?</b> For example, a statin inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis occurs in red yeast rice, {{an important component of the}} Asian diet. In summary, CRP is a marker for monitoring cardiovascular therapy and assessing the wellness of the general population. Through improving health and preventing disease, CRP testing may help lower a nation’s health costs...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{increasing}} evidence that vascular disease contributes to cognitive impairment and dementia. Clarification {{of the role}} of vascular risk factors in dementia is important because most are modifiable, in contrast to other risk factors such as age and genetics. METHODS: In 428 patients with mental illness we have investigated the relation of vascular disease to diagnoses, and a biochemical parameter, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is associated with inflammation and vascular disease. RESULTS: Patients with vascular disease showed higher CRP levels than patients without vascular disease. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer's disease showed <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> than patients with vascular dementia, mild cognitive impairment or depression. There is no obvious reason for this finding, since it could not be attributed to drug treatment.

Methods: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided in five groups (n= 6) control, positive control group and three experimental groups treated with 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg F. H.

Results: The results revealed that at the time of inflammation induction, indomethacin decrease inflammation; however, F. H. E. brought about immediate amelioration of the inflammation. Moreover, as time passed different treatments continued their effect and helped in reducing the inflammation though lower doses of F. H. E. showed no significant efficiency. Furthermore, the <b>level</b> of <b>CRP</b> in all treatment groups was nearly similar to the control group implying that treatment either by indomethacin or Fulcaria vulgaris was successful in <b>lowering</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> to the control level and hence, reducing the consequences of inflammation.

40|$|Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) is {{associated}} with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether CRP is causally associated with CHD or merely a marker of underlying atherosclerosis is uncertain. Methods: We used a Mendelian randomisation design to investigate the causal relationship of CRP with CHD. We identified three genetic variants in the CRP locus (rs 7553007, rs 1130864 and rs 1205) which influence <b>CRP</b> <b>levels.</b> We tested the three SNPs for association with CHD amongst 28, 112 CHD cases and 100, 823 controls. We then compared the observed relationship between the SNPs and CHD, with that predicted from the association of SNPs with <b>CRP</b> <b>levels,</b> and of <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> with CHD. Results: SNPs in the CRP locus were not associated with CHD: rs 7553007, OR 0. 98 (95 % CI, 0. 94 - 1. 01); rs 1130864, OR 1. 00 (95 % CI, 0. 86 - 1. 15); rs 1205, OR 1. 03 (95 % CI, 0. 99 - 1. 07); combined OR for all three SNPs, 1. 00 (95 % CI, 0. 97 - 1. 02), per 20 % <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> (figure).

We carried out a mendelian randomization study of the most closely associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CRP locus and published data on other CRP variants involving a total of 28, 112 cases and 100, 823 controls, to investigate the association of CRP variants with coronary heart disease. We compared our finding with that predicted from meta-analysis of observational studies of <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> and risk of coronary heart disease. For the other loci associated with <b>CRP</b> <b>levels,</b> we selected the most closely associated SNP for testing against coronary heart disease among 14, 365 cases and 32, 069 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of coronary heart disease. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in 5 genetic loci were strongly associated with <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> (% difference per minor allele) : SNP rs 6700896 in LEPR (- 14. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], - 17. 6 % to - 12. 0 %; P = 6. 2 x 10 (- 22)), rs 4537545 in IL 6 R (- 11. 5 %; 95 % CI, - 14. 4 % to - 8. 5 %; P = 1. 3 x 10 (- 12)), rs 7553007 in the CRP locus (- 20. 7 %; 95 % CI, - 23. 4 % to - 17. 9 %; P = 1. 3 x 10 (- 38)), rs 1183910 in HNF 1 A (- 13. 8 %; 95 % CI, - 16. 6 % to - 10. 9 %; P = 1. 9 x 10 (- 18)), and rs 4420638 in APOE-CI-CII (- 21. 8 %; 95 % CI, - 25. 3 % to - 18. 1 %; P = 8. 1 x 10 (- 26)). Association of SNP rs 7553007 in the CRP locus with coronary heart disease gave an odds ratio (OR) of 0. 98 (95 % CI, 0. 94 to 1. 01) per 20 % <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>level.</b> Our mendelian randomization study of variants in the CRP locus showed no association with coronary heart disease: OR, 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 97 to 1. 02; per 20 % <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>level,</b> compared with OR, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 94 to 0. 95; predicted from meta-analysis of the observational studies of <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> and coronary heart disease (z score, - 3. 45; P <. 001). SNPs rs 6700896 in LEPR (OR, 1. 06; 95 % CI, 1. 02 to 1. 09; per minor allele), rs 4537545 in IL 6 R (OR, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 91 to 0. 97), and rs 4420638 in the APOE-CI-CII cluster (OR, 1. 16; 95 % CI, 1. 12 to 1. 21) were all associated with risk of coronary heart disease. CONCLUSION: The lack of concordance between the effect on coronary heart disease risk of CRP genotypes and <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> argues against a causal association of CRP with coronary heart disease...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Low {{physical}} activity levels and high serum C-reactive protein (<b>CRP)</b> <b>levels</b> are risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) in both men and women. However, postmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may have increased risk of CAD because of HRT-related increases in serum CRP. There are two manuscripts in this dissertation. The purpose of the first manuscript {{was to determine whether}} higher {{physical activity}} energy expenditure was associated with <b>lower</b> serum <b>CRP,</b> independent of oral HRT status and body fatness, in 133 postmenopausal women. Higher physical activity energy expenditures were significantly associated with <b>lower</b> serum <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> (r=- 0. 21, p= 0. 0 l 9), independent of oral HRT use, age, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, aspirin use, and statin use. However, in the complete multivariate model, which included body fat, the association between higher physical activity and <b>lower</b> serum <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> was abolished. The purpose of the second study was to quantify the biological variability of insulin resistant CAD risk factors in a sample of 8 postmenopausal women. Risk factor outcomes, including serum total cholesterol, serum triglycerides (TG), serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum glucose, plasma insulin, serum CRP, waist and hip circumferences, abdominal sagittal diameter, body fat, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, and self-reported physical activity energy expenditure, were measured on two occasions, 7 - 12 days apart. High absolute biological variability values (by standard error of measurement) were observed for serum TG (32. 0 mg/dl), serum CRP (5. 6 mg/l), SBP (4. 0 mmHg), and physical activity (9. 4 kcal/kg/week).

Obesity is associated with high plasma c-reactive proten (CRP) levels, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Mediterranean diet (MD), low-carbohydrate diets (LCD), and very-low-carbohydrate diets (VLCD) are gaining popularity and have been studied for their effects on CRP. Purpose: The goal {{of this study is}} to compare the effects of the MD, LCD, and VLCD on CRP levels. Method: A systematic evidence-based literature review was conducted comparing these diets. Medline, PubMed, and FirstSearch databases were searched using the MeSH terms c-reactive protein, low-carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, ketogenic diet, and inflammatory markers. Results: Twelve studies examined either of the three diets and their effects on CRP. Each diet has similar effects on CRP in obese individuals. Four studies examined the MD while the other eight a LCD or VLCD. Half of the articles for the MD showed significant decrease in CRP whereas the other half revealed no significant change in CRP. Four LCD and two VLCD articles showed significant reduction in CRP while one LCD and one VLCD study revealed no change.

40|$|Abstract Background Elevated {{baseline}} C-reactive protein (CRP) {{levels are}} associated with increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Several CRP gene variants {{have been associated with}} altered baseline CRP levels in ambulatory populations. However, the influence of CRP gene variants on CRP levels during inflammatory states, such as surgery, is largely unexplored. We describe the association between candidate CRP gene variants and postoperative plasma CRP levels in patients undergoing primary, elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods Using a multicenter candidate gene association study design, we examined the association between seventeen candidate CRP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and inferred haplotypes, and altered postoperative CRP levels in 604 patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Perioperative CRP levels were measured immediately prior to surgery, post-CPB and on postoperative days (POD) 1 – 4. Results CRP levels were significantly elevated at all postoperative time points when compared with preoperative levels (P P = 2. 4 × 10 - 4) and <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> across all postoperative time points (P = 4. 8 × 10 - 5). rs 1800947 remained highly significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. Conclusion We identified a CRP gene SNP associated with lower postoperative CRP levels in patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Further investigation is needed to clarify the significance of this association between CRP gene variants and the acute-phase rise in postoperative CRP levels with regard to the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective—The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether C-reactive protein (CRP) gene variants affect baseline and training-induced changes in plasma CRP levels. Methods and Results—Sixty-three sedentary men and women aged 50 to 75 years old underwent baseline testing (VOmax, body composition, CRP levels). They repeated these tests after 24 weeks of exercise training while on a low-fat diet. The CRP 219 G/A variant significantly associated with CRP levels before and after training after accounting for the effects of demographic and biological variables. CRP 732 A/G genotype was significantly related on a univariate basis to CRP levels after training. The CRP 29 T/A variant did not affect CRP levels before or after training. In regression analyses, the 219 and 732 variants each had significant effects on CRP levels before and after training. Subjects homozygous for the common A/G 732 / 219 haplotype exhibited the highest CRP levels, and having the rare allele at either site was associated with significantly <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels.</b> CRP levels decreased significantly with training (0. 380. 18 mg/L; P 0. 03). However, none of the CRP variants was associated with the training-induced CRP changes. Conclusion—CRP 219 G/A and 732 A/G genotypes and haplotypes and exercise training appear to modulate CRP levels. However, training-induced CRP reductions appear to be independent of genotype at these loci. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2004; 24 : 1874 - 1879.)

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} aimed at verifying whether {{activation}} of platelets might represent a source of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta levels in hypercholesterolemia. To this purpose, we compared {{the effects of a}} short-term treatment with simvastatin or low-dose aspirin on circulating levels of this cytokine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomly allocated to receive an 8 -week therapeutic course of simvastatin 20 mg daily (n= 25) or aspirin 100 mg daily (n= 25). Baseline soluble (s) P-selectin directly correlated with IL- 1 beta (P< 0. 0001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P< 0. 05) but not with von Willebrand factor, total cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol levels. Furthermore, sP-selectin (P< 0. 02) and IL- 1 beta (P< 0. 0001) levels were independently related to CRP by multiple regression analysis. Both drugs were associated with comparable, significant reductions in IL- 1 beta and sP-selectin. Simvastatin, but not aspirin treatment, significantly <b>lowered</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> (P< 0. 05). The change in IL- 1 beta levels correlated with the change in sP-selectin in patients randomized to either simvastatin (Rho, 0. 42; P< 0. 05) or aspirin (Rho, 0. 42; P< 0. 05). In contrast, the simvastatin-induced change in IL- 1 beta did not correlate with the change in <b>CRP</b> <b>levels.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that platelets might contribute to IL- 1 beta production in hypercholesterolemia, thus providing an additional link between inflammation and the prothrombotic state in this setting...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE – Minimal {{invasive}} {{mitral valve}} repair has become standard of care. It {{is a safe}} and durable alternative to conventional median sternotomy, resulting in less pain and faster recovery. The factors contributing to these advantages remain poorly understood. We studied the biological effects of full sternotomy compared to minithoracotomy for mitral valve surgery. METHODS – Single centre data from patients who underwent mitral valve surgery were retrospectively collected. Patients were divided in two groups based upon type of surgery: Full Sternotomy or Port-Access. Propensity score matching, based upon age, gender, BSA, NYHA, preoperative rhythm, and medical history was performed. Perioperative characteristics, including biochemical data of the first 10 days postoperatively (Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, Red blood cell count, Plateled count, White blood cell count, C-reactive protein, Creatinine, and Troponine) were collected for analysis. RESULTS – Each group of the matched cohort consisted of 126 patients. Port-Access was associated with significant longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, longer aortic cross-clamp times, shorter hospital and intensive care stay. The amount of blood transfused, and inotropic agents and vasopressors administered were lower in Port-Access. Analysis of biochemical characteristics show a faster recovery of blood cell counts, <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> and less increase in troponin levels after Port-Access surgery. CONCLUSIONS – Port-access mitral valve surgery, though associated with longer cardio-pulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times, results in faster haematological recovery, less inflammatory response, and less myocardial damage. These factors {{may contribute to the}} faster recovery after minimal invasive mitral valve surgery. status: publishe...|$|E

We analyzed 4, 707 participants (1, 943 men and 2, 764 women) from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective follow-up study of subjects aged 55 years or older in the Netherlands. At baseline (1989 – 1993), dietary intake of PUFAs was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaire. CRP was measured at baseline and at the third study visit (1997 – 1999). Regression coefficients (β) and 95 % confidence intervals were obtained using linear gen-eralized estimating equations. Dietary intake of butter andmargarine explainedmost {{of the variance in}} PUFA intake. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, higher intake of total PUFAs was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> (fourth quartile vs. first quartile: β =− 0. 08, 95 % confidence interval: − 0. 15, − 0. 01). Similarly, intake of n- 6 PUFAs was inversely related to CRP (fourth quartile vs. first: β =− 0. 09, 95 % confidence interval: − 0. 16, − 0. 01). No consistent trends were observed regarding n- 3 PUFAs or n- 3 :n- 6 PUFA ratio and CRP. These findings suggest that high intakes of total PUFAs are associated with lower levels of CRP, reflecting diminished chronic systemic inflammation, which in our study was mainly driven by n- 6 PUFAs.

Aim of this secondary analysis was to identify patient subgroups which differ in the decline of beta cell function during treatment with atorvastatin. The randomized placebo-controlled Diabetes and Atorvastatin (DIATOR) Trial included 89 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and detectable islet autoantibodies (mean age 30 years, 40 % females), in 12 centers in Germany. Patients received placebo or 80 mg/d atorvastatin for 18 months. As primary outcome stimulated serum C-peptide levels were determined 90 min after a standardized liquid mixed meal. For this secondary analysis patients were stratified by single baseline characteristics which were considered to possibly be modified by atorvastatin treatment. Subgroups defined by age, sex or by baseline metabolic parameters like body mass index (BMI), total serum cholesterol or fasting C-peptide did not differ in C-peptide outcome after atorvastatin treatment. However, the subgroup defined by high (above median) baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations exhibited higher stimulated C-peptide secretion after statin treatment (p =  0. 044). Individual baseline CRP levels correlated with C-peptide outcome in the statin group (r(2)  =  0. 3079, p< 0. 004). The subgroup with baseline CRP concentrations above median differed from the corresponding subgroup with <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> by higher median values of BMI, IL- 6, IL- 1 RA, sICAM- 1 and E-selectin. Atorvastatin treatment may be effective in slowing the decline of beta cell function in a patient subgroup defined by above median levels of CRP and other inflammation associated immune mediators.

40|$|Abstract: The {{major public}} health concern {{worldwide}} is coronary heart disease, with dyslipidemia {{as a major}} risk factor. Statin drugs are recommended by several guidelines for both primary and secondary prevention. Rosuvastatin has been widely accepted because of its efficacy, potency, and superior safety profile. Inflammation is involved in all phases of atherosclerosis, with the process beginning in early youth and advancing relentlessly for decades throughout life. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-studied, nonspecific marker of inflammation which may reflect general health risk. Considerable evidence suggests CRP is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events, but direct involvement in atherosclerosis remains controversial. Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, hydrophilic statin with unique stereochemistry. A large proportion of patients achieve evidence-based lipid targets while using the drug, and it slows progression and induces regression of atherosclerotic coronary lesions. Rosuvastatin <b>lowers</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> significantly. The Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial was designed after the observation that when both low density lipoprotein and CRP were reduced, patients fared better than when only LDL was lowered. Advocates and critics alike acknowledge {{that the benefits of}} rosuvastatin in JUPITER were real. After a review, the US Food and Drug Administration extended the indications for rosuvastatin to include asymptomatic JUPITER-eligible individuals with one additional risk factor. Th...|$|R

Material and methods: The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: 28 PHD patients (main group) received atorvastatin, 20 mg once a day for 30 days, and 26 patients (control group) had PHD only. Endothelin 1 - 21 (ET) level and von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity were determined by enzyme immunoassay, nitric oxide (NO) levels — spectrophotometrically, C-reactive protein (CRP) — by immunoturbidimetric method, fibrinogen — by Clauss method. Results: After 30 days of observation, control patients were found to have NO and ET increase, as well as the reduced activity of vWF relative to initial data, while fibrinogen and <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> scarcely changed. The main group patients had similar changes of endothelial condition values, and their fibrinogen and <b>CRP</b> <b>levels</b> decreased.

SUBJECTS: 46 patients with severe TBI, randomised to epoprostenol (n[*]=[*] 23) or placebo (n[*]=[*] 23). TREATMENT: Epoprostenol, 0. 5  ng[*]·[*]kg(- 1) [*]·[*]min(- 1), or placebo (saline) was given intravenously for 72  hours and then tapered off over the next 24  hours. METHODS: Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), soluble intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels were measured over five days. Measurements were made at 24  h intervals ≤ 24  h after TBI to 97 - 120  h after TBI. RESULTS: A significantly <b>lower</b> <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> was detected in the epoprostenol group compared to the placebo group within 73 - 96  h (p[*]=[*] 0. 04) and within 97 - 120  h (p[*]=[*] 0. 008) after trauma. IL- 6 within 73 - 96  h after TBI was significantly lower in the epoprostenol group compared to the placebo group (p[*]=[*] 0. 04). ADMA was significantly increased within 49 - 72  h and remained elevated, but there was no effect of epoprostenol on ADMA levels. No significant differences between the epoprostenol and placebo groups were detected for IL- 8 or sICAM- 1. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the prostacyclin analogue epoprostenol significantly decreased CRP and, to some extent, IL- 6 levels in patients with severe TBI compared to placebo. These findings indicate an interesting option for treatment of TBI and warrants future larger studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier, NCT 01363583...|$|R
