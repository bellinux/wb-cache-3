5|$|The Gliders {{returned}} to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, {{in front of a}} capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders reverse this in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 {{in the first half of}} third, 6–4 in the <b>last</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the <b>last</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven assists. The loss raised the prospect that Australia might not make the finals at all, but Crispin remained confident that they could.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during the <b>last</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the night, and return {{to one of their}} nests prior to sunrise.

During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E

5|$|The {{islands of}} the Clyde may well have formed the power base of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde and his {{descendants}} by the <b>last</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 12th century.

The western extension of Scottish authority appears to have been one of the factors behind a Norwegian invasion of the region in 1230, in which the invaders seized Rothesay Castle.|$|E

5|$|The mosaics of Delos form a {{significant}} corpus of surviving ancient Greek mosaic art.

Hellenistic mosaics were no longer produced after roughly 69 BC, due to warfare with the Kingdom of Pontus and subsequently abrupt decline of the island's population and position as a major trading center. Among Hellenistic Greek archaeological sites, Delos contains one of the highest concentrations of surviving mosaic artworks as well as rare Greek wall paintings.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the <b>last</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Following Mikan's {{retirement}} in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but {{still managed to}} win 40 games.

Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year. Mikan came back for the <b>last</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season. Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games. They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.|$|E
