5|$|This {{situation}} led to frustration {{among the}} English nobility. In {{addition to the}} Scottish issue, there was also discontent with the king's treatment of his favourite, Piers Gaveston. Gaveston's promotion from relative obscurity to Earl of Cornwall, combined with his arrogant behaviour, caused resentment among the established nobility. Gloucester was initially not hostile to Gaveston, who had married Gloucester's sister Margaret in October 1307. He did, however, share in the other earls' frustration with Edward's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative</b> towards Scotland. In 1308, therefore, Gloucester was among the earls who demanded Gaveston's exile, a demand the king was forced to meet. After this, {{he seems to have}} been reconciled with the king, and in 1309 he acted as a mediator when the earls agreed to Gaveston's return. Relations between the king and the nobility deteriorated even further, however, after Gaveston's return. In 1310, a group of so-called Lords Ordainers were appointed to draft the Ordinances of 1311, a set of restrictions on the rule of EdwardII, including a renewed exile for Gaveston. Gloucester, who was still a supporter of the king, was not initially among the Ordainers, but was appointed on 4March 1311, upon the death of the Earl of Lincoln.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the models for developing managerial competences in different types of Brazilian multinationals. The main premise is that Brazilian multinationals need to develop non local competences in their subsidiaries in order to compete on equal terms with established multinationals in the global market. The article is based on a research survey conducted with sixty-six foreign subsidiaries of thirty multinationals of Brazilian origin. The results show that the development of non local competences is associated with four essential factors. Subsidiaries with non local competence show greater insertion of the subsidiary in foreign business networks, location in dynamic competitive contexts, greater intensity <b>of</b> <b>initiatives</b> and a strong integration between headquarters and subsidiaries. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiatives</b> and location in adverse contexts characterize the development of specific competences. Lower insertion of the subsidiary in foreign business networks and less integration with the internal network characterize the development of local competences...|$|R

[...] The Athenians, accordingly, rejected the Mytilenean offer, and when the ambassadors returned to Lesbos bearing this news all the cities of Lesbos save Methymna openly declared war on Athens.

60|$|James Cushat-Prinkly was a {{young man}} who had always had a settled {{conviction}} that one of these days he would marry; up to the age of thirty-four he had done nothing to justify that conviction. He liked and admired a great many women collectively and dispassionately without singling out one for especial matrimonial consideration, just as one might admire the Alps without feeling that one wanted any particular peak as one’s own private property. His <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative</b> in this matter aroused a certain amount of impatience among the sentimentally-minded women-folk of his home circle; his mother, his sisters, an aunt-in-residence, and two or three intimate matronly friends regarded his dilatory approach to the married state with a disapproval that was far from being inarticulate. His most innocent flirtations were watched with the straining eagerness which a group of unexercised terriers concentrates on the slightest movements of a human being who may be reasonably considered likely to take them for a walk. No decent-souled mortal can long resist the pleading of several pairs of walk-beseeching dog-eyes; James Cushat-Prinkly was not sufficiently obstinate or indifferent to home influences to disregard the obviously expressed wish of his family that he should become enamoured of some nice marriageable girl, and when his Uncle Jules departed this life and bequeathed him a comfortable little legacy it really seemed the correct thing to do to set about discovering some one to share it with him. The process of discovery was carried on more by the force of suggestion and the weight of public opinion than by any initiative of his own; a clear working majority of his female relatives and the aforesaid matronly friends had pitched on Joan Sebastable as the most suitable young woman in his range of acquaintance to whom he might propose marriage, and James became gradually accustomed to the idea that he and Joan would go together through the prescribed stages of congratulations, present-receiving, Norwegian or Mediterranean hotels, and eventual domesticity. It was necessary, however to ask the lady what she thought about the matter; the family had so far conducted and directed the flirtation with ability and discretion, but the actual proposal would have to be an individual effort.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Governance and Development, 2008. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 63 - 66). Union Parishad (UP) is the oldest Local Government institution in our country. Over the years, the organisation has changed its structure {{a number of times}} {{in order to make it}} more people-oriented and responsive to poverty alleviation and rural development intiatives. At present, this thirteen member organisation has the opportunity to form a number of standing Committees for ensuring good governance at the grass roots level. Since initiatives have been started to strengthen our Local Government institutions for the balanced development of the country, a strong UP with the active participation of Standing Committees is urgently needed. Considering the debate regarding the effectiveness of the Standing Committees, the objectives of this study are to examine the scope and performance of Standing Committees and to assess the involvement of female members in the said committees. The study was conducted in 10 Union Parishads in two different Upazilas of two districts of Bangladesh. Findings of the study indicate that though Standing Committees have a high potential of ensuring transparency and accountability of Union Parishads, involving cross section of people in decision making process, reducing the dominance of one¬man show of UP Chairmen, ensuring proper utilization of Annual Development Programme and Block Grants, and encouraging female members to perform important responsibilities at the local; the actual scenario is not that much encouraging. The reasons behind the sluggish performance of Standing Committees may be attributed to a number of factors such as <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiatives</b> <b>of</b> UP members, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> pressure from the common people, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> political pressure, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> skills required for planning and implementing development programmes at the local level, no specific terms of references of Standing Committees, unwillingness on the part of UP Chairman to delegate authority and even non- existence of Standing Committees or existence only on paper.
