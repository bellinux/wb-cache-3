While the LSTs were unloaded quickly enough, the seven bulk loaded LCTs were not, due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading. The last was not unloaded until 14:30. At 13:00, six LSTs heading for Red Beach {{were attacked by}} a force of about 70 Japanese aircraft. Some 48 Lockheed P-38 <b>Lightnings</b> were vectored to assist. USS LST-473 was rocked by two bomb hits and two near misses from Val dive bombers. Eight Americans were killed and 37 Americans and Australians wounded. USS LST-471 was torpedoed {{on the port side}} aft by a Betty bomber; 43 Americans and Australians were killed and 30 were wounded. Particularly hard hit were the commandos of the 2/4th Independent Company, which lost 34 dead and 7 wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, India {{arranged}} to purchase Hunters {{as a part}} of a wider arms deal with Britain, ordering 140 Hunter single-seat fighters at the same time that Pakistan announced its purchase of several North American F-86 Sabre jet fighters. The Indian Air Force (IAF) was the first to operate the Hunter T.66 trainers, placing an initial order in 1957. The more powerful engine was considered beneficial in a hot environment, allowing for greater takeoff weights. During the 1960s, Pakistan investigated the possibility of buying as many as 40 English Electric <b>Lightnings,</b> but Britain was unenthusiastic about the potential sales opportunity because of the damage it would do to its relations with India, which at the time was still awaiting the delivery of large numbers of ex-RAF Hunters.|$|E

5|$|Air {{support was}} {{provided}} by No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, which included several Royal Australian Air Force squadrons such as No. 4 Squadron RAAF, flying CAC Boomerangs and Wirraways, and No. 24 Squadron RAAF equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers; these units undertook numerous close air support and resupply missions throughout the campaign. American Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and Lockheed P-38 <b>Lightnings</b> from the 348th and 475th Fighter Groups were also used to provide fighter cover for Allied shipping, while heavy and medium bombers from the Fifth Air Force carried out strategic bombing missions to reduce Japanese airbases around Wewak and New Britain, and raided Japanese lines of communication in concert with PT boats. Due to the impracticalities of using wheeled transport in the jungle, Allied logistics was undertaken primarily by means of water transport such as landing craft and barges which moved supplies along the coast, with overland supply to combat units being completed by New Guinean labourers and, at times, by Australian combat troops themselves, which were re-roled temporarily to undertake portage tasks as required, and augmented where possible with jeeps.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the planned refit of HMS Eagle {{to allow her to}} operate the Phantom, a total of 20 airframes that had originally been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm were diverted to the Royal Air Force to serve in the air defence role. At the time, the RAF's primary interceptor was the English Electric Lightning, which suffered badly both in terms of range, loiter time and weapons fit, all of which hampered its effectiveness, especially in long interceptions of Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation bombers and reconnaissance aircraft over the North Sea and North Atlantic. So a new Phantom squadron was formed at RAF Leuchars, the UK's most northerly air defence base at the time, {{to take advantage of the}} improvements that the Phantom provided over the Lightning – it could carry more fuel, and could thus fly further for longer; it was fitted with a more powerful radar; and it could carry more missiles (up to 8, compared to 2 for the Lightning). On 1 September 1969, 43 Squadron was formed at Leuchars, operating as part of the UK's northern QRA zone alongside the <b>Lightnings</b> of 11 Squadron and 23 Squadron until, in 1972, 11Squadron was redeployed to join 5 Squadron at RAF Binbrook and was replaced by the Royal Navy Phantoms of the Phantom Training Flight (PTF) and 892 Naval Air Squadron.|$|E
5|$|After the Falklands War, the UK {{government}} began upgrading the defences of the Falkland Islands {{to guard against}} any further aggression from Argentina. One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands, with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983. At the time, the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado was still in development, meaning that the Phantom was the UK's primary air defence aircraft (supported by two remaining squadrons of <b>Lightnings).</b> The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left {{a gap in the}} UK's air defences and nothing immediately available to fill it, given that the Tornado was still some years from service. As a result, the UK government decided to purchase another squadron of Phantoms. Because the aircraft in RAF service were a special production batch built to UK specifications, it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft, so 15 second-hand airframes were procured from among the best of the ex-US Navy F-4Js stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and the Naval Air Rework Facility at NAS North Island. The F-4J was chosen because it was the variant from which the RAF's F-4Ks and F-4Ms were developed, and was thus the closest available to the British aircraft. The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought to a standard almost equivalent to the F-4S, which was the last variant in service with the US Navy, the only differences being the absence of leading-edge slats and a helmet gun sight.|$|E

5|$|In May 1982, three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward {{deployed}} to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air {{cover for the}} RAF's operations during the Falklands War, replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron, which were transiting to the war zone. In August 1982, {{following the end of}} the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway, 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands. Late the following year, 23 Squadron took up the role, remaining stationed there until October 1988, when they were replaced by 1435 Flight. To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado. Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of <b>Lightnings,</b> but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham, alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region. Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained. The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a {{reduction in the number of}} air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992. However, just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby, the UK's participation in the First Gulf War, when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward {{deployed to}} provide air defence cover at RAF Akrotiri; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the Gulf region. Following their final withdrawal from service, with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped. Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.|$|E

The first Kuwait aircraft, a T.55K first flew on 24 May 1968 and deliveries to Kuwait started in December 1968. The Kuwaitis somewhat overestimated {{their ability to}} maintain such a complex aircraft, not adopting the extensive support from BAC and Airwork Services that the Saudis used to keep their <b>Lightnings</b> operational, so serviceability was poor. The Kuwaiti <b>Lightnings</b> {{did not have a}} long service career; after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Egypt in 1973, Kuwait replaced its last <b>Lightnings</b> with Dassault Mirage F1s in 1977.

Maximum induced voltage of indirect <b>lightning</b> is computed by using Rusck theory, then indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes are simulated by using ATP-EMTP. In this paper, five conditions are simulated. The first condition is the distribution line without the indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters and the ground wire is installed, the second condition is the indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes without the 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters and ground wire, the third condition is indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with the ground wire is installed and without the 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arrester, the fourth condition is the indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters are installed and without the ground wire, and the fifth condition is the indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes with the 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters and ground wire is installed. The simulation results show that the ground wire is able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from the indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes, the 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters are able to reduce the effect of the induced voltage from the indirect <b>lightning</b> strikes, and the best results are obtained when the ground wire and the 15 kV <b>lightning</b> arresters are installed on the distribution line...|$|R
