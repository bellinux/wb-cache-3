500|$|After the {{introduction}} of Sensurround, movie theater owners began installing permanent subwoofer systems. Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track was a six channel film sound format introduced in 1976 that used two subwoofer channels for stereo reproduction of low frequencies. In 1981, Altec introduced a dedicated cinema subwoofer model tuned to around 20Hz: the 8182. Starting in 1983, THX certification of the cinema sound experience quantified the parameters of good audio for watching films, including requirements for subwoofer performance levels and enough isolation from outside sounds so that noise did {{not interfere with the}} listening experience. This helped provide guidelines for multiplex cinema owners who wanted to isolate each individual cinema from its neighbors, even as louder subwoofers were making isolation more difficult. Specific cinema subwoofer models appeared from JBL, Electro-Voice, Eastern Acoustic Works, Kintek, Meyer Sound Laboratories and BGW Systems in the early 1990s. In 1992, Dolby Digital's six-channel film sound format incorporated a single <b>LFE</b> <b>channel,</b> the [...] "point one" [...] in 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
500|$|The first subwoofers were {{developed}} in the 1960s to add bass response to home stereo systems. Subwoofers came into greater popular consciousness in the 1970s {{with the introduction of}} Sensurround in movies such as Earthquake, which produced loud low-frequency sounds through large subwoofers. With the advent of the compact cassette and the compact disc in the 1980s, the easy reproduction of deep and loud bass was no longer limited by the ability of a phonograph record stylus to track a groove, and producers could add more low frequency content to recordings. As well, during the 1990s, DVDs were increasingly recorded with [...] "surround sound" [...] processes that included a low-frequency effects (<b>LFE)</b> <b>channel,</b> which could be heard using the subwoofer in home theater systems. During the 1990s, subwoofers also became increasingly popular in home stereo systems, custom car audio installations, and in PA systems. By the 2000s, subwoofers became almost universal in sound reinforcement systems in nightclubs and concert venues.|$|E
50|$|As {{the table}} shows, the bass manager directs bass {{frequencies}} from all channels {{to one or}} more subwoofers, not just the content of the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel.</b> However, when there is no subwoofer, the bass manager would direct the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> to the main speakers. This is the only time the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> would not be sent to the subwoofer.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be {{expressed}} {{as the number of}} full-range channels in front of the listener, separated by a slash from the number of full-range channels beside or behind the listener, separated by a decimal point from the number of limited-range <b>LFE</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Released 2000. http://www.creative.com/soundblaster/milestones/2000-2001.asp Live! {{with added}} outputs for a center <b>channel</b> speaker and <b>LFE</b> {{subwoofer}} <b>channel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 Remember the Future {{was once}} again re-{{released}}, but this time by the UK's Eclectic Discs/Dream Nebula Recordings. For this reissue [...] the remastered version was used and they added a third Radio edit of the title track. This version was also released as a SACD, which includes a 5.1 surround mix (which was actually the original 1973 quadraphonic mix with derived center and <b>LFE</b> <b>channels</b> added); the 2 channel audio CD layer contains the 2002 remix. Track 3 ("Remember the Future") is an edit released on a various artists compilation album titled [...] "Made In Germany." [...] Tracks 4 and 5 are radio promo only single edits.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{notation}} difference {{before and}} after the bass management system. Before the bass management system there is a Low Frequency Effects (<b>LFE)</b> <b>channel.</b> After the bass management system there is a subwoofer signal. A common misunderstanding is the belief that the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is the [...] "subwoofer channel". The bass management system may direct bass to one or more subwoofers (if present) from any channel, not just from the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel.</b> Also, if there is no subwoofer speaker present then the bass management system can direct the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> to {{one or more of the}} main speakers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> {{delivers}} bass-only {{information to}} supplement the overall bass content. The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> content {{is not the same}} as the content of a subwoofer-out jack. The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is used to carry additional bass information in the Dolby Digital program, while the subwoofer output is bass information from up to all six channels that has been selected to be reproduced by the subwoofer via a bass management system.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] ".2" [...] in 10.2 {{refers to}} the fact that an {{additional}} Low Frequency Effects channel is added, not just a second subwoofer, to enhance the sense of envelopment. All bass from the left channels are directed to a left <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> while right channel bass is directed to the right <b>LFE</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|MPEG-2 Part 7 defined three profiles: Low-Complexity profile (AAC-LC / LC-AAC), Main profile (AAC Main) and Scalable Sampling Rate profile (AAC-SSR). AAC-LC profile {{consists}} of a base format very much like AT&T's Perceptual Audio Coding (PAC) coding format, {{with the addition of}} temporal noise shaping (TNS), the Dolby Kaiser Window (described below), a nonuniform quantizer, and a reworking of the bitstream format to handle up to 16 stereo channels, 16 mono channels, 16 low-frequency effect (<b>LFE)</b> <b>channels</b> and 16 commentary channels in one bitstream. The Main profile adds a set of recursive predictors that are calculated on each tap of the filterbank. The SSR uses a 4-band PQMF filterbank, with four shorter filterbanks following, in order to allow for scalable sampling rates.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic and}} most common {{version of the}} format is a 5.1-channel system, similar to a Dolby Digital setup, which encodes the audio as five primary (full-range) {{channels}} plus a special <b>LFE</b> (low-frequency effects) <b>channel</b> for the subwoofer.|$|R
2500|$|DVD-Audio {{offers many}} {{possible}} configurations of audio channels, ranging from single-channel mono to 5.1-channel surround sound, at various sampling frequencies and sample rates. (The [...] ".1" [...] denotes a Low-frequency effects <b>channel</b> (<b>LFE)</b> for bass and/or special audio effects.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Low Frequency Effects (LFE) mixes the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> (bass) with front speaker {{channels}} ...|$|E
5000|$|E.g. 3 front {{channels}} + 2 side channels + an <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> = 3/2.1 ...|$|E
5000|$|The key {{concept is}} that the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is not the [...] "subwoofer channel".|$|E
5000|$|Stereo {{receivers}} {{have two}} channels of amplification, while AV receivers {{may have more}} than two. The standard for AV receivers is five channels of amplification. These are usually referred to as 5.1 receivers. This provides for a left, right, center, left surround and right surround speaker to be powered by the receiver. 7.1 receivers are becoming more common and provide for two additional surround channels, left rear surround and right rear surround. The [...] ".1" [...] refers to the <b>LFE</b> (low-frequency effects/bass) <b>channel,</b> the signal of which is usually sent to an amplified subwoofer unit. 5.1 and 7.1 receivers don't usually provide amplification for this channel. Instead, they provide a line level output.|$|R
50|$|The '.1' in 5.1, 7.1 etc. {{refers to}} the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel,</b> {{which is also a}} {{discrete}} channel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> {{originated}} in Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track film prints, {{as a way}} of providing louder bass and sub-bass effects, without detracting from the quality of the standard audio channels. The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is conventionally played back 10 dB louder than the main channels, giving significantly more recording headroom. Also, the separate recording allowed a straightforward installation of extra dedicated subwoofers, and removed the need to upgrade the main speakers.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 front {{channels}} + 2 rear channels + 3 channels {{reproduced in}} the rear in total + 1 <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> = 3/2:3.1 ...|$|E
5000|$|This notation, e.g. [...] "5.1", {{reflects}} {{the number of}} full range channels; including a [...] ".1" [...] to reflect the limited range of the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{configurations}} optionally {{include the}} extra low-frequency effects (<b>LFE)</b> <b>channel.</b> The last two with stereo surrounds optionally use Dolby Digital EX matrix encoding {{to add an}} extra Rear Surround channel.|$|E
5000|$|Any of {{the channel}} {{configurations}} above may include a low frequency effects (<b>LFE)</b> <b>channel</b> (the channel played through the subwoofer.) This would make the configuration [...] ".1" [...] instead of [...] ".0". Most modern multichannel mixes will contain an LFE.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{numbers and}} labels are: Channel numbers up to 6 {{represent}} {{the same as}} those in a 5.1 channel system. There are then a further 5 listener-plane channels, 9 overhead channels, arranged in a square, and a row of 3 further channels at the bottom front, plus the additional <b>LFE</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later formats such as Dolby Digital {{retained}} the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel,</b> {{although this is}} more through convention and backwards compatibility than necessity, as digital formats have greater dynamic range than the magnetic analogue recordings on 70 mm prints, and modern sound processors have a bass management system to redirect bass from all channels to a subwoofer.|$|E
5000|$|Independent substreams, {{which can}} contain a single 5.1 program. Up to eight {{independent}} substreams {{may be present}} in a Dolby Digital Plus stream. The channels present in an independent substream are the traditional 5.1 channels: Left (L), Right (R), Center (C), Left Surround (Ls), and Right Surround (Rs) channels, {{as well as a}} Low Frequency Effects (<b>Lfe)</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Likewise, it is {{possible}} to pre-decode Ambisonic material to arbitrary speaker layouts, such as Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Auro 11.1, or even 22.2, again without manual intervention. The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is either omitted, or a special mix is created manually.Pre-decoding to 5.1 media has been known as G-Format during the early days of DVD audio, although the term is not in common use anymore.|$|E
5000|$|Dolby TrueHD: Dolby's current {{lossless}} coding technology. It offers bit-for-bit sound reproduction {{identical to the}} studio master. Over seven full-range 24-bit/96 kHz discrete channels are supported (plus a <b>LFE</b> <b>channel,</b> making it 7.1 surround) along with the HDMI interface. Theoretically, Dolby TrueHD can support more channels, but this number has been limited to 8 for HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
50|$|The bass {{management}} in surround sound replay systems is that bass {{content in the}} incoming signal, irrespective of channel, should be directed only to loudspeakers capable of handling it. The bass management system may direct bass {{to one or more}} subwoofers (if present) from any channel, not simply the content of the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel.</b> As such, it is incorrect to call the LFE the subwoofer channel.|$|E
50|$|The low-frequency effects (<b>LFE)</b> <b>channel</b> is {{the name}} of an audio track {{specifically}} intended for deep, low-pitched sounds ranging from 3-120 Hz. This track is normally sent to a speaker that is specially designed for low-pitched sounds called the subwoofer. While LFE channels originated in Dolby Stereo 70 mm film prints, they became commonplace in the 1990s and 2000s in home theater systems used to reproduce film soundtracks for DVDs and Blu-ray discs.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> can be {{output to}} one or more Tactile transducers, also known as [...] "bass shakers". When {{connected}} to the subwoofer output, the bass shaker will vibrate at the frequency of the bass, usually between 20 and 200 Hz, without producing much audible sound. Tactile transducers are frequently mounted directly to the frame of a chair or sofa. A listener's body can feel the vibrations from the LFE, enhancing the overall sensation of the bass.|$|E
5000|$|Tactile {{sound is}} often used to {{increase}} the realism of an artificial environment. For example, mounting a tactile sound transducer in a chair or couch in a home cinema setup can give more of a sense of [...] "being there". For such use, the transducer is often connected to the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> of an A/V receiver. Tactile sound {{is often used}} in combination with a subwoofer so that low frequencies can be both felt and heard.|$|E
50|$|Some {{record labels}} such as Telarc and Chesky {{have argued that}} LFE {{channels}} are not needed in a modern digital multichannel entertainment system. They argue that all available channels have a full-frequency range and, as such, {{there is no need}} for an LFE in surround music production, because all the frequencies are available in all the main channels. These labels sometimes use the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> to carry a height channel, underlining its redundancy for its original purpose. The label BIS generally uses a 5.0 channel mix.|$|E
50|$|Downmixing is {{the process}} of {{converting}} a program with a multiple-channel configuration into a program with fewer channels. Common examples include downmixing from 5.1 surround sound to stereo, and stereo to mono. In the former case, the left and right surround channels are blended with the left and right front channels. The centre channel is blended equally with the left and right channels. The <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is either mixed with the front signals or not used. Because these are common scenarios, it is common practice to verify the sound of such downmixes during the production process to ensure stereo and mono compatibility.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} movie theater implementation, the LFE was a separate channel fed {{to one or}} more subwoofers. Home replay systems, however, may not have a separate subwoofer, so modern home surround decoders and systems often include a bass management system that allows bass on any channel (main or LFE) to be fed only to the loudspeakers that can handle low-frequency signals. The salient point here is that the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> is not the [...] "subwoofer channel"; there may be no subwoofer and, if there is, it may be handling a good deal more than effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternative}} EBU multichannel ident tone {{follows a}} format more {{closely associated with}} the film industry. A sustained 80Hz runs on the <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> throughout the sequence. After a 3 second period of constant 1 kHz, -18dBFS tone on all main channels, each channel is identified in turn with a 0.5s pulse of 1 kHz tone, separated from its neighbours by 0.5s silence. The ident sequence starts at Front Left and continues clockwise through each available channel. The amount of time between the 3 second constant tone periods indicates the total number of channels in the system - e.g. a 7.1 system will have an ident sequence lasting 8 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Other, newer DTS {{variants}} {{are also}} currently available, including versions that support {{up to seven}} primary audio channels plus one <b>LFE</b> <b>channel</b> (DTS-ES). These variants are generally based on DTSs core-and-extension philosophy, in which a core DTS data stream is augmented with an extension stream which includes the additional data necessary for the new variant in use. The core stream can be decoded by any DTS decoder, {{even if it does}} not understand the new variant. A decoder which does understand the new variant decodes the core stream, and then modifies it according to the instructions contained in the extension stream. This method allows backward compatibility.|$|E
