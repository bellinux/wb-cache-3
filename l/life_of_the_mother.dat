5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their general}} {{opposition}} to abortion, fundamentalist churches {{that include the}} conservative evangelical, Non-denominational, Southern Baptist and Pentecostal movements, {{do not have a}} consensus doctrine regarding abortion. While these movements hold in common that abortion (when there is no threat to the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother)</b> is a form of infanticide, there is no consensus as to whether exceptions should be allowed when the mother's life is in mortal danger, or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Some argue that the lives of both the mother and fetus should be given equal consideration, in effect condemning all abortion including those performed to save the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother.</b> Others argue for exceptions which favor the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother,</b> perhaps including pregnancies resulting from cases of rape or incest.|$|E
