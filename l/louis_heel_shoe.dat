Methods Objectification method was 3 D record of human gait (= kinematic analysis), which was performed using the Qualisys Track Manager. In our thesis we used the method of comparison. The aim of the study is the comparison of parameters measured in different types of <b>shoes</b> (high <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes,</b> high <b>heeled</b> less <b>shoes</b> with barefoot gait) and the influence on pelvis motion in the sagittal plane. Measurements were carried out in the gym at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport at ten probands.

40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable high <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> construction that could enter the current high heel market. The impact of high <b>heel</b> <b>shoes</b> on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high heel that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high <b>heel</b> <b>shoes</b> to learn and leverage the current high <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable high <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high heel. (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high heel to maintain high heel stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high heel infrastructure. The development of the detachable high heel construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high heel construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)

It is important in improving the understanding of jogging with high heels and damage/injury prevention. It can also potentially guide the development of suitable/adaptive exercise schemes in between daily activities with high heels. In this work, plantar pressure data were collected from 10 habituated healthy female subjects (aged 21 – 25 years) at their natural jogging speed with three different conditions: flat <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> (0. 8 cm), low <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> (4. 0 cm), and high <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> (6. 6 cm). Data analysis showed significantly differences in plantar pressure distribution associated with the heel heights with increased pressure in the first metatarsal region and decreased pressure in the lateral metatarsal and midfoot sections. However, there is no significant alteration of plantar pressure in the central area of the forefoot with jogging gait...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} three different types of shoe models frequently worn at home, including an open <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> model, on gait parameters {{that are associated with}} fall risk in older persons. Methods: Twenty-five community-dwelling independent older persons were asked to walk on an electronic walkway system, the GAITRite® walkway, while wearing three different shoe models which are frequently worn at home. We measured spatial and temporal gait parameters. Results: Gait velocity and stride length were significantly reduced, and step time, stance, and double support time were significantly increased, when older persons wore an open <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> model compared to the high collar shoe models. Conclusion: Wearing an open <b>heel</b> <b>shoe</b> model is associated with gait parameters that are associated with fall risk, compared with a high collar shoe model, in community-dwelling older persons. With regard to falls prevention, further attention for footwear in older persons seems warranted, especially for footwear worn in and around the home. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Foot {{health is}} very {{important}} for women. Previous studies have demonstrated that the wearing of high <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> could create high forefoot pressure and cause many foot problems. Metatarsal pads are often used in plantar pressure relief. Therefore, the effects of several different metatarsal pads for high <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> are investigated in this study. There are three tested materials, including bio-gel, polyurethane and EVA. Forefoot pressure, heel pressure, and comfort level are recorded and analyzed. The results show that the insertions of all types of metatarsal pads reduce forefoot peak pressure and increase heel peak pressure during walking. Polyurethane is the most efficient material, which relieves the forefoot peak pressure by 35. 54 % compared to circumstances without the padding. In addition, the subjective comfort level is significantly improved when the bio-gel pad is applied. The results from this study could be useful in the designing of metatarsal pads for high <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes.</b> School of DesignInterdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|INTRADUCTION: A type of {{negative}} <b>heel</b> <b>shoes</b> (NHS) {{was designed for}} the purpose of training the muscles in trunk and leg,. The negative <b>heel</b> <b>shoes</b> are characterized as having the heel section lower than the toe when the top of the shoe and the insole are removed. The shoe itself tilts the foot into about 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. It is noteworthy that the original objectives of the NHS designer were to build up and exercise the muscles in trunk and 'Iower limn as well as Achilles tendon. However, studies about the kinematics and muscle activities of trunk and lower-limb in walking with NHS are limited (Benz, et aI., 1998). And no scientific evidence supports that walking with the negative <b>heel</b> <b>shoes</b> benefits the muscle strength. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the kinematics and EMG activity in the muscles of trunk and lower-limb, as compared with walkinQl with normal shoes.

5000|$|Walking in {{negative}} <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> {{leads to a}} faster cadence and shorter stride length, resulting in a significantly shorter stride cycle time than when walking with a natural cadence. The range of the ankle motion is also significantly greater in the negative <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes,</b> remaining in dorsiflexion longer throughout the stance and swing phases of gait. The increased duration of dorsiflexion leads to lengthening of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle-tendon units {{and the length of}} the moment arm of the Achilles tendon. [...] A similar post-operative exercise effect involving increased dorsiflexion is often desired after surgeries involving the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles or Achilles tendon. The purpose of the exercise is to increase the range of motion in the ankle joint and strengthen the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and the Achilles tendons. Wearing negative <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes,</b> therefore, may offer an alternative method for post-operative rehabilitation in these situations. It should be noted that while dorsiflexion of the ankle may be beneficial, it also causes the center of gravity to shift backward, which can cause instability and difficulty in propelling forward during gait.|$|R

The gait of 45 elderly women between 60 and 70 years of age was evaluated. Twenty-one had knee OR graded 2 or 3 according to Kellgren and Lawrence`s criteria, and 24 who had no OA comprised the control group (CG). The gait conditions were: barefoot, Moleca (R), and modern <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes.</b> Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured to calculate KAM by inverse dynamics. For both groups, the Moleca (R) provided peak KAM and KAM impulse similar to barefoot walking. For the OA group, the Moleca (R) reduced KAM even more as compared to the barefoot condition during midstance. On the other hand, the modern <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> increased this variable in both groups. Inexpensive, flexible, and non-heeled footwear provided loading on the knee joint similar to a barefoot gait and significant overload decreases in elderly women with and without knee OA, compared to modern <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes.</b> During midstance, the Moleca (R) also allowed greater reduction in the knee joint loads as compared to barefoot gait in elderly women with knee OA, with the further advantage of providing external foot protection during gait.

40|$|Lunge is one {{frequently}} executed {{movement in}} badminton and involves a unique sagittal footstrike angle {{of more than}} 40 degrees at initial ground contact compared with other manoeuvres. This study examined if the <b>shoe</b> <b>heel</b> curvature design of a badminton shoe would influence shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments during lunge. Eleven elite and fifteen intermediate players performed five left-forward maximum lunge trials with Rounded <b>Heel</b> <b>Shoe</b> (RHS), Flattened <b>Heel</b> <b>Shoe</b> (FHS), and Standard <b>Heel</b> <b>Shoes</b> (SHS). Shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments were measured by using synchronized force platform and motion analysis system. A 2 (Group) x 3 (Shoe) ANOVA with repeated measures was performed {{to determine the effects}} of different shoes and different playing levels, as well as the interaction of two factors on all variables. Shoe effect indicated that players demonstrated lower maximum vertical loading rate in RHS than the other two shoes (P < 0. 05). Group effect revealed that elite players exhibited larger footstrike angle, faster approaching speed, lower peak horizontal force and horizontal loading rates but higher vertical loading rates and larger peak knee flexion and extension moments (P < 0. 05). Analysis of Interactions of Group x Shoe for maximum and mean vertical loading rates (P < 0. 05) indicated that elite players exhibited lower left maximum and mean vertical loading rates in RHS compared to FHS (P < 0. 01), while the intermediate group did not show any Shoe effect on vertical loading rates. These findings indicate that <b>shoe</b> <b>heel</b> curvature would play some role in altering ground reaction force impact during badminton lunge. The differences in impact loads and knee moments between elite and intermediate players may be useful in optimizing footwear design and training strategy to minimize the potential risks for impact related injuries in badminton...|$|R

40|$|Objective Previous studies {{indicate}} that flexible footwear, which mimics the biomechanics of walking barefoot, results in decreased knee loads in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) during walking. However, the effect of flexible footwear on other activities of daily living, such as descending stairs, remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of inexpensive and minimalist footwear (Moleca) on knee adduction moment (KAM) during stair descent of elderly women with and without knee OA. Methods. Thirty-four elderly women were equally divided into an OA group and a control group (CG). Stair descent was evaluated in barefoot condition, while wearing the Moleca, and while wearing <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes.</b> Kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured to calculate KAM by using inverse dynamics. Results. The OA group experienced a higher KAM during midstance under the barefoot condition (233. 3 %; P = 0. 028), the Moleca (379. 2 %; P = 0. 004), and <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> (217. 6 %; P = 0. 007). The OA group had a similar knee load during early, mid, and late stance with the Moleca compared with the barefoot condition. <b>Heeled</b> <b>shoes</b> increased the knee loads during the early-stance (versus barefoot [16. 7 %; P < 0. 001] and versus the Moleca [15. 5 %; P < 0. 001]), midstance (versus barefoot [8. 6 %; P = 0. 014] and versus the Moleca [9. 5 %; P = 0. 010]), and late-stance phase (versus barefoot [10. 6 %; P = 0. 003] and versus the Moleca [9. 2 %; P < 0. 001]). In the CG, the Moleca produced a knee load similar to the barefoot condition only during the early-stance phase. Conclusion. Besides the general foot protection, the inexpensive and minimalist footwear contributes to decreasing knee loads in elderly women with OA during stair descent. The loads {{are similar to the}} barefoot condition and effectively decreased when compared with <b>heeled</b> <b>shoes.</b> National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [480209 / 2007 - 3]Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2011 / 01640 - 8...|$|R
