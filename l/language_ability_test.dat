We also pioneered the suitability of a five-step developmental scale of ToM understanding for 2 -year-old toddlers from Indigenous- and AngloAustralian cultural backgrounds. A total of 97 children aged 2 to 5 years took (a) a battery of false belief (FB) tests, (b) a developmental ToM Scale, and (c) a standard <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> <b>test.</b> Results showed that, contrary to earlier findings for Piagetian tasks, the Indigenous Australian children were not delayed in ToM understanding.

We also found, for the first time, that the five-step ToM Scale was both suitable for, and sensitive to individual differences in, children as young as age 2.

Participants' linguistic skills were assessed via <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> <b>tests.</b> We focused on plurals, passives, and tense, and we examined synthetic forms. The results confirmed that erosion is occurring in all areas investigated; in particular, the synthetic nature of Gaelic causes problems for younger generation speakers.

Through an interview with an expert informant, we also explored the implications of Gaelic education for the Gaelicspeaking community on Skye. Revitalization efforts are currently underway, but despite maintenance efforts such as Gaelic Medium Education (GME), English remains the language of the schoolchildren as well as the community at large. The authors feel that a concerted community revitalization effort is needed in congruence with the application of GME. Maintenance efforts should be directed towards sponsoring Gaelic-speaking community events so that GME students have the opportunity to speak Gaelic outside the classroom as well as experience the viability of the language for communication in different domains...|$|R

All factors contributed significantly to the prediction of word reading and spelling development seven months later. Verbal-sequential processing was the strongest predictor for both word decoding and spelling. Furthermore, autoregression effects of word decoding and spelling were strong and verbal-sequential processing had predictive value on word spelling nineteen months later when pre-existing spelling abilities were accounted for. Children with SLI and normal literacy skills performed better on most of the language and language-related measures than children with SLI and poor literacy skills. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, readers will describe four language domains that are related to later literacy skills in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). As a result of this activity, readers will recognize the predictive value of each of these language domains and the important role of verbal-sequential processing in learning to decode and writing words for children with SLI. As a result of this activity, readers will recall the differences in language proficiencies between children with SLI who develop normal literacy skills and those who encounter literacy problems...|$|R
40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) {{refers to}} the ability to predict and explain others’ {{behaviour}} {{on the basis of their}} emotions, intentions, desires, attitudes etc. By doing this, mental states can be posited inside a person to explain behaviour that doesn’t seem logical at first. It is generally assumed that in persons with an autistic disorder ToM is impaired. The purpose of this study was to find out whether or not autistic children have problems with language that requires understanding of other people’s mental states. In this study this ‘mental language’ is divided in a lexical and a discourse part. A group of 10 autistic children and a control group of 19 typically developing children were tested with ToM tests, general language tests, Executive Function tests and mental language tests. To examine the comprehension of mental language, two types of tests were used: an indirect requests test (discourse) and a modal comprehension test (lexical). The results showed that the two groups differed only in their performance on the Theory of Mind tasks. As expected, the autistic children performed worse on these tests. Both groups did not score significantly differently on the mental language tests. However, when the children were divided differently, in a group that did pass the ToM tests and a group that did not, it was shown that the children who had passed the ToM tests scored better on the modal comprehension test than the children who had failed. The children were also divided according to their score on the general <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> <b>tests.</b> From this division, it was shown that whenever their general <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> score was low, their score on the indirect request test was also low in comparison to the children who had a high general <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> score. These results provide evidence for the theory that for the lexical part of mental language, a fully functioning ToM is important, whereas for the discourse part this is not the case. A possible theory could be that the discourse part of mental language is more influenced by general <b>language</b> <b>abilities</b> than by ToM abilities...|$|R
30|$|Making such life-changing {{decisions}} {{for an individual}} solely on a single test score {{continues to be a}} concern among language testing researchers. Language knowledge alone is not a determinant of a <b>test</b> taker’s <b>language</b> <b>ability.</b> In fact, <b>test</b> takers’ individual cognitive or mental processes invoked by a task are crucial as they result in test score variability (Purpura 2014). These processes may be automatically or deliberately mobilized to complete a task. This conscious, intentional choice is what differentiates strategies from automatic cognitive processes (Cohen 2014; Phakiti 2007). Understanding the relationship between strategy use and the processes, researchers argue, would provide insights into <b>test</b> takers’ <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> and how they could perform in real world situations (e.g. O’Sullivan and Weir 2011). Research studies on how these processes work and impact test takers’ performance are lacking especially in the speaking test domain.

40|$|Background: In the {{literature}} {{so far the}} limited research on specific language impairment (SLI) in bilingual children has concentrated on linguistic skills in the first language (L 1) and/or the second language (L 2) without {{paying attention to the}} relations between the two types of skills and to the issue of linguistic transfer. Aims: To examine the first and second language proficiency of 75 Turkish-Dutch bilingual children with SLI in the age range between 7 and 11 years living in the Netherlands. A multidimensional perspective on language proficiency was taken in order to assess children's Turkish and Dutch proficiency levels, whereas equivalent tests were used in order to determine language dominance. A second aim was to find out to what extent the children's proficiency in L 2 can be predicted from their L 1 proficiency, while taking into account their general cognitive abilities. Methods & Procedures: The children's performance on a battery of equivalent <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> <b>tests</b> in Turkish and Dutch was compared at three age levels. By means of analyses of variance, it was explored to what extent the factors of language and grade level as well as their interactions were significant. Bivariate correlations and partial correlations with age level partialled out were computed to examine the relationships between L 1 and L 2 proficiency levels. Moreover, regression analysis was conducted to find out to what extent the variance in general L 2 proficiency levels could be explained by children's L 1 proficiency, short-term memory and non-verbal intelligence. Outcomes & Results: Repeated measures analyses showed that the children had generally higher scores on L 1 as compared with L 2 and that with progression of age the children's scores in L 1 and L 2 improved. Medium to high correlations were found between phonological memory, phonological awareness, grammatical skills and story comprehension in the two languages. Regression analysis revealed that children's L 2 proficiency levels could be explained by their proficiency levels in L 1, even after controlling for children's non-verbal intelligence and working memory. Conclusions & Implications: It is concluded that children's formal linguistic skills in L 1 and L 2 tend to be related and that their level of L 1 proficiency may help to develop linguistic skills in L 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the major}} {{dimensions}} of a communicative language test that Bachman proposed, this paper aims to have an investigation on {{the validity of the}} new CET- 4 listening subtest in China from a communicative point of view. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are involved in the study. Material analysis falls into qualitative study, including analysis of the CET- 4 testing syllabus and eight new CET- 4 listening comprehension tests. Students’ scores of two tests and the questionnaires are analyzed quantitatively. Through analysis, it is found that the new CET- 4 listening subtest has a high validity and can measure test-takers’ listening ability in real communication. First, the new CET- 4 listening subtest has the quality of reliability. Second, the seven listening skills tested in this subtest can measure the communicative <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> required in the testing syllabus. The intra-correlation analysis shows that each part of the new CET- 4 listening subtest focuses on different <b>language</b> <b>abilities</b> related to listening. Third, the authenticity of the new CET- 4 listening subtest reaches a satisfactory level. The materials chosen in the test cover various topics and genres. Speakers’ pronunciation, tone and speed are in accordance with the real situation. However, some shortcomings also exist in the test design and should be improved later. For example, its limited item types cannot represent the task types in real life, and the actual input is too ideal to be authentic.   Keywords: Communicative <b>language</b> <b>ability,</b> communicative <b>language</b> <b>testing,</b> listening comprehension, test validit...|$|R
40|$|Language {{difficulties}} {{have historically}} been viewed as integral to autism spectrum conditions (ASC), leading molecular genetic studies to consider whether ASC and language difficulties have overlapping genetic bases. The extent of genetic, and also environmental, overlap between ASC and language is, however, unclear. We hence conducted a twin study of the concurrent association between autistic traits and receptive <b>language</b> <b>abilities.</b> Internet-based <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> were completed by ∼ 3, 000 pairs of twins, while autistic traits were assessed via parent ratings. Twin model fitting explored the association between these measures in the full sample, while DeFries-Fulker analysis tested these associations at the extremes of the sample. Phenotypic associations between <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> and autistic traits were modest and negative. The degree of genetic overlap was also negative, indicating that genetic influences on autistic traits lowered language scores in the full sample (mean genetic correlation[*]=[*]− 0. 13). Genetic overlap was also low at the extremes of the sample (mean genetic correlation[*]=[*] 0. 14), indicating that genetic influences on quantitatively defined language difficulties were largely distinct from those on extreme autistic traits. Variation in <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> and autistic traits were also associated with largely different nonshared environmental influences. Language and autistic traits are influenced by largely distinct etiological factors. This has implications for molecular genetic studies of ASC and understanding the etiology of ASC. Additionally, these findings lend support to forthcoming DSM- 5 changes to ASC diagnostic criteria that will see language difficulties separated from the core ASC communication symptoms, and instead listed as a clinical specifier. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the performance of young elementary children with differing auditory <b>language</b> <b>abilities</b> on <b>tests</b> of central auditory functioning (central deafness). <b>Language</b> <b>abilities</b> were based on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) and Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT) level vs. Reading Expectancy level performances. Group A, the control group, scored in the normal range on both the ITPA and the SORT. Groups B and C were both deficient in reading skills by at least one year. The difference between these groups was their ITPA performance. Group C displayed average ITPA profiles while Group B scored significantly lower in auditory skills. Four central deafness tests designed by Willeford and the Sound Mimicry Test of the Goldman-Fristoe-Woodcock Auditory Skills Test Battery were administered to all subjects. A One Way Analysis of Variance was used to analyze differences in performance between groups on all test variables. Pearson Correlation Coefficients were used to study relationships between the ITPA and the central deafness tests and the Sound Mimicry Test. Group B, subjects with poor ITPAauditory subtest scores, also scored significantly lower on two of the central deafness tests. Group C scored significantly lower than the control group only on the Sound Mimicry Test. Great disparity among individual scores within groups detracts from possible conclusions to be drawn from this study. It appears, however, that the two central deafness tests designed to assess brainstem integrity (Binaural Fusion and Alternating Speech) correlate with performances on the ITPA auditory subtests. Scores on the ITPA Auditory Memory subtest appear to correlate with the Sound Mimicry Test suggesting that these subjects experience difficulty with temporal order sequencing tasks.

40|$|<b>Language</b> <b>ability</b> may {{not only}} affect the {{earnings}} of the individual, but the participation {{to participate in the}} labor market or becoming employed as well. It may also affect selection of people into economic sectors and occupation. In this paper the effects of <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> on earnings are analyzed for foreigners in Germany with joint consideration of up to four types of self-selection. The results show that language profciency signifcantly increases participation and employment probability and affects earnings directly. However, when self-selection into economic sectors and occupation is regarded, the direct effects of <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> on earnings vanish.

40|$|Background: Many {{children}} with language impairment present with deficits in other areas, including executive functioning (EF), attention and behaviour. Similarly, many children receiving services for attention or behaviour problems have deficits in <b>language</b> <b>ability.</b> Aims: To evaluate the relations among EF, <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> and behaviour {{problems in a}} sample of school-age {{children with}} a wide range of language and behaviour profiles. The following research questions were addressed: Does performance on EF tasks predict <b>language</b> <b>ability?</b> Do <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> and EF predict problems with attention, internalizing and/or externalizing? Methods & Procedures: EF was defined as referring to the separable, yet related, processes of shifting, updating working memory and inhibition as specified in the latent variable model of EF. Children aged 8 – 11 years recruited from an urban school district completed standardized language and cognitive assessments and a computerized task assessing EF. Their parents completed standardized questionnaires assessing the children’s EF and problem behaviours. Regression analyses were conducted. Outcomes & Results: Regression analyses revealed that EF did not contribute to <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> beyond the variance accounted for by nonverbal reasoning. <b>Language</b> <b>ability</b> contributed to attention problems when entered as a single predictor, but was no longer significant when the EF measures were added to the model. <b>Language</b> <b>ability</b> did not significantly contribute to internalizing or externalizing behaviour problems. Parent-reported inhibition was a robust predictor of attention, internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems. Conclusions & Implications: In this sample of school-age children, <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> was related to attention problems, but not to internalizing or externalizing. Children with behaviour problems may have particular difficulty with inhibition...|$|R

[...] This first version had four categories, with <b>Language</b> <b>Ability</b> originally covered in the ‘Language Knowledge and Awareness’ category.

40|$|Background: Does poor <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> {{in early}} {{childhood}} {{increase the likelihood of}} physical aggression or is <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> delayed by frequent physical aggression? This study examined the longitudinal associations between physical aggression and <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> from toddlerhood to early childhood in a population sample while controlling for parenting behaviours, non-verbal intellectual functioning, and children 2 ̆ 7 s sex. Methods: Children enrolled in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) (N = 2, 057) were assessed longitudinally from 17 to 72 months via parent reports and standardized assessments. Results: The cross-lagged models revealed modest reciprocal associations between physical aggression and language performance from 17 to 41 months but not thereafter. Conclusions: Significant associations between physical aggression and poor <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> are minimal and limited to the period when physical aggression and language performance are both substantially increasing. During that period parenting behaviours may {{play an important role in}} supporting <b>language</b> <b>ability</b> while reducing the frequency of physical aggression. Further studies are needed that utilize multiple assessments of physical aggression, assess multiple domains of <b>language</b> <b>abilities,</b> and that examine the potential mediating role of parenting behaviours between 12 and 48 months...|$|R
