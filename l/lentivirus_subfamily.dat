40|$|Infections {{caused by}} the small {{ruminant}} lentiviruses (SRLV) of sheep (maedi visna virus) and goats (caprine arthritis encephalitis virus) are a serious economical threat to small ruminant farming particularly in the more intensive settings like dairy farms. Revenue is ultimately negatively influenced by decreased milk production, reduced birth-rate and bodyweight and trade limitations 1, 2, 3. Chronically infected animals have a poor body condition and may display progressive dyspnoea, painful arthritis and indurative mastitis, factors that markedly affect animal welfare. However, in well managed flocks overt clinical disease is hardly seen because affected animals are culled in {{an early stage of}} this perniciously progressive disease, hence the only sign is an increased replacement rate. The infection spreads lactogenically from dam to progeny through colostrum and/or milk and horizontally on one hand via the natural close contact between the dam and her progeny 4, 5 {{and on the other hand}} between flock members via direct and indirect contacts 6, 7. Vertical -prenatal- transmission is generally considered to be of low or no importance. Infections are microscopically characterised by lymphoid infiltrations and inflammatory lesions in the lungs, the udder, the carpal joints and the central nervous system 8, 9, 10. There is no cure for this usually slowly progressive disease. Identification of infected individuals by laboratory testing and strict farm and animal sanitary management are corner-stones of programs for control and are at the same time the only tools available for reducing the prevalence of infection. Caution with respect to the reliability of laboratory testing for SRLV infections is augmented by the growing knowledge of the RNA viral genomes and their expression products. Immense genetic heterogeneity hampers protein as well as viral genome based tests. Due to sub-optimal laboratory tests generating false negative results, an early diagnosis is easily missed which will lead to spread of infection. This reduces the farmers’ support for control programs which was already under pressure because of the costs involved, the low direct market returns and the ‘invisibility’ of the long-term returns. Improvement of the diagnostic tools combined with improved test strategies will enable early detection of infection. Moreover, especially, the use of milk samples in stead of blood and in particular the use of bulk milk samples for the antibody detection as well as the molecular biological detection of SRLV infections could lead to considerable cost reduction. The small ruminant <b>lentiviruses,</b> a <b>subfamily</b> of the retroviruses, will need continuous attention because they are prone to diagnostic test escape as a result of their rapid evolving genomes 7, 11, 12 with consequences at the genomic and epitope level 13.

40|$|HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 {{are members}} of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily.</b> These retroviruses are {{approximately}} 50 % related at the nucleotide level (1, 2). A major difference in their genetic organization is that vpu, an accessory gene, is unique to HIV- 1 (3), while the vpx gene is found only in HIV- 2 (4, 5). Of the two viruses, HIV- 1 is the more widely distributed, accounting for approximately 95 % of all HIV infections worldwide. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences from globally circulating strains of HIV reveal a great deal of genetic diversity. Sequence analyses have shown not only that there is genom-ic heterogeneity between the various strains worldwide, but also that the diversity is unevenly dis-tributed throughout the HIV- 1 genome (2). Furthermore, intrapatient isolates have less diversity than interpatient isolates, but even within a single individual replicating viruses can differ as much as 10 % at the nucleotide level (1, 2, 6).

40|$|In the mid-eighties {{it became}} {{apparent}} that a human retrovirus of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily,</b> later designated human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-l), was the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

The urgent need to gain insight in certain aspects of the pathobiology of this infection demanded relevant animal models. As a consequence of this need the search for similar lentivimses present in other animal species intensified. Several lentivimses have been identified to induce AIDS-like disease in a vruiety of animals, however, only simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and feline inununodeficiency virus (FIV), wWcb cause AIDS-like symptoms in macaques and cats, respectively, have been commonly used as animal models.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-I and HIV- 2), the causative agents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, {{are members of}} the Lentivirinae subfamily of the Retroviridae family. The <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily</b> also includes related members from other species, like monkeys (simian {{immunodeficiency virus}}es [SIV]), cats (feline immunodeficiency viruses [FIV]), and the ungulates sheep, goats, horses and cattle. Mature lentiviruses are spherical to ellipsoid particles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm consisting of a lipid envelope surrounding a cone shaped core (Gelderblom et al 1989) (Fig. I). In HIV-I the core is formed by a 24 kd capsid protein (p 24). It contains two identical strands of positive-sense genomic RNA closely associated with the nucleocapsid proteins (p 7 and p 9) and several copies of the reverse transcriptase. A membrane associated matrix protein p 17 is situated between the core and the envelope. In the envelope a 41 kd transmembrane glycoprotein (gp 41) is anchored.

40|$|HIV is a {{retrovirus}} on the <b>Lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily.</b> The virus binds to the CD 4 receptor on the T helper lymphocytes. Fusion of the viral {{and cell}} membranes allows entry of the viral core into the cell. The reverse transcriptase enzyme, a protein {{carried by the}} virus that allows transcription of ribonucleic acid (RNA) into deoxyribonucleic acid, then mediates transcription of the viral RNA genome into viral DNA. Viral integrase then facilitates incorporation of the viral DNA into the host genome. The viral DNA is then transcribed into multiple RNA copies by the host cell. This newly created RNA is translated into viral proteins. Translation of the viral RNA sequences results in protein precursors that undergo proteolytic processing by a viral protease that liberates the functional viral proteins [1, 2]. As the virus infects and damages helper T cells, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are impaired. Defective chemotaxis and phagocytosis causes increased vulnerability to infections such as candidiasis and toxoplasmosis. A lack of T-cell stimulation of B cells results in decreased immunoglobulin production and a vulnerability to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria. These problems are compounded by impaired neutrophil function [2]. </p...|$|E

The occurrence of CpG dinucleotides is greater in the 2 - 3 (NCG) than in the 1 - 2 (CGN) codon-defined frame, {{as well as in the}} gag and env genes, compared to the more conserved pol gene. These differences suggest that CpG depletion in lentiviruses occurs as a result of selection against CpG rather than due to mutational bias, the latter is responsible for low CpG frequencies in vertebrate genomes. CpG levels in the onco-retrovirus subfamily are reduced to a lesser extent, principally due to mutational bias. The difference between the retrovirus subfamilies appears to reflect their evolutionary origin, that is, lentiviruses have no known endogenous counterparts whereas most oncoviruses have endogenous cellular counterparts with which they can undergo recombination. Furthermore, we suggest that the number of CpG dinucleotides in a lentiviral genome determines the maximum potential DNA methylation level of the provirus, which in turn affects viral transcription in host cells...|$|E

The discovery of FIV {{provides an opportunity}} {{for the development of a}} small animal model for AIDS. To initiate the molecular and biological characterization of FIV, cDNA clones were synthesized and used to isolate a proviral clone of FIV. Molecular cross-hybridization analysis of FIV with five lentiviruses revealed that nucleotide-sequence similarities exist between FIV and these lentiviruses in the gag-pol genes. However, nucleotide-sequence similarities were not seen upon comparison of the FIV long terminal repeat sequence with known viral sequences. Common antigenic determinants appeared to be shared by FIV, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, and visna virus as shown by serological cross-reactivity of rabbit antibodies to caprine arthritis encephalitis virus and visna virus with the putative FIV core protein p 28.

Cell extracts from strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring these two vectors (pYENV 1 and pYENV 2) were found to contain a specific protein with a size of 50 kDa when induced by galactose, while the protein could not be detected in extracts from control cells containing only the E. coli-yeast vector in the presence of galactose. Furthermore, another expression plasmid coding for fusion proteins from the majority of the external {{envelope glycoprotein}} (gp 120) moiety and {{a large part of the}} �-galactosidase was constructed.

Lentiviruses cause chronic, lifelong infections in their respective host species, which may be followed by a slowly progressive and degenerative disease. FIV was first isolated from a domestic cat suffering from an immunodeficiency syndrome reminiscent of AIDS in humans. Subsequently it was shown that upon FIV infection, domestic cats may develop an immunodeficiency syndrome, hallmarked by secondary and opportunistic infections. The clinical stages preceding the final stage of feline AIDS, are similar to those observed in humans with HIV infection: the acute stage is followed by the asymptomatic carrier (AC) stage, after which a persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) gradually leads to the stage of AIDS related complex (ARC). Then the animal develops full blown AIDS. The different stages of F 1 V infection of cats may often not be quite distinct and rapid transitions between the respective stages may be observed (see below).

Cell lines which express the viral gag polyprotein were isolated for hybrids pMoHIV-I and pMoHIV-III. These cells produced viral particles which contained processed core proteins. Cleavage of the gag polyprotein in the viral particles was inhibited by the HIV- 1 PR inhibitor L- 687908, indicating that the viral PR {{is responsible for the}} observed processing.

The LTR of a North American ovine lentivirus, OLV-CUl, was found to be closely related at the molecular and functional levels to visna virus, the Icelandic ovine lentivirus. Sequence analysis of the LTR revealed high identity to other ovine and ¢aprine lentiviruses in key regulatory elements of the upstream promoter region (- 25 to- 1 15). However, the R region of the LTR was much less homologous. Transcriptional control of OLV-CU 1 in transient transcriptional assays required a con-served putative AP- 4 region and possibly an AP- 1 like element in the upstream promoter region for moderate to high levels of transcription, much like visna virus. In contrast to visna virusy the down-stream region beyond the transcriptional start site was required for virus-specific transactivation.

40|$|Abstract: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection of CD 4 T lymphocytes leads to their progressive loss, whereas HIV- 1 -infected macrophages appear to resist HIV- 1 -mediated apo-ptotic death. The differential response {{of these two}} host-cell populations may be critical in the devel-opment of immunodeficiency and long-term persis-tence of the virus. Multiple contributing factors may favor the macrophage as a resilient host, not only supporting infection by HIV- 1 but also pro-moting replication and persistence of this member of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily</b> of primate retroviruses. An encounter between macrophages and R 5 virus engages a signal cascade eventuating in transcrip-tional regulation of multiple genes including those associated with host defense, cell cycle, nuclear factor-B regulation, and apoptosis. It is important that enhanced gene expression is transient, declin-ing to near control levels, and during this quiescent state, the virus continues its life cycle unimpeded. However, when viral replication becomes promi-nent, an increase in host genes again occurs under the orchestration of viral gene products. This bi-phasic host response must fulfill {{the needs of the}} parasitic virus as viral replication activity occurs and leads to intracellular and cell surface-associ-ated viral budding. Inroads into understanding how HIV- 1 co-opts host factors to generate a permissive environment for viral replication and transmission to new viral hosts may provide opportunities for targeted interruption of this lethal process.

The transport of the preintegration complex into the nucleus is cell cycle-independent, but the mechanism is not well understood. Integrase is a key component of the complex and has been suggested {{to play a role in}} nuclear import during HIV- 1 replication. To determine its karyophilic property, FIV integrase fused with glutathione S-transferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein was expressed in various feline and human cells and the subcellular localization was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Wild-type FIV integrase was karyophilic in all cell lines tested and capable of targeting the fusion protein to the nuclei of transfected cells. Analysis of deletion and point mutation variants of FIV integrase failed to reveal any canonical nuclear localization signal, and the karyophilic determinant was mapped to the highly conserved N-terminal zinc-binding HHCC motif. A region near the C-terminal domain enriched with basic amino acid residues also affected the nuclear import of integrase. However, the role of this region is only modulatory in comparison to that of the zinc-binding domain. The N-terminal zinc-binding domain does not bind DNA and instead is essential in integrase multimerization.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 Vpu protein is a 16 -kDa phosphoprotein which enhances the efficiency of virion production and induces rapid degradation of CD 4, the cellular receptor for {{human immunodeficiency}} virus. The topology of membrane-inserted Vpu was investigated by using in vitro-synthesized Vpu cotranslationally inserted into canine microsomal membranes. Proteolytic digestion and immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Vpu was a type I integral membrane protein, with the hydrophilic domain projecting from the cytoplasmic membrane face. In addition, several high-molecular-weight proteins containing Vpu were identified by chemical cross-linking. Such complexes also formed when wild-type Vpu and a Tat-Vpu fusion protein were coexpressed. Subsequent analysis by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that these high-molecular-weight complexes consisted of homo-oligomers of Vpu. These findings indicate that Vpu is a type I integral membrane protein capable of multimerization. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is a mem-ber of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily</b> of Retrovindae.

40|$|Members of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily</b> of retroviruses are {{characterized}} as causing slow, chronic disease. Atypical of other lentiviruses, such as {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) may produce a rapid, variable disease course in horses. Infected horses may undergo an, acute episode of disease involving viremia, fever, and thrombocytopenia. Following this acute period, horses may resolve to an inapparent infection or suffer a chronic period of additional cycles of viremia, fever, and thrombocytopenia. Horses which survive clinical episodes usually become inapparent carriers of the virus for life. Numerous virus and host factors contribute to the phenotypic manifestations of disease. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, the rate of virus replication, the host immune response, and genetic variation of the virus. Genetic variation in EIAV has been identified in a region overlapped by the genes encoding the transmembrane protein and the trans-regulatory protein Rev. Rev is a nucleocytoplasmic transport protein which regulates the expression of viral structural proteins and progeny RNA molecules during the late phase of virus replication. Therefore, factors which modulate Rev activity may result in changes in virus replication and ultimately contribute to virus pathogenesis in vivo. The long term goal of this research project is to determine the contribution of Rev variation to the manifestation of clinical disease during an EIAV infection. To accomplish this goal, we first determined that genetic variation in Rev can modulate the rate of virus replication in vitro;We then characterized variation within Rev in an experimentally-infected pony. Functional analysis of the dominant Rev variants at various time points during infection indicated that the variants dominant during the clinical periods possessed more nuclear export activity than those dominant in the acute or aclinical periods. To further understand the significance of Rev variation, we also mapped the cis- and trans-acting elements required for the nuclear export and alternative splicing activities of Rev.

40|$|Equine {{infectious}} anemia virus (EIAV) is {{a member}} of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily</b> of retroviruses that produces a variable clinical disease course characterized as acute, chronic, and inapparent. The clinical signs can vary according to the stage of disease, and generally correlate with levels of virus replication. As with other retroviruses, EIAV utilizes both RNA and proteins to produce alternatively spliced transcripts required for virus replication. EIAV encodes a protein called Rev, which functions by binding unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNAs in the nucleus at a sequence called the Rev responsive element (RRE) and exporting them into the cytoplasm. Rev is absolutely required for virus replication, and factors that inhibit Rev function would be expected to inhibit virus replication. EIAV Rev is encoded in exons 3 and 4 of a bicistronic, four-exon mRNA, which also encodes the protein Tat in exons 1 and 2. The presence of Rev results in the expression of an alternatively spliced viral mRNA that differs from the four-exon mRNA by lacking exon 3. Exon 3 contains cis-acting sequences that function as both an exon splicing enhancer (ESE) and a RRE. ESEs bind cellular SR proteins to assist in the recognition and inclusion of exons. Therefore, the EIAV ESE/RRE sequences bind both SR proteins and Rev. The goal of this research is to characterize the interactions between EIAV and cellular SR proteins that modulate virus replication. I first show that Rev-mediated alternative splicing of exon 3 is not a mechanism to up-regulate Tat activity. I demonstrate that SF 2 /ASF inhibits Rev-mediated nuclear export activity and EIAV replication in vitro. I show that the RNA binding domain of SF 2 /ASF is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of Rev nuclear export activity and EIAV replication. Further, the inhibition of both Rev activity and virus replication correlated with the SR protein RNA binding specificity. These results suggest that SR proteins and Rev compete for binding viral RNAs at the ESE/RRE.

Lentiviruses replicate in cells of the immune system, and activation of immune cells has been shown to modulate virus replication. Studies were undertaken to determine the effects of macrophage activation on EIAV replication in vitro. Primary horse macrophage cultures (HMC) were established from 20 different horses, infected with EIAV, and stimulated with 5 [mu]g/ml of bacterial endotoxin. Supernatants collected from HMC were assayed for the presence of tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF-[alpha]), and titers of infectious virus. Results indicated that EIAV replication in vitro varied significantly (p ≤ 0. 0001) from horse to horse, regardless of the treatment of HMC. Also, EIAV replication was significantly (p ≤ 0. 0001) decreased in HMC stimulated with bacterial endotoxin as compared to untreated HMC. No significant correlation was found between virus replication and production of TNF-[alpha] following endotoxin treatment of virus-infected cells. However, inhibition of EIAV replication was more dramatic when basal levels of TNF-[alpha] were detected at the time of infection, suggesting that cellular factors present in activated macrophages may inhibit EIAV replication early after infection. Additional experiments were designed to determine the mechanism of inhibition of EIAV replication in activated HMC. HMC were treated with serially diluted bacterial endotoxin and infected with EIAV. Total cellular DNA and RNA were isolated from HMC at six hours, 18 hours, 43 hours and six days following infection, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the reverse transcription-PCR were used to amplify EIAV proviral DNA and mRNA sequences, respectively. Results indicated that the reverse transcription of proviral DNA early after infection was not affected by endotoxin treatment of HMC. Also, there were no quantitative differences in full-length or multiply-spliced mRNAs until six days post-infection. However, variable splicing patterns dependent on both time and dose of endotoxin were observed in mRNA species from endotoxin-treated HMC. The appearance of single-spliced EIAV mRNA was delayed by endotoxin treatment. Together these results suggest that inhibition of EIAV replication in endotoxin-treated HMC occurs during the transition from early to late stages in virus replication...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{is a member}} of the <b>lentivirus</b> <b>subfamily</b> of retroviruses. HIV- 1 expresses multiple genes from a single provirus by alternative splicing. Early in viral expression, fully spliced 2 -kb viral RNA is exported from the nucleus and encodes the viral regulatory protein, Rev, which is essential for nuclear transport of partially spliced and unspliced genomic-length RNA. Rev binds to an RNA structural element called the Rev response element (RRE) and mediates nuclear export through the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) pathway. The human Rev Interacting Protein (hRIP) interacts specifically with the Rev NES. Rev NES mutants that are unable to export Rev-dependent RNAs are also unable to bind to hRIP. The hRIP cDNA encodes a 562 amino acid protein containing an N-terminal zinc finger with homology to Arf GAP domains, a central serine and threonine rich region, and C-terminal phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats characteristic of nucleoporins. To identify an hRIP ortholog in a genetically tractable organism, we performed database searches using the N-terminal zinc finger of hRIP. Using this approach, we identified a novel gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Alignment of the entire reading frame of the putative ortholog with hRIP indicates similarity with the serine/threonine rich region and with the FG repeats, suggesting that S. pombe could be a good model system to study the cellular function of hRIP. We find that the S. pombe ORF is an essential gene, which encodes a 483 amino acid protein that is also able to interact with the NES of HIV- 1 Rev. Based on being an essential gene, and the presence of a putative Arf GAP domain, the ORF was named an Arf GAP essential for viability, agv 1 +. We show that Agv 1 is not directly involved in the nuclear export of poly(A+) RNA or 5 S rRNA, nuclear export of leucine-rich NES-containing proteins, or nuclear import of nuclear localization signal (NLS) -containing proteins. However, Agv 1 does appear to play a role in the cytoplasmic localization of 5 S rRNA. We demonstrate that loss of Agv 1 alters the localization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and Golgi membrane resident proteins, accumulates intracellular membrane, and blocks processing of carboxypeptidase Y. Furthermore, the S. cerevisiae ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPase activating protein (GAP) Glo 3, but not a catalytically inactive Glo 3 mutant [R 59 K], is able to partially compensate for the loss of Agv 1 function in temperature sensitive strains, indicating that Agv 1 is an S. pombe Arf GAP with some functional features similar to S. cerevisiae Glo 3...|$|E
