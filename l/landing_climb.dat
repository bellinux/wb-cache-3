5000|$|During the 1960s, Boeing {{introduced}} the 737, and Douglas {{introduced the}} DC-9, the original models of each being for shorter routes; the 105% figure {{was not an}} issue, thus they had no fuel dump systems installed. During the 1960s and 1970s, both Boeing and Douglas [...] "grew" [...] their respective aircraft as far as operational capabilities were concerned via Pratt & Whitney's development of increasingly powerful variants of the JT8D engines that powered both aircraft series. Both aircraft were now capable of longer duration flights, with increased weight limits, and complying with the existing 105% rule became problematic due to {{the costs associated with}} adding a fuel dump system to aircraft in production. Considering the more powerful engines that had been developed, the FAA changed the rules to delete the 105% requirement, and FAR 25.1001 was enacted stating a jettison system was not required if the climb requirements of FAR 25.119 (<b>Landing</b> <b>Climb)</b> and FAR 25.121 (Approach Climb) could be met, assuming a 15-minute flight. In other words, for a go-around with full landing flaps and all engines operating, and at approach flap setting and one engine inoperative, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} use of high-fidelity multidisciplinary optimization techniques in lowboom supersonic business jet designs {{has been limited}} {{because of the high}} computational cost associated with CFD-based evaluations of both the performance and the loudness of the ground boom of the aircraft. This is particularly true of designs that involve the sonic boom loudness as either a cost function or a constraint because gradient-free optimization techniques may become necessary, leading to even larger numbers of function evaluations. If, in addition, the objective of the design method is to account for the performance of the aircraft throughout its mission (T/O and <b>landing,</b> <b>climb,</b> acceleration, etc.) while including important multi-disciplinary trade-offs between the relevant disciplines (performance, boom, structures, stability and control, propulsion, etc.) the situation only worsens. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a hierarchical multi-fidelity design approach where high-fidelity models are only used where and when they are needed to correct the shortcomings of the low-fidelity models. Our design approach consists of two basic components: a multi-disciplinary aircraft synthesis tool (PASS) that uses highly-tuned low-fidelity models of all of the relevant disciplines an...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Langley low-turbulence pressure tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of climb, cruise, and landing configurations. These tests {{were conducted}} over a Mach number range from 0. 10 to 0. 35, a chord Reynolds number range from 2. 0 x 1 million to 20. 0 x 1 million, and an angle-of-attack range from - 8 deg to 20 deg. Results show that the maximum section lift coefficients increased in the Reynolds number range from 2. 0 x 1 million to 9. 0 x 1 million and reached values of approximately 2. 1, 1. 8, and 1. 5 for the <b>landing,</b> <b>climb,</b> and cruise configurations, respectively. Stall characteristics, although of the trailing-edge type, were abrupt. The section lift-drag ratio of the climb configuration with fixed transition near the leading edge was about 78 at a lift coefficient of 0. 9, a Mach number of 0. 15, and a Reynolds number of 4. 0 x 1 million. Design lift coefficients of 0. 9 and 0. 4 for the climb and cruise configurations were obtained at the same angle of attack, about 6 deg, as intended. Good agreement was obtained between experimental results and the predictions of a viscous, attached-flow theoretical method...|$|E

5000|$|Black Creek, Beaver Creek and Weatherly are all {{historically}} {{related to}} the Beaver Meadow Railroad, an 1830 predecessor railway to (purchased in 1855 by the newly formed) Lehigh Valley Railroad corporation (LV or LVRR), which grew to be a famous Class I railway. [...] The banks-side footpath from the Lehigh River at the 19th century settlement of Lausanne <b>Landing</b> <b>climbed</b> the steep south slopes of Broad Mountain and followed a chain of watercourses to Nescopeck opposite Shickshinny, PA on the main Susquehanna branch. Initially, in 1830, the Beaver Meadow mining operations sent coal out by pack mules, but then capitalized the railway, when the technology was emergent and untried. Consequently, the creek hosted the first operating steam locomotives employed as mobile traction engines in the United States.|$|R

The {{other side of the}} Glan with the buildings of the former Schrammenmühle (a mill) belongs to the former (before the amalgamation) municipal area of Gumbsweiler, itself now part of Sankt Julian, like Eschenau. Some two kilometres up the Glan lies Niederalben’s outlying centre of Neuwirtshaus, and just beyond that is Rathsweiler. About one kilometre down the Glan lies Sankt Julian’s like-named main centre, and across the Glan to the southeast lies another of Sankt Julian’s centres, Gumbsweiler.|$|R

50|$|The scenic, rural double {{village is}} {{nestled in a}} low-mountain {{landscape}} on the upper river Kuralb, which here bears the name Stegbach, and farther up, the names Stegwiesbach and Feldwiesbach. Towards the east, the Kuralb ﬂows by way of Oberalben to the Totenalb and the Steinalb. The village itself lies {{in the southern part}} of a relatively big municipal area at an elevation of some 330 m above sea level. The formerly self-administering village of Dennweiler lies in the northeast of the combined built-up area, while the former village of Frohnbach lies in the southwest.

The Wahnenbusch, the largest contiguous wooded area, is located south of the town of Tenholt and covers 25 ha.
