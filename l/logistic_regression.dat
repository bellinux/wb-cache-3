40|$|The case-parents {{design has}} been widely used to detect genetic {{associations}} as it can prevent spurious association that could occur in population-based designs. When examining the effect of an individual genetic locus on a disease, <b>logistic</b> <b>regressions</b> developed by conditioning on parental genotypes provide complete protection from spurious association caused by population stratification. However, when testing gene-gene interactions, it is unknown whether conditional <b>logistic</b> <b>regressions</b> are still robust. Here we evaluate the robustness and efficiency of several gene-gene interaction tests that are derived from conditional <b>logistic</b> <b>regressions.</b> We found that {{in the presence of}} SNP genotype correlation due to population stratification or linkage disequilibrium, tests with incorrectly specified main-genetic-effect models can lead to inflated type I error rates. We also found that a test with fully flexible main genetic effects always maintains correct test size and its robustness can be achieved with negligible sacrifice of its power. When testing gene-gene interactions is the focus, the test allowing fully flexible main effects is recommended to be used...|$|R
