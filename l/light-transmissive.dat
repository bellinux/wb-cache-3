30|$|Two-year-old saplings were {{collected}} from a short-rotation plantation in the post-mining area of Welzow-Süd, Brandenburg, Germany (N 51 ° 36 ′ 14 ″, E 14 ° 19 ′ 51 ″). The climate at the collection site is transitional between oceanic and continental. The mean annual rainfall is 556 mm and the mean annual temperature is 9.3 °C (Meteorological Station Cottbus 1951 – 2003). Trees were selected {{in order to have}} a comparable trunk diameter (approximately 16 mm) and height (approximately 280 mm). To reduce variation in crown structure, clones presenting only three primary branches were chosen and these were cut back at 100 mm from the trunk before they were transplanted. The nine selected trees were planted directly in 15 L pots and over-wintered under a <b>light-transmissive</b> shelter to avoid frost damage. In March 2011, the young plants were transplanted into wick lysimeters (three trees per lysimeter; Mantovani et al. [2013]; Ben-Gal and Shani [2002]) and fertilised with 1045 mL of Hoagland standard solution (Hoagland and Arnon [1950]) and 3.18 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2 PO 4). The trees were well-watered in the lysimeters during the establishment phase until the start of the experiment in June 2011.|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaics (solar cells) are {{important}} {{in the creation of}} sustainable architecture, but are difficult to integrate into a wide variety of architectural styles, which is necessary if this technology is to be extensively used. Adding variety to the colour range in these installations will provide a way of making this solar energy technology more visually exciting, so methods need to be found to add colour at minimal extra cost, without loss of efficiency. Adding colour to photovoltaic encapsulant materials offers a solution. It is shown that fluorescent, organic Lumogen dyes (BASF) can be added to the photovoltaic encapsulant materials Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) and EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate). The dyes continue to fluoresce within these host materials. Encapsulating a photovoltaic cell with Sylgard containing Lumogen red 300 dye (BASF) demonstrates that light can be transported to a photovoltaic cell by the fluorescent dyes inside the encapsulant material that surrounds the cell. This slightly improves the electricity output from the photovoltaic cell, and is especially promising for use in <b>light-transmissive</b> photovoltaic arrays incorporating widely-spaced photovoltaic cells, such as architectural glass art that incorporates photovoltaics. Further work is needed to test and improve the performance of the dyes over time, to ensure that installations incorporating this technology can last for the minimum twenty years that is the current industry standard for photovoltaics...|$|E
40|$|Within {{this work}} a new {{measurement}} technique to determine 1 D temperature and concentration profiles in gel beads with high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution is presented. In particular for inhomogeneous gels like calcium alginate such a measurement technique is essential to observe local phenomena. The method applied here is linear 1 D-Raman spectroscopy in combination with indirect hard modeling (IHM), which is used for data reduction. IHM is based on parametric pure component models and therefore allows the modeling of nonlinear effects, introduced by mixture and temperature effects. An aqueous solution containing 1 -butanol diffusing into a calcium alginate bead is chosen as model system. This choice is motivated by the practical usage of gel beads to immobilize catalysts for esterifications. The influence of temperature on the spectra of 1 -butanol-water {{as well as the}} determined concentration is analyzed in detail. The temperature is measured by a pseudo concentration measurement. Therefore for each substance two models at two different, but known temperatures are generated. The temperature of the system is correlated to the spectral weight of these components. This approach is applied to pure water and butanol, and furthermore to aqueous solutions containing butanol, alginate or calcium chloride. The presented measurement technique is expected to be suitable for a large variety of substances as long as the system is <b>light-transmissive</b> for the wavelengths used for excitation and detection. The observable substances include many different hydrogels containing even multiple diffusants...|$|E
40|$|Planning {{uncertainty}} {{has long}} {{prevailed in the}} area of facades and skylights due to the use of daylight in buildings. There was a lack of da ta describing the characteristics of daylighting systems and the appropriate planning and consultation software. This led to planning errors and not maximising the potential that facade technology can offer with regard to daylighting. Based on the results of a joint research project, planners will now {{be given the opportunity to}} plan the use of daylight through <b>light-transmissive</b> facade systems correctly and easily with the DIALux evo software. The corresponding data interface allows the use of the calculation within other programs. Facade systems and skylights are measured photometrically in an advanced goniophotometer. Processing algorithms for the measurement da ta allow the calculation of daylight in amount and direction of the interior in conjunction with outdoor lighting. The measurement data are also the basis for the creation of electronic product catalogs where manufacturers can enrich the technical facade systems and skylight data with relevant marketing-related information for the planner (i. e. electric lighting catalogues in DIALux). The lighting design software, DIALux evo, uses the measured data and provides the correct calculation of different daylight conditions. Different system can be compared and optimized directly. Based on the results of daylighting calculation, a complementary electric lighting design can be carried out, which also optimizes the energy use for lighting within the existing architecture...|$|E
40|$|One Method {{to perform}} surface flow {{visualizations}} in water tunnel facilities is the temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) method, {{which is a}} thermographic method. In water facilities it is very beneficial to use the TSP method, because water is <b>light-transmissive</b> for the used wavelengths, the heat capacity of water is large and flow speeds and the propagation speeds are low. At low flow speeds thermographic methods are only capable of visualizing flow structures if a heat flux between model surface and fluid is generated. Therefore, only flow structures with a varying heat transfer coefficient can be detected. The heat flux can be generated, for example, with an electrical model heating. At DLR the possibility to use carbon fiber reinforced plastic as a resistive heater was adapted for the usage in water-facility models. First tests with a flat plate model were performed in the laminar water channel of the Institute of Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics (University of Stuttgart). Exemplarily some results of a Blasius boundary-layer flow disturbed by a two dimensional surface excrescence, i. e. a forward-backward facing step configuration, the junction flow around a cylinder-shaped roughness element and measurements of the laminar to turbulent transition of a Blasius boundary layer are presented. The resistive heating with carbon fiber reinforced plastic proved to fulfill all requirements {{for the application of}} TSP in water facilities: lt is a robust and homogeneous heating. The aspects to implement the heating in more complex models are also described...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} years {{terrestrial}} laser scanning became a standard method of data acquisition for various applications in close range domain, like industrial production, forest inventories, plant engineering and construction, car navigation and – {{one of the most}} important fields – the recording and modelling of buildings. To use laser scanning data in an adequate way, a quality assessment of the laser scanner is inevitable. In the literature some publications can be found concerning the data quality of terrestrial laser scanners. Most of these papers concentrate on the geometrical accuracy of the scanner (errors of instrument axis, range accuracy using target etc.). In this paper a special aspect of quality assessment will be discussed: the influence of different materials and object colours on the recorded measurements of a TLS. The effects on the geometric accuracy as well as on the simultaneously acquired intensity values are the topics of our investigations. A TRIMBLE GX scanner was used for several test series. The study of different effects refer to materials commonly used at building façades, i. e. grey scaled and coloured sheets, various species of wood, a metal plate, plasters of different particle size, <b>light-transmissive</b> slides and surfaces of different conditions of wetness. The tests concerning a grey wedge show a dependence on the brightness where the mean square error (MSE) decrease from black to white, and therefore, confirm previous results of other research groups. Similar results had been obtained with coloured sheets. In this context an important result is that the accuracy of measurements at night-time has proved to be much better than at day time. While different species of wood and different conditions of wetness have no significant effect on the range accuracy the study of a metal plate delivers MSE values considerably higher than the accuracy of the scanner, if the angle of incidence is approximatel...|$|E
30|$|The nine wicked lysimeters {{used for}} water balance and growth {{performance}} evaluations were constructed as follows: polyethylene drums (1968 cm 3, 25 cm radius × 50 cm depth) {{were filled with}} sandy loam soil at bulk density of 1.3 kg m− 3, low in carbon (1.33 %) and nitrogen (0.08 %) Bulk density was estimated by using the thermo-gravimetric method (Jury and Horton [2004]) while the total C and total N were estimated with the dry combustion method by using an elemental analyzer (Elemental Vario EL, LT Scientific, Inc. Nevada, USA). Water was supplied from an automatic drip-irrigation system, installed at the soil-atmosphere interface, only when the soil moisture reached values lower than the predefined values. Uncontrolled water input was avoided by installing the system under a <b>light-transmissive</b> roof and the evaporation was minimised by covering the soil with two separate geotextile layers. To control the irrigation amount and frequency, the soil moisture was measured at 20 cm depth with a Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) probe (SM- 200, Frequency Domain Reflectometry, Soil Moisture Sensor Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). A supplementary FDR probe was installed at 40 cm depth to monitor the soil moisture gradient along the profile. To measure the soil matric potential, two gypsum tensiometers (SIS, UMS, München, Germany) were installed at 20 and 40 cm depth. Solar radiation and wind speed were recorded using a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor (QS 2, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) and a switching anemometer (A 100 R, 119 Vector Instruments, Rhyl, UK) respectively) All measurements were logged at hourly intervals. The data were stored on data loggers (GP 1, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) and transferred using a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) wireless data transmission system to an internet platform (WEBVis, Umweltanalystische Produkte GmbH, Cottbus, Germany). The daily mean vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was calculated from the daily mean temperature and relative humidity, measured from 9 : 00 to 18 : 00. The variation in water storage requirements for the weekly water budget calculation was obtained by measuring the soil moisture at four depths (10, 20, 30, and 40 cm) with a portable FDR profile probe (PR 2 / 4 w- 02, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) on a weekly basis. Water use for a single plant {{during the growing season}} was evaluated from the experimental water balance. Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated at harvest by the ratio between the total above-ground dry biomass (defined and determined below) produced from each tree and its cumulative water use. The economic water-use efficiency was calculated taking only the economically relevant woody biomass into account, since only the only the wood is harvested.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlpine {{environments in}} Europe are {{increasingly}} affected by more erratic precipitation patterns, and more frequent drought and heat waves. Heat-hardening capacity {{is a key}} feature for survival of these abiotic stress factors, but it is poorly understood how heat and drought affect plant performance when combined. The main objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to determine maximum heat hardening capacity in 14 selected plant species and (2) to study how alpine plants respond to combined heat and drought stress compared to heat alone. (3) For risk assessment maximum leaf temperatures were measured in the field and (4) important methodological aspects of testing heat tolerance were evaluated. Heat hardening capacity was assessed by Tc, the heat threshold of photosystem II (PS II), and by heat tolerance tests based on visual inspection of leaf tissue damage or potential quantum efficiency of PS II (Fv/Fm). A purpose-built Heat Tolerance Testing System (HTTS) was used, which allows for controlled heat exposure of whole plants under nearly natural conditions. Additionally, in two species from contrasting habitats, Senecio incanus and Primula minima, the dynamics of heat hardening was studied during and after 8 days exposure to heat (H), or to a combination of heat and severe drought (H+D) within a <b>light-transmissive</b> heat hardening chamber at the alpine field site. In both species, H treatment significantly increased heat tolerance (LT 50), determined by the HTTS, to 58. 0 °C and 54. 9 °C, respectively, and was accompanied by elevated production of abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA), whereas jasmonic acid (JA) levels decreased. Under H+D the LT 50 was only 56. 5 °C and 51. 6 °C, respectively, and levels of ABA were higher in S. incanus and SA lower in both species in comparison to H. Changes in xanthophyll cycle pigments, α-tocopherol and carotenoids:chlorophyll ratio were more pronounced in P. minima than in S. incanus. In P. minima both H and H+D significantly increased singlet oxygen (1 O 2) scavenging capacity, determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). In the field, the maximum half-hourly mean (HHM) leaf temperature of P. minima (32. 2 °C) was significantly lower than of S. incanus (46. 5 °C, a potentially harmful temperature). We conclude that the investigated species are well adapted to the prevailing temperature conditions in the field. They also possess an outstanding heat hardening capacity, but this can be curtailed when heat is combined with drought. As drought further increases leaf temperatures, the risk of suffering lethal heat damage of some species may increase in the future, particularly at south exposed, ruderal alpine sites with uncertain water supply...|$|E
