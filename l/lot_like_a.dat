Carter wrote the episode {{at the same time}} as Duchovny was working on the next episode, [...] "". Kim Manners said preparations were confusing since it wasn't known at the time how the storyline would unfold. Spotnitz said of the end result, [...] "For me, it was a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fifties monster movie with Scully out on the beach with this guy going nuts with a machete, the bug attacks, and the sea of blood. Yeah, it was supposed to be serious business but, overall, I thought it was shaping up as a pretty entertaining hour." ...|$|E
500|$|The album has had [...] "a slow {{progress}} to critical darlinghood"; {{for the most}} part, audiences have remained nonplussed. According to Simon Goddard, most critics regard it as [...] " [...] defining avant-garde masterpiece". The Rolling Stone Album Guide considers The Marble Index the point in Nico's discography where [...] "the difficult listening starts", and the album is [...] "pretty amazing for it". Anthony Carew of About.com called it [...] "a suite of rootless songs written with little precedent" [...] and [...] "an astonishing haunting, {{the work of a}} woman who, even whilst alive, seemed a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ghost". Anthony Thornton of NME called it an [...] "artistic triumph": [...] "Bleak but beautiful, this album remains the most fitting embodiment of her doomed glamour." [...] According to Spin, [...] "Few records, before or since, have sounded lonelier, spookier, or more desolate". Trouser Press described it as [...] "one of the scariest records ever made".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E

500|$|Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] resembles ballads sung by Whitney Houston. Spence D. of IGN {{wrote that the}} song was {{inspired}} by Aretha Franklin's work since [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] consists of several variations in gutturals and octave range. The lyrics of [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song [...] "sounds a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> statement of independence". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable—and that, in fact, her new man will be arriving momentarily." [...] Hermansen said that [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] is a song that [...] "people {{from all walks of}} life can enjoy". Beyoncé said that the song is [...] "a little honest", and, [...] "... basically we can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that. And sometimes you feel like you're not being appreciated. And sometimes they forget that they can be replaced." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the single}} {{received}} favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose the song as an album highlight. Echoing this thought, Steve Beebee of rock magazine Kerrang! added that it [...] "develops into a searching, soulful hook, ranging high {{among the best}} material this band has ever recorded." [...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner labelled the recording as a track to consider downloading, further writing that [...] "'My Heart Is Broken' would strongly beg to differ, with a dashing piano riff skittling over growling guitar strums serving as a backdrop for her emotive alto-soprano." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote, [...] "On 'My Heart Is Broken', a gorgeous piano intro rises alongside Lee's vibrant vocal delivery as Will Hunt's airtight drumming propels the tune into another realm." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME praised [...] "My Heart Is Broken", saying that it [...] "sounds quite a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Disney ballad, beginning with Amy Lee cooing 'I will wander {{until the end of}} time' over a piano line straight off Powers Ballad Vol.12. It gets heavier at the end though, don't worry." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters concluded that the song was [...] "bluntly titled", while The Hollywood Reporters Sophie Schillaci called it a [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] ballad. Describing the song as [...] "fiery", Chad Grischow of IGN noted that in [...] "My Heart Is Broken", [...] "Lee's siren-esque vocals shine, [...] the band takes a few interesting chances late in the album." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe called the single [...] "a banshee howl of defiant, [...] self-lacerating rage." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever, as heard in her piercing wails on hit-in-waiting 'My Heart Is Broken'." [...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic confessed that, [...] "Really, when your heart is broken, you want a song that's as idea driven as 'My Heart is Broken' to carry you through and that's what she [...] delivers." [...] Additionally, Arwa Haider of Metro commented, [...] "Standard romantic rock bluster from Evanescence. Frontwoman Amy Lee still sounds like she’d tear strips off any would-be lothario." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{concludes with}} the love songs, [...] "Comfort You", [...] "Come Here My Love", and [...] "Country Fair"—the latter two {{employing}} the traditional Irish ballad style. [...] To Clinton Heylin, the songs also spoke to [...] "the {{healing power of}} love... here at last are songs that speak of {{what he can do}} for her, rather than concerned solely with his needs and wants." [...] Heylin comments on the song, [...] "Come Here My Love": [...] "This is no 'Autumn Song'. Rather, it sounds a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man learning how to love again." [...] Morrison spoke of [...] "Country Fair" [...] as having the same kind of feeling as [...] "And It Stoned Me", although that song was used to open the Moondance album, instead of as a kind of closure.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{staff writer}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a}} half out of five stars. He said, [...] "This is further proof that Pearl Jam {{consciously}} turned away from the big, anthemic sound and spirit that won them a mass audience with Ten—they still had the songs and sound, they just chose to bury it. Lost Dogs crackles with that passion and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam's albums, it's a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, Lost Dogs captures what Pearl Jam stood for and what it felt like at their peak."

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Firebird's introduction, DeLorean turned his {{attention}} to development of an all-new Grand Prix, the division's personal luxury car based on the full sized Pontiac line since 1962. Sales were sagging by this time however, but the new for 1969 model would have its own distinct body shell with drivetrain and chassis components from the intermediate-sized Pontiac A-body (Tempest, LeMans, GTO). Delorean knew Pontiac Division couldn't finance the new car alone so Delorean went to his former boss Pete Estes and asked to share the cost of development with Pontiac having a one-year exclusivity before Chevrolet would release the 1970 Monte Carlo. The deal was done. The 1969 Pontiac Grand Prix looked a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slightly scaled down Cadillac Eldorado with its razor-sharp bodylines and a [...] hood. Inside was a sporty and luxurious interior highlighted by a wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel, bucket seats and center console. The new model offered a sportier, high performance, somewhat smaller and lower-priced alternative to the other personal luxury cars then on the market such as the Ford Thunderbird, Buick Riviera, Lincoln Continental Mark III, and Oldsmobile Toronado. The 1969 Grand Prix production ended up at over 112,000 units, far higher than the 32,000 1968 Grand Prix built from the full-sized Pontiac body.|$|E

50|$|The intro is the {{introduction}} into the song, the riff is the musical part without voices. The a melo, or a-melody is the first verse in the song, the b melo is {{the bridge of the}} song, and the sabi is the chorus of the song. There is also a c melo after the first sabi, as well as another a/b melo variant after the second sabi.Eurobeat songs often have a beginning section followed by a very loud, highly technical synth riff, which is then repeated after the chorus. Songs usually repeat the verse, bridge, and chorus multiple times during the song.Another thing to note is that the beginning is typically <b>like</b> <b>an</b> instrumental rendition of the verse, bridge, and chorus, while the riff is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> instrumental version of the chorus.|$|R

At least I know that some of the pleasantest recollections of my childhood are connected with the voluntary study of an ancient Bible which belonged to my grandmother. There were splendid pictures in it, to be sure; but I recollect little or nothing about them save a portrait of the high priest in his vestments.
