5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E

25|$|Gracillariidae is an {{important}} family of insects in the order Lepidoptera and the principal family of leaf miners that includes several economic, horticultural or recently invasive pest species such as the horse-chestnut <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Cameraria ohridella.|$|E
25|$|This {{caterpillar}} is a <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> by {{habit and}} this serves as its defense. As {{soon as it}} hatches it bores into the leaf and will {{spend the rest of}} its life between the epidermal layers of the leaf. Occasionally it will change leaves.|$|E
25|$|B. lecheguana is a known natural {{enemy of}} the coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> Leucoptera coffeella, along with several other species of wasp {{including}} Polistes versicolor, Polybia paulista, Polybia occidentalis, Polybia scutellaris, and Protonectarina sylveirae. B. lecheguana are often used as biological controls in coffee plantations {{in order to prevent}} the proliferation of the devastating <b>leaf</b> <b>miner.</b> In order to test the effect pesticides have on the environment and to test the efficacy of using pesticides in conjunction with natural predators, the effect that several pesticides have on the health of B. lecheguana and other wasps was assayed. This wasp species is found to be highly susceptible to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphate pesticides. Even at half the recommended dosage of a number of these pesticides, the wasp was found to have nearly 100% mortality.|$|E

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>miners</b> {{typically}} show non-random distributions both {{between and}} within plants. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> on two oak species were clumped on individual host trees and individual branches and addressed whether clumping was influenced by aspects of plant quality and how clumping and/or interactions with other oak herbivores affected leaf-miner survivorship. Null models were used to test whether oak herbivores and different herbivore guilds co-occur at the plant scale. Twenty individual Quercus geminata plants and 20 Quercus laevis plants were followed over the season for the appearance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> and other herbivores, and foliar nitrogen, tannin concentration, leaf toughness and leaf water content were evaluated monthly for each individual tree. The survivorship {{of the most common}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> was evaluated by following the fate of marked mines in several combinations that involved intraand inter-specific associations. We observed that all <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> studied were clumped at the plant and branch scale, and the abundance of most leaf-miner species was influenced by plant quality traits. Mines that occurred singly on leaves exhibited significantly higher survivorship than double and triple mines and leaves that contained a mine or a leaf gall and a mine and damage by chewers exhibited lowest survivorship. Although <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> were clumped at individual host trees, null model analyses indicated that oak herbivores do not co-occur significantly less than expected by chance and there was no evidence for biological mechanisms such as inter-specific competition determining community structure at the plant scale. Thus, despite co-occurrence resulting in reduced survivorship at the leaf scale, such competition was not strong enough to structure separation of these oak herbivore communities...|$|R

However, in the mid-twentieth century, L. sativae became a serious pest of {{tomatoes}} in Florida, having been a minor problem before, when use of insecticides (DDT and BHC) proved more lethal to the braconid wasps that parasitised them than to the other insects the pesticides were designed to control.

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>miners</b> are insects whose larval stages live {{between layers}} of leaf epidermis, feeding on {{mesophyll}} and lower epidermis to create mine-like cavities. Little {{is known about}} the ecology or distribution of <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia. We investigated the incidence of <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in relation to aridity, vegetation types, host plant taxonomy, leaf traits, canopy cover and latitude. We surveyed <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> at 15 sites in NSW, eastern Australia, situated along a rainfall gradient from 300 to 1700 mm per annum and a latitudinal gradient of 28 °S to 33 °S, within four vegetation types (mallee, heath, woodland and rainforest). Leaf mining was recorded from 36 plant species, 89 % of which had no previous record of mining. The proportion of mined plant species at each site varied, but {{there was no significant difference}} between vegetation types. Leaf mining presence was positively correlated with both total leaf length and leaf thickness. No significant correlations were found between the proportion of mined species at a site and rainfall, latitude or foliar projected cover. We conclude that leaf mining is a widespread type of insect herbivory whose distribution patterns are more likely to be influenced by biotic than abiotic factors. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} (FA) represents small, random variation from symmetry {{and can be}} used as {{an indicator}} of plant susceptibility to herbivory. We investi-gated the effects of FA of two oak species, Quercus laevis and Q. geminata, and the responses of three herbivore guilds: <b>leaf</b> <b>miners,</b> gallers, and chewers. To examine differences in FA and herbivory between individuals, 40 leaves from each tree were collected, and FA indices were calculated. To examine differences in FA and herbivory within-individuals, we sampled pairs of mined and unmined leaves for asymmetry measurements. Differences in growth of <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> between <b>leaf</b> types were determined by tracing 50 mines of each species on symmetric leaves and asymmetric leaves. Asymmetric leaves contained significantly lower concentrations of tannins and higher concentrations of nitrogen than symmetric leaves for both plant species. Both frequency of asymmetric leaves on plants and levels of asymmetry positively influenced the abundance of Brachys, Stilbosis and other <b>leaf</b> <b>miners,</b> but no significant relationship between asymmetry and herbivory was observed for Acrocercops. Brachys and Stilbosis mines were smaller on asymmetric leaves, but differences in mine survivorship between symmetric and asymmetric leaves were observed only for Stilbosis mines. This study indicated that <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> might use <b>leaf</b> FA as a cue to plant quality, although differential survivorship among leaf types was not observed for all species studied. Reasons for the different results between guilds are discussed...|$|R
