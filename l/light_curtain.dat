The wick of one was still warm, {{as if it had been}} {{recently}} extinguished. As the light slowly radiated, he could see that she was regarding him with an air of affected unconcern, but a somewhat heightened color. It was like her, and not inconsistent with his idea that she had come there to avoid an after scene with Mrs. McClosky or himself, or perhaps both. The room was not disarranged in any way.

50|$|<b>Light</b> <b>curtain</b> {{systems may}} be used alone or in {{conjunction}} with other guarding systems. The <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> projects a field or beams of light between two points and, when the field is broken-at any point, the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> system interrupts the circuit it is wired into. These can be used in areas where an operator must interact with operating equipment to prevent movement of the equipment while the operator works a hazardous area.Pressure sensitive mats that are wired into the equipment’s control system can be placed in hazardous areas and be set to stop the equipment if stepped on. These devices can be used alone or {{in conjunction with other}} guarding devices, usually at operator interaction points.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>curtain</b> puppet presentations use {{light to}} {{highlight}} small portions {{of a performance}} area, allowing the puppet to be seen while the manipulators remain invisible. The puppets stand on a stage divided into an unlit background and a well-lit foreground, meeting to form a [...] "curtain" [...] of light. The puppeteer dresses in black and remains hidden in the unlit background of the stage while the puppet is held across the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> in the lit foreground of the stage. [...] "Light curtain puppet" [...] is an umbrella term, and any puppet which is extended into a well-lit area where its handler remains separated from the puppet by a division of light may be called a <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> puppet.|$|E
50|$|Safety <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{opto-electronic}} {{devices that}} are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as presses, winders and palletisers. Safety <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, safety <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of safety <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
50|$|Typically, safety <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{connected}} to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard {{in the event that}} an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the safety <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures.|$|R

This technology allows whiteboards to be made of any material; with this system no dry-erase marker or stylus is needed.|$|E
50|$|Packaging Equipment or pallet {{wrappers}} have {{a moving}} load and an arm that stretches plastic wrap around the load. Typically a three sided wire partition guard is placed around the wrapper, and a <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> controls {{access to the}} open side where the wrapper is accessed by a lift truck.Robotic Welding Cells incorporate wire mesh fixed barriers outfitted with vinyl welding curtains and light curtains or pressure sensitive mats. The welding curtains mounted inside of the fixed barrier control exposure to welding flash, sparks and spatter from the welding operation. While the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> or pressure sensitive mats prevent welding operations while the operator is loading/unloading the weld fixtures. Robotic Material Handling for pallet pack or de-palletizing could use any of the aforementioned guarding systems. Light curtains or pressure sensitive mats {{around the perimeter of}} the work area that stop the robot when an operator enters. Wire partition could be used around the work area with an interlocked gate which stops the robot when opened.|$|E

The Mercedes designers have also achieved a new-quality light production: transparent lenses that produce a red <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> which tapers smoothly towards the sides, creating a lightly diffused effect. This effect is repeated in white by the front headlamps. What's more, the front lights feature new lens technology and a plexiglas edge to produce [...] "C" [...] shaped daytime driving lights {{with the help of}} state-of-the-art LED headlamp technology.|$|E
50|$|Presence Sensing Devices (PSD) {{are one of}} {{the more}} common safety devices for press brake safety. It is {{difficult}} to protect the operator using a metal bending machine such as a press brake. Often the operator must hold the sheet metal work-piece in one place while another portion of the piece is being formed in the die. If a foreign object is detected, the laser, camera, or <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> technology will immediately retract the die or stop the motion of the ram. PSDs protect the operator and other employees in the area.|$|E
5000|$|Laser <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> — An {{infrared}} laser {{is located}} in each upper corner of the whiteboard. The laser beam sweeps across the whiteboard surface—much like a lighthouse sweeps light across the ocean—by using a rotating mirror. Reflectors on the stylus or marker reflect the laser beam back to the source and the (X,Y) position can be triangulated. This technology may be combined with a hard (usually ceramic on steel) surface, which has long life and erases cleanly. Markers and styli are passive, but must have reflective tape to work.|$|E
50|$|Much {{within the}} {{buildings}} is highly automated. Everything from <b>lighting,</b> <b>curtains,</b> home networks and even washing machines can be pre-set to perform certain actions at a defined time {{or when a}} mode is activated from the control panels. The entire home can be controlled through the owner's mobile phone.|$|R
50|$|Safety <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{supplied}} as a {{pair with}} a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists {{of a number of}} photoelectric cells. When an object breaks {{one or more of the}} beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment.|$|R
50|$|Safety <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> {{fall into}} a {{category}} of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive safety mats and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important application of safety relays is in automation industries dealing with robotic cell set up.|$|R
5000|$|Projector/Laser <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> — A dual {{infrared}} laser {{device is}} positioned {{in the top}} middle area of a flat surface. The laser beam sweeps across the surface creating an invisible curtain. The projector, usually an ultra short throw projector) has a built in camera with an infrared filter that scans the projected area. When a pointer, finger or marker disrupts the laser curtain, an X,Y position can be traced. This {{is one of the}} few optical technologies that do not require a reflecting frame in the perimeter of the projected area to work.|$|E
50|$|GoalRef {{features}} a passive electronic circuit {{embedded in the}} ball and a low-frequency magnetic field around the goal. Any change in the field on or behind the goalline is detected by coils embedded in the goal frame, which determine the scoring of a goal. By producing low magnetic fields around the goals, GoalRef creates the radio equivalent of a <b>light</b> <b>curtain.</b> As soon as the ball has wholly crossed the goal line between the posts, {{a change in the}} magnetic field is detected. A goal alert is then instantaneously transmitted to the game officials using an encrypted radio signal, with a message displayed on their wristwatches.|$|E

The two-antenna configuration (2) reads a transponder (3) {{mounted on the}} vehicle's windshield. As the vehicle passes through the exit <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> (4), it is electronically classified by the treadle (5) {{based on the number}} of axles, and the ETC account is charged the proper amount. Feedback is provided to the driver on an electronic sign (6). If the vehicle does not have a transponder, the system classifies it as a violator and cameras (7) take photos of the vehicle and its license plate for processing. If the license plate is registered as belonging to a FasTrak user, the account is debited only the toll charge, and no penalty is charged.|$|E

5000|$|One {{category}} of presence sensing devices is Photoelectric Sensors. Light Curtains {{fall into this}} category. Light curtains use many infrared light beams to form a perimeter around machinery. When two or more consecutively adjacent beams are interrupted, a kill-switch stops the machine until the boundary is reset. Light curtains must be {{placed in front of}} the work area. This makes it difficult for press brake operators to work on small parts. One cannot help but disrupt the beam. The operator might [...] "mute" [...] the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> {{in order to get the}} job done. Certain parts of the beam can be muted. For example, muting the front and rear of the beam allows the middle to offer continued protection for the operator. Additionally, it may be necessary to use auxiliary light beams if the operator will reach between the main light beams and the edge of certain machines.|$|E
5000|$|... openSAFETY is a {{communications}} protocol used to transmit {{information that is}} crucial for the safe operation of machinery in manufacturing lines, process plants, or similar industrial environments. Such information may be e.g. an alert signal triggered when someone or something has breached a <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> on a factory floor. While traditional safety solutions rely on dedicated communication lines connecting machinery and control systems via special relays, openSAFETY does not need any extra cables reserved for safety-related information. It is a bus-based protocol that allows for passing on safety data over existing Industrial Ethernet connections between end devices and higher-level automation systems - connections principally established and used for regular monitoring and control purposes. Unlike other bus-based safety protocols that are suitable for use only with a single or a few specific Industrial Ethernet implementations and are incompatible with other systems, openSAFETY works {{with a wide range}} of different Industrial Ethernet variants.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic and servo-electric {{machines}} are typically used in lower tonnage applications. Hydraulic brakes produce accurate high quality products, are reliable, use little energy and are safer because, unlike flywheel-driven presses, {{the motion of}} the ram can be easily stopped at any time in response to a safety device, e.g. a <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> or other presence sensing device. Recent improvements are mainly in the control and a device called a backgauge. A back gauge is a device {{that can be used to}} accurately position a piece of metal so that the brake puts the bend in the correct place. Furthermore, the back gauge can be programmed to move between bends to repeatedly make complex parts. Early brakes relied on the tooling to determine the bend angle of the bend. The animation to the right shows the operation of the back gauge, setting the distance from the edge of the material or previous bend to the center of the die.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Ram / Slide=== The {{vertical}} {{motion of the}} slide acts like a hammer to an anvil. When presses are used manually, where an operator is loading and unloading parts, extreme caution should be used and proper methods of safe guarding should be in place. With the addition of safety <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> and an I-PRESS control, the <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> can then be muted or turned off on the slide upstroke to increase productivity when press is being used in single stroke mode. Standard modes of operation with up to date safe press controls are OFF-INCH-SINGLE STROKE & CONTINUOUS modes which can be selected via a keyed mode selector switch. Special modes of operation include, MICRO INCH-SSD/SINGLE ON DEMAND & CSD/CONTINUOUS ON DEMAND. Micro Inch is normally used for die set up near the BDC / Bottom Dead Center, SSD Single Stroke on Demand can be used when long coil feed lengths or automation loading and unloading will trigger SSD. CSD Continuous on Demand is normally used when press are used in roll form lines or irregular stroking is required when punching holes in large panel with gag feed dies.|$|R

As featured within this novel, Nüwa is very highly respected {{since the time}} of the Xia Dynasty for being the daughter of the Jade Emperor; Nüwa is also regularly called the [...] "Snake Goddess". After the Shang Dynasty had been created, Nüwa created the five-colored stones to protect the dynasty with occasional seasonal rains and other enhancing qualities. Thus in time, Shang Rong asked King Zhou of Shang to pay her a visit as a sign of deep respect. After Zhou was completely overcome with lust at the very sight of the beautiful ancient goddess Nüwa (who had been sitting behind a <b>light</b> <b>curtain),</b> he would write a small poem on a neighboring wall and take his leave. When Nüwa later returned to her temple after visiting the Yellow Emperor, Nüwa would see the foulness of Zhou's words. In her anger, she swore that the Shang Dynasty would end in payment for his foulness. In her rage, Nüwa would personally ascend to the palace in an attempt to kill the king, but was suddenly struck back by two large beams of red light.|$|E
5000|$|Wicked Twister {{has many}} {{additional}} safety systems installed because it passes the station multiple times, and at high speeds. The {{first of these}} systems is a [...] "light curtain", named for the nature in which it operates. Two emitters and two receivers are placed {{on each side of}} the ride station. Each emitter sends a thick, invisible beam of light towards the receiver on the other side. If at any time this beam is broken during ride operation, it will automatically emergency stop. Another safety system is installed under the station, attached to the automatic platform gates. If an individual places too much downward vertical force, or shakes the gates, the ride emergency stops. Yet another safety system is located on all other gates on the ride, including entrance and exit. The gates are electromagnetically sealed while the ride is in progress, to ensure guests do not enter. After the 2009 season yet another safety system was installed on the train that wirelessly communicates with the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> mentioned above that can stop the train anywhere on the launch/brake section of the track when the light is broken.|$|E
40|$|Active {{optical sensing}} (LIDAR and <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> transmission) devices {{mounted on a}} mobile {{platform}} can correctly detect, localize, and classify trees. To conduct an evaluation and comparison of the different sensors, an optical encoder wheel was used for vehicle odometry and provided a measurement of the linear displacement of the prototype vehicle along a row of tree seedlings as a reference for each recorded sensor measurement. The field trials were conducted in a juvenile tree nursery with one-year-old grafted almond trees at Sierra Gold Nurseries, Yuba City, CA, United States. Through these tests and subsequent data processing, each sensor was individually evaluated to characterize their reliability, {{as well as their}} advantages and disadvantages for the proposed task. Test results indicated that 95. 7 % and 99. 48 % of the trees were successfully detected with the LIDAR and <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> sensors, respectively. LIDAR correctly classified, between alive or dead tree states at a 93. 75 % success rate compared to 94. 16 % for the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> sensor. These results can help system designers select the most reliable sensor for the accurate detection and localization of each tree in a nursery, which might allow labor-intensive tasks, such as weeding, to be automated without damaging crops.
