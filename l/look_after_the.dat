5|$|A medical {{program was}} {{established}} at Los Alamos under Captain James F. Nolan of the United States Army Medical Corps. Initially, a small five-bed infirmary was established for civilians, and a three-bed infirmary for military personnel. More serious cases were {{handled by the}} Army's Bruns General Hospital in Santa Fe, but this was soon regarded as unsatisfactory due {{to the loss of}} time due to the long trip, and security risks. Nolan recommended that the infirmaries be consolidated and expanded into a 60-bed hospital. A 54-bed hospital was opened in 1944, staffed by Army personnel. A dentist arrived in March 1944. A Veterinary Corps officer, Captain J. Stevenson, had already been assigned to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> guard dogs.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{inquiries}} into Smith's background, police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him. Patricia Lynott, a 47-year-old divorced mother of two, had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid-1990s. On 23 October 2000, while she was employed at the Rainbow as a cleaner and to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> licensee's children, she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on Maxstoke Street, Bordesley Green.

5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an {{official}} librarian to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> collection and the library contains his many catalogues entitled Aedes Althorpianæ, documenting the books of the library. The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery {{on the first floor}} above it. By the time of George John's death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added {{to the ends of the}} library during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.|$|E

She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.|$|E

At {{the end of}} the First World War, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission's foundation, it had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent disease and hunger. It also established the Nansen passport as a means of identification for stateless people.|$|E
5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> family's jewellery business.|$|E

When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonalds {{initially}} {{lived with}} another family, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James {{died from a}} blow to the head by a servant who was supposed to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the Midland District. John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.|$|E

5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> prisoners. The Tower {{was often a}} safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh {{was held in the}} Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E
5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to <b>look</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
