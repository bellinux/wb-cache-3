5|$|The 1984 Summer Olympics {{became a}} {{watershed}} moment in Olympic history. The <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> organising committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, {{was able to}} generate a surplus of US$225million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time. The organising committee {{had been able to}} create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies. The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand. Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50million for a four-year membership. Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Operation California {{began using}} the name Operation USA because it better {{described}} the effort and intent of the organization to represent the entire American people. In 1989 Operation USA facilitated operations on children in Vietnam who had cleft palates by a <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> plastic surgeon, Dr Stanley Frileck. Medical aid and rebuilding effort was delivered to Mexico in 1990, by OPUSA. In 1991 OPUSA delivered aid to Bangladesh. OpUSA delivered aid to war torn Somali's in 1993. In 1994 OpUSA provided earthquake relief. In 1995 the organization provided aid to Hurricane Mitch survivors in Honduras and Nicaragua. In 1999 OpUSA supplied aid to storm victims in Mexico.

5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E
5|$|Sigi Schmid {{was born}} in Tübingen, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved {{with his family to}} the United States; they took up {{residence}} in Torrance, California, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a prisoner of war during World War II, worked at Pabst Brewing; his mother, Doris, ran a <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> German deli, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making him feel German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a stuttering speech disorder he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching Bundesliga clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for the inaugural American Youth Soccer Organization team, an achievement for which he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E
5|$|Duane Allman, and {{his younger}} brother, Gregg, grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida. Gregg was first {{to pick up the}} guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, {{dropping}} out of high school to practice constantly. The duo formed their first band, the Escorts, which evolved into the Allman Joys in the mid-1960s. When a black friend introduced Gregg to R and soul music, they began to incorporate it into their sound. By 1967, the group spent time in St. Louis, where a <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the Hour Glass, cutting two unsuccessful albums for Liberty Records. Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, while Gregg stayed behind in Hollywood bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career. The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in Miami, producing an album-length demo with the 31st of February, a group that included drummer Butch Trucks.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Kingsglaive was based around {{a portion of}} the {{original}} opening of Final Fantasy XV, which would have shown the invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of Kingsglaive. To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff. The storyline was designed to complement and {{set the stage for the}} events of Final Fantasy XV without revealing major plot elements from the game. The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team. As many team members were Final Fantasy fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.|$|E
5|$|Two rule {{changes were}} made for the 79th Academy Awards {{in regard to the}} Best Foreign Language Film process. The first was instituting a two-step process in {{choosing}} the nominees for the award in order to allow New York-based members of the Academy to participate. An initial committee would select nine films to form a shortlist in January that would then be reviewed by a committee composed of ten members of the initial committee, ten <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles-based</b> members, and ten New York-based members that would select the final five nominees. The second change was the removal of a rule requiring that the films be in an official language of the submitting country. This was done in response to the rejection of Italy's and Austria's submissions for the 78th Academy Awards, Private and Caché respectively, because they were not filmed in the official language of their respective countries. This allowed for the acceptance of submissions such as Canada's Water, which contained solely Hindi dialogue. Following the revealing of the shortlist, the Academy released a list of the five nominees on January 23, 2007. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was Germany's The Lives of Others, which was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.|$|E
5|$|Beth asks Mick to {{help her}} friend Morgan find her stolen cameras. When he meets her, Mick is {{completely}} shocked; Morgan is identical to his ex-wife, Coraline. He becomes even more confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that Morgan is human. Mick tries to expose Morgan as Coraline, but finally comes {{to believe that she}} is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did.
