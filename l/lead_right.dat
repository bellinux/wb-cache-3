25|$|The Raiders {{scored on}} their first drive {{of the second half}} with Stabler's 41-yard {{completion}} to Cliff Branch setting up his 8-yard touchdown pass to Casper.

But Baltimore still took the <b>lead</b> <b>right</b> back as Marshall Johnson returned the ensuing kickoff 87 yards to the end zone. On Oakland's next possession, they lost their fourth turnover of the day when Laird picked off another Stabler pass, this one on the Raiders 40.

500|$|California Chrome's first graded stakes win was the March 8 Grade II San Felipe Stakes. Espinoza tried a {{different}} riding tactic {{and let the}} horse go to the <b>lead</b> <b>right</b> out of the gate. [...] California Chrome led most of the way, and after Espinoza gave him one tap on the shoulder with the whip, the horse {{pulled away from the}} field {{at the top of the}} homestretch and won by [...] lengths. Alan Sherman said, [...] "My jaw dropped", while Art Sherman joked, [...] "I'm glad I'm training at Los Alamitos, because he looked like a 350 [...] horse coming out of the gate"; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances. Espinoza remarked, [...] "I wanted to let him enjoy his race," [...] later adding, [...] "I wanted to see if he [...] go wire to wire... that was the day I found out how much he loves to run." [...] The San Felipe was California Chrome's first win in a race open to all three-year-olds, not just California-breds, and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system.|$|E

Traditionally, the <b>Lead's</b> <b>right</b> hand is on the follow's back, near the lowest part of the shoulder-blade.

Very still and mild it was, {{wrapped in a}} great, white, brooding silence--a silence which was yet threaded through with many little silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened as much with your soul as your ears.

Crestwick was somewhere {{on the wrong side of}} the crack, which seemed to <b>lead</b> <b>right</b> across the stream toward the confusion of broken ridges and hummocks which, as Lisle remembered, fringed the opposite bank. He must endeavor to find the place where the lad had got across; but this was difficult, for fresh breaches and ridges drove him back from the edge. Presently the chasm ended in a wide opening filled with an inky flood, and Lisle, turning back a yard or two, braced himself and jumped.|$|E

"You see one doesn't {{want to use}} {{terms that}} have been used in a {{thousand}} different senses in any way that isn't a perfectly unambiguous sense, {{and at the same time}} one doesn't want to seem to be canting about things or pitching anything a note or two higher than it ought legitimately to go, but it seems to me that this sort of something that Mr. Britling is always asking for in his essays and writings and things, and what you are looking for just as much and which seems so important to you that even love itself is a secondary kind of thing until you can square the two together, is nothing more nor less than Religion--I don't mean this Religion or that Religion but just Religion itself, a Big, Solemn, Comprehensive Idea that holds you and me and all the world together in one great, grand universal scheme. And though it isn't quite the sort of idea of love-making that's been popular--well, in places like Carrierville--for some time, it's the right idea; it's got to be followed out if we don't want love-making to be a sort of idle, troublesome game of treats and flatteries that is sure as anything to <b>lead</b> <b>right</b> away to disappointments and foolishness and unfaithfulness and--just Hell. What you are driving at, according to my interpretation, is that marriage has got to be a religious marriage or else you are splitting up life, that religion and love are most of life and all the power there is in it, and that they can't afford to be harnessed in two different directions.... I never had these ideas until I came here and met you, but they come up now in my mind as though they had always been there.... And that's why you don't want to marry in a hurry. And that's why I'm glad almost that you don't want to marry in a hurry." ...|$|E

Why friend, it may be, nay twenty to one, but thou hast been, ever since thou didst come into the world, with thy back towards heaven, and thy face towards hell; and thou, it may be, either through ignorance or carelessness, which is as bad, if not worse, hast been running full hastily that way ever since. Why friend? I beseech thee put a little stop to thy earnest race, and take a view of what entertainment thou art like to have, if thou do in deed and in truth persist in this thy course. Friend, thy way leads 'down to death,' and thy 'steps take hold on hell' (Prov 5:5). It may be the path indeed is pleasant to the flesh, but the end thereof will be bitter to thy soul. Hark, dost thou not hear the bitter cries of them that are but newly gone before, saying, Let him 'dip {{the tip of his}} finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame?' (Luke 16:24). Dost thou not hear them say, Send out from the dead, to prevent my father, my brother, and my father's house, from coming 'into this place of torment?' Shall not then these mournful groans pierce thy flinty heart? Wilt thou stop thine ears, and shut thy eyes? And wilt thou not regard? Take warning and stop thy journey before it be too late. Wilt thou be like the silly fly, that is not quiet unless she be either entangled in the spider's web, or burned in the candle? Wilt thou be like the bird that hasteth to the snare of the fowler? Wilt thou be like that simple one named in the seventh of Proverbs, that will be drawn to the slaughter by the cord of a silly lust? O sinner, sinner, there are better things than hell to be had, and at a cheaper rate by the thousandth part! O! there is no comparison, there is heaven, there is God, there is Christ, there is communion with an innumerable company of saints and angels. Hear the message then that God doth send, that Christ doth send, that saints do bring, nay, that the dead do send unto thee: 'I pray thee, therefore, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house'; 'if one went unto them from the dead they would repent.' 'How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And the scorners delight in their scorning? And fools hate knowledge?' 'Turn you at my reproof: behold,' saith God, 'I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.' I say, hear this voice, O silly one, and turn and live, thou sinful soul, lest he make thee hear that other saying, But, 'because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh' (Prov 1:22-26).|$|E
