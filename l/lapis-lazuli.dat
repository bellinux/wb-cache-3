Heaven was separated from the earth by the firmament, the visible sky, a solid inverted bowl where God's throne sat [...] "on the vaulted roof of earth."(Isaiah 40:22).

2500|$|Sapir (סַפִּיר = in the masoretic text) / Sapphiros (in the Septuagint) - despite {{appearing}} {{to refer to}} Sapphire, Sapphire was essentially unknown before {{the era of the}} Roman Empire and its use in Greek texts is believed to be a mere transliteration of the Hebrew. Once it became more known, it was treated as merely being a form of hyacinth or of jacinth. It is more likely that the term Sapir referred to a mineral of similar colour to Sapphires, and that the name gradually came to refer to the latter mineral, on account of its colour; scholars think the most likely candidate is lapis lazuli, a stone with a deep, ocean-blue colour which was frequently sent as a gift to Akhenaten from Babylon. Theophrastus mentions the stone sapphirus as being [...] "dark" [...] and having the [...] "colour of verdigris," [...] as well as being [...] "speckled as of with gold." [...] By all accounts, his description fits the <b>lapis-lazuli.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{travellers}} {{landed on}} a vast flight of sparkling steps of <b>lapis-lazuli.</b> Ascending, they entered beautiful gardens; winding walks that yielded to the feet, and accelerated your passage by their rebounding pressure; fragrant shrubs covered with dazzling flowers, the fleeting tints of which changed every moment; groups of tall trees, with strange birds of brilliant and variegated plumage, singing and reposing in their sheeny foliage, and fountains of perfumes.|$|E
60|$|They all {{followed}} the leader, all the Gods, all the genii; in the midst, the brawny husband of Hebe bearing Ixion aloft, {{bound to the}} fatal wheel. They reached the terrace; they descended the sparkling steps of <b>lapis-lazuli.</b> Hercules held his burthen on high, ready, at a nod, to plunge the hapless but presumptuous mortal through space into Hades.

With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> while two lovely voices sang: ...|$|E
60|$|The door opened, {{and they}} found {{themselves}} in a vast and gorgeous hall. Pillars of many-coloured marbles rose from a red and blue pavement of the same material, and supported a vaulted, circular, and highly-embossed roof of purple, scarlet, and gold.[23] Around a fountain, which rose fifty feet in height from an immense basin of <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> and reclining on small yellow Barbary mats, was a group of Nubian eunuchs, dressed in rich habits of scarlet and gold,[24] and armed with ivory battle-axes, the white handles worked in precious arabesque finely contrasting with the blue and brilliant blades.|$|E
60|$|So I conquered, {{though the}} victory left me {{trembling}} like a child, and wishing that I {{had not been}} born to know the pangs of love denied. My reward was very swift, for just then Merapi unfastened a gem from the breast of her white robe and held it towards the moon, as though to study it. In an instant I knew it again. It was that royal scarab of <b>lapis-lazuli</b> with which in Goshen the Prince had made fast the bandage on her wounded food, which also had been snatched from her breast by some power on that night when the statue of Amon was shattered in the temple.|$|E
60|$|There was sea-green watered silk {{with golden}} dragons; terra-cotta crêpe with ivory-white {{chrysanthemums}} clustering upon it; black-barred silk shot with yellow flames; <b>lapis-lazuli</b> silk and silver fishes; avanturine silk with plaques of grey-green let in; {{cloth of gold}} over dragon's blood; and saffron and brown silk stiff as a board with embroidery. We returned to the temple now filled with the gorgeous robes. The little lacquer stands were the priests' book-racks. Some lay down among them, while others moved very softly about the golden altars and the incense-burners; and the high priest disposed himself, {{with his back to}} the congregation, in a golden chair through which his robe winked like the shards of a tiger-beetle.|$|E
60|$|Among this {{assembly}} {{were men}} and women burned to an even blue-black tint--civilised people with bleached hair and sparkling eyes. They explained themselves as 'diggers'--just diggers--and opened me a new world. Granted that all Egypt is one big undertaker's emporium, {{what could be more}} fascinating than to get Government leave to rummage in a corner of it, to form a little company and spend the cold weather trying to pay dividends in the shape of amethyst necklaces, <b>lapis-lazuli</b> scarabs, pots of pure gold, and priceless bits of statuary? Or, if one is rich, what better fun than to grub-stake an expedition on the supposed site of a dead city and see what turns up? There was a big-game hunter who had used most of the Continent, quite carried away by this sport.|$|E
6000|$|The ball-room is beautiful--all marble, and {{yet with}} a comfortable, cheerful look; the other apartments are not less agreeable, {{and the people}} looked with intense {{satisfaction}} at some great <b>lapis-lazuli</b> tables, which the guide informed us were worth four millions, more or less; adding with a very knowing look, that they were un peu plus cher que l'or. This speech has a tremendous effect on visitors, and when we met some of our steamboat companions in the Park or elsewhere--in so small a place as this one falls in with them a dozen times a day--"Have you seen the tables?" [...] was the general question. Prodigious tables are they, indeed! Fancy a table, my dear--a table four feet wide--a table with legs. Ye heavens! the mind can hardly picture to itself anything so beautiful and so tremendous! ...|$|E
60|$|A <b>lapis-lazuli</b> {{coloured}} locomotive which, by accident, had a {{mixed train}} {{attached to it}} happened to loaf up to the platform just then, and we entered a first-class English compartment. There was no stupid double roof, window shade, or abortive thermantidote. It was a London and South-Western carriage. Osaka is about eighteen miles from Kobé, and stands {{at the head of}} the bay of Osaka. The train is allowed to go as fast as fifteen miles an hour and to play at the stations all along the line. You must know that the line runs between the hills and the shore, and the drainage-fall is a great deal steeper than anything we have between Saharunpur and Umballa. The rivers and the hill torrents come down straight from the hills on raised beds of their own formation, which beds again have to be bunded and spanned with girder bridges or--here, perhaps, I may be wrong--tunnelled.|$|E
60|$|After {{some time}} {{he rose from}} his seat, and leaning against the carved {{penthouse}} of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room. The walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty. A large press, inlaid with agate and <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, {{and a cup of}} dark-veined onyx. Pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling. A laughing Narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head. On the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were about}} to withdraw, or rather to ask her what she ailed, when {{suddenly}} she turned her head, so that the light fell full upon her face. So lovely was it that I caught my breath and the Prince at my side started. Indeed {{it was more than}} lovely, for as a lamp shines through an alabaster vase or a shell of pearl so did the spirit within this woman shine through her tear-stained face, making it mysterious as the night. Then I understood, perhaps for the first time, that it is the spirit which gives true beauty both to maid and man and not the flesh. The white vase of alabaster, however shapely, is still a vase alone; it is the hidden lamp within that graces it with the glory of a star. And those eyes, those large, dreaming eyes aswim with tears and hued like richest <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> oh! what man could look on them and not be stirred? ...|$|E
60|$|We have next {{to inquire}} whether this view can be extended, through {{the law of}} the equal {{transmission}} of characters to both sexes, to those groups in which the males and females are brilliant in the same or nearly the same degree and manner. In such a genus as Labrus, which includes some of the most splendid fishes in the world, for instance, the Peacock Labrus (L. pavo), described,[25] with pardonable exaggeration, as formed of polished scales of gold encrusting <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> rubies, sapphires, emeralds and amethysts, we may, with much probability, accept this belief; for we have seen that the sexes in at least one species differ greatly in colour. With some fishes, as with many of the lowest animals, splendid colours may be the direct result of the nature of their tissues and of the surrounding conditions, without any aid from selection. The goldfish (Cyprinus auratus), judging from the analogy of the golden variety of the common carp, is, perhaps, a case in point, as it may owe its splendid colours to a single abrupt variation, due to the conditions to which this fish has been subjected under confinement. It is, however, more probable that these colours have been intensified through artificial selection, as this species has been carefully bred in China from a remote period.[26] Under natural conditions it does not seem probable that beings so highly organised as fishes, and which live under such complex relations, should become brilliantly coloured without suffering some evil or receiving some benefit from so great a change, and consequently without the intervention of natural selection.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing becomes Makná {{better than}} the view on leaving it. A varied and {{attractive}} picture this, with the turquoise-blue of the deep water, the purple and leek-green tints of the shoaly and sandy little port, and the tawny shore dotted by six distinct palm-tufts. They are outliers of the main line, yon flood of verdure, climbing up and streaming down from the high, dry, and barren banks of arenaceous drift, heaped up and filmed over by the wind, and, lastly, surging through its narrow [...] "Gate," [...] with the clifflets of conglomerate forming the old coast. Add the bluff headland of the Ras el-Tárah {{to the north of}} the harbour, and behind it the Rughámat Makná, the greenish-yellow, flat-backed [...] "horse" [...] of Madyan, which, shimmering in the sunset with a pearly lustre, forms the best of landmarks. Finish to the south of the Wady with the quaint chopping outlines of the Jebel el-Fahísát, resembling from afar a huge alligator lying on the water; with the similar but lower forms {{to the north of the}} valley, both reflected in the Jibál el-Hamrá (the Red Hills), whose curtains of green-black trap are broken by sheets of dull dead-white plaster. Cap the whole with the mighty double quoin of gypseous Jebel el-Kharaj, buttressing the eastern flank of its valley, and with the low, dark metal-revetted hills of the Kalb el-Nakhlah, a copy of the Fahísát. Throw in the background, slowly rising as you recede from the shore, a curtain of plutonic peaks and buttresses, cones, quoins, cupolas, parrot-beaks; with every trick of shape, from the lumpy Zahd to the buttressed and pinnacled 'Urnub; with every shade of mountain-tint between <b>lapis-lazuli</b> and plum-purple. Dome the whole with that marvellous transparent sky, the ocean of the air, that spreads loveliness over the rugged cheek of the Desert; and you have a picture which, though distinctly Arabian, you can hardly expect to see in Arabia.|$|E
60|$|Dec. 31st--At daybreak the Ke Islands (pronounced Kay) were in sight, {{where we}} are to stay a few days. About noon we rounded the {{northern}} point, and endeavoured to coast along to the anchorage; but being now on the leeward side of the island, the wind came in violent irregular gusts, and then leaving us altogether, we were carried back by a strong current. Just then two boats-load of natives appeared, and our owner having agreed with them to tow us into harbour, they tried to do so, assisted by our own boat, but could make no way. We were therefore obliged to anchor in a very dangerous place on a rocky bottom, and we were engaged till nearly dark getting hawsers secured to some rocks under water. The coast of Ke along which we had passed was very picturesque. Light coloured limestone rocks rose abruptly from the water to the height of several hundred feet, everywhere broken into jutting peaks and pinnacles, weather-worn into sharp points and honeycombed surfaces, and clothed throughout with a most varied and luxuriant vegetation. The cliffs above the sea offered to our view screw-pines and arborescent Liliaceae of strange forms, mingled with shrubs and creepers; while the higher slopes supported a dense growth of forest trees. Here and there little bays and inlets presented beaches of dazzling whiteness. The water was transparent as crystal, and tinged the rock-strewn slope which plunged steeply into its unfathomable depths with colours varying from emerald to <b>lapis-lazuli.</b> The sea was calm as a lake, and the glorious sun of the tropics threw a flood of golden light over all. The scene was to me inexpressibly delightful. I was in a new world, and could dream of the wonderful productions hid in those rocky forests, and in those azure abysses. But few European feet had ever trodden the shores I gazed upon its plants, and animals, and men were alike almost unknown, and I could not help speculating on what my wanderings {{there for a few}} days might bring to light.|$|E
60|$|The shrine {{where the}} golden coffin was to rest is {{substantially}} {{the same in}} our own day, with its triple-cusped arches below, the stage of six and stage of four above them, and the twisted columns in imitation of that {{which was supposed to}} have come from the Beautiful Gate of the Temple. But at that time it was a glittering fabric of mosaic work, in gold, <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> and precious stones, aided here and there by fragments of coloured glass, {{the only part of the}} costly workmanship that has come down to us. Around this shrine the preceding members of the procession had taken their places. Archbishop Boniface of Savoy was there, old age ennobling a countenance that once had been light and frivolous, and all his bishops in the splendour of their richest copes, solidly embroidered with absolute scenes and portraits in embroidery, with tall mitres worked with gold wire and jewels, and crosiers of beauteous workmanship in gold, ivory, and enamel. Mitred abbots, no less glorious in array, stood in another rank; the scarlet-mantled Grand Prior of the Hospital, and the white-cloaked Templar, made a link between the ecclesiastic and the warrior. Priests and monks, selected for their voices' sake, clustered in every available space; and, in full radiance, on a stage on the further side, were seated the ladies of the court, mostly with their hair uncovered, and surrounded by a garland of precious stones. Queen Eleanor of Provence, still bent on youthfulness, looked somewhat haggard in this garb; but it well became Beatrix von Falkmorite, the young German girl whom Richard King of the Romans had wedded in his old age for the sake of her fair face. Smiling, plump, and rosy, she sat opening her wide blue eyes, wearing her emerald and ruby wreath as though it had been a coronal of daisies, and gazing with childish whisperings as she watched the movements of her king, and clung for direction and help in her own part of the pageant to the Princess Eleanor, who sat beside her, little the elder in years, less beautiful in colouring, but how far surpassing her in queenly pensive grace and dignity! Leaning on Eleanor's lap was a bright-eyed, bright-haired boy of four years old, watching with puzzled looks the brilliant ceremony, which he only half understood, and his glances wandering between his father and the blue and white robed little acolytes who stood nearest to the shrine, holding by chains the silver censers, which from time to time sent forth a fragrant vapour, curling round the heads of the nearest figures, and floating away in the lofty vaultings of the roof.|$|E
6000|$|The {{great number}} {{and variety of}} Browning's {{characters}} can be illustrated in different ways. We might, for instance, note how many nationalities are represented. The personages in [...] "Stafford" [...] and the [...] "Cavalier Tunes" [...] are Englishmen {{from the time of}} the Civil War. [...] "Clive" [...] is a true story of the Indian Empire. We have from Italian life the numerous characters in Sordello, [...] "Fra Lippo Lippi," [...] "Pictor Ignotus," [...] "The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St. Praxed's Church," [...] "My Last Duchess," [...] The Ring and the Book, [...] "A Grammarian's Funeral," [...] "Up at a Villa--Down in the City," [...] "In a Gondola," [...] and many more. [...] "Count Gismond" [...] and [...] "Hervé Riel" [...] are French stories. Paracelsus and [...] "Abt Vogler" [...] are of German origin. Balaustion's Adventure, Aristophanes' Apology, [...] "Pheidippides," [...] and [...] "Echetlos" [...] celebrate Greek thought and adventure. Very important poems such as [...] "Saul" [...] and [...] "Rabbi Ben Ezra," [...] have to do with Jewish life. And unlike Shakespeare, who is not concerned with making Julius Cæsar a Roman or Duke Theseus a Greek, Browning brings to the creation of each of these widely divergent characters, a detailed knowledge of the special habits of life and thought of the nation or race concerned. He represents also many kinds of human interest. We find in his poems seekers after knowledge such as Paracelsus, who takes all thought and fact as his domain; or such as the Grammarian, who found Greek particles too wide a realm; or such as the pedant Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis, whose learned rubbish cumbers the land. There are likewise those who grope after the truths of religion from Caliban on his island to the learned physician Karshish and the highly cultured Cleon; those who have the full vision from John to Rabbi Ben Ezra; those who juggle with terms and creeds as does Bishop Blougram; and out and out frauds like Sludge the Medium. The church is represented by many men dissimilar in endowments, tastes, spiritual experiences, and aims. There are Italian prelates of every sort, from the worldly-minded Bishop of St. Praxed's, occupied in death with vain thoughts of <b>lapis-lazuli</b> and pure Latin, to the [...] "soldier-saint," [...] Caponsacchi, who saved Pompilia, and the wise old Pope who pronounced Guido's doom; from the unworthy priest in the Spanish Cloister to the very human, kindly Pope in [...] "The Bean Feast." [...] And from all these it is far down the ages to the evangelical parish priest of The Inn Album, that [...] "purblind honest drudge," [...] who, the deeper to impress his flock, painted heaven dimly but [...] "made hell distinct." [...] There are many artists, many musicians. There are poets from Aprile in Paracelsus, and the troubadours Eglamour and Sordello, to Keats and Shelley. The extremes of social life are given. There are the street-girls in Pippa Passes and there are kings and queens with royal retinues. There are statesmen, and warriors, and seekers after romantic adventure. There are haughty aristocrats of cold and cruel natures, and there are obscure but high-hearted doers of heroic deeds. Browning's dictum, [...] "Study man, man, whatever the issue," [...] led him into a world wider than that known by any other poet of his time, and akin, as has been pointed out, to that of the great writers of fiction. As an observer of human life he was not unlike his poor poet of Valladolid who, with his [...] "scrutinizing hat," [...] went about the streets, absorbed in watching all kinds of people, all sorts of occupations, [...] "scenting the world, looking it full in the face." [...] He chose to set forth [...] "the wants and ways" [...] of actual life. He summed up his work in the [...] "Epilogue to Pacchiarotto": ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{peculiarity}} of Egypt, {{in religion}} and myth as {{in every other}} institution, is the retention of the very rudest and most barbarous things {{side by side with}} the last refinements of civilisation (Tiele, Manuel, p. 44). The existence of this conservatism (by which we profess to explain the Egyptian myths and worship) is illustrated, in another field, by the arts of everyday life, and by the testimony of the sepulchres of Thebes. M. Passalacqua, in some excavations at Quoarnah (Gurna), struck on the common cemetery of the ancient city of Thebes. Here he found [...] "the mummy of a hunter, with a wooden bow and twelve arrows, the shaft made of reed, the points of hardened wood tipped with edged flints. Hard by lay jewels belonging to the mummy of a young woman, pins with ornamental heads, necklaces of gold and <b>lapis-lazuli,</b> gold earrings, scarabs of gold, bracelets of gold," [...] and so forth (Chabas, Etudes sur l'Antiquity Historique, p. 390). The refined art of the gold-worker was contemporary, and this at a late period, with the use of flint-headed arrows, the weapons commonly found all over the world in places where the metals had never penetrated. Again, a razor-shaped knife of flint has been unearthed; it is inscribed in hieroglyphics with the words, [...] "The great Sam, son of Ptah, chief of artists [...] ". The [...] "Sams" [...] were members of the priestly class, who fulfilled certain mystic duties at funerals. It is reported by Herodotus that the embalmers opened the bodies of the dead with a knife of stone; and the discovery of such a knife, though it had not belonged to an embalmer, proves that in Egypt the stone age did not disappear, but coexisted throughout with the arts of metal-working. It is alleged that flint chisels and stone hammers were used by the workers of the mines in Sinai, even under Dynasties XII., XIX. The soil of Egypt, when excavated, constantly shows that the Egyptians, who in the remote age of the pyramid-builders were already acquainted with bronze, and even with iron, did not therefore relinquish the use of flint knives and arrow-heads when such implements became cheaper than tools of metal, or when they were associated with religion. Precisely in the same way did the Egyptians, who, in the remotest known times, had imposing religious ideas, decline to relinquish the totems and beast-gods and absurd or blasphemous myths which (like flint axes and arrow-heads) are everywhere characteristic of savages. The fact is, that the Egyptian mind, when turned to divine matters, was constantly working on, and working over, the primeval stuff of all mythologies and of all religions. First, there is the belief in a moral guardian and father of men; this is expressed in the sacred hymns. Next, there is the belief in [...] "a strange and powerful race, supposed to have been busy on earth before the making, or the evolution, or the emergence of man"; this is expressed in the mythical legends. The Egyptians inherited a number of legends of extra-natural heroes, not unlike the savage Qat, Cagn, Yehl, Pund-jel, Ioskeha and Quahteaht, the Maori Tutenganahau and the South Sea Tangaroa. Some of these were elemental forces, personified in human or bestial guise; some were merely idealised medicine-men. Their [...] "wanderings, rapes and manslaughters and mutilations," [...] as Plutarch says, remained permanently in legend. When these beings, in the advance of thought, had obtained divine attributes, and when the conception of abstract divinity, returning, perhaps, to its first form, had become pure and lofty, the old legends became so many stumbling-blocks to the faithful. They were explained away as allegories (every student having his own allegorical system), or the extranatural beings were taken (as by Plutarch) to be [...] "demons, not gods [...] ".|$|E
