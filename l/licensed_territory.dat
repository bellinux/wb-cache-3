50|$|The FTC {{requires}} that the franchisee be furnished with a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) by the franchisor at least fourteen days before money changes hands or a franchise agreement is signed. The final agreement is always a negotiated document setting forth fees and other terms. Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties, only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon. The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is lengthy (300-700 pp +) and detailed (see Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) for elements of disclosure), and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format, except in some circumstances, such as where a franchisor is new. It must include such data as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the <b>licensed</b> <b>territory</b> (who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations), estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability.|$|E
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} between geo-blocking and the internal market. Geo-blocking refers to technical measures, which restrict access to copyright protected audiovisual content from outside of the <b>licensed</b> <b>territory.</b> Territorial nature of copyright and agreements between right holders and service providers are main reasons behind geo-blocking. Digital Single Market Strategy and related competition law investigation aim to abolish geo-blocking practices. Aim {{of this study is}} to assess whether or not such agreements infringe competition law of the EU. In order to answer the question, {{the relationship between}} free movement of services and geo-blocking is also examined. Relevant case law, including Coditel cases and Murphy, is profoundly scrutinized. A legal test based on substantial and geographical dimensions of copyright is used to assess compatibility. Relevancy of underlying regulatory context is one of the main findings of the study. The study concludes that geo-blocking agreements do not infringe competition law as long as copyright is regulated by the “country of destination” approach. However, if copyright is regulated by the “country of origin” principle, there is a breach of competition law in principle. In that case, only economic context can justify geo-blocking. The study maintains that there is a chance that economic characteristics of audiovisual products can justify such restrictions...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{licensing}} {{policies for}} {{the owner of}} a new product and addresses their welfare impact in the assessment of market failures. We show that the best licensing policy for the patent holder is fixed fee licensing with an exclusive territory clause. Consumers are also better off with fixed fees but do not prefer the exclusive territory clause. Social welfare is higher under exclusive territories when fixed costs are not too large. As for efficiency, the number of licences in the private market equilibrium falls short of the socially optimal solution. Our analysis discloses that (i) any policy measures aimed at enhancing the diffusion of technology, {{in terms of the number}} of licences, would be welcomed and, (ii) the permissive treatment received by licensing agreements with exclusive <b>territories</b> is justified. <b>Licensing,</b> Exclusive <b>territories,</b> Market failure,...|$|R

30|$|Between 2007 and 2013, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) {{introduced}} {{major national}} policy reforms to improve quality {{in early childhood}} education and care (ECEC) (Brennan and Adamson 2014). The COAG reforms for early childhood, hereafter {{referred to as the}} reforms, promised substantial financial commitment and legislative initiatives to improve early childhood outcomes for all Australian children. Initiatives included a National Partnership agreement across Australia’s six States and two Territories for a National Quality Agenda to unify previously disparate State and <b>Territory</b> <b>licensing</b> and regulatory systems. The reforms included the following: stronger standards, streamlined approaches to regulatory requirements, a new rating system to measure quality, the first national ECEC curriculum document—the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), and strategies to develop the early childhood workforce (Council of Australian Governments 2009). In this context, the reforms aimed to improve quality by investing $ 77 million over four years (Rudd and Macklin 2007 b). This funding and changes to standards and structures for the early childhood sector constituted “bold and ambitious” policy developments (Tayler 2011, 223). Yet the approach to government funding remained largely the same that tied government subsidy to systems that measure and monitor quality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a {{relatively}} common autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are produced to circulating platelets. Symptoms can be mild, but for most patients the risk of severe bleeding is unacceptable and treatment is required. Glucocorticoids followed by splenectomy had been the mainstays of therapy. High dose intravenous immunoglobulin and anti-RhD therapy are available for patients with severe illness, but produce only temporary benefit. Rituximab may provide more durable responses, danazol may be underutilized, and immunosuppressants and cytotoxic agents are less often required. Recently the pathophysiology of ITP has been more clearly elucidated, particularly the importance of decreased production of platelets in most patients and the very blunted rise that occurs in serum thrombopoietin (TPO). The isolation of TPO and better understanding of its role in thrombopoiesis {{has led to the}} development of new highly effective treatments. TPO analogs had some successes in treating highly refractory ITP patients but were taken out of development due to TPO-antibody induction. Two second-generation TPO-mimetics, romiplostim and the orally available eltrombopag, have recently been <b>licensed</b> in some <b>territories</b> for the treatment of ITP. Approval of eltrombopag was based on results from Phase II and III placebo-controlled clinica...|$|R
