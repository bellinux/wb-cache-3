We evaluate these enriched representations within two <b>lexical</b> sample sense <b>disambiguation</b> benchmarks. Our results indicate that (1) features extracted from the corpus-based resource help to significantly outperform a model {{based solely on the}} lexical resource; (2) our method achieves results comparable or better to four state-of-the-art unsupervised knowledge-based WSD systems including three hybrid systems that also rely on text corpora.

40|$|This paper assesses several broad {{approaches}} to language analysis {{with respect to}} the problem of lexical ambiguity. The impact of the problem on both syntactic and semantic analysis is discussed, and several common methods for disambiguation, including the use of selectional restrictions and scriptal lexicons, are analyzed. Their shortcomings illustrate the need for complex inference to resolve ambiguity, which forms one of the key functional arguments in favor of integrating language analysis with memory and inference. However, it has proven surprisingly difficult to realize such an integrated approach in practice: An assessment of <b>lexical</b> <b>disambiguation</b> within some recent models which attempt to do so reveals that they rely largely on the traditional techniques of selectional restrictions and scriptal lexicons, with all their drawbacks. The difficulty is shown to stem primarily from the theories of memory and inferential processing utilized.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to semantic interpretation in natural language understanding is described, together with mechanisms for both <b>lexical</b> and structural <b>disambiguation</b> that work {{in concert with the}} semantic interpreter. ABSITY, the system described, is a Montague-inspired semantic interpreter. Like Montague formalisms, its semantics is compositional by design and is strongly typed, with semantic rules in one-to-one correspondence with the meaning-affecting rules of a Marcus parser. The Montague semantic objects [...] functors and truth conditions [...] are replaced with elements of the frame language FRAIL. ABSITY's partial results are always well-formed FRAIL objects. A semantic interpreter must be able to provide feedback to the parser to help it handle structural ambiguities. In ABS 1 TY, this is done by the "'Semantic Enquiry Desk," a process that answers the parser's questions on semantic preferences. Disambiguation of word senses and of case slots is done by a set of procedures, one per word or slot, each of which determines the word or slot's correct sense, in cooperation with the other procedures. It is from the fact that partial results are always well-formed semantic objects that the system gains much of its power. This, in turn, comes from the strict correspondence between syntax and semantics in ABSITY. The result is a. foundation for semantic interpretation superior to previous approaches...|$|R

The approach encodes Arabic structures into a set of semantic relations between a set of nodes representing the elements (words) of the sentence as concepts. Once the concepts are built, the relations between them are determined and can be decoded again to any other language. The grammar for the encoding process is implemented in Universal Networking Language (UNL); it enables computers to understand natural languages which will make it possible for humans to communicate with machines in natural language.
