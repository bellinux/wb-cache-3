40|$|Objective: The neural {{basis for}} autistic {{spectrum}} disorders is unclear, but abnormalities {{in the development}} of <b>limbic</b> <b>areas</b> and of glutamate have been suggested. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) can be used to measure the concentration of brain metabolites. However, the concentration of glutamate/glutamine in brain regions implicated in autistic spectrum disorders has not yet been examined in vivo. Method: The authors used 1 H-MRS to investigate the neuronal integrity of the amygdala-hippocampal complex and a parietal control region in adults with autistic spectrum disorders and healthy subjects. Results: People with autistic spectrum disorders had a significantly higher concentration of glutamate/glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine in the amygdala-hippocampal region but not in the parietal region. Conclusions: Abnormalities in glutamate/glutamine may partially underpin the pathophysiology of autistic spectrum disorders, and the authors confirm earlier reports that <b>limbic</b> <b>areas</b> are metabolically aberrant in these disorders. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{limbic system}} (the {{collective}} {{term for the}} brain structures that are the centers of emotion and moti-vation) functions in interesting ways in responding to music. Research into {{the question of the}} physiological effect of music on the <b>limbic</b> <b>area</b> of the brain may give insight into human emotional response to music. Insights gained from this study might provide a more thorough understanding of affective responses of human subjects to music. Howard Gardner addressed the importance of the study of emotional response to the arts in this way: Given the difficulty of determining feeling life, why introduce it into a discussion of artistic development? The answer [...] . is that feeling life has been regarded universally as a crucial component of the artistic process; any discussion of the arts that takes no account of the feelings of individuals runs the risk of completely misrepresenting the phenomena under investigation. If artists speak of communicating their feelings to others, or of portraying feelings and their forms in artistic works-If perceivers and critics have their feelings deeply affected and altered through encounters with artistic works-these are situations that merit study and explanation (1973, p. 70). Research on the <b>limbic</b> <b>area</b> of the brain is rela-tively recent (Hart, 1975, p. 66). The factors that determine emotional response to music are complex. Therefore, answers to most questions are highly spec-ulative and are often posed as hypotheses in need of further study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This electroencephalographic (EEG) study tested whether {{cortical}} EEG rhythms (especially delta and alpha) show {{a progressive}} increasing or decreasing trend across physiological aging. To this aim, we analyzed {{the type of}} correlation (linear and nonlinear) between cortical EEG rhythms and age. Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 108 young (Nyoung; age range: 18 – 50 years, mean age 27. 3 7. 3 SD) and 107 elderly (Nold; age range: 51 – 85 years, mean age 67. 3 9. 2 SD) subjects. The EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2 – 4 Hz), theta (4 – 8 Hz), alpha 1 (8 – 10. 5 Hz), alpha 2 (10. 5 – 13 Hz), beta 1 (13 – 20 Hz), and beta 2 (20 – 30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Statistical results showed that delta sources in the occipital area had significantly less magnitude in Nold compared to Nyoung subjects. Similarly, alpha 1 and alpha 2 sources in the parietal, occipital, temporal, and <b>limbic</b> <b>areas</b> had significantly less magnitude in Nold compared to Nyoung subjects. These nine EEG sources were given as input for evaluating the type (linear, exponential, logarithmic, and power) of correlation with age. When subjects were considered as a single group {{there was a significant}} linear correlation of age with the magnitude of delta sources in the occipital area and of alpha 1 sources in occipital and <b>limbic</b> <b>areas.</b> The same was true for alpha 2 sources in the parietal, occipital, temporal, and <b>limbic</b> <b>areas.</b> In general, the EEG sources showing significant linear correlation with age also supported a nonlinear correlation with age. These results suggest that the occipital delta and posterior cortical alpha rhythms decrease in magnitude during physiological aging with both linear and nonlinear trends. In conclusion, this new methodological approach holds promise for the prediction of dementia in mild cognitive impairment by regional source rather than surface EEG data and by both linear and nonlinear predictor...|$|R
40|$|Dominant and {{subordinate}} dispositions are {{not only}} determined genetically but also nurtured by environmental stimuli during neuroendocrine development. However, the relationship between early life environment and dominance behavior remains elusive. Using the IntelliCage-based competition task for group-housed mice, we have previously described two cases in which environmental insults during the developmental period altered the outcome of dominance behavior later in life. First, mice that were repeatedly isolated from their mother and their littermates (early deprivation; ED), and second, mice perinatally exposed to an environmental pollutant, dioxin, both exhibited subordinate phenotypes, defined by decreased occupancy of limited resource sites under highly competitive circumstances.

40|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is a key}} <b>limbic</b> <b>area</b> {{involved in}} fear responses and pavlovian conditioning {{with the potential to}} directly respond to endocrine signals associated with fear or stress. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms and subregional specificity of fear conditioning, we disrupted type II glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) by delivering lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase into floxed-GR mice. GR deletion in the CeA (CeAGRKO mice) prevented conditioned fear behavior. In contrast, forebrain disruption of GRs excluding the CeA did not. The conditioned fear deficit in CeAGRKO mice was associated with decreases in cFos and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression. Moreover, intracerebroventricular delivery of CRH rescued the conditioned fear deficit in CeAGRKO mice. We conclude that fear conditioning involves a neuroendocrine circuit by using GR activation in the CeA for acute CRH induction and long-lasting behavioral modulation...|$|E

Separate neural systems have been implicated in the recognition of facial identity (mainly extrastriate visual cortex) and emotional expression (<b>limbic</b> <b>areas</b> and the superior temporal sulcus). Working-memory (WM) studies with faces have shown different but partly overlapping activation patterns in comparison to spatial WM in parietal and prefrontal areas.

We found a fronto-parietal-visual WM-network for both tasks during maintenance, including fusiform gyrus. <b>Limbic</b> <b>areas</b> in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus demonstrated a stronger activation for the identity than the emotion condition. One explanation for this finding is that the repetitive presentation of faces with different identities but the same emotional expression during the identity-task is responsible for the stronger increase in BOLD signal in the amygdala. These results raise the question how different emotional expressions are coded in WM. Our findings suggest that emotional expressions are re-coded in an abstract representation that is supported at the neural level by the canonical fronto-parietal WM network...|$|R
