Interestingly, for global maxima, the situation is different: even if we only know the number of locations where the global maximum is attained, then, in general, it is not algorithmically possible to find all these locations.

25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by radio occultation. This result was later confirmed by {{an analysis of the}} Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide clouds were determined to be at 3bar based on the spectroscopic data in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1μm). However a recent analysis of the spectroscopic data in the wavelength range 1–2.3μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper cloud layers varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane cloud layer's optical depth had a <b>local</b> <b>maximum</b> at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} {{locating}} <b>local</b> <b>maxima</b> and minima of a function from approximate measurement results {{is vital for}} many physical applications: in spectral analysis, chemical species are identified by locating <b>local</b> <b>maxima</b> of the spectra; in radioastronomy, sources of celestial radio emission and and their subcomponents are identified by locating <b>local</b> <b>maxima</b> of the measured brightness of the radio sky; elementary particles are identified by locating <b>local</b> <b>maxima</b> of the experimental curves. In [17], a sequential algorithm was proposed that solves this problem in linear time (i. e., in time ≤ Cn, where n {{is the number of}} measurements and C is a constant that is independent on n). In this paper, we propose parallel algorithms that find <b>local</b> <b>maxima</b> and minima in polylog time (≤ C log 2 (n) on n processors, and ≤ C log(n) on n 2 processors). I...|$|R
