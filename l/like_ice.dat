5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, <b>like</b> <b>ice</b> carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
25|$|Ringette {{has thus}} far been {{excluded}} from the Olympics {{partly due to the}} fact that it must have 25% of each gender to qualify.

Currently there are not enough males with the skill to qualify for an Olympic team.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{mechanisms}} {{contribute to}} observed sea level rise: (1) thermal expansion: {{because of the}} increase in ocean heat content (ocean water expands as it warms); and (2) the melting of major stores of land ice <b>like</b> <b>ice</b> sheets and glaciers. Based on figures from between 1993–2008 two thirds (68%) of recent sea level rise has been attributed by melting ice, and roughly one third has come from thermal expansion.|$|E

25|$|Humans use {{water for}} many {{recreational}} purposes, {{as well as}} for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, waterskiing, boating, surfing and diving. In addition, some sports, <b>like</b> <b>ice</b> hockey and ice skating, are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in aquariums or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. skiing, sledding, snowmobiling or snowboarding, which require the water to be frozen.|$|E

To create the appearance of stained glass in the windows, an old French technique was used. The pattern was drawn and painted on translucent paper, then sandwiched between glass. Larocque created the alcove behind the altar and its crucifix himself. Adam commissioned Mona Sharer, a 17-year-old deaf-mute Inuit woman who had shown talent as an artist at a Catholic school in Aklavik, to paint the Stations of the Cross on the inside walls. She started in January 1960 and completed the work in two months, along with some other paintings of scenes from the life of Christ. Later that year the church was formally consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by Paul Piché, bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Mackenzie (later elevated to the Diocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith).|$|E

Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel's cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean. The group began performing in local showcases and high school talent shows. Hill was initially only a singer, but then learned to rap too; instead of modeling herself on female rappers like Salt-n-Pepa and MC Lyte, she preferred male rappers <b>like</b> <b>Ice</b> Cube and developed her flow from listening to them. Hill later said, [...] "I remember doing my homework in the bathroom stalls of hip-hop clubs." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Recuperative Winter" [...] {{reviews the}} {{cultural}} and social history of winter festivals and holidays. Gopnik posits that the modern Christmas is a compound holiday merging elements from numerous societies, traditions, and beliefs; that its moral foundations were established in the 1820/30s; its celebratory and commercialism elements were established in the 1870s. He also argues that stress and anxiety {{have been part of}} the holiday since the 1920s. [...] "Recreational Winter" [...] is about winter sports, <b>like</b> <b>ice</b> hockey. The evolution of ice skating is identified from the Dutch bringing the concept to England in the 1600s and the origin of hockey is traced back to a particular neighbourhood in Montreal in the 1800s. He portrays winter sports as being more about preparation and the pleasure of solitude, in contrast with summer sports, which are more about impulse. The final chapter, [...] "Remembering Winter", discusses three ways that the human experience of winter is changing: through technological and architectural innovations, via global warming, and by memory.|$|E

2500|$|Computer {{graphics}} used {{in films}} {{and video games}} gradually began to be realistic {{to the point of}} entering the uncanny valley. CGI movies proliferated, with traditional animated cartoon films <b>like</b> <b>Ice</b> Age and Madagascar as well as numerous Pixar offerings like Finding Nemo dominating the box office in this field. The , released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture. The film was not a box-office success, however. Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the [...] "uncanny valley". Other animated films like The Polar Express drew attention at this time as well. Star Wars also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy and the effects continued to set a bar for CGI in film.|$|E

2500|$|The Llanquihue {{glaciation}} {{takes its}} name from Llanquihue Lake in southern Chile which is a fan-shaped piedmont glacial lake. On the lake's western shores there are large moraine systems of which the innermost belong to the last glacial period. Llanquihue Lake's varves are a node point in southern Chile's varve geochronology. During the last glacial maximum the Patagonian Ice Sheet extended over the Andes from about 35°S to Tierra del Fuego at 55°S. The western part appears to have been very active, with wet basal conditions, while the eastern part was cold based. Cryogenic features <b>like</b> <b>ice</b> wedges, patterned ground, pingos, rock glaciers, palsas, soil cryoturbation, [...] solifluction deposits developed in unglaciated extra-Andean Patagonia during the Last Glaciation. However, not all these reported features have been verified. The area west of Llanquihue Lake was ice-free during the LGM, and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by Nothofagus. Valdivian temperate rainforest was reduced to scattered remnants in the western side of the Andes.|$|E
2500|$|Serving as the album's most radio-friendly track, [...] "Ice Cream" [...] was {{released}} September 25, 1995, with [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces" [...] as its B-side. This {{proved to be}} the most successful single off the album, as it reached the 37th spot on the Billboard Hot 100, and the fifth spot on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The song uses different flavor variants of ice cream as a metaphor for different races of women. Raekwon later commented [...] "we wanted to reach out and let the women know that we respected them as queens. And queens, much <b>like</b> <b>ice</b> cream, come in all different flavors." [...] The song marks the second appearance of Cappadonna on the album, and serves as his break-through performance, as it would give him commercial exposure. In regard to his guest spot, Cappadonna later recalled [...] "I had heard Rae's and Ghost's verses on there.

It has also been suggested that the [...] "1" [...] at the front of the combination followed by two letters might be confused with [...] "I", for example, making 1CE look <b>like</b> <b>ICE.</b> Another issue with the new series is that the letter [...] "O" [...] and the number [...] "0" [...] are the same shape in the font used on Victorian plates, so the combination ending in [...] "4OW" [...] for example, is more likely to be read as [...] "40W". This mistake was less likely to be made on the older series as the letters and numbers were isolated by a separator.|$|E
