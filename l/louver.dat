6000|$|It was to {{this old}} king, or rather {{to his son}} Sigtryg, godson of Sigtryg Silkbeard, and distant cousin of his own, that Hereward now took his way, and told his story, as the king sat in his hall, {{drinking}} [...] "across the fire," [...] after the old Norse fashion. The fire of pine logs {{was in the midst}} of the hall, and the smoke went out through a <b>louver</b> in the roof. On one side was a long bench, and in the middle of it the king's high arm-chair; right and left of him sat his kinsmen and the ladies, and his sea-captains and men of wealth. Opposite, on the other side of the fire, was another bench. In the middle of that sat his marshal, and right and left all his housecarles. There were other benches behind, on which sat more freemen, but of lesser rank.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{daylighting}} and thermal performance of open-plan office buildings with two scenarios of daylight <b>louvers</b> – fixed and motorized ones. Both types are for facade window applications. They redirect transmitted daylight to eliminate glare on occupants and increase daylight levels {{deeper in the}} interior space, but have significantly different daylight transmitting characteristics. In addition to daylighting, these <b>louvers</b> also affect solar heat gain. The tilt angle of slats in motorized <b>louvers</b> can be adjusted to control solar heat gain and daylight. In this study, an existing energy-efficient office building with fixed <b>louvers</b> is used. A combined thermal and daylighting model for a typical section of the building is developed using a simplified approach, and validated with measured data. The option of motorized <b>louvers</b> is then added to this model. The daylighting and thermal performance for different designs and seasons are assessed using the model. Results show that motorized <b>louvers</b> can effectively enhance useful solar heat gain and/or daylighting. The effect of building depth is also investigated...|$|R

50|$|Louvers {{are active}} thermal control {{elements}} {{that are used in}} many different forms. Most commonly they are placed over external radiators, louvers {{can also be used to}} control heat transfer between internal spacecraft surfaces, or be placed on openings on the spacecraft walls. A <b>louver</b> in its fully open state can reject six times as much heat as it does in its fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. The most commonly used <b>louver</b> is the bimetallic, spring-actuated, rectangular blade <b>louver</b> also known as venetian-blind <b>louver.</b> <b>Louver</b> radiator assemblies consist of five main elements: baseplate, blades, actuators, sensing elements, and structural elements.|$|E

50|$|Often used interchangeably by mistake, the key {{difference}} between <b>louvers</b> and jalousies is that <b>louvers</b> are fixed position.

40|$|The {{new series}} of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES I,J,K,L/M) will have two earth viewing optical {{instruments}} which use passive, bi-metallic actuated, blade-type <b>louvers</b> for their thermal control. GOES is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft in geostationary orbit, which means that sun can enter the instrument apertures for several hours before and after local midnight. The solar heat absorbed in the instruments causes the <b>louvers</b> to open thus allowing the radiators to reject the heat. These louvered radiators are located on the north face of the instruments. To perform thermal analyses of the instruments, a modeling method was needed for predicting the thermal characteristics of the <b>louvers.</b> This task was {{complicated by the fact}} that sun shines on the <b>louvers</b> during the summer season. A Monte Carlo analytical technique was used to develop absorbed power and effective emissivity tables for the <b>louvers.</b> These tables could be used with the instrument math models to predict the thermal behavior of the instruments. Data from the Monte Carlo analysis showed that solar entrapment could have a significant effect on the heat rejection capability of the louvered radiators...|$|R

The lower ring of <b>louvers</b> (3) are crucial to get high mass flows, because air from them (33) spins more slowly, and thus has lower centripetal forces and a higher pressure at the vortex.|$|R
