If aft cyclic is applied while the disc is unloaded, the main rotor could strike the tail causing catastrophic failure.|$|R

When ready, the slot is unlocked, and the caddy can be inserted and withdrawn by a person, now with the disc back inside.|$|R
40|$|We state {{a general}} {{criterion}} for existence of analytic discs attached to conormal bundles of CR manifolds. In particular let S be a CR (non [...] generic) submanifold of X=^n and E^* a CR subbundle {{of the complex}} conormal bundle T^*_SX∩ T^*_SX such that E^*+√(- 1) E^*=T^*_SX∩√(- 1) T^*_SX (where sum and multiplication by √(- 1) are understood {{in the sense of}} the fibers). We then show that for any small disc A attached to S through z_o, and for any point p_o∈ (E^*) _z_o, there is an analytic lift A^* attached to E^* through p_o. In particular we regain the theorem by Trepreau and Tumanov T 3 on existence of <b>lifts</b> for <b>discs</b> attached to non [...] minimal manifolds. Our criterion also applies to discs attached to manifolds with a constant number of negative Levi [...] eigenvalues. We finally state the uniqueness of small discs attached to (non [...] necessarily CR) manifolds M through a given point z_o and with prescribed components in T^_z_oM. This is a slight, but perhaps interesting, generalization of the classical result (often used all through this paper), on uniqueness of <b>lifts</b> of small <b>discs</b> attached to generic manifolds...|$|R
5000|$|Also {{note that}} the above {{equation}} neglects the influence of atmospheric refraction (which <b>lifts</b> the solar <b>disc</b> by approximately 0.6° when {{it is on the}} horizon) and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc (about 0.5°). The times of the rising and the setting of the upper solar limb as given in astronomical almanacs correct for this by using the more general equation ...|$|R
50|$|The B model (introduced in 1983) {{differs from}} the A and C model in that it uses a {{reinforced}} wing spar, which provides an increased water ballast capacity {{at the expense of}} the flexible wing. The B and C model include several enhancements over the original A model, including a <b>lifting</b> panel, hydraulic <b>disc</b> brake, and automatic elevator hookup. The B and C wings also incorporate a pneumatic turbulator system, which draws high pressure air from pitot inlets on the wing and injects it through approximately 860 pinholes into the boundary layer to control underwing airflow separation.|$|R
50|$|Fogelman {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Los Angeles. In high school, he worked for his uncle, Louis Fogelman, a co-founder of the retail music chain Wherehouse Entertainment and the founder of Music Plus. Fogelman {{attended}} Tulane University and the University of Southern California and graduated with a BS in Accounting. He subsequently earned a CPA in California. He graduated from the UCLA Anderson School of Management with an MBA in 1992. While at UCLA, he and his colleagues created the <b>Disc</b> <b>Lift,</b> a CD-ROM device. After the patent was awarded, Fogelman built IAF Enterprises, a company which provided the infrastructure to market and support the device.|$|R
25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating <b>disc</b> <b>lifts</b> and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|R
40|$|A bounded linear {{operator}} T on a complex Hilbert space is called homogeneous if {{the spectrum of}} T is contained in the closed unit disc and all bi-holomorphic automorphisms of this <b>disc</b> <b>lift</b> to automorphisms of the operator modulo unitary equivalence. We prove that all the irreducible homogeneous operators are block shifts. Therefore, {{as a first step}} in classifying all of them, it is natural to begin with the homogeneous scalar shifts. In this paper we determine all the homogeneous (scalar) weighted shifts. They consist of the un-weighted bilateral shift, two one-parameter families of unilat-eral shifts (adjoints of each other), an one-parameter family of bilateral shifts and a two-parameter family of bilateral shifts. This classification is obtained by a careful analysis of the possibilities for the projective representation of the Möbius group associated with an irreducible homogeneous shift. ...|$|R
50|$|The Wonder Pot is {{effective}} at baking {{on top of}} the stove for three reasons: its aluminium material, its hole, and the metal disc separating it from the flame. The aluminium material allows heat to spread uniformly. The center hole of the pot focuses the flame and creates heat dispersion around the inside of the cake. The metal <b>disc</b> <b>lifts</b> the pot off the fire, reducing and focusing the flame. Baking in the Wonder Pot without the metal disc will produce a cake that is dry on the bottom and thick and wobbly in the center. The metal disc is sold in different thicknesses and diameters to accommodate different baking times and larger flames. The lid of the Wonder Pot is perforated with small holes to release steam. Baking time in a Wonder Pot varies from 40 to 50 minutes.|$|R
40|$|When T is a {{completely}} non-unitary (cnu) contraction with Sz. -Nagy–Foias characteristic function θ and µ is a scalar (0 < µ < 1) then general theory implies {{the existence of a}} cnu contraction T [µ] with characteristic function µθ. How to describe T [µ] in terms of T? In this paper, we find a simple answer in case T is in the class C· 0. An operator is called homogeneous if its spectrum is contained in the closed unit disc and all the bi-holomorphic automorphisms of the unit <b>disc</b> <b>lift</b> to automorphisms of the operator T modulo unitary equivalence. When T is homogeneous, so is T [µ]. We find explicit formulae for the characteristic functions of the (homogeneous) twisted Bergman shifts – these have product formulae involving the discrete series projective representations of the Möbius group. These formulae lead to an explicit description of the Sz. -Nagy–Foias models of these weighted shifts. Combining our main results with an analytic continuation argument, we find a three-parameter family of homogeneous operators. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of forming a C-shape flattening its abdomen {{and making a}} motion of lateral undulation in the air {{makes it possible for}} the snake to glide in the air, where it also manages to save energy compared to travel on the ground and dodge earth-bound predators. The concave wing that the snake creates in flattening itself, flattens its body to up to twice its width {{from the back of the}} head to the anal vent, which is close to the end of the snake's tail, causes the cross section of the snake's body to resemble the cross section of a frisbee or flying disc. When a flying disc spins in the air, the designed cross sectional concavity causes increased air pressure under the centre of the <b>disc,</b> causing <b>lift</b> for the <b>disc</b> to fly. The snake continuously moves in lateral undulation to create the same effect of increased air pressure underneath its arched body to glide. Flying snakes are able to glide better than flying squirrels and other gliding animals, despite the lack of limbs, wings, or any other wing-like projections, gliding through the forest and jungle it inhabits with the distance being as great as 100 m. Their destination is mostly predicted by ballistics; however, they can exercise some in-flight attitude control by [...] "slithering" [...] in the air.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{tomography}} (CT) -based {{finite element}} (FE) models assess vertebral strength better than dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporotic vertebrae are usually loaded via degenerated intervertebral discs (IVD) and potentially {{at higher risk}} under forward bending, but the influences of the IVD and loading conditions are generally overlooked. Accordingly, magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 14 lumbar discs to generate FE models for the healthiest and most degenerated specimens. Compression, torsion, bending, flexion and extension conducted experimentally were used to calibrate both models. They were combined with CT-based FE models of 12 lumbar vertebral bodies to evaluate the effect of disc degeneration compared to a loading via endplates embedded in a stiff resin, the usual experimental paradigm. Compression and lifting were simulated, load and damage pattern were evaluated at failure. Adding flexion to the compression (<b>lifting)</b> and higher <b>disc</b> degeneration reduces the failure load (8 – 14 %, 5 – 7 %) and increases damage in the vertebrae. Under both loading scenarios, decreasing the disc height slightly increases the failure load; embedding and degenerated IVD provides respectively the highest and lowest failure load. Embedded vertebrae are more brittle, but failure loads induced via IVDs correlate highly with vertebral strength. In conclusion, osteoporotic vertebrae with degenerated IVDs are consistently weaker—especially under lifting, but clinical assessment of their strength is possible via FE analysis without extensive disc modelling, by extrapolating measures from the embedded situation...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the effect related to the expansion of different gases throughout safety relief valves is carried out both numerically and experimentally. The considered gases are air, argon and ethylene, representative {{of a wide range of}} specific heat ratios. A first experimental campaign performed in air and argon on a safety relief valve characterized by connection 1 / 200 100 and orifice designation D (diameter 10 mm) according to API 526 showed significant reduction both in <b>disc</b> <b>lift</b> and in exhausted mass flow rate, at the nominal overpressure, when operating with argon. In order to gain a deeper insight into the physics involved and to evaluate the valve behavior with other gases, an extensive numerical testing has been performed by means of an accurate CFD code based on discontinuous Galerkin formulation. Numerical results are at first validated against measurements obtained in air on a 200 J 300 safety relief valve proving a remarkable accuracy of the computational method. Then the validated solver is applied on the same computational grid using argon and ethylene as working fluids. The three gases are considered as thermally perfect gases. A critical discussion based on the numerical results allows to clarify the fluid dynamic and physical reasons causing the observed trends both in the opening force and in the discharge coefficient. The main conclusion is that particular care must be taken when a safety valve operates with a fluid characterized by a specific heat ratio greater than the one of the gas used during type testin...|$|R
