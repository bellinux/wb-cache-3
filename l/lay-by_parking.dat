2500|$|The Sow of Atholl is climbed {{directly}} from the A9 road and with a starting altitude of around 400 metres {{it is not a}} hard climb. The most popular point to commence a direct ascent is Dalnaspidal Lodge (...) where there is <b>lay-by</b> <b>parking.</b> The flat area around the lodge is quite boggy and is prone to flooding after wet weather due to presence of a sluice dam. The route goes straight up the SE flanks of the hill which are its least steep. The start at Dalnaspidal gives the opportunity to climb The Sow along with the Corbett Meall na Leitreach which lies five km to the south across Loch Garry. Another possible starting point is 2.5km further north on the A9 at the summit of the Pass of Drumochter although the climb from here is steeper. The Sow can be climbed as part of a round of Coire Dhomhain, taking in the other Munros of [...] Sgairneach Mhòr, Beinn Udlamain and A' Mharconaich. The top of the hill is marked by a small cairn made up of a few rocks. The highlight of the view is a fine prospect both north and south down the Pass of Drumochter.|$|E

50|$|After Blakeney, {{the road}} descends into the Glaven Valley, and into view comes the {{landmark}} of Cley next the Sea Windmill. Again the road becomes a bottle neck {{in the summer}} months as it pass through the village of Cley next the Sea. The next stretch of the road between Cley and Sheringham is a very scenic part of the A149. After negotiating the narrow streets of Cley the road runs along the coast south of Cley and Salthouse salt marshes, the sea is hidden by a long bank of shingle that runs along the shoreline here. The marshes are a Nature Reserve and all along this stretch of the road there are <b>lay-bys</b> and car <b>parks</b> which are used as viewing points.|$|R
