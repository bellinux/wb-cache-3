25|$|The G35 sedan {{underwent}} a major revision for the 2007 model year. This 2nd generation front-mid (FM) platform underpinning the new G is shared {{in part with}} the Infiniti M and has several structural reinforcements around the engine and rear floor area, along with three times more laser welding and 16 percent more spot welds than the old version; overall body stiffness was improved by 40 percent. Single-pivot lower control arms in front replace the 1st gen model's twin <b>lower</b> <b>links.</b> The G35x sedan uses an ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system.|$|E
25|$|The Ibec design, while bespoke, was not adventurous. The main chassis {{was formed}} by a riveted and bonded {{aluminium}} monocoque, behind which the DFV engine and Hewland FG400 gearbox were bolted as stressed chassis members. Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, with twin trailing arms, parallel <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> and single top links at the rear. The car was clothed in fibreglass bodywork which had been properly wind tunnel tested, and which proved highly effective at generating both downforce in corners and stability at high speed. The total cost of designing and building the 308LM was less than £100,000, approximately £0.5 million at 2005 prices, more than most privateer teams, but far lower than many contemporary factory race programs.|$|E

5000|$|Yet another {{variation}} of short link design is the [...] "Switch link", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle {{is connected to}} the frame using an eccentric lower pivot, effectively creating a very short <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> whose length is that {{from the center of the}} eccentric to the attached pivot. The <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or [...] "Switching" [...] the <b>lower</b> <b>link's</b> direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> has been replaced with a liner bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This liner bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel.|$|R

5000|$|Roos {{developed}} an {{independent front suspension}} system using a transverse leaf spring and upper and <b>lower</b> <b>links.</b> He called this [...] "planar" [...] suspension. The system was introduced on Studebaker cars in 1935.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} uses two <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> and a V-link on top plus an anti-roll bar.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> {{itself is}} not {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the Chapman strut is a long upright strut combining a coil spring and shock absorber, with a universal-jointed drive shaft itself forming the <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> of the suspension.|$|R

The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed 580 kg, it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5 hp/kg.|$|E
50|$|The alloy/steel tub of the T332 {{followed}} standard Lola design {{practice with}} twin bulkheads and utilised a semi-stressed engine and transmission. Twin side radiators were mounted {{in front of}} the rear wheels which were located by upper and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> and radius rods. Driven through a Hewland DG300 five-speed transmission, a Chevrolet powered T332 was once timed at 305 km/h at the now closed Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California.|$|E
5000|$|Springing and damping are {{provided}} by four coilover spring and damper units which attach to the crossbeam {{at the top and}} the <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> at the bottom. The use of two spring and damper units on each side is unusual and allows the use of smaller springs, taking up less space and protruding less into the luggage area.

50|$|Each <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> is {{fabricated}} from a {{steel tube}} with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer {{end of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through {{the bottom of each}} hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent {{to the bottom of the}} differential casing. Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.|$|R

She and Hedeker divorced in 1993, and while they remained together professionally a bit longer, the end was clearly in sight. Algebra Suicide broke up for good in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Equilink" [...] {{suspension}} system {{was developed by}} Felt Bicycles for their full suspension line. The system employs a [...] "Stephenson-style" [...] six-bar linkage {{suspension system}}. Equilink gets {{its name from the}} dog bone shaped bar that ties the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> together. Early models included a pivot between chain- and seatstay whereas in later, carbon fiber, models the chain- and seatstays are one piece, creating pivoting action by flexing. Felt contends that the system holds its pedaling efficiency in any gear combination.|$|E

50|$|As Williams' current chassis, the Iso-Marlboro FX3B, did {{not conform}} to 1973's new {{deformable}} structure regulations, a new car had to be designed. The result was the IR (the initials standing for Iso Rivolta), designed by John Clarke. Another conventional design, it featured {{double wishbone front suspension}} with upper and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> at the rear, and outboard springs all round. The car's lines were angular except for the rounded cockpit. Italian engineer Gian Paolo Dallara was brought into the team to redesign the rear suspension during the 1973 season. Ron Tauranac also made some development changes later in the season.|$|E
50|$|In the {{attached}} {{photo of a}} 5-link live axle suspension, {{the different types of}} links can be seen. These links work in tandem with the coil springs, dampers, and sway bar to control all six degrees of freedom of the axle. The upper links (orange) and the <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> (yellow) work in tandem to control the pitch, yaw and the fore and aft movement (surge). The panhard rod (green) controls the left and right movement (sway). While the springs and dampers (not shown) control the up and down movement (heave) and the roll is controlled by the sway bar (also not shown).|$|E
50|$|The station {{building}} {{was built in}} 1889 and 1890 to a design by E. Müller {{in the style of}} the Gründerzeit. The main hall has two <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> connecting to corner pavilions. The entrance hall was lowered in 1927. A few shops are located in the lobby next to the service facilities of Deutsche Bahn. A pedestrian tunnel leads from the hall to two island platforms with four platform tracks. On the opposite side of the station the tunnel is connected to two staircases and an elevator. These lead to Straße Zum Bahnhof (street), which connects to the Platz der Freiheit.|$|E
50|$|A {{short long}} arms {{suspension}} (SLA) {{is also known}} as an unequal length double wishbone suspension. The upper arm is typically an A-arm, and is shorter than the <b>lower</b> <b>link,</b> which is an A-arm or an L-arm, or sometimes a pair of tension/compression arms. In the latter case the suspension can be called a multi-link, or dual ball joint suspension.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} was by upper A-arms and <b>lower</b> lateral <b>links</b> triangulated by the anti-roll bar.

There were coil-over shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} wishbones {{were similar}} to that of the E-Type, however where the E-Type used longitudinal torsion bars, the XJ13 had more conventional coil spring/damper units. At the rear there again remained similarities with the E-Type—the use of driveshafts as upper transverse links—however the rest was quite different, with two long radius arms per side angling back from the central body tub together with a single fabricated transverse <b>lower</b> <b>link.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 177, the {{designation}} of which {{was derived from the}} fact that its design was commenced in 1977, was a bulky car finished in the handsome dark red colour adopted by Autodelta. The 177 featured a riveted aluminium chassis, with front suspension by upper rocking arms, lower wishbones and inboard-mounted coil spring/damper units. The rear suspension featured parallel <b>lower</b> <b>links,</b> single top links, twin radius rods and outboard coil spring/damper units.Bruno Giacomelli had won the 1978 European Formula Two Championship in a March and was hired to drive the new Alfa Romeo 177; he used this car at Belgian and French Grands Prix.|$|E

5000|$|The {{complete}} {{rear suspension}} assembly is {{carried in a}} steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower link pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, the Honda Civic was {{significantly}} redesigned for model year 1988. The suspension had a radical re-configuration with double-wishbone suspension {{in the front}} and an independent suspension in the rear, wheelbase was increased to 98.4 inches (250 cm), and the body was redesigned with a lower hood line and more glass, giving less drag. The front suspension incorporates an extended hub carrier, so the upper arm is relatively short. The rear suspension is a multi-link trailing arm suspension with upper and <b>lower</b> lateral control <b>links</b> (with the spring/damper strut carried on the <b>lower</b> <b>link)</b> near the axle line and a short lateral link for toe control ahead of the pivot of the main trailing arm.|$|R
30|$|Yu et al. [19] {{proposed}} Link Effective Available Time (LEAT).

A new routing link cost was proposed which <b>lowered</b> <b>link</b> breakage. Routing was formulated as an optimal routing problem based on new cost, using a heuristic algorithm. Simulation shows that LEAT improved network performance in delay, hop counts, and throughput when compared to present routing algorithms.|$|R
50|$|If the Path MTU changes {{after the}} {{connection}} is set up and {{is lower than the}} previously determined Path MTU, the first large packet will cause an ICMP error and the new, lower Path MTU will be found.

On both Linux and Windows this timer is set by default to ten minutes.|$|R
