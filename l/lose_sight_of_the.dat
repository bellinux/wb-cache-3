25|$|Cerveny labored faithfully, even in {{the face}} of {{financial}} difficulties and a somewhat unruly element. At his request he was transferred to St. Ladislas' Church, Cleveland, and was succeeded on September 16, 1894, by Father Sigmund Wozny, who had just then come to the diocese. During 1895 Wozny had the church property enclosed by a fence, and replaced the chairs with pews, besides making other necessary improvements. Like his immediate predecessor, he found an unruly element to deal with, which, with the comparatively large parish debt, about $17,000, discouraged him, and hence he asked to be relieved from his unpleasant pastoral charge. His wish was granted, and he left the diocese in February, 1896 and was at once succeeded by Father Francis X. Fremel, who set courageously to work to put men and things to rights. He too met with opposition at the start, but with prudence and firmness he soon succeeded in surmounting the difficulties that beset him. Under his direction, seconded by the generosity of the people, the interior of the church was ornamented quite neatly, and all the requisites for divine service procured. At the same time he did not <b>lose</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funded debt, but strained every nerve to have it reduced.|$|E

[...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies.

Instead of recording the album in one block session, she commuted from France to Bath to the producers' studio. She made several trips from the end of 2006 to May 2007, concentrating on two or three tracks at the time.

2500|$|The poem is an {{irregular}} Pindaric ode in 11 stanzas that combines aspects of Coleridge's Conversation poems, the religious sentiments of the Bible and {{the works of}} Saint Augustine, and aspects of the elegiac and apocalyptic traditions. It is split into three movements: the first four stanzas discuss death, {{and the loss of}} youth and innocence; the second four stanzas describes how age causes man to <b>lose</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine, and the final three stanzas express hope that the memory of the divine allow us to sympathise with our fellow man. The poem relies on the concept of Pre-existence, the idea that the soul existed before the body, to connect children with the ability to witness the divine within nature. As children mature, they become more worldly and lose this divine vision, and the ode reveals Wordsworth's understanding of psychological development that is also found in his poems The Prelude and Tintern Abbey. Wordsworth's praise of the child as the [...] "best philosopher" [...] was criticised by Coleridge and became the source of later critical discussion.|$|E
