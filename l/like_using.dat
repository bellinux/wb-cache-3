The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them.

Two-way insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability.

25|$|China's Education Ministry {{published}} research on September, 2014, that only 70% {{percent of people}} of the PRC had good understanding and speaking skill of Putonghua despite People's Republic of China Government was promoting Putonghua on TV, radio and public services like buses and like that to develop Putonghua as PRC official language to ease communication between all people of the PRC, because many ethnic groups had their own dialects, so it was problem to understand each other. To develop the Putonghua as the official common language of the PRC is difficult sometimes because some ethnic groups that are using other dialects don't <b>like</b> <b>using</b> the Putonghua {{because they think they}} are losing their own native dialect and cultural identity, for example, when in the summer of 2010 appeared some reports of increasing the using of the Putonghua on a local TV broadcasting in Cantonese dialect in the province of Guangdong, then thousands of Cantonese-speaking citizens were protesting on the demonstration against the plan.|$|E
25|$|This swine {{production}} and pollution that accompanies factory hogging {{is concentrated in}} the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development. Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO {{is made up of}} three parts: the hog house, the “lagoon,” and the “spray field.” Waste disposal techniques used by small-scale traditional hog farms, <b>like</b> <b>using</b> waste as fertilizer for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an impermeable liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious sludge into North Carolina’s New River and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.|$|E

Additional information about Jesus's skin colour and hair is provided by Goodacre.
