5|$|The {{interaction}} of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons. Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere. It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closed, from energetic particles. The latter can still freely strike Ganymede's poles, where the field <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> open. Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts. Energetic electrons entering its thin atmosphere {{are responsible for the}} observed Ganymedian polar aurorae.|$|E
