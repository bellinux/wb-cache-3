Alex Rocha of TV Guide {{called it a}} [...] "pretty dull episode, but with some bright humorous spots [...] The episode {{looked like it had}} potential, but definitely did not perform to its best." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN called it [...] "far from perfect" [...] but [...] "definitely a <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> terrible O.J. Simpson episode from last week."

[...] He praises Leto's acting, stating [...] "The closest the film comes to having a gravitational center are in the scenes set in 2092. What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future, but Leto's performance. His acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth." [...] He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying [...] "Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, are impressive, bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life." [...] Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his [...] "Top 10 New Faces & Voices" [...] of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He notes that [...] "newbie Toby Regbo might easily be Mr. Nobody's most [...] "alive" [...] character.
