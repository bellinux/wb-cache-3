5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also {{made a conscious decision}} to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E

25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had found the right actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't remember exactly which was the one he liked. Eichinger <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the tape and found {{what he thought was a}} suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E

Among the evidence seen as likely to do so was that collected from the Rasmussens' residence. However, {{it was not until}} 2004 that another criminalist, Jennifer Butterworth, was able to analyze it.|$|E

25|$|Lead vocalist Keith Morris was an {{original}} member of Black Flag, co-founding the band with Greg Ginn and recording the Nervous Breakdown EP with them before suddenly departing {{the group in}} December 1979. Morris formed Circle Jerks as the Bedwetters along with guitarist Greg Hetson, bassist Roger Rogerson (a classically-trained guitarist) and drummer Lucky Lehrer (a jazz-trained drummer). Lehrer {{did not like the}} name the Bedwetters, so Morris <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> a dictionary of slang words and renamed the band the Circle Jerks.|$|E
25|$|Scott Cameron Despres {{was born}} in Utica, New York on September 4, 1970. He and his family later moved to Ashburnham, Massachusetts where he {{graduated}} from Oakmont Regional High School in 1988. It was during high school that Despres first became interested in professional wrestling when, in his sophomore year, Despres' younger brother Danny {{was hit by a}} car. While Danny was hospitalized with broken arms and legs, the two <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> wrestling magazines when Despres visited him. Despres began attending local wrestling matches with high school friends and soon developed an interest in becoming a wrestler himself. He started training with Brian Walsh, a local wrestler from Braintree, and spent twice a week in Walsh's basement gym. Without a ring or crash mats, Despres was taught the older European-style of wrestling. He also started weightlifting three to four times a week.|$|E

25|$|On April 1, 2001, an {{incident}} occurred when a mid-air collision between an EP-3E of VQ-1 and a People's Liberation Army Navy J-8II fighter jet {{resulted in an}} international dispute between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. The accident happened {{after one of the}} J-8s, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Wang Wei made two close passes to the EP-3. On the third pass, it collided with the EP-3. The J-8 broke into two pieces. The EP-3 made an unauthorized emergency landing at Lingshui airfield, due to severe damage, after at least 15 distress signals had gone unanswered. For 15 minutes after landing, the EP-3 crew continued to destroy sensitive items and data on board the aircraft, as per Department of Defense protocol. They disembarked from the aircraft after soldiers <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> windows, pointed guns, and shouted through bullhorns. The crew of the EP-3 was released on April 11, 2001, and returned to their base at Whidbey Island via Honolulu, Hawaii, where they were subject to two days of intense debriefings, followed by a heroes' welcome.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{decided to}} use a film {{in the public domain}} to avoid any rights issues. He <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the Prelinger Archives to find a film which matched the mood he wanted for the Chroma Key album. One of the first films he found was the social {{guidance}} film Age 13. [...] "It was kind of rich for musical accompaniment and the cinematography and everything is really beautiful, kind of surreal," [...] Moore said. The film served as Moore's main inspiration and source of audio samples.|$|E

500|$|There are two {{versions}} of the story of how Lennon and Ono first met. [...] According to the first account, on November 9, 1966 Lennon went to the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. [...] When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the spyglass and saw the word [...] "YES" [...] which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was [...] "anti" [...] everything.|$|E

500|$|The rescuers, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt to force open the van with hatchets, sledgehammers, and crowbars, called upon Police Sergeant Brett, who {{was inside the}} van with the prisoners, to open the door. Brett refused, {{so one of the}} rescuers placed his revolver at the keyhole of the van to blow the lock, just as Brett <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the keyhole {{to see what was happening}} outside. The bullet passed through his eye into his brain and killed him. The door was opened when one of the women prisoners took the keys from Brett's pocket, and passed them through a ventilator to the Fenians outside, allowing Kelly and Deasy to escape. Brett was the first Manchester police officer to be killed on duty, in an incident that became known locally as the [...] "Manchester Outrages".|$|E
500|$|Talking about {{bringing}} {{the character of}} Franklin Hall from the comics to the series, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said that the writers had <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the comics for a character to fill the episode's role, and felt that Hall had an interesting history. Subsequently, changes were made to fit the comics character into the existing role for the series, and he ultimately appears in an origin story-type role rather than as the fully formed supervillain from the comics. As a hint at his potential to become the villain [...] "Graviton" [...] in the future, the series changed his original scientific interests from matter transportation {{to the study of}} [...] "gravitonium", a substance created for the episode. The episode's ending, which sees Hall fall into some gravitonium, indicates that this is how he gains his Graviton abilities in the series.|$|E
