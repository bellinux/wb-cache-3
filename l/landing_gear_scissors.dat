40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, {{the interaction of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometry. The prediction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise is performed using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Gear</b> Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for the prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> wake with the high lift devices. Comparisons with measurements show the accuracy of the predictions of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise levels and directivity. Airframe noise predictions for the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> of a complete aircraft are described. I...|$|R

The pilot completed the emergency procedure from memory and visually checked the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> appeared to be extended.

The pilot flew the airplane to the maintenance base. On landing rollout, the right main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> collapsed. Examination of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> by the FAA revealed improper rigging of the right main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> down lock mechanism due to normal wear. The probable cause was the pilot's decision to depart an airport and continue flight with known deficient equipment. Contributing to the accident was the failure of company maintenance personnel to adjust the down lock mechanism prior to flight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the passive control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model and semi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of passive control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active control <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds.
