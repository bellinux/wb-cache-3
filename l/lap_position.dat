40|$|Abstract. This study {{examines}} for keyhole behavior by observing the laser-induced plasma and investigates {{the relation between}} keyhole behavior and formation of weld defect. Laser-induced plasma has been accompanied with the vaporizing pressure of zinc ejecting from keyhole to surface of primer coated plate. This dynamic behavior of plasma was very unstable and it was {{closely related to the}} unstable motion of keyhole during laser welding. As a result of observing the composition of porosity, much of Zn element was found from inner surface of it. But Zn was not found from the dimple structure fractured at the weld metal. therefore we can prove that the major cause of porosity is the vaporization of primer in <b>lap</b> <b>position.</b> Mechanism of porosity-formation is that the primer vaporized from the <b>lap</b> <b>position</b> accelerates dynamic behavior of the key hole and the bubble separated from the key hole is trapped in the solidification boundary and remains as porosity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of laser welding {{technology has been}} considered to shipbuilding structure. However, when this technology is applied to primer-coated steel, good quality weld beads are not easily obtained. Because the primer-coated layer caused the spatter, humping bead and porosity which are {{main part of the}} welding defect attributed to the powerful vaporizing pressure of zinc. So we performed experiment with objectives of understanding spatter and porosity formation mechanism and producing sound weld beads in 6 t primer coated steels by a CO 2 CW laser. The effects of welding parameters; defocused distance, welding speed, coated thickness and coated position; were investigated in the bead shape and penetration depth on bead and lap welding. Alternative idea was suggested to suspend the welding defect by giving a reasonable gap clearance for primer coated thickness. The zinc of primer has a boiling point that is lower than melting point of steel. Zinc vapor builds up at the interface between the two sheets and this tends to deteriorate the quality of the weld by ejecting weld material from <b>lap</b> <b>position</b> or leaving porosity. Significant effects of primer coated position were lap side rather than surface. Therefore introducing a small gap clearance in the <b>lap</b> <b>position,</b> the zinc vapor could escape through it and sound weld beads can be acquired. In conclusion, formation and suspension mechanism of the welding defects was suggested by controlling the factors...|$|E

5000|$|From 2010 until 2015, if the caution {{flag was}} shown {{during the first}} of the two <b>laps,</b> <b>positions</b> would be frozen as they would be during a regular race caution, and a second green-white-checker attempt would be made, up to a maximum of three attempts. From 2016 until August 2017, the rule was changed so that an [...] "overtime line" [...] was {{established}} (usually halfway on the penultimate lap), and if a caution on a green-white-checkered attempt occurs before that line is passed, another attempt is made at a restart, until a valid restart has been made (defined as the race leader reaching the overtime line under green).

5000|$|CCS uses an {{advanced}} software package to facilitate scoring and operations. The operations system, RaceWurx, is developed by Bitgeist Corporation out of Miami, FL and the timming system is manufactured by Westhold Corporation of Santa Clara, CA. [...] Racers receive {{the use of}} an electronic transponder device when they register for a race. They then affix that transponder to the machine to be raced. When on the track, the transponder works with a hardware beacon and software system that records racers <b>lap</b> times, <b>position,</b> and other data, and feeds it to the race officials software system, which then allows the officials to know in real-time what is happening with the race. Participants benefit as well from the system due to faster posting of results, reduced error rates, and the ability to interface with the system in read-only mode to see current <b>lap</b> times, <b>position,</b> and other data. A racer's performance in an individual event gives that rider points, which are added to the rider's performance history. The aggregate number of points as well as a mathematically derived performance index are used by CCS to determine championship winners in RaceWurx as a given season progresses.|$|R
