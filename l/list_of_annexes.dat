40|$|Europeanisation from a Neo-Institutionalist Perspective: Experiencing Territorial Politics in Spain and Romania The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{study is}} to investigate and explain {{the emergence of the}} phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation in two different national and historical contexts, namely Spain and Romania during their respective democratic transitions and EC/EU pre-accession periods. For Spain, we concentrate on the period from 1976 to 1986, which corresponds to end of the Franco regime, the transition to democracy and the EC pre-accession process. For Romania, we analyse the period from 1990 to 2007, which refers the end of the communist regime, the democratic transition and the EU pre-accession process. The key research questions to be investigated are: What factors or variables determine the internal institutional change (or lack of change) towards the institutionalisation of regions during the EU enlargement process? Under which conditions can we expect change towards the regions’ institutionalisation? Is this phenomenon caused either by external EC/EU pressures and requirements for institutional reform, or by domestic institutions and actors’ interests and norms? Or is it generated by the interplay between these external and internal variables for change? In order to answer these questions, we have constructed a theoretical and methodological framework that would be useful for the empirical data analysis and which is based on the combination between different strands of literature, namely Europeanisation, comparative regionalism and new institutionalism (rational-choice, historical, and sociological). The purpose was to identify in this literature a number of hypothesised variables or conditions for domestic change that may explain the regions’ institutionalisation in the two selected EC/EU candidate countries. In the process of identifying these conditions, which cause change or uphold stability in the state institutional and territorial structure during the EU enlargement process, we focussed on the EC/EU external conditionality in the regional and territorial policy field and on domestic national and subnational elements of explanation. First, we hypothesised that domestic institutional change is supposed to happen either in response to the EU pressures, be it material or normative pressures, or as a usage of the EU, without necessarily the presence of an important frame of external conditionality. Secondly, from a rational-choice new institutionalist perspective, it was hypothesised that institutional change depends on the presence of “formal institutions” and of “veto players” opposed to territorial reforms. Thirdly, from a sociological new institutionalist perspective, it was expected that the regions’ institutionalisation is likely to take place in the presence of “norm agents”, a “cooperative-type of political culture” and/or a “legitimating discourse” in favour of regionalisation. Fourthly, from a historical new institutionalist perspective, it was hypothesised that the phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation is likely to occur {{in the presence of the}} “historical regionalism state tradition” and of a “path-setting sequence” favourable to territorial and regional reforms. In methodological terms, this doctoral study subscribes to a case-oriented methodology, also known as the comparative method. It follows the method of “comparing few countries”, focussing therefore on a small number of cases chosen “purposefully rather than at random” and which generally supposes the use of qualitative analysis. In operationalising the qualitative comparative method, we mainly used a number of sources of evidence namely: archival records, documents, interviews and direct observation during our field work. We have constantly cross-checked these different types of data. In terms of results, we have tested, confirmed and disconfirmed the hypothesised explanatory power of the selected new institutionalist variables and we have come to the following conclusions. In Spain, we assert, in light of the test of the work hypotheses against the empirical data, that the phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation is explained by (1) the ethnic-nationalist state tradition, (2) the initial path-setting sequence towards the institutionalisation of regions (the pre-autonomy and the constitutional autonomy system), (3) the reform supportive internal institutions, (4) the important action capacity and access to decision-making of norm agents, promoters of regionalisation and autonomy, (5) the cooperative, consensus-building political culture between the representatives of Spanish nationalism from the central establishment and the representatives of ethnic-nationalist regionalism, (6) the domestic discourse favouring territorial and regional reforms, associated with democracy and peaceful transition, and (7) the weak action capacity and restrained access to decision-making of veto players. This internal domestic conjuncture favourable to the regions’ institutionalisation was as well externally strengthened by the presence of supportive external EC institutions. The Romanian case of regions’ institutionalisation is explained by a combination of causal variables such as: (1) the material and normative EU conditionality, (2) the blocked access of veto players to the national decision-making system, (3) the emergence of a prevailing consensual type of domestic political culture and relations between the centre and the periphery, (4) the incipient existence of formal institutions providing the basis for regional development and assuring the possibility for cooperation between the different state territorial levels, and (5) the emergence of a dominant legitimating discourse which associated the regions’ institutionalisation to economic development and successful EU accession Accordingly, in light of the comparative analysis approach, we have come to the conclusion that not all the causal variables selected from the literature have an explanatory power in both cases. The comparative analysis confirms and thus allows us to make modest theoretical generalisations about the causal links between the dependent variable under investigation and the following explanatory variables. First is the presence of a consensual political culture between centre and periphery. Second is the existence of formal institutions which can provide interested actors with the necessary means for regional and territorial reforms and for regional development. Third is the prevailing presence of a discourse favouring the regions’ institutionalisation and legitimising the minorities’ autonomy claims. Fourth is the existence of a feeble or blocked access to decision-making of veto players. Both cases agree on these four variables, by which we understand that these variables are the causes of the phenomenon under investigation. From the angle of this generalisation, we can assume that whenever these causes or conditions occur, then, their combined effects produce change towards the regions’ institutionalisation. Finally, this doctoral research has thus contributed to both the refinement and development of theoretical propositions derived from new institutionalism, but also to the refinement of the literature on Europeanisation and comparative regionalism. It has also contributed to empirical knowledge related to the comparative analysis of domestic territorial and regional reforms in two candidate countries, Spain and Romania in the double context of democratisation and adaptation for EC/EU membership.

A key has therefore been produced based on defined habitat categories that can be recorded consistently in the field in order to restrict the range of options for any given habitat patch. Expert judgement may still be needed to finalise the allocation to a specific class. A direct key is not possible because the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>Annex</b> I habitats has been produced by meetings of national experts and final allocation often requires scientific judgement.

The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection has already asked the EU Commission to start the procedure under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1925 / 2006 for these plants and preparations, for the purpose of including them in one <b>of</b> the three <b>lists</b> in Annex III. The assessment applies to ephedra alkaloid-containing ephedra haulm. The risk assessment of the plants was carried out {{on the basis of the}} Guidance on Safety Assessment of botanicals and botanical preparations intended for use as ingredients in food supplements published by the EFSA 1 and the BfR guidelines on health assessments 2. Result We know that ingestion of ephedra alkaloid-containing Ephedra haulm represents a risk from medicinal use in the USA and from the fact that it has now been banned as a food supplement in the USA. Serious unwanted and sometimes life-threatening side effects are associated with the ingestion of food supplements containing ephedra alkaloids. Due to the risks described, we would recommend that ephedra alkaloid-containing Ephedra haulm be classified in <b>List</b> A <b>of</b> <b>Annex</b> III t...|$|R

The diagnoses of the two species of Marteilia found in Europe (Marteilia refringens and Marteilia maurini) was done using ultrastructural characteristics and host specificity. However, it is not possible to establish whether one, two, or more species of Marteilia exist in bivalve molluscs in Europe. There is an urgent need to set up more sensitive and accurate methods to allow the detection of low prevalence of Marteilia and to clarify the taxonomy of this parasite. The existence of a complex life-cycle was early postulated by many authors. Because of the limitations of histology, a sensible and specific tool is needed to screen for Marteilia presence in intermediate or alternative hosts...|$|R
