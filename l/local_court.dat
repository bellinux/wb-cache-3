5|$|Most of {{the common}} pleas court judges up for {{re-election}} were endorsed by both parties, but in the one contested race, Democrat John Morgan Davis defeated incumbent Republican Thomas Bluett. The Democrats also took eight of the fourteen magisterial district judge positions (a <b>local</b> <b>court,</b> the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court).|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was {{becoming}} less fashionable as a residence. Goodrich was too distant from London to {{be a useful}} power base, and was gradually abandoned in favour of more stylish residences, Goodrich continued {{to be used as}} a judicial centre however; the antiquarian John Leland noted that some of the castle was used to hold prisoners for the <b>local</b> <b>court</b> during the 1530s, and the castle ditch was sometimes used to store confiscated cattle taken from local farmers.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 the <b>Local</b> <b>Courts</b> Act {{abolished}} Courts of Petty Sessions {{by changing}} their name to <b>Local</b> <b>Courts</b> and appointments are now made under that Act.

5|$|Economic {{development}} and increased settlement led the Pennsylvania General Assembly to establish Cummings Township in 1832 from land taken from parts of Mifflin and Brown Townships. The new township {{was named for}} John Cummings, who was an associate judge in the <b>local</b> <b>court</b> system at the time. Early industry in the township included lumber and quarries for flag and building stone. In 1839Clinton County was formed from {{the western part of}} Lycoming County, with much of the eastern border of the new county formed by the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 {{elections}} to the Crimean parliament, the Party of Regions received the largest share of votes, whilst the second-placed Communist Party of Ukraine received {{a much smaller}} share. Both of these political parties would later be targets of the Euromaidan movement. Former president of Crimea Yuriy Olexandrovich Meshkov called for a referendum on restoring the 1992 Constitution of Crimea in July 2011. As a consequence of this, a <b>local</b> <b>court</b> in Crimea deported Meshkov from Ukraine for five years.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Atemengue {{was made}} {{chief of the}} <b>local</b> <b>court,</b> and Atangana was again {{appointed}} paramount chief (chef supérieur). He received {{a seat on the}} Council of Notables, a body the French had introduced to act as liaisons to their subjects and advisors to the administration. Atangana set up a cabinet based on those he had observed in Spain, but he never allowed it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.|$|E
40|$|Last session I had the honour of {{submitting}} to this Society an essay containing {{the result of}} some inquiries into {{the constitution of the}} <b>local</b> <b>courts</b> in the Three Kingdoms, and containing also some suggestions as to the modification of our Irish <b>local</b> <b>courts.</b> I ventured to advocate for the <b>local</b> <b>courts</b> a jurisdiction complete and comprehensive, within whatever money limits it might be thought desirable to fix. The Council of the Society have done me the further honour of asking me to supplement that paper by another. They commissioned me to ascertain by a comparison between the official staff in the <b>local</b> <b>courts</b> in the Three Kingdoms, what officers should be supplied to the local tribunals in Ireland, so as to give complete effect to the proposed extended jurisdiction...|$|R

5|$|There {{were also}} {{thirteen}} seats open for magistrate, a <b>local</b> <b>court,</b> {{the duties of}} which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. In the magistrate races, each political party could nominate eight candidates, and voters could only vote for eight, with the result being that the majority party could only take eight of the thirteen seats, leaving five for the minority party. The Democrats took {{the maximum number of}} eight magistracies, with incumbents Vincent A. Dean and William Cibotti leading the ticket. Republicans were held to just the five slots allotted them, with incumbent Benjamin W. Schwartz taking the most votes of his party's nominees.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a <b>local</b> <b>court</b> in Germany {{ruled that the}} {{television}} rights to the FIA European Truck Racing Cup (passed to Ecclestone by the FIA the previous year, along with all other FIA authorised championships) {{should be returned to}} the series organiser, following a complaint from German television company AE TV-Cooperations. The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court's decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice. On appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.|$|E
5|$|Raj Thackeray and SP leader Abu Asim Azmi were booked under Indian Penal Code {{sections}} 153 (wantonly giving provocation {{with intent}} to cause riot), 153 A (promoting enmity between groups {{on the basis of}} place of birth, residence, etc.) and 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) on 11 February. The police also applied section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to both politicians and warned them not to hold any press conferences or rallies in the next seven days. On 13 February, however, police arrested both the leaders. Later that day, a <b>local</b> <b>court</b> granted Raj conditional bail and ordered him not to make any speeches that would inflame public tension. He obtained a release after furnishing a personal bond of Rs.15,000. Azmi was arrested and taken to the Bhoiwada court in South Central Mumbai and was released on surety of Rs.10,000.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} in the down-ballot races. Democratic city commissioners Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry were reelected as was Republican Walter I. Davidson. William M. Lennox was reelected county sheriff and Joseph A. Scanlon was reelected {{clerk of the court}} of quarter sessions (a court whose jurisdiction is now exercised by the court of common pleas). The Democrats also took four of the seven magisterial district judge positions up for election that year (a <b>local</b> <b>court,</b> the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court). The ballot contained two referendums authorizing the city to take loans for construction of medical facilities, streets, sewers, playgrounds, and other civic improvements. They passed with overwhelming support, each tallying 84% affirmative votes.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts. The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the <b>local</b> <b>court,</b> overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E
5|$|When King Henry II died in 1189, his son Richard I, who {{had spent}} most of his life in France, arrived in Portsmouth before he was crowned in London. When Richard {{returned}} from captivity in Austria in May 1194, he summoned a fleet of 100 ships and an army to the port. He granted the town a Royal charter, giving permission for an annual fifteen-day free market fair, weekly markets, and a <b>local</b> <b>court</b> to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from paying an annual tax of £18. Richard granted the town the arms of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, whom he had defeated during the Third Crusade in 1191, reflecting a significant involvement of local soldiers, sailors, and vessels in the holy war. The 800 anniversary was celebrated in 1994 as the city's founding.|$|E

5|$|On 12 June, Wrawe {{attacked}} Sir Richard Lyons' {{property at}} Overhall, advancing on to Cavendish and Bury St Edmunds in west Suffolk the next day, gathering further support as they went. John Cambridge, the Prior {{of the wealthy}} Bury St Edmunds Abbey, was disliked in the town, and Wrawe allied himself with the townspeople and stormed the abbey. The Prior escaped, but was found two days later and beheaded. A small band of rebels marched north to Thetford to extort protection money from the town, and another group tracked down Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Cavendish was caught in Lakenheath and killed. John Battisford and Thomas Sampson independently led a revolt near Ipswich on 14 June. They took the town without opposition and looted {{the properties of the}} archdeacon and local tax officials. The violence spread out further, with attacks on many properties and the burning of the <b>local</b> <b>court</b> records. One official, Edmund Lakenheath, was forced to flee from the Suffolk coast by boat.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century, the central {{government}} became increasingly involved in local affairs. The feud was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of Justices of the Peace on the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions. Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a joint commission with the English set up in 1587. James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts {{of the region and}} forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the Statues of Iona 1609. From the seventeenth century the function of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom or shire to collect the cess land tax. The parish also became an important unit of local government, pressured by Justices in the early eighteenth century, it became responsible for taking care of the destitute in periods of famine, like that in 1740, to prevent the impoverished from taking to the roads and causing general disorder. Behaviour could be regulated through kirk sessions, composed of local church elders, which replaced the church courts of the Middle Ages, and which dealt with moral and religious conduct. The <b>local</b> <b>court</b> baron remained important in regulating minor interpersonal and property offences. They were held {{at the behest of the}} local baron when there was a backlog of cases and could appoint birleymen, usually senior tenants, who would resolve disputes and issues. The combination of kirk sessions and courts baron gave considerable power to local lairds to control the behaviour of the populations of their communities.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 the {{government}} of Malawi established a commission to review the possibility of re-introducing formal <b>local</b> traditional <b>courts.</b> After {{the completion of the}} review, {{the government}} introduced a bill that would provide <b>Local</b> <b>Courts</b> able to prosecute some criminal cases. The 2011 <b>Local</b> <b>Courts</b> legislation created <b>Local</b> <b>Courts</b> that would primarily handle nuisance crimes as well as crimes such as defamation. Some Malawian politicians and human rights activists have derided the bill, characterizing it as a plan for Kangaroo courts {{that could be used for}} political repression. Ibrahim Matola of the United Democratic Front has argued that the courts will provide too much power to local chiefs and could devolve into a [...] "draconian system". Opposition leader John Tembo has condemned the plan as incompatible with a multi party democracy. The Malawi Congress Party has also criticized the plan, claiming that it will unconstitutionally takes away power from the Judicial branch of government. The Solicitor General of Malawi, Anthony Kamanga, has disputed this claim, arguing that the Constitution of Malawi allows for the limited use of <b>local</b> <b>courts.</b> The Justice Minister of Malawi, George Chaponda, has also defended the bill, citing the fact that serious crimes will not be handled by the <b>local</b> <b>courts</b> as proof that there is no danger of human rights abuses. Chaponda claims that the plans are popular with most Malawians, and that his critics are not “conversant with the historical development of this country.” ...|$|R
