25|$|Unlike many boxers, Norton {{would often}} {{not attempt to}} stare down an {{opponent}} while announcements were made before the match started. Instead, he'd often <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor and gather his thoughts. He was also widely noted for his fine athletic build.|$|E
25|$|The yaw string, {{also known}} as a slip string, is a simple device for {{indicating}} a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight. It performs the same function as the slip-skid indicator ball, but is more sensitive, and does not require the pilot to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> instrument panel. Technically, it measures sideslip angle, not yaw angle, but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the sideslip angle to zero.|$|E
60|$|Doctor Prince nodded, but he {{continued}} to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pools of blood and the bar of iron.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reins in her lap, and {{she felt}} again that wicked {{stirring}} within her,--incredible stirring of minister's daughter for tanner's son. Coniston believes, and always will believe, that the social bars are strong enough. So Cynthia <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reins.|$|R
60|$|Saduko {{paused and}} <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{brooding}} heavily.|$|R

60|$|The sentry {{stood by}} and {{allowed them to}} pass, {{although}} he looked searchingly at Granet. They walked slowly up the scrubby avenue to the house. Once Granet paused to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> long arm of the sea on his left.|$|E
60|$|No, it ain't. I've done it myself. It's {{like a high}} dive. When you <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{water it}} fairly takes your breath away, but after you've done it--it's not so bad as you think. You're going to be married, my boy.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{his voice}} tailing off into silence.|$|R
60|$|Jane Hubbard {{clasped her}} strong hands and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{cheque-book}} {{which lay}} open before him.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Daisy and Mr. Dabster stepped from an {{elevator}} to {{the top floor of}} the skyscraper. Then up a short, steep stairway and out upon the roof. Dabster led her to the parapet so she could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> black dots moving in the street below.|$|E
60|$|He had sauntered far enough. Before {{turning to}} retrace his steps, he stopped upon the margin, to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{reflected}} night. In an instant, with a dreadful crash, the reflected night turned crooked, flames shot jaggedly across the air, {{and the moon}} and stars came bursting from the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, the skipper’s fad soon got known for’ard. But I didn’t {{think much}} about it, till one day I seed old Dan’l Dennis sitting on a locker reading. Every now and then he’d shut the book, an’ look up, closing ’is eyes, an’ moving his lips like a hen drinking, an’ then <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> book again.|$|E
60|$|Their eyes met. Langmaid <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{tip of his}} cigar.|$|R
60|$|They leaned together, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart-drama being acted below.|$|R
60|$|Thorne <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> child {{before he}} turned toward his hostess.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I not owe {{something}} to myself?" [...] said Tito, inwardly, {{with a slight}} movement of his shoulders, the first he had made since he had turned to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> florins. [...] "Before I quit everything, and incur again all the risks of which I am even now weary, I must {{at least have a}} reasonable hope. Am I to spend my life in a wandering search? I believe he is dead. Cennini was right about my florins: I will place them in his hands to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|Charnock got up {{and went}} off, beating his hands. He noted that there was a hole in the mittens he had brought from home. This was {{annoying}} because Sadie had given him the mittens. In spite of many difficulties, they braced the posts securely before they stopped work, and when supper was over Charnock reluctantly put on his coat. He wanted to ask Norton something, and when he left the latter's office came back along a narrow path above the track. After going a short distance he stopped to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> half-finished frames.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}}," [...] said Brown, turning for {{a moment}} to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sea, which now lay spread out far below them like a blue plain, [...] "I've been thinking that the proof of people having been here long ago lies not only in these stones, axes, spears, and images, but also in the fact that we find the cocoa-nut trees, bananas, plantains, breadfruit-trees, as well as yams and sweet potatoes, grow chiefly in the sunny and sheltered parts of the island, and gathered together {{as if they had been}} planted there." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Emperor {{continued}} to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kneeling boy, {{and at last}} he gave a short, dry laugh. [...] "So be it," [...] said he, [...] "thy plan {{is not without its}} wisdom. Mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be ended thus peacefully. The estates of the Roderburgs shall be held in trust for thee until thou art come of age; otherwise it shall be as thou hast proposed, the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own care. And as to thee--art thou willing that I should take thee under my own charge in the room of thy father, who is dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{adjective}} [...] "high" [...] is {{not only}} one of the sudden and stunning inspirations of literature; {{it is also one of}} the greatest and gravest definitions of moral science. However far aloft a man may go, he is still looking up, not only at God (which is obvious), but in a manner at men also: seeing more and more all that is towering and mysterious in the dignity and destiny of the lonely house of Adam. I wrote some part of these rambling remarks on a high ridge of rock and turf overlooking a stretch of the central counties; the rise was slight enough in reality, but the immediate ascent had been so steep and sudden that one could not avoid the fancy that on reaching the summit one would <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars. But one did not <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars, but rather up at the cities; seeing as high in heaven the palace town of Alfred like a lit sunset cloud, and away in the void spaces, like a planet in eclipse, Salisbury. So, it may be hoped, until we die you and I will always look up rather than down at the labours and the habitations of our race; we will lift up our eyes to the valleys from whence cometh our help. For from every special eminence and beyond every sublime landmark, it is good for our souls to see only vaster and vaster visions of that dizzy and divine level; and to behold from our crumbling turrets the tall plains of equality.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{brought into}} my head, master," [...] returns the woman, her eyes filling with tears, [...] "when I <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> child lying so. If {{it was never}} to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I know that very well. I was with Jenny when she lost hers--warn't I, Jenny?--and I know how she grieved. But look around you at this place. Look at them," [...] glancing at the {{sleepers}} on the ground. [...] "Look at the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn. Think of the children that your business lays with often and often, and that YOU see grow up!" ...|$|E
60|$|Nicholas Fenn <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table. His {{expression}} was not altogether pleasant.|$|R

60|$|Poor Steadfast had {{not much}} heart for {{watching}} soldiers, but it struck {{him that he}} might see or hear something of Jephthah, so he came with the other boys to the bank, where from behind a hedge they could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ranks of soldiers as they marched along, five abreast, the road was not wide enough to hold more. They {{had been allowed to}} keep their weapons, so the officers had their swords, and the men carried their musquets. Most of them looked dull and dispirited, and the officers had very gloomy, displeased faces. In fact, they were very angry with their commander, Colonel Fiennes, for having surrendered so easily, and he was afterwards brought to a court-martial for having done so.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were in the}} cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As the gaoler made {{a general}} {{inspection}} of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through {{the mind of the}} prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like {{a man who had been}} drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, [...] "Now am I left, as if I were dead." [...] Stopping then, to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, [...] "And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{time went}} on, and the dolls were given up, {{and we could}} no longer believe in savages, and began to think romping and {{throwing}} stones unladylike, although at times very pleasant, the summer-house became our reading-room, and at last, after we had a governess, our schoolroom in fine weather. This was not obtained without some opposition upon the part of mamma, who considered it as an irregular sort of proceeding; but we coaxed papa into putting in a good word for us, and then mamma, who was only too glad to see us happy, gave in at once. We had but just gone out, and after a <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river and the fish, and across at the pretty country beyond, had opened our books with a little sigh of regret, when we heard a footstep coming down the garden and to our surprise found it was papa.|$|E

60|$|Then, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cat, she resumed her old, mocking, humorous sing-song.|$|R
60|$|She sighed, and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{handkerchief}} {{with which}} she had been toying.|$|R
