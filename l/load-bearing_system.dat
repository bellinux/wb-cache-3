Integration of these metallic elements into traditional fiber-reinforced polymer composites has introduced other opportunities for multifunctionality, in terms of self-healing, thermal transport and perhaps sensing applications.

50|$|Capacity {{design of}} {{structures}} is: to control failure {{in a building}} by pre-selecting localized ductile fuses (or weak links) to act as the primary location for energy dissipation when a building is subjected to extreme loading. The structure is designed such that all inelastic action (or damage) occurs at these critical locations (the fuses), which are designed to behave in a ductile and stable manner. Conversely, all other structural elements are protected against failure or collapse by limiting the load transfer to these elements to the yield capacity of the fuses. In SPSWs, the infill plates are meant {{to serve as the}} fuse elements. When damaged during an extreme loading event, they can be replaced at a reasonable cost and restore full integrity of the building. In general, SPWs are categorized based on their performance, selection of structural and <b>load-bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> and the presence of perforations or stiffeners (Table 1).|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in tall buildings is lateral resistance of the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>systems</b> against applied loads such as earthquake, wind and blast. Dual systems comprising core wall systems (single or multi-cell core) and moment-resisting frames are used as resistance systems in tall buildings. In addition to adequate stiffness provided by the dual system, most tall buildings may have to rely on various control systems to reduce the level of unwanted motions stemming from severe dynamic loads. One of the main challenges to effectively control the motion of a structure is limitation in distributing the required control along the structure height optimally. In this paper, concrete shear walls are used as secondary resistance system at three different heights as well as actuators installed in the braces. The optimal actuator positions are found by using optimized PSO algorithm as well as arbitrarily. The control performance of buildings that are equipped and controlled using the PSO algorithm method placement is assessed and compared with arbitrary placement of controllers using both near- and far-field ground motions of Kobe and Chi–Chi earthquakes.|$|R

40|$|Wood is {{a natural}} wealth of our country and to {{encourage}} its use encourages country's economic growth. It is also becoming a popular material in modern construction because of its ecological benefits. Designing timber framed structures in seismic areas has been quite difficult if not an impossible task, with cross-laminated wooden panels it has became possible. Structurally {{it can be used}} as a shear wall or as a slab, which gives the structure its rigidness in the plane of the panel. Glued laminated timber (Glulam) elements have greater loading capacity than dimensionally equal elements of solid timber. Glulam is suitable for load-bearing elements in wooden structures, in which loading is expected to be greater. We wanted to verify the suitability of choice of the structural <b>load-bearing</b> <b>system</b> and dimensions of the load-bearing elements of a wooden office building in a seismic area. As a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>system</b> we chose frame, which is attached to two concrete kernels. For connection of load-bearing elements we chose steel connectors. The design of the concrete kernels and the joints between the timber frame and kernels are not included in the study. The structural modeling and its analysis was done by using software tool called Sofistik. During the study some assumptions were made, some were underpinned by tests. The conclusion is that with the use of cross laminated timber slabs, diagonals and concrete kernels sufficient horizontal resistance within the structure is achieved. The use of glued laminated timber for the beam elements is justified, although the dimensions are quite large, the same applies to the selected joints. We assume that most of the horizontal load is carried by kernels since they are much more rigid compared to the timber frame. For a more detailed analysis of the adequacy of the selected <b>load-bearing</b> <b>system</b> it would be necessary to include the design of the concrete kernels and joints between timber and concrete structure in the study. It should also be noted that the program used for structural analysis of the building does not give an option to define combination rules for serviceability limit state, although it is often decisive in the design of timber structures. ...|$|E

This study summarises the fundamentals of progressive collapse in relation to the existing theoretical concepts and understanding. Specifically the existing theories pertinent to progressive {{collapse of}} building structures, in particular reinforced concrete (RC) flat plates, are examined from the following four key aspects: (1) definition of progressive collapse from deformation and/or strength perspectives with respect to the failure criteria of structural members and the entire structural system; (2) failure mechanisms of <b>load-bearing</b> <b>systems</b> undergoing progressive collapse with respect to the structural ultimate capacity, which has not been considered in the design process; (3) research methodologies for investigating collapse mechanisms, with emphases on experimental and numerical approaches; and (4) collapse-resistant design principles as covered in several international design standards in which a number of robustness requirements have been recognised. Based on the schematic review of the current trends and developments, gaps and limitations in progressive collapse research are identified and a new research direction is established to advance the progressive collapse study of RC flat plate structures...|$|R

40|$|Load-bearing {{structures}} with kinematic functions enable and disable {{degrees of}} freedom and are part of many mechanical engineering applications. The relative movement between a wheel and {{the body of a}} car or a landing gear and an aircraft fuselage are examples for <b>load-bearing</b> <b>systems</b> with defined kinematics. In most cases, the load is transmitted through a predetermined load path to the structural support interfaces. However, unexpected load peaks or varying health condition of the system's supports, which means for example varying damping and stiffness characteristics, may require an active adjustment of the load path. However, load paths transmitted through damaged or weakened supports can be the reason for reduced comfort or even failure. In this paper a simplified 2 D two mass oscillator with two supports is used to numerically investigate the potential of controlled adaptive auxiliary kinematic guidance elements in a load-bearing structure to adapt the load path de pending on the stiffness change, representing damage of the supports. The aim is to provide additional forces in the auxiliary kinematic guidance elements for two reasons. On the one hand, one of the two supports that may become weaker through stiffness change will be relieved from higher loading. On the other hand, tilting due to different compliance in the supports will be minimized. Therefore, shifting load between the supports during operation could be an effective option...|$|R

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{structures are}} normally provided with tie connections {{that make it}} possible to transfer tensile forces across the joints. The tie connections are essential for the structural integrity and can contribute to the formation of alternative load-bearing systems in case of local damages of the structure. The aim of the present research was to develop a method for prediction of the load-displacement characteristics of tie connections in the plastic stage. Tie connections between concrete elements were studied experimentally. The load-displacement relationship and the strain distribution along the tie bar were evaluated from measurements. In most of the tests it was possible to obtain large plastic deformations and the ultimate displacement was determined by the rupture of the reinforcing steel. The anchorage capacity of tie bars anchored in grouted joints between hollow core elements was studied in separate test series. A numerical approach was developed for the analysis of tie connections in the plastic stage. The local bond-slip behaviour of the steel-to-concrete interface and the strain hardening of the steel were considered in the analysis. The bond-slip relationships that are recommended today could not be used in the calculations as the yield penetration along the embedded tie bar and, as a result, the displacement was considerably underestimated. Modified bond-slip relationships are proposed which take into account the yielding of the steel. It was found that the load-displacement relationship often had the same proportions as long as ductile types of tie bars were used even when the strength of steel and concrete varied substantially. The relative strain energy was defined and was found to be a valuable parameter describing the ductile behaviour of tie connections. An approach for the analysis of alternative <b>load-bearing</b> <b>system</b> is presented and exemplified. The approach is based on a condition of energy equilibrium. It is shown how the dynamic resistance of an alternative <b>load-bearing</b> <b>system</b> is affected by the ductility and the deformability of tie connections.
