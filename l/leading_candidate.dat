5|$|In November 1976, {{voters in}} San Francisco decided to reorganize {{supervisor}} elections to choose supervisors from neighborhoods instead of voting {{for them in}} citywide ballots. Harvey Milk quickly qualified as the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> in District 5, surrounding Castro Street.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009 Altadhaug Municipality cut {{the budgets}} of youth organisations by an {{estimated}} NOK 400,000. Steinholt opposed this, {{saying that if}} the wages of the mayor and several other high-ranking politicians had been cut, the municipality could have saved NOK 487,000. In the 2009 parliamentary election Steinholt received 1,829 votes, again as Red Nordland's <b>leading</b> <b>candidate.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} the 1824 presidential election, a <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> was William H. Crawford. However, {{malfeasance}} charges were brought up against Crawford and a select committee was formed to investigate the charges, the chairman of which was Floyd. Crawford rivals were determined to remove Floyd, as it was known he favored Crawford's candidacy, but their efforts failed. The committee acquitted Crawford of the charges.|$|E

5|$|The {{conclave}} remained deadlocked {{until the}} electors were informed of Charles II's death in November. The electors present understood that with Charles' death, the next pope {{would need to}} be politically impartial, so a member of the zelanti was preferred. Giovanni Albani, who had drafted the bull outlawing nepotism, soon became the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> for the papacy.|$|E
5|$|Long {{interested}} in an administrative role, White was the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> for {{principal of the}} neglected Roberts Vaux Consolidated School. In 1864, he was appointed principal, the first black person in Philadelphia to assume such a role. Originally housed in the poorly ventilated basement of the Zoar Methodist Church, under White's leadership, the Vaux school moved to the building formerly housing the William D. Helley School and tripled in attendance. White's administration facilitated {{the integration of the}} educational system in Philadelphia, including the end of segregation at Central High School and Girls' Normal School. Satisfied with his accomplishments, White retired from the position in June 1896.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{different}} factions in Masyumi were in conflict over the path {{the party was}} taking; the NU members thought Masyumi was becoming too political, abandoning its Islamic roots. When the Natsir Cabinet began to collapse, the Masyumi put forth Fakih as a potential Minister for Religious Affairs. This act was controversial because {{four of the five}} allocated slots for the party were already filled by non-NU members, and ultimately the NU pulled out of Masyumi, effective 5April 1952. Fakih had been chosen with a majority of five votes, while the next <b>leading</b> <b>candidate,</b> Usman Raliby, received four.|$|E

5|$|Seward {{originally}} {{supported the}} Regency, but by 1824 had broken from it, concluding it was corrupt. He {{became part of}} the Anti-Masonic Party, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; he was most likely killed by fellow Masons for publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Stevens's first {{political}} {{cause was}} Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance {{and death of}} William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites.

5|$|Tangherlini was {{considered}} a <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> for Metro's top job on a permanent basis before he resigned to work as D.C. City Administrator under Mayor Adrian Fenty. On November 6, 2006, Tangherlini was replaced as interim general manager by Jack Requa, Metro's chief bus manager. John B. Catoe, Jr., who was previously the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, became the agency's eighth permanent General Manager on January 25, 2007. He resigned three years later following the deadliest crash in the Metrorail system's history.|$|E

5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Bostock was considered a <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> for the position of Chief of the Air Staff in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore George Jones, a friend of twenty years. Appointed Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones {{over control of the}} Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|When Theobald died in 1160, most {{observers}} believed that Foliot was the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury {{had been held}} by a monk, {{at least since the}} replacement of Stigand by Lanfranc in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E
5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new party leader at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, and Hans Olav Syversen was elected to this position.|$|E

5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} as the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> {{during the early}} months of the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
5|$|Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> for the Democratic gubernatorial {{nomination}}, {{but after}} the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd also declined the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.|$|E
5|$|In early 1903, Harding {{announced}} he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by {{the withdrawal of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>candidate,</b> Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.|$|E

5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate,</b> Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
5|$|Steinholt {{started her}} {{political}} {{career as a}} member of Red Youth, and later became a member of its mother party, Red. In 2007 Steinholt was elected as Red Nordland's <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> in the local elections of 2007. Steinholt had a very short election campaign, but she managed to make several notable appearances. Steinholt focused on environmental issues during the campaign, and opposed the establishment of a petroleum plant in northern Norway. Under her leadership, Red Norddland received 2,956 votes, 3.0 percent of the votes, an increase of 0.9% from the previous local election in 2003. Red won another seat on the Nordland County Council during the election; Steinholt became the youngest member of the council.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ fared {{much better}} than the BZÖ in polls {{following}} the 2005 split, with the first tests in regional elections in Styria and Burgenland. On 23 April 2005 Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as new chairman of the FPÖ, taking over from interim leader Hilmar Kabas. As most of the party's office-seeking elite had gone over to the BZÖ, the FPÖ was again free from responsibility. Under Strache the party's ideology grew more radical, and it returned to its primary goal of vote-maximising. The FPÖ did reasonably well in October's Vienna election, in which Strache was the <b>leading</b> <b>candidate</b> and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a 14.9% share, while the BZÖ won just 1.2%.|$|E
