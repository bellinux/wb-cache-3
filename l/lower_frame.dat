Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view.

5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's <b>lower</b> <b>frame,</b> art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse {{engineering}} {{has determined}} that the Kinect's various sensors output video at a frame rate of ≈9Hz to 30Hz depending on resolution. The default RGB video stream uses 8-bit VGA resolution (640×480 pixels) with a Bayer color filter, but the hardware is capable of resolutions up to 1280x1024 (at a <b>lower</b> <b>frame</b> rate) and other colour formats such as UYVY. [...] The monochrome depth sensing video stream is in VGA resolution (640×480 pixels) with 11-bit depth, which provides 2,048 levels of sensitivity. [...] The Kinect can also stream the view from its IR camera directly (i.e.: before it has {{been converted into a}} depth map) as 640x480 video, or 1280x1024 at a <b>lower</b> <b>frame</b> rate. The Kinect sensor has a practical ranging limit of [...] distance when used with the Xbox software. The area required to play Kinect is roughly 6m2, although the sensor can maintain tracking through an extended range of approximately [...] The sensor has an angular field of view of 57° horizontally and 43° vertically, while the motorized pivot is capable of tilting the sensor up to 27° either up or down. The horizontal field of the Kinect sensor at the minimum viewing distance of ≈ is therefore ≈, and the vertical field is ≈, resulting in a resolution of just over [...] per pixel.

SubCompact Alpha and Standard Alpha models were introduced in late 2014/early 2015. All models have a DA/SA trigger, ambidextrous decocker and a TIAIN-coated steel slide. The Compacts are also available with threaded barrels. In the Compact size (7.40" [...] overall length) are the Black, Krypton and Sand lines, featuring hard anodized aluminum upper and <b>lower</b> <b>frames</b> (29.06-29.72 oz), and the Duo-Tone and Stainless Steel lines with all steel upper and <b>lower</b> <b>frames</b> (42.43-42.64 oz).

2500|$|Behind the scenes, the {{development}} of The Last Guardian was considered slow by Shuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide. Yoshida explained that the vision for The Last Guardian {{was based on a}} video prepared by Ueda to demonstrate the concepts and style of the game, a process Ueda had used for Ico, and Sony wanted to stay true to that vision. Team Ico, which is a small studio compared to other Sony studios in Japan or other Western developers, were struggling with achieving Ueda's vision for the game on the PlayStation 3 hardware. In 2015 Yoshida revealed that the previous 2009 trailer was [...] "specced up", running at a much <b>lower</b> <b>frame</b> rate on the PlayStation 3 and sped up for the presentation. Around 2011, Sony brought in many of their core development teams such as Santa Monica Studios to review the code and try to improve the performance. In 2012, with Sony preparing to announce the PlayStation 4 and still recognizing the sluggish development of the PlayStation 3 version of the game, it was decided to change the target platform to the PlayStation 4 so that Ueda's concept could be fully realized. Ueda stated that this choice was primarily Sony's decision, speculating that the PlayStation 3 version of the game at this point would still have been sufficient to convey his concept. Following the target platform switch, Ueda and other members of Team Ico were not as involved with the process, as other teams worked to take the highly customized PlayStation 3 code to adapt it to the PlayStation 4; this included the help of PlayStation 4 lead architect Mark Cerny. With the reintroduction of the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015, Yoshida explained that the game engine is now fully running at speed on the PlayStation 4 and that the remainder of {{the development}} lies with the game designers to complete.|$|E
60|$|As I {{go across}} a meadow {{directly}} toward a low rising ground this bright afternoon, I see, some fifty rods {{off toward the}} sun, {{the top of a}} Maple swamp just appearing over the sheeny russet edge of the hill, a stripe apparently twenty rods long by ten feet deep, of the most intensely brilliant scarlet, orange, and yellow, equal to any flowers or fruits, or any tints ever painted. As I advance, lowering the edge of the hill which makes the firm foreground or <b>lower</b> <b>frame</b> of the picture, the depth of the brilliant grove revealed steadily increases, suggesting that the whole of the inclosed valley is filled with such color. One wonders that the tithing-men and fathers of the town are not out to see what the trees mean by their high colors and exuberance of spirits, fearing that some mischief is brewing. I do not see what the Puritans did at this season, when the Maples blaze out in scarlet. They certainly could not have worshipped in groves then. Perhaps that is what they built meeting-houses and fenced them round with horse-sheds for.|$|E
