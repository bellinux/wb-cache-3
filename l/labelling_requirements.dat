500|$|The 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act removed {{international}} trade barriers and amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, designating the metric system as [...] "the Preferred system of {{weights and measures}} for United States trade and commerce". The legislation stated {{that the federal government}} has a responsibility to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries; the Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was cancelled by the 1998 highway bill TEA21. However, the US military uses the metric system widely, partly because of the need to work with armed services from other nations. Although overall responsibility for <b>labelling</b> <b>requirements</b> of consumer goods lies with Congress and is therefore covered by federal law, details of <b>labelling</b> <b>requirements</b> for certain commodities are controlled by state law or by other authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.|$|E
2500|$|Levying fines {{of up to}} $7000 per offence, Charter enforcers {{were widely}} {{labelled}} in the English media as the [...] "language police" [...] or [...] "tongue troopers". While the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) provides several warnings before resorting to legal sanctions, allegations that it has abused its powers has led to charges of racism and harassment. The OQLF took action against stores retailing imported kosher goods that did not meet its <b>labelling</b> <b>requirements,</b> an action perceived in the Jewish community as an unfair targeting that coincided with a high-profile case against the well-known Schwartz's delicatessen, the owner of which was subjected to failed legal action by the OQLF due to the apostrophe in his sign, which remains. In the mid 1980s, another delicatessen Dunn's got in trouble for having the English word, [...] "Smoked Meat" [...] on the sign out front. [...] The manager at the time stated that Parti Québécois MNA Gérald Godin himself ordered the sandwich by its name. Dunn's also fought a ruling to {{change the name of}} [...] "Smoked Meat" [...] to [...] "Boeuf Mariné" [...] in order to conform to Quebec Language Law. They won the ruling by appeal by proving that if they didn't advertise [...] "Smoked Meat" [...] they would confuse and anger customers. Due to the work of Myer Dunn, under the new ruling, enacted in 1987, Smoked meat became a word in both Official languages of Canada.In 2002, there were reported cases of harassment of allophone merchants who refused to speak French.|$|E
