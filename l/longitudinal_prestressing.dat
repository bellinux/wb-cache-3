40|$|Critical for {{the seismic}} safety of {{immersed}} tunnels is {{the magnitude of}} deformations developing in the segment joints, {{as a result of}} the combined longitudinal and lateral vibrations. Analysis and design against such vibrations is the main focus of this paper, with reference to a proposed 70 m-deep immersed tunnel in a highly seismic region, in Greece. The multisegment tunnel is modeled as a beam connected to the ground through properly calibrated interaction springs, dashpots, and sliders. Actual records of significant directivity-affected around motions, downscaled to 0. 24 g peak acceleration, form the basis of the basement excitation. Free-field acceleration time histories are computed from these records through one-dimensional wave propagation equivalent-linear and nonlinear analyses of parametrically different soil profiles along the tunnel; they are then applied as excitation at the support of the springs, with a suitable time lac, to conservatively approximate wave passage effects. The joints between the tunnel segments are modeled realistically with special nonlinear hyperelastic elements, while their <b>longitudinal</b> <b>prestressing</b> due to the great (7 bar) water pressure is also considered. Nonlinear dynamic transient analysis of the tunnel is performed without ignoring the inertia of the thick-walled tunnel, and the influence of segment length and joint properties is investigated parametrically. It is shown that despite ground excitation with acceleration levels exceeding 0. 50 g and velocity of about 80 cm/s at the base of the tunnel, net tension and excessive compression between the segments can be avoided with a suitable design of joint gaskets and a selection of relatively small segment lengths. Although this research was prompted by the needs of a specific project, the dynamic analysis methods, the proposed design concepts, and many of the conclusions of the study are sufficiently general and may apply in other immersed tunneling projects...|$|E
40|$|The Accelerated bridge {{construction}} (ABC) techniques are gaining popularity among {{the departments of}} transportation (DOTs) due to their reductions of on-site construction time and traffic delays. One ABC technique that utilizes precast deck panels has demonstrated some advantages over normal cast-in-place construction, but has also demonstrated some serviceability issues such as cracks and water leakage to the transverse joints. Some of these problems are addressed by applying <b>longitudinal</b> <b>prestressing.</b> This thesis evaluates the service and ultimate capacities in both flexure and shear, of the finite element models of the post-tensioned system currently used by Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) and a proposed curved-bolt system to confirm the experimental results. The panels were built and tested under negative moment in order to investigate a known problem, namely, tension in the deck concrete. Shear tests were performed on specimens with geometry designed to investigate the effects of high shear across the joint. The curved-bolt connection not only provides the necessary compressive stress across the transverse joint but also makes future replacement of a single deck panel possible without replacing the entire deck. Load-deflection, shear-deflection curves were obtained using the experimental tests and were used to compare with the values obtained from finite element analysis. In flexure, the ultimate load predicted by the finite element model was lower than the experimental ultimate load by 1 % for the post-tensioned connection and 3 % for the curved-bolt connection. The shear models predicted the ultimate shear reached, within 5 % of the experimental values. The cracking pattern also matched closely.

40|$|In the past, {{presented}} design-methods for {{the determining}} of the transverse force load-bearing capacity of reinforced concrete beams were only developed for single-span girders. For continuous beams {{the influence of}} the bending moment which occurs at the location of the greatest transverse force demand, has been previously insufficiently considered. A parameter study shows that infact most of these models underestimate the loadbearing capacity while some models overestimate them. The aim of the presented publication is the developing of a model for the determination of the transverse force loadbearing capacity of statically undetermined reinforced concrete beams. It is based on the model for single-span beams as published by Specht/Scholz, which describes the transverse force loadbearing capacity with the help of three elements: that of the conrete cross-section, the element of shear reinforcement and the element resulting from <b>longitudinal</b> <b>prestressing.</b> For the element of the concrete cross-section a new framework model has been derived, increasing the inclination of the strut to 35 angle at the intermediate support based on figures taken from crack patterns. After a new definition of the slenderness ratio, the resistance of the separate transverse force will be derived. The results of 86 shear tests taken from pre-published material have allowed the calibration of the formulae. Compared to models published up until now the new model shows a clear improvement of the accuracy of the prediction. The use of 5 untensioned reinforced or unbonded prestressed two-span beams made of microconcrete and tested at the TU Berlin served for checking the modified model. Finally, a design-method for the transverse force proof will be derived, based on the safety concept as stipulated in EC 2. A practical simplification allows the determination of the element of the concrete cross-section at intermediate supports by using the formulae from Specht/Scholz for single-span beams through multiplication with correction factors taken from diagrams.

40|$|Incremental bridge {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the many}} ways in which a bridge can be constructed. In The Netherlands this method is not often used. This may be explained by the fact, that there are not many suitable locations for application of this method. Incremental bridge launching is profitable for long bridges and can only be used for straight bridges or when the superstructure has a constant horizontal and vertical radius throughout the length. However, when the preconditions for use of this method are met, incremental bridge launching can be a great solution for bridge design. Ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is a new concrete. In contrast to regular reinforced concrete, UHPFRC contains fibers to provide for the capacity that is necessary when the concrete is loaded in tension. However, as for incrementally launched bridges, its application is limited as of yet. One explanation for the reluctance to use the material, is that compared to regular concrete, the cost of production are many times higher. To make economical designs using UHPFRC, the high cost of production need to be recovered by material savings, when a structure is executed or during its lifetime. The aim of this thesis is to identify whether a superstructure designed in UHPFRC can increase the application range of incremental bridge launching in The Netherlands, and to explore whether the concept can compete with other bridge designs. In order to make a statement, a case study approach is used. It concerns the launch of the eastern approach bridge of the bridge over “Het Pannerdensch Kanaal”, designed in UHPFRC. The location suits incremental bridge launching perfectly, as there is a constant horizontal and vertical curvature in the alignment for over 550 meters. The most favorable cross-section for incrementally launched bridges is a box girder. A comprehensive analysis on the cross-sectional capacity of a prestressed box girder, designed with different concrete strength classes, is performed to optimize the shape. The design of a box girder takes a special procedure, where both the transverse and longitudinal directions are considered separately. Transverse bending moments and shear forces, due to mobile loading, are obtained with influence surfaces and the differential equation of the Euler-Bernoulli bending beam. For the longitudinal direction, a spreadsheet is developed to identify the bending moments and shear forces that occur during launch and service life. The force method for analysis of indeterminate structures is used to determine the governing bending moments for this multiple span bridge. Also, the sheet contains parts to determine the required amount of central and continuity prestressing and to optimize the length of the steel nose to reduce the peak moments during launch. The use of UHPFRC in the design of a structure requires a special approach. Requirements regarding quality control are strict and need to be prescribed to allow on-site production. The typical characteristics of UHPFRC have an important impact on the execution and production cycle of the incrementally launched bridge, which is therefore investigated. The case study is used to investigate the competitiveness of the design. Cost of production and execution are integrated into a price per cubic meter of concrete and compared to the design of The Zeeburgerbrug, which was launched and built with regular concrete. Efficient use of UHPFRC allows a light box girder design, which can be launched without auxiliary supports. Conventional and shear reinforcement are not necessary. Transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>prestressing</b> provide sufficient bending moment capacity, while the fibers contribute to a huge shear capacity that is more than enough to withstand the shear forces. The required amount of central and continuity prestressing does not fit in the concrete cross-section. Therefore, all tendons are applied externally. The anchors and deviators will not fit in the concrete cross-section either. The cost comparison shows, that a lot of the higher cost of production of UHPFRC can already be compensated during the design and construction phases. The remaining part of the higher cost of production of UHPFRC need to be compensated differently, for instance by savings in maintenance cost due to better durability properties or by a lighter substructure, as we are able to generate proper savings in the amount of concrete for the superstructure. The case study proves that when the superstructure is considered only, it might be hard to design and execute the UHPFRC box girder more economically than the design of The Zeeburgerbrug. However, when we consider the total bridge over the entire service life, we might have a competitive design. Alternative bridge designs, that use different construction techniques should be developed to assess the competitiveness of the incrementally launched UHPFRC box girder for that location.

30|$|Based on {{previous}} {{developments of the}} STA, namely the incorporation of a variable angle for {{the direction of the}} principal compressive stresses for concrete, Hsu and Mo (1985 a, b) proposed the Variable Angle Truss Model (VATM). This model aimed to unify the torsional design of beams with small and large cross sections, as well as RC beams and beams with <b>longitudinal</b> and uniform <b>prestress,</b> that is, prestressed concrete (PC) beams. In the VATM, the conventional stress (σ)–strain (ε) relationship for uniaxial compressive concrete was substituted by a smeared softened σ–ε relationship to account for the softening effect (influence of the diagonal cracks due to the perpendicular tensile stresses). VATM proved to give good results for the ultimate torsional behavior of RC and PC beams (Hsu and Mo 1985 a, b). This is because VATM neglects the concrete tensile strength and also the influence of the concrete core for plain beams, so this model approaches the real model only for high loading stages (Hsu and Mo 1985 a, b; Bernardo et al. 2012 a). Further studies also shown that the σ–ε relationships used to simulate the behavior of the materials constitute also a very important factor for VATM to be able to provide accurate predictions for high loading stages, both for RC and PC beams under torsion (Bernardo et al. 2012 a; Bernardo and Andrade 2017).|$|R

However, not all the collected beams can be considered trustworthy for {{the comparative}} analysis focused on their global behavior (not only for the resistance torque).

When compared with the theoretical results from the GSVATM, the PC beams from Wafa et al.

This probably explains why some authors did not consider these PC beams in their comparative analysis, for instance Jeng et al. (2010). For this reason, in this study the PC beams from Wafa et al. (1995) will not be used for comparative analysis with respect to the twists, but only with the torsional moments.|$|R
