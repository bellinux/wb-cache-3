Methods: 40 Subjects with active myofascial trigger points in trapezius were selected for this study. Pain intensity was assessed using Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Pressure Pain Threshold of trigger points by pressure algometer.

40|$|Queenright Apis mellifera capensis colonies exhibit egg <b>laying</b> <b>by</b> {{workers in}} periods of both {{low and high}} egg removal. To {{reproduce}} workers should lay in times of low egg removal to increase survival of their eggs. Were this so, a negative correlation between egg laying and removal would be expected. Egg removal rates for queen (N= 240) and worker-laid (N= 240) eggs and egg <b>laying</b> <b>by</b> workers were tested in queenright colonies. Worker-laid eggs were removed significantly faster than queen-laid eggs; but significant differences in egg <b>laying</b> <b>by</b> workers occurred among colonies. Egg laying and removal are positively correlated and co-dependent. Egg removal appears triggered {{by the number of}} worker-laid eggs. Intercolonial variation for laying worker egg number and egg removal rates may explain the phenotypic variation in worker reproduction in queenright Cape honeybee colonies...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of TRB 3 (tribbles 3), an apoptosis regulated gene, increases during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. How mechanical stress affects {{the regulation of}} TRB 3 in cardiomyocytes during apoptosis is not fully understood. An in vivo model of aorta-caval shunt in adult rats demonstrated the increased TRB 3 protein expression in the myocardium. The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist etanercept reversed the TRB 3 protein expression and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by AV shunt. An in vitro model of cyclic stretch in neonatal rats was also used to investigate TRB 3 expression. We hypothesized that cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced <b>by</b> cyclic <b>stretch</b> is TRB 3 dependent. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes grown on a flexible membrane base were <b>stretched</b> <b>by</b> vacuum to 20 % of maximum elongation, at 60 cycles/min. Cyclic stretch significantly increased TRB 3 protein and mRNA expression. Addition of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP 600125, TNF-α antibody and etanercept 30 min before stretch reversed the induction of TRB 3 protein induced <b>by</b> <b>stretch.</b> Cyclic stretch induced the DNA-binding activity of growth arrest and DNA damaged inducible gene- 153 (GADD 153) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. SP 600125, JNK siRNA, TNF-α antibody and etanercept abolished the binding activity induced <b>by</b> <b>stretch.</b> TRB 3 promoter activity was enhanced <b>by</b> <b>stretch</b> and TRB 3 -mut plasmid, SP 600125, TNF-α antibody and etanercept attenuated TRB 3 promoter activity induced <b>by</b> <b>stretch.</b> Exogenous administration of TNF-α recombinant protein to the non-stretched cardiomyocytes increased TRB 3 protein expression similar to that seen after stretch. Cyclic stretch induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is inhibited by TRB 3 siRNA and etanercept. The stretch-induced TRB 3 is mediated by TNF-α、JNK and GADD 153 pathway. These results indicate that TRB 3 {{plays an important role}} in stretch-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis...|$|R
