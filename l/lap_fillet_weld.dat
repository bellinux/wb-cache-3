40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have gained}} {{increased}} attention {{in recent years in}} automotive, electronics, and medical industry. This because of magnesium alloys have better properties than aluminum alloys and steels in respects of their low density and high strength to weight ratio. However, the main problems of magnesium alloy welding are the crack formation and the appearance of porosity during the solidification. This paper proposes a unique technique to weld two thin sheets of AZ 31 B magnesium alloy using a paste containing Ag nanoparticles. The paste containing Ag nanoparticles of 5 nm in average diameter and an organic solvent was used to coat the surface of AZ 31 B thin sheet. The coated sheet was heated at 100 °C for 60 s to evaporate the solvent. The dried sheet was set as a lower AZ 31 B sheet on the jig, and then <b>lap</b> <b>fillet</b> <b>welding</b> was carried out by using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser in a closed box filled with argon gas...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{arc welding}} {{processes}} {{are difficult to}} use to join thin sheet magnesium alloy because {{of the necessity of}} high energy input, which in turn leads to various problems such as burn through and distortion. Alternatively, laser welding can resolve these problems because of lower heat input and smaller spot size compared to conventional welding. Even when using laser welding, it is difficult to weld thin magnesium sheets with a thickness of less than 1 mm; cut, melt through and cracks tend to occur due to the evaporation of molten metal and high solidification rate. In this study, an attempt has been made to <b>lap</b> <b>fillet</b> <b>welding</b> of thin sheet magnesium alloy AZ 31 B with a thickness of 0. 3 mm using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam in a conduction mode. This paper investigates the occurrence of defects in the <b>lap</b> <b>fillet</b> joint of AZ 31 B magnesium alloys. Defects such as void and cracks were observed at the weld root. A void at the root occurred because of lack of fusion due to insufficient melting of the lower sheet. The void was reduced by grinding the metal surface to eliminate the oxide layer. Cracks generated in large grain areas initiated from the void at the root. A higher scan speed significantly improves the defect behaviour because of generating a narrow large grain area and wider fine grain area. Macropore-free weld was obtained in this laser welding research, and smaller amount of micropores than the base metal can be attained...|$|R

However, thermal joining of steel and aluminum is still being researched, due to a limited solubility of the binary system of iron and aluminum causing the formation of hard and brittle intermetallic phases, which decrease the strength and the formability of the dissimilar seam.

Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various wire feed speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the wire feed speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The wire feed speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding wire feed speed should increase as well. On the other hand, {{it is clear that}} the maximum value of the objective function has decreased.

Radiography is not an option, a. o. because of the thickness variations. The weld’s complex, varying geometry prevents a reliable volumetric ultrasonic inspection. N. V.

Thus, understanding the behavior of <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> under various types of loading is important, and numerical simulations can provide increased insight into this topic. This paper concerns finite element simulations of previous quasi-static and dynamic (impact) tests on <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> The test specimens employed were structural steel components joined by either longitudinally or transversely oriented <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> In the simulations, the material of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> was modeled using a shear-modified Gurson model, which accounts for material softening in both low and high stress triaxiality regimes. Additionally, strain rate and temperature dependencies were incorporated in the material model with a modified Johnson–Cook constitutive relation for the matrix material. Several types of material tests were conducted to identify the parameters entering the material model. For the quasi-static component tests and simulations, a good agreement was observed {{in terms of both}} force–deformation curves and failure mechanisms. The simulations of the dynamic tests predicted appreciably higher force levels and weld deformations at failure than those obtained in the corresponding experiments. A parameter study showed that these discrepancies may partly be due to inaccurate values used for the material parameters related to strain-rate hardening and thermal softening. Finally, a comparison was made between simulations with the shear-modified Gurson model and a simpler material model that does not account for void-induced softening. The simpler model employed the Cockcroft–Latham failure criterion, uncoupled from the constitutive relations. This model was unable to capture the response of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> to the same extent as the shear-modified Gurson model...|$|R
