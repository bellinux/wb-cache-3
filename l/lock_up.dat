5|$|Following the tour, Wright {{left the}} group {{to work on the}} {{upcoming}} Dio album <b>Lock</b> <b>Up</b> the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before the law to be punished. Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} the door is 13th-century, while the dividing wall including the door is 18th-century.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when {{a bad case of}} food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship with a total of five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the debates}} {{leading up to}} World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued to <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{following}} the break-up {{of the band}} <b>Lock</b> <b>Up</b> featuring guitarist Tom Morello, the band's drummer, Jon Knox, encouraged Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello. Tom soon called Brad Wilk, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for <b>Lock</b> <b>Up.</b> This line-up went on to form Rage Against the Machine. After frequenting the L.A. club circuit, Rage Against the Machine signed a record deal with Epic Records in 1992. That same year, the band released their self-titled debut. They achieved a phenomenal amount of mainstream success and released three more studio albums.|$|E

25|$|Very loose {{surfaces}} (such as {{gravel and}} loose dirt): In some loose-surface situations, {{it may be}} beneficial to completely <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> the rear wheel in order to slow down or maintain control. On very steep slopes with loose surfaces where any braking will cause the wheel to skid, it can be better to maintain control of the bicycle by the rear-brake more than one would normally. However neither wheel should stop rotating completely, as this will result in very little control.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the early 1970s, the issue of race began to {{dominate}} all others and the regime started to repress its white opponents. By 1975, although officially democratic, the regime had started to <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> even peaceful opponents of white domination. Black Rhodesians regarded their legal situation as morally unjustifiable and wanted full equality. From August 1964 to December 1974, Robert Mugabe was imprisoned without trial. Although legal, it was emblematic of a regime that disregarded human rights as part of its fight against terrorism.|$|E

25|$|The ABS {{controller}} {{knows that}} such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very quickly, before the tire can actually significantly change speed. The {{result is that the}} tire slows down {{at the same rate as}} the car, with the brakes keeping the tires very near the point at which they will start to <b>lock</b> <b>up.</b> This gives the system maximum braking power.|$|E
