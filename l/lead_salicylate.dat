5000|$|Catalysts. Propellant {{formulas}} {{often require}} a catalyst to burn {{faster and more}} stably. Transition metal ions and complexes tend to be used. Certain oxidizers often serve as catalysts. E.g. ammonium dichromate {{is used as a}} catalyst in ammonium nitrate based propellant formulas. Other catalysts are e.g. iron(III) oxide, hydrated ferric oxide, manganese dioxide, potassium dichromate, copper chromite, <b>lead</b> <b>salicylate,</b> lead stearate, lead 2-ethylhexoate, copper salicylate, copper stearate, lithium fluoride, n-butyl ferrocene, di-n-butyl ferrocene.|$|E

In patients presenting with an acute overdose, a 16% morbidity rate and a 1% mortality rate are observed.|$|R
40|$|Growth of Staphylococcus aureus {{with the}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} salicylate reduces susceptibility {{of the organism}} to multiple antimicrobials. Transcriptome analysis revealed that growth of S. aureus with <b>salicylate</b> <b>leads</b> to the induction of genes involved with gluconate and formate metabolism and represses genes required for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. In addition, salicylate induction upregulates two antibiotic target genes and downregulates a multidrug efflux pump gene repressor (mgrA) and sarR, which represses a gene (sarA) important for intrinsic antimicrobial resistance. We hypothesize that these salicylate-induced alterations jointly represent a unique mechanism that allows S. aureus to resist antimicrobial stress and toxicity...|$|R
