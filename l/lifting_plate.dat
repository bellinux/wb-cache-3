50|$|Between 1997 and 2001, there {{systematic}} {{changes to}} the buildings interiors, that included the substitution of the electrical systems, {{the construction of new}} washrooms on all floors, the substitution of water supply, security and fire protection systems, the repair of the roof, recuperation of the dressing rooms on five floors and the elaboration of a new aesthetic with the building. Moving and scenic lighting equipment were upgraded, the heating network was recovered and improved, an electronic subtitling system (with simultaneous translation in two languages) and an electronic ticket office were installed. The auditorium was completely rebuilt to improve the acoustics and the visibility of the spectators, while a warehouse was built under the auditorium. A second orchestra pit and a new circus track were installed on a 13 m hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} {{a sandwich}} <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> for cargo trucks {{in order to}} propose an option for existing lift platforms in aluminium or steel. The wish {{is to make it}} lighter but not less stiff or weak. Two different cores in Divinycell with different density; H 130 and H 250 is examined. Calculations are made with respect to deflection and max stress in both core and faces for the whole plates. But also more local calculations are performed to see how the faces and core behaved on local point loads from pallet lift wheels. The analytical results successfully meet the deflection requirements causing only 30 mm deflection in the worst scenario with 33 % overload on a <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> built up by 3 mm aluminium faces and H 130 Divinycell core measuring a total (incl. faces) 20 mm thickness in the top. Nor did the von Mises stresses exceed 50 % of ultimate strength for the aluminium parts or the Divinycell core. The choice between the lighter (H 130) and heavier (H 250) core only appears to affect the deflection 1 - 2 mm and the von Mises face stress for point loads are in the order of 10 MPa. The objective regarding the mass of the <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> was not met. This is however a matter of further optimisation and is considered to be solved...|$|R

The inside of the mill is lined with <b>lifting</b> <b>plates</b> to <b>lift</b> the material inside the mill, where it then falls off the plates onto {{the rest of the}} ore charge.

40|$|Abstract — Boom or tower type crane consist hook {{facility}} to lift or move material {{and it is}} more flexibility than simple beam type horizontally established gantry crane. In this crane, beam is lifted by means of wire rope, link or chain to the distal end of boom and material can be lift by means of wire rope with lifting point. Beam is directly suspended using wire ropes and its move by boom crane. Wire ropes are fitted with lugs which are directly welded to the horizontally suspended beam for lifting material or objects. Generally, Beams are used to move slender materials specifically say slender plate as one industry application. Slender plate type objects are flexible in nature so, it may be sag or bend {{during a time of}} lifting because of only two lifting lug are generally used. Moreover, fixed size of beam is used for a single application of <b>lifting</b> <b>plate</b> so; this is a limitation of a beam, and in major cases it requires changing as application changes. On the other hand, due to two lifting point on a beam plate may be band or sag so it’s require to solve two problem simultaneously. Also it is not solution to simply weld more number of lifting points say lug to beam, but need of specific and optimum design is requirement which is detail describe in this paper...|$|E
50|$|An {{optional}} feature offered by Bowler was a lift device that could lift the vehicle past the lowest travel {{of the front}} and rear suspension. The lift was intended to be used to assist in digging the vehicle out of soft ground or to facilitate changing a wheel. The lift device consisted of a large steel plate on a hinged sub-frame attached to the underside of the vehicle frame between {{the front and rear}} axles. The lift was lowered by a hydraulic ram that was controlled from inside the vehicle. The <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> also served to protect the underside of vehicle when raised.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe helium cooled magnets of the LHC {{particle}} accelerator are {{installed in a}} confined space, formed by a 27 km circumference 3. 8 m diameter underground tunnel. The vacuum enclosures of the superconducting LHC magnets are protected by a <b>lift</b> <b>plate</b> against excessive overpressure created by eventual leaks from the magnet helium bath, or from the helium supply headers. A three-meter long no stay zone has been defined centered to these plates, based on earlier scale model studies, to protect the personnel against the consequences of an eventual opening of such a <b>lift</b> <b>plate.</b> More recently several simulation studies {{have been carried out}} modelling the propagation of the resulting helium/air mixture along the tunnel in case of such a cold helium release at a rate in the range of 1 kg/s. To validate the different scale models and simulation studies, real life mock-up tests have been performed in the LHC, releasing about 1000 liter of liquid helium under standard operational tunnel conditions. Data recorded during these tests include oxygen level, temperature and flow speed as well as video recordings, taken up- and downstream of the spill point (- 100 m to + 200 m) with respect to the ventilation direction in the LHC tunnel. The experimental set-up and measurement results are presented. Generic effects found during the tests will be discussed to allow the transposal to possible cold helium release cases in similar facilities...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to Smith {{and the other}} eleven {{who claimed to be}} witnesses, a few other early Mormons said they saw the plates.

Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother William and younger sister Katharine also said they had examined and <b>lifted</b> the <b>plates</b> while they were wrapped in fabric. Others said they had visions of the plates or had been shown the plates by an angel, in some cases years after Smith said he had returned the plates.|$|R

5000|$|Different people {{estimated}} {{the weight of}} the plates differently. According to Smith's one-time-friend Willard Chase, Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between 40 and 60 pounds (18-27 kg), most likely the latter. Smith's father Joseph Smith, Sr., {{who was one of the}} Eight Witnesses, reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they [...] "weighed thirty pounds" [...] (14 kg). Smith's brother William, who had <b>lifted</b> the <b>plates,</b> thought they [...] "weighed about sixty pounds kg according to the best of my judgment". Others who <b>lifted</b> the <b>plates</b> while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about 60 pounds kg. Martin Harris said that he had [...] "hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds kg". Smith's wife Emma never {{estimated the}} weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to [...] "move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work". None of the witnesses specified the exact size of the plates or the number of leaves contained in them, but one scholar speculates that, had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds (64 kg), while LDS writers have speculated that the plates were made of a copper-gold alloy like tumbaga, which would have weighed significantly less.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} move the 800 lb. copper plates {{that make up the}} O. H. modules a vacuum lifting device has been made that will <b>lift</b> the <b>plates</b> safely. The purpose of this report is to provide {{documentation}} for the structural integrity of the system {{and to make sure that}} it passes all of the safety requirements that have been established for a system of this nature. The vacuum system is composed of a PIAB model M 125 vacuum pump that has the pumping capacity of 27 in. Hg. This pump will produce vacuum for three 8 1 / 2 in. diameter suction cups or pads. A pressure gauge is fixed on the unit to allow the operator to continually monitor the pressure during all lifts. An additional safety feature is a mechanical vacuum monitoring device that is set to emit a shrill tone if the system vacuum falls below 24 in. Hg. A 'bleed' valve fixed on the unit will be used to let the system go to atmospheric pressure once the lift is complete. A 3 psi. check valve and a vacuum reserve of 384 in. is used to insure that the device will not just drop the object if the pump fails. A schematic for the pumping system is given in Figure 1...|$|R
