40|$|Cephalopods (nautiluses, cuttlefishes, squids and octopuses) exhibit direct {{development}} and display two major developmental modes: planktonic and benthic. Planktonic hatchlings {{are small and}} go through some degree of morphological changes during the planktonic phase, which can last from days to months, with ocean currents enhancing their dispersal capacity. Benthic hatchlings are usually large, miniature-like adults and have comparatively reduced dispersal potential. We {{examined the relationship between}} early developmental mode, hatchling size and species latitudinal distribution range of 110 species hatched in the laboratory, which represent 13 % {{of the total number of}} <b>live</b> <b>cephalopod</b> species described to date. Results showed that species with planktonic hatchlings reach broader distributional ranges in comparison with species with benthic hatchlings. In addition, squids and octopods follow an inverse relationship between hatchling size and species latitudinal distribution. In both groups, species with smaller hatchlings have broader latitudinal distribution ranges. Thus, squid and octopod species with larger hatchlings have latitudinal distributions of comparatively minor extension. This pattern also emerges when all species are grouped by genus (n = 41), but was not detected for cuttlefishes, a group composed mainly of species with large and benthic hatchlings. However, when hatchling size was compared to adult size, it was observed that the smaller the hatchlings, the broader the latitudinal distributional range of the species for cuttlefishes, squids and octopuses. This was also valid for all cephalopod species with benthic hatchlings pooled together. Hatchling size and associated developmental mode and dispersal potential seem to be main influential factors in determining the distributional range of cephalopods...|$|R
40|$|Octopus vulgaris is {{a species}} of great {{interest}} in research areas such as neurobiology, ethology, and ecology but also a candidate species for aquaculture as a food resource and for alleviating the fishing pressure on its wild populations. This study aimed to characterize the predatory behavior of O. vulgaris paralarvae and to quantify their digestive activity. Those processes were affordable using the video-recording analysis of 3 days post-hatching (dph), mantle-transparent paralarvae feeding on 18 types of live zooplanktonic prey. We show {{for the first time}} in a <b>live</b> <b>cephalopod</b> that octopus paralarvae attack, immobilize, drill, and ingest live cladocerans and copepods with 100 % efficiency, which decreases dramatically to 60 % on decapod prey (Pisidia longicornis). The majority (85 %) of successful attacks targeted the prey cephalothorax while unsuccessful attacks either targeted the dorsal cephalothorax or involved prey defensive strategies (e. g., juvenile crab megalopae) or prey protected by thick carapaces (e. g., gammaridae amphipods). After immobilization, the beak, the buccal mass and the radula were involved in exoskeleton penetration and content ingestion. Ingestion time of prey content was rapid for copepods and cladocerans (73. 13 ± 23. 34 s) but much slower for decapod zoeae and euphausiids (152. 49 ± 29. 40 s). Total contact time with prey was always < 5 min. Contrary to the conventional view of crop filling dynamics observed in adult O. vulgaris, food accumulated first in the stomach of paralarvae and the crop filled after the stomach volume plateaued. Peristaltic crop contractions (~ 18 /min) moved food into the stomach (contractions ~ 30 /min) from where it passed to the caecum. Pigmented food particles were seen to enter the digestive gland, 312 ± 32 s after the crop reached its maximum volume. Digestive tract contents passed into the terminal intestine by peristalsis (contraction frequency ~ 50 /min) and defaecation was accompanied by an increased frequency of mantle contractions. Current results provide novel insights into both, O. vulgaris paralarvae—live prey capture strategies and the physiological mechanisms following ingestion, providing key information required to develop an effective rearing protocol for O. vulgaris paralarvae...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is {{to fill the gap}} {{regarding}} the potential of cephalopods to affect community structure and function in the sea, giving a neuroecological view of the reproductive behaviour of Octopus vulgaris. Cephalopods are known for their ability to learn, memorize and show sophisticated behaviours in the wild when enacting strategies of predation, defence and reproduction. Furthermore they change colour pattern and texture quickly due to the presence of chromatophores controlled directly by the nervous system. Their boneless bodies, inspired the creation of a soft-bodied robot. They sleep, show a “personality” and the ability to use tools in the wild. Octopuses, in particular, show adaptive behaviours implying the existence of a “consciousness” and appear to perceive the pain; properties that strongly contribute to shaping of their behaviour in the sea. This results in the inclusion of all the species of living cephalopods, in the EU Directive covering the “protection of Animals used for scientific purposes” (1 st January, 2013). Attention to the capabilities of these “advanced invertebrates” has been developed, for more than 100 years through behavioural and neurophysiological investigations. The majority of these studies have been conducted on Loligo vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Octopus vulgaris, which are considered to be good animal models by neuroethologists. The <b>cephalopods</b> <b>live</b> in all oceans of the world {{with the exception of the}} Black Sea, spreading from the surface waters down into the deep sea and occupying a wide range of ecological niches. Even though they are the smallest class of the phylum Mollusca, because of their wide distribution they play an important role in the community organization and function of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Much of the language that regulates life of the sea consists of chemical cues. These chemical signals determine feeding, habitat and mating choice. Some cephalopods show social behaviour exclusively during reproduction. The reproductive behaviour of Octopus vulgaris is under the control of a complex set of signal molecules such as sex steroids, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters that guide the behaviour from the level of individuals in evaluating mates, to stimulating or deterring copulation, to sperm-egg chemical signalling that promotes fertilization. These signals are intercepted by the olfactory organs and integrated in the olfactory lobes in the central nervous system. The olfactory organ plays a key role in the development of the switch in behaviour from growth to reproduction. In this context we propose a model in which the olfactory organ of Octopus vulgaris and the olfactory lobe could represent the on-off switch between food intake and reproduction...|$|R
