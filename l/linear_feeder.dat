40|$|Development of a {{vibration}} feeder was performed as one {{application of a}} vibratory machine with a self-contained vibration-reducing function by means of interference of transmissive force. The most important conditions for a vibration proof of a vibratory machine are compatibility of functions which oppose each other, reduction of transmissive force on the machine base and amplification of vibration on the body. This study deals with application of the proposed design to the feeder. The machine consists of coupling {{of a pair of}} one-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system. An excitation spring is devided {{as a part of a}} coupling spring for generation of excitation force on the two bodies. One end of the spring is excited by harmonic displacement with a reciprocating mechanism such as a crank. In this paper, we present vibration characteristics with full consideration of transmissive force and the optimum design procedure of the system. The transmissive force is reduced by 30 dB in the <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> which is excited by the excitation spring in the first trial...|$|E
40|$|The study {{objectives}} were {{to determine the}} effect of feeder space allowance on nursery pig performance, and {{to determine the effect}} of the same feeder space allowance in combination with varying DDGS inclusion levels on finishing pig performance, carcass characteristics, and nutrient digestibility. These studies were carried out on the same group of pigs within a commercial wean-finish system. For the nursery phase, a completely randomized design was used to compare 3 feeder space allowance treatments (2. 1, 2. 5, 2. 9 cm/pig). Pigs (n = 3, 720) were randomly allotted to same sex pens (10 feeders /treatment) of 62 pigs/pen. Thirty 7 -hole double sided feeders were utilized in the study. Differing <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> space treatments were established by blocking off feeder sections for both studies. All pigs had equal floor space (0. 85 m²/pig). In the grow-finish phase, a total of 60 pens (n = 1, 860 pigs) were utilized in a 2 х 3 factorial design with 3 feeder space allowances (4. 1, 4. 9, or 5. 7 cm/pig) and 2 dietary DDGS treatments (D 30 and D 60).

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{designed}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of different feeding systems {{on the behavior of}} local Rohilkhandi kids. Materials and Methods: A total of 21 growing goats (local goat of Rohilkhand region), weighing around 7 - 11 kg and aging 4 - 5 months, were used. These animals were kept in three groups. Group I was fed un-chopped green fodder in circular feeder (newly designed). Group II was fed un-chopped green fodder in <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> that was similar to the existing farm practice. Group III was fed chopped green fodder in <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> (modified version). Amount of concentrate and dry fodder fed was kept constant for all the three groups subject to equal increment in accordance with their increasing age. Adlibitum green fodder was made available to the animals. The experiment was conducted for 3 months. On-going behavior was recorded each day 4 h (2 h in the morning from 9 : 00 am to 11 : 00 am, after offering the feed, and same was repeated for 2 h in the afternoon, i. e., from 2 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 pm) was made between 9 am and 5 pm. The individual behaviors, viz., feeding, drinking, lying down, ruminating, idling, butting, pressing, pushing, frontal clashing, and physical displacement at feed barrier (active and passive: Without physical contact) of the goat were recorded using time-sampling method. Further, incidental activities such as defecation and urination were also recorded. Results: Among all the groups, butting, head to head, and pushing were the common agonistic behavior found but values did not differ significantly. The pushing while feeding was relatively less in Group II (0. 22 ± 0. 04 min) which differed significantly (p< 0. 05) from the other two groups. The idling time was found significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in Group II (1. 68 ± 0. 21) as compared to Group I (4. 67 ± 0. 52) and Group III (4. 27 ± 0. 56). Time spent in rumination near the feeding trough as well as away from the feeding trough was also significantly higher in Group I (p< 0. 05) than the other two groups. Other minor activities, viz., defecation and urination were negligible. No stereotypic activities were observed. Conclusion: It was concluded that provision of un-chopped fodder in circular feeder could only simulate natural feeding behavior of goat but did not give any added advantage. Further, feeding chopped fodder in linear feeding trough lead to increased consumption and more time is spent on feeding than on agonistic behavior as compared to the other two groups...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Late Mesozoic magmatic {{province}} is {{a prominent}} {{feature of the}} South China block (SCB). However, the tectonic regimes associated with the magmatism are still elusive. A combined anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and gravity study {{has been carried out}} to determine the fabric patterns and shape at depth of the Dayunshan–Mufushan composite batholith in the north-central SCB. This is a companion paper to Part 1 that presented the structural and geochronological data of this batholith. The magnetic fabrics in the batholith interior predominantly reflect magma flow structures. Two distinct patterns of the magnetic lineations are defined, around NNE–SSW and WNW–ESE trends for the early-stage and late-stage intrusions of the batholith, respectively. The gravity survey reveals that the early-stage intrusion has a main feeder zone located below its northern part while several <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> zones trending NNE–SSW are inferred for the late-stage intrusion. Integrating all results, a two-stage construction of the batholith with distinct tectonic regimes has been established. It is concluded that the early-stage intrusion experienced a southward magma transport during its emplacement, partially assisted by far-field compression from the north at ca. 150 Ma. Conversely, the emplacement and exhumation of the late-stage intrusion was accommodated by a NW–SE crustal stretching involving a lateral magma expansion above the multiple feeder zones (likely corresponding to extensional fractures) and ductile shearing during 132 – 95 Ma localized mainly along the Dayunshan detachment fault. Finally, we discuss the geodynamic linkage between the Paleo-Pacific subduction and the Late Mesozoic tectono-magmatism in the SCB...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> connecting multiple distributed loads and generators to the sub-station. Voltage is controlled {{directly at the}} sub-station, however, voltage down the line shifts up or down, in particular depending on if the feeder operates in the power export regime or power import regime. Starting from this finite element description of the feeder, assuming that the consumption/generation is distributed heterogeneously along the feeder, and following the asymptotic homogenization approach, we derive simple low-parametric ODE model of the feeder. We also explain how the homogeneous ODE modeling is generalized to account for other distributed effects, e. g. for inverter based and voltage dependent control of reactive power. The resulting system of the DistFlow-ODEs, relating homogenized voltage to flows of real and reactive power along the lines, admits computationally efficient analysis {{in terms of the}} minimal number of the feeder line “media ” parameters, such as the ratio of the inductance-to-resistance densities. Exploring the space of the media and control parameters allows us to test and juxtapose different measures of the system performance, in particular expressed in terms of the voltage drop along the feeder, power import/export from the feeder line as the whole, power losses within the feeder, and critical (with respect to possible voltage collapse) length of the feeder. Our most surprising funding relates to performance of a feeder rich on PhotoVoltaic (PV) systems during a sunny day. We observe that if the feeder is sufficiently long the DistFlow-ODEs may have multiple stable solutions. The multiplicity may mean troubles for successful recovery of the feeder after a very short, few periods long, fault {{at the head of the}} line. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{vibratory}} feeders ensuring effective product feeding is particularly demanding since {{the flexibility of}} the device components severely affects the dynamic response. Traditional design approaches are based on expensive and time-consuming trial and error iterations, which include building and testing tentative devices. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel systematic approach for designing <b>linear</b> vibratory <b>feeders,</b> based on an inverse dynamic structural modification approach. After synthesising a reduced-order model, the design is cast as an inverse eigenvalue problem and solved numerically through the minimization of a convex quadratic function. Constraints on the design variables, i. e. inertial and elastic parameters, are represented through a convex domain and included in the optimization problem. The numerical and experimental results obtained prove the effectiveness of the method and its ease of application, that make is suitable for both the design of new feeders and the optimization of existing one...|$|R
40|$|The Dooley Rhyolite Breccia in {{northeast}} Oregon was erupted between 12 and 16 million years ago, from central vents and <b>linear</b> <b>feeder</b> dikes within the Dooley Mountain quadrangle. The peraluminous, high-silica rhyolites {{of the formation}} were erupted over an irregular highland of eroded pre-Tertiary metamorphic rocks locally overlain by intracanyon, Eocene Clarno-type basalt flow(s). The Dooley Rhyolite Braccia is exposed in a tectonically disrupted, north-south trending graben across the Elkhorn Range. The formation is variable in thickness with maximum thickness exceeding 660 meters {{in the south and}} 600 meters in the north half of the quadrangle. Volumetrically the formation is dominated by block lava flows with lessor associated volcaniclastic and pyroclastic rocks. Although initial and waning phases of eruption of the formation produced ash-flow tuffs which extend well beyond the quadrangle boundaries, volcanism within the quadrangle appears to have been primarily effusive. At least nine geochemically distinct rhyolite subunits belonging to four related chemical groups have been identified in the formation stratigraphy which appear to represent unique eruptive episodes. Chronologic geochemical patterns within the formation are consistent with a petrogenetic model of repeated partial melting and eruption from multiple silicic magma chambers in an attenuated continental crust. Basalts correlative with the Powder River Basalt and the Strawberry Volcanics overlie the Dooley Rhyolite Braccia on the north flank of Dooley Mountain. Cale-alkaline basalts correlative with the Strawberry Volcanics are overlain by thoeliitic basalts of uncertain affinity on the south flank of the mountain. These basalt flows on respective flanks of the mountain were not continuous across the quadrangle. Rhyolitic volcanism in the Dooley Mountain quadrangle is contemporary with the strawberry Volcanics and the Picture Gorge Basalt of the Columbia River Basalt Group...|$|E
40|$|The {{mathematical}} model {{for evaluating the}} dynamic behavior of <b>linear</b> vibratory <b>feeders</b> is presented and discussed. The model {{is based on the}} Eksergian's equation of motion, with the aim at taking into account the effects of the main design parameters without unnecessarily increasing the complexity of the model. Deep emphasis is given to the procedure for the estimation of the external excitations applied to the driveline by proposing two procedures. The first one gives birth to a transcendent equation system, while the second procedure, based on more restrictive hypotheses regarding the geometry of the feeder, leads to a linear system. A dedicated experimental campaign for characterizing the dynamic behavior of a real machine is conducted under different operational conditions. Measured data are compared with simulated results obtained by applying both models; the experimental validation highlights the satisfactory quality of the model estimation, both in terms of torsional oscillations of the driveline and the global frame vibrations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss a <b>linear</b> {{vibratory}} part <b>feeder</b> for handling brake liners, typical sector-shaped components. Part feeders have been used in the industries for a long time to present the parts in a desired orientation. Berretty et al. (1999) discussed a class of mechanical filters that are capable of removing polygonal sections from the track of the feeder which are referred to as traps. The traps eliminate or reorient the parts until they reach the final desired orientation. A part feeder was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. The desired orientation was the most probable natural resting orientation. The trap was mounted on a <b>linear</b> vibratory <b>feeder.</b> The adaptive part feeder developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part and adjust the trap to accommodate that. This set-up eliminates the use of different traps for different-sized sector-shaped parts and wastage of productive time in changing the traps for different sizes. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity of part on the feeder. Design/methodology/approach A part feeder was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. Acrylic material was found to be suitable for trap compared to aluminium. The adaptive part feeder developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part using proximity sensors. Depending on the size of the incoming part, the track width was adjusted dynamically with the help of a stepper motor, rack and pinion arrangement. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity. Findings Typical brake liners in the size range of 40 - 60 mm (radius) were considered for developing the adaptive part feeder. Based on performance studies, the acrylic trap was found better than aluminium traps. The appropriate frequency and amplitude of vibration for maximum conveying velocity of the adaptive part feeder were found experimentally. Regression equation was developed to determine the conveying velocity based on input frequency and amplitude. The regression results were found to be in close agreement with the experimental results. Research limitations/implications The developed part feeder is suitable for handling sector-shaped parts only. Originality/value This paper demonstrates an inexpensive adaptive part feeding device for handling sector-shaped parts which can be extended for handling other asymmetric parts also...|$|R

Ten healthy mares, averaging 500 kg live weigh (LW), were housed in individual pens, where the four experimental concentrates were offered simultaneously, in a <b>linear</b> and continuous <b>feeder</b> for horses, for a period of 15 min. During this period, the first action (smelling or eating), the first choice (first concentrate effectively ingested) and the intake ratio (intake of each concentrate in relation to the total concentrate intake) were observed. Effect of inclusion on first action was observed (P 0. 05), however the concentrate with 7 % was the most preferred (36. 67 %). Citrus pulp can be used as concentrate feed for horses. Therefore, low levels of inclusion in the concentrate, close to 7 %, are recommended when the concentrate is based on corn, wheat bran, soybean meal, with no flavour agents like molasses...|$|R
40|$|Magma {{transport}} {{through the}} Earth’s crust often ends in sedimentary basins. While it erupts at the surface, {{a significant part}} of the magma emplaces in depth in the basin forming sheet complexes dominated by horizontal sills associated with vertical dykes. Their fundamental units are saucer-shaped sills. They are typically ~ 20 - 200 m thick with a radius varying ~ 10 - 20 km. When a large igneous event occurs, the emplacement of sill complexes possibly affects the whole sedimentary basin. This can have important implications for: (i) global climate change due to large volumes of greenhouse gases released from metamorphic aureole around the sills; (ii) organic matter maturation and fluid migration, and ground-water aquifers. The main objective of my thesis consisted to characterize the geochemical architecture of a representative sill complex in order to give information about the emplacement mechanism and the magmatic differentiation associated processes. My thesis presents a detailed geochemical study of the Golden Valley Sill Complex (GVSC) that is one of the best exposures of sheet complexes exhumed by erosion in the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Eight distinct geographical intrusive-units involving saucer-shaped sills and dykes were identified. The large and dense sampling coverage allowed a statistical analysis among more than 300 whole-rock analyses to distinguish the various geochemical signatures. Analogue experiments reproducing saucer-shaped sills were conducted in order to integrate the results of the produced geochemical architecture for the GVSC. Finally, magmatic differentiation associated processes were studied from the best exposed saucer and through detailed examination of variations along 18 vertical profiles. My results show that (1) the GVSC formed itself via a mixture of two-end member hypotheses. Among the distinct geographical units, some have identical and some have distinct geochemical signatures suggesting that GVSC is intermediate between single and multi-batch emplacement model. (2) Integrated study with analogue experiments suggests that major saucer-shaped sills are centrally fed. Moreover, we conclude that the common elliptic shape of saucers is controlled by the size and orientation of vertical <b>linear</b> individual <b>feeders.</b> Finally, (3) chemical changes taking place in a saucer-shaped sill result from different fractionations processes taking place at different parts and times of the cooling history...|$|R
