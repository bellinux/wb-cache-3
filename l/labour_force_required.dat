Entering into the 21 st century in South Africa, training and development has emerged in business as the way to create employment and develop skills. Worldwide the economy is on a fast path of globalisation. Due to globalisation and the changes required in global markets, training and development is the driving force to meet the demand for technical staff and highly skilled workers to meet with economic challenges. The majority of the South African <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>requires</b> new or significantly expanded skills {{to keep up with the}} demands of their jobs.

50|$|The Cairns Wharf Complex is of {{importance}} in demonstrating {{the evolution of}} Queensland's history as it represents an important stage of development of Queensland and Australian wharf facilities dating from 1909 to 1942. The wharves are among the earliest Australian attempts to introduce the medium of reinforced concrete into wharf construction. The construction of number 6 wharf in 1942 demonstrates the importance of Cairns as a centre for Pacific forces during World War II, and its timber and reinforced concrete construction reflects war-time expediency. The wharf-side cargo sheds, numbers 2 and 3, are the most visible surviving remnant of the Cairns waterfront development in the early 1900s. The cargo crane is the last remaining crane from the earliest period of the wharf's history in the 1910s, and helps to {{convey a sense of}} the industrial maritime history of the wharves. White's (Sugar) Shed is a place which demonstrates an evolutionary stage of the North Queensland sugar industry and wharf practices dating to the 1920s through 1950s. The closure of the shed to sugar handling in the early 1960s {{was the result of the}} opening of Cairns bulk sugar terminal at Portsmith in 1964. The opening of the bulk terminals reduced significantly the wharf <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>required</b> for the handling of sugar. The railway lines demonstrate the importance of rail links in establishing Cairns as the dominant regional port in far North Queensland, and consequently, as a viable town. The railway lines are also integral to an understanding of the operation of the wharves, with wharf shed platforms that aligned to the height of the rail cars.|$|E

Education and training providers hold a key role in equipping their students for these challenges. If anything, {{it could be argued that}} recent talk in education systems around the world about “getting back to basics”, with a no more obvious example than the No Child Left Behind policy adopted by the Bush administration, is in fact returning to the “wrong” basics. Ask an employer what skills they wished their people had more of and they will usually respond with things like: ·         Creativity ·         Collaboration ·         Communication ·         The ability to manage uncertainty ·         Emotional intelligence These skills seem far more anchored in “right-brain” capabilities than the left brain “basics” we continue to obsess about in education. Sir Ken Robinsons, the highly respected commentator on creativity and education, suggests that we have forgotten that literacy, mathematics and science as the core focus of education is in fact a recent phenomena.

40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, {{the number of}} women in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> has risen dramatically. Since World War II the {{increase}} in <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation among married women has been particularly noticeable. However the participation of married women has fluctuated at times over the century as a result of national crises such as the World Wars and economic booms and recessions. Two labour market theories have been used to analyse women's <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation. The reserve army of labour theory as developed by Marx, is {{based on the idea that}} a flexible and disposable <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> is <b>required</b> by capital for capital accumulation. Although Marx did not specifically describe women as a reserve <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> recent theorists have applied his theory to women in wage labour. The dual labour market theory likewise was not developed with women in mind but has since been used to analyse their <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation. It has been shown that women as a group of workers display similar characteristics to those attributed to secondary sector workers in the dual labour market, such as low wages and insecure, unstable positions and poor working conditions. Neither of the labour market theories questions why women as a group of workers comprise part of a reserve army of labour or the secondary sector of the labour market. In particular, these theories take no account of women's domestic responsibilities which considerably limit women's <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation. Feminist theorists however maintain that a theory of women's wage labour must include women's domestic role. This thesis examines how the labour market theories have been used to analyse women's participation in the labour market and reviews feminist theories which have linked women's domestic role with their position in the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> Employers hold a key position in the entry of women to the labour market. A survey of employers in the Manufacturing, Insurance, Finance and Business Services industrial groups in Palmerston North was undertaken to investigate employers' perceptions of the place of women in the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> Evidence from the study indicates that employers prefer women in positions which have traditionally been "women's work" and are reluctant to promote women because employers think the women's domestic responsibilities will preclude them from adequately carrying out their labour market obligations. In conclusion, it is apparent that employers do not perceive women as being career oriented because they believe women's domestic responsibilities will take priority in their lives. This belief effectively limits women's participation in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> and contributes to the continuation of sexual divisions in the labour market...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{population}} ageing {{is expected}} to create severe fiscal pressures for governments. With 12 Commonwealth agencies as researeh partners, NATSEM is currently constructing the Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM), a dynamic microsimulation model, to simulate our likely social and economic futures and the future distributional impact of policy changes. The APPSIM model takes the 2001 Census one per cent sample file as its base data and then ages the individuals within the sample, year by year, to 2051. <b>Labour</b> <b>force</b> participation will become an increasingly important issue as the population ages. People who are employed pay taxes and claim less social security, improving the budget balance and making more funds available for Australia's increasing health care, pensions and aged care needs. Promoting <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation has been suggested by Treasury and the Productivity Commission {{as a means of}} reducing future fiscal pressures caused by the ageing population. Simulating the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> first <b>requires</b> a solid understanding of <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation patterns in Australia; their historical context; legislation and social conditions that guided <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation; and how these patterns are expected to change in the future. Given the microsimulation nature of APPSIM, {{it is also important to}} understand the process undertaken at the individual level to decide on whether to work and if so, when and how much. This thesis begins by reviewing the literature on Australian <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> patterns and international examples of dynamic microsimulation models. It explains in some detail the development of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> module for APPSIM, ineluding modelling methods used, the use of separate equations to model different groups and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> processes and the explanatory variables considered. It then validates the model by comparing its outcomes to external benchmarks. Finally, the usefulness of the module is demonstrated by assessing the impact of three policy scenarios on <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation: increasing Year 12 and university attainment, increasing the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation of single mothers with school-age children, and reducing the incidence and impact of disability among workers aged 45 - 64. These policy scenarios demonstrate that higher educational attainment will result in higher savings in the future, but the gains will take decades to appear. Increasing the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation of single mothers has less of an impact on overall superannuation savings, but the impact is focused on people who would have had very low levels of superannuation. Reducing the incidence and impact of disability improves superannuation balances as people are able to work for longer, and has the most immediate impact on superannuation savings. These simulations illustrate the fact that policies targeted towards people who are likely to have lower superannuation balances can be of great benefit. Future research in this area could be targeted towards a more detailed model of the <b>labour</b> <b>force.</b> As detailed longitudinal data becomes more widely available and computer power increases, there is the potential to simulate behavioural response to changes in take-home income and a wider range of explanatory factors in <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation...|$|R
