We carried out combined measurements of gas exchanges and chlorophyll fluorescence in field-grown Arbutus unedo L. trees during late spring and mid summer, and a quantitative limitation analysis was performed {{to distinguish between the}} different limitations to photosynthesis, i. e., diffusional [D L = stomatal (S L) + mesophyll (MCL) ] and non-diffusional (carboxylation capacity and electron transport, B <b>L)</b> <b>limitations.</b> Light-saturated assimilation at ambient CO 2 (A max), stomatal conductance to water vapour (g sw) and maximum carboxylation rate (V cmax C i) showed a marked midday depression during both periods. The total limitations tended to increase during the day and were remarkably similar in June and July (50 and 48 %, respectively); on a daily basis, D L was similar to B L (about 23 %) in June; whereas, in July the former was predominant (38 and 4 %, respectively). We concluded that the midday depression in photosynthesis was largely caused by diffusional limitations, with non-diffusional limitations playing a smaller role. Although stomatal closure was the main diffusional limitation, the decline in mesophyll conductance was not negligible during the hottest and driest period. JRC. DDG. H. 2 -Climate chang...|$|R

(2) The fitness functions of DE utilized in this research favor the modification with smaller accumulated pixel values more than success rate of attack such that controlling the accumulated pixel values becomes the priority during the evolution.

The study suggests that chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is moderately suitable in soils of Pedon P 8 but marginally suitable in soils of Pedon P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, and P 5 whereas soils of Pedon P 6 and P 10 are not suitable for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cultivation. Soil depth, wetness (drainage), erosion, texture and organic carbon are the major limitations for crop growth in the most of soils of Malwa plateau.

E-O- 3 accelerated leaf senescence, as indicated by significant decreases in photosynthetic pigment contents with the elongation of O- 3 exposure. E-O- 3 significantly affected gas exchange and carboxylation, inducing reductions in light-saturated photosynthesis (A(sat)), the maximum activity of Rubisco (V-c,V-max) and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)). Chl a/b, V-c,V-max/J(max) and stomatal <b>limitation</b> (<b>l)</b> were not affected. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was significantly decreased by E-O- 3 in the first year, but remained unchanged in the second year. It can be inferred that the decrease in A(sat) by E-O- 3 was mainly attributed to the changes in non-stomatal factors. After two years' exposure, E-O- 3 caused significant decreases in canopy photosynthesis and leaf mass per area, and {{a significant increase in}} the number of branches, but induced slight, not significant decreases in growth and biomass. Therefore, it can be concluded that the carbon accumulation of the species M. glyptostroboides could be negatively affected after long-term exposure to high O- 3 concentration.

40|$|Detailed and {{accurate}} vertical distributions of cloud properties (such as cloud fraction, cloud phase, and cloud water content) and their changes {{are essential to}} accurately calculate the surface radiative flux and to depict the mean climate state. Surface and space-based active sensors including radar and lidar are ideal to provide this information because of their superior capability to detect clouds and retrieve cloud microphysical properties. In this study, we compare the annual cycles of cloud property vertical distributions from space-based active sensors and surface-based active sensors at two Arctic atmospheric observatories, Barrow and Eureka. Based on the comparisons, we identify the sensors' respective strengths and limitations, and develop a blended cloud property vertical distribution by combining both sets of observations. Results show that surface-based observations offer a more complete cloud property vertical distribution from the surface up to 11  km {{above mean sea level}} (a. m. s. <b>l.)</b> with <b>limitations</b> in the middle and high altitudes; the annual mean total cloud fraction from space-based observations shows 25 – 40  % fewer clouds below 0. 5  km than from surface-based observations, and space-based observations also show much fewer ice clouds and mixed-phase clouds, and slightly more liquid clouds, from the surface to 1  km. In general, space-based observations show comparable cloud fractions between 1 and 2  km a. m. s. l., and larger cloud fractions above 2  km a. m. s. l. than from surface-based observations.

We assessed the effects of canopy warming and fully open air [CO 2] enrichment on (1) the acclimation of two biochemical parameters that frequently limit photosynthesis (A), the maximumcarboxylation capacity of Rubisco (Vc,max) and the maximum potential linear electron flux through photo-system II (Jmax), (2) the associated responses of leaf structural and chemical properties related to A, as wellas (3) the stomatal <b>limitation</b> (<b>l)</b> imposed on A, for soybean over two growing seasons in a conventionallymanaged agricultural field in Illinois, USA.

Large seasonal differences in precipi-tation altered soil moisture availability modulating the complex effects of elevated temperature and CO 2 on biochemical and structural properties related to A. Elevated temperature also reduced the benefit ofelevated [CO 2] by eliminating decreases in stomatal limitation at elevated [CO 2].

40|$|Research Seminar PresentationTertiary {{students}} in EFL contexts like China are often {{faced with a}} gap between their limited command of L 2 (English) academic literacies and their much more developed L 1 academic literacies. Instead of just focusing on the <b>L</b> 2 <b>limitations</b> of the EFL academic writer, research can also look at how best one can help bridge this gap. There are two major dimensions {{to the task of}} academic writing: (1) the bottom-up dimension: selecting the appropriate kinds of lexico-grammatical resources—lexical phrases, and (2) the top-down dimension: planning the schematic structure of the text to achieve one’s overall communicative purpose through moves and steps, each with specific rhetorical functions. In view of the many Chinese university contexts where students are often taught in huge classrooms and accustomed to explicit instruction on general English skills with grammar exercises, this seminar will present a culturally appropriate pedagogical approach integrating genre-based pedagogies (Rose and Martin, 2012), lexical bundle studies (e. g. Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Cortes, 2004, 2013; Hyland, 2008) and move analysis of English for academic purposes (EAP) (Swales, 1990; Swale & Feak, 2004). The “teaching and learning cycle” of genre-based pedagogies (Rose & Martin, 2012) and corpus-informed explicit instruction are incorporated into an EAP genre-based approach for a better “text in context” exemplification of genre knowledge and genre-specific language features. Lexical phrases are focused upon as key EAP resources in the context of genre awareness including “general academic lexical phrases” (GALP) (e. g., 4 - 5 word “lexical bundles” such as “on the basis of”) selected through corpus frequency analysis, and “move-specific lexical phrases” (MLP) selected through qualitative genre analysis (Cai & Lin, 2012). MLPs are, in particular, taught as useful “frames” for expanding students’ repertoire of lexico-grammatical resources to realize different moves in a specific genre. This new distinction between GALP and MLP is made in an attempt to attend to both the frequency and variety of building blocks of academic texts in genre-based pedagogies, and also to model a good strategy for students’ own independent learning in different genres of academic writing...|$|R

Decrease in relative water content (RWC) of leaves resulted in fast and considerable stomatal closure and decrease in net photosynthetic CO 2 fixation (A) in Ae. bicornis and in wheat cultivars, while in Ae. tauschii and Ae. speltoides stomatal conductance (gs) and A remained relatively high between 90 and 70 % RWC. Parallel with this, A was {{limited by the}} CO 2 diffusion to the intercellular spaces (stomatal <b>limitation,</b> <b>Ls)</b> even at a lower RWC in Ae. taushii and in Ae. speltoides, while a significant mesophyll limitation (Lm) was observed for Ae. bicornis and for wheat. On the other hand, drought stress resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the thermal stability of PSII in wheat and Aegilops genotypes. The results indicate that some genotypes of Ae. taushii and Ae. speltoides have better drought tolerance with satisfactory heat stability than wheat, making them appropriate for improving the heat tolerance of wheat to survive dry and hot periods in the field.

However, studies with plants have shown that labile metal complexes enhance metal bioavailability when the uptake is rate-limited by transport of the free ion in solution to the uptake site. Here, the role of labile complexes of Cd on metal bioavailability was assessed using Caco- 2 cells, the cell model for intestinal absorption. At low Cd(2 +) concentration (1 nM), the CdCl(n) (2 -n) complexes contributed to the uptake almost to the same extent as the free ion. At large Cd(2 +) concentration (10 μM), the contribution of the complexes was much smaller. At constant Cd(2 +) concentration, Cd intake in the cells from solutions containing synthetic ligands such as EDTA increased as the dissociation rate of the cadmium complexes increased, and correlated well with the Cd diffusion flux in solution measured with the Diffusive Gradient in Thin Films technique (DGT). The Cd intake fluxes in the cells were well predicted assuming that the specific uptake is limited by diffusion of the free Cd(2 +) ion to the cell surface. Our results underline that speciation of Cd has a major effect on its uptake by intestinal cells, but the availability is not simply related to the free ion concentration.

40|$|Master of EducationStudies of nonverbal {{communication}} {{for some}} decades {{have shown a}} fundamental relationship between verbal and nonverbal aspects of language. Hence, communication {{has come to be}} understood as the use of a multidimensional system of integrated verbal and nonverbal behaviour. In Japan, the study of English at high school has traditionally focused on the development of students' reading and writing skills and neglected the teaching of spoken English communication. Thus, the English education system in Japan is seen to have avoided the threat to cultural identity that can result from exposure to cultural traditions and the complex system of values and norms that exist in English as in any language. It is within this context of English education in Japan that this study has explored the issues relating to the teaching and learning of spoken English by implementing a syllabus focusing primarily on common nonverbal behaviours used by native speakers of English. A program of instruction in English nonverbal behaviour was designed and implemented in one Third Year senior high school class (equivalent to Year 12 in Australia) in a school in Kyoto, Japan. The study sought to investigate the progress that could be made by these Japanese high school students in spoken English proficiency {{at the conclusion of the}} program; and to explore the strategies that facilitated progress and factors that impeded progress. The research method chosen was a case study in teaching practice and a predominantly qualitative approach was taken in the methods of data collection. A pre- and post-test was also used. The data analysis revealed that after the program, all students improved in spoken English proficiency through their acquisition of English nonverbal behaviours, particularly in the use of English gestures. Difficulties for the learners included social and emotional challenges related to adopting nonverbal elements that contrast with the values and norms attached to their <b>L</b> 1; <b>limitations</b> of the classroom context; and physical obstacles in 'acquiring' foreign language elements. One unexpected outcome of the study was the development of trust among students and between the teacher and students during the program. A significant finding was that students transferred the new L 2 behaviours learned in unscripted interactions in the classroom. Key factors that facilitated learner progress were teaching strategies that incorporated metacognitive instruction with physical modelling; high student motivation resulting from the learners' cognitive understanding of the genuine need for the new behaviours in effective communication; and active learning techniques.

40|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} importance of investigating the social context(s) in which second-language (L 2) learning and use take place, the decade-old “social turn” {{within the field}} of second-language acquisition (SLA) has yet to produce a “parsimonious system of valid and generalizable parameters to describe contextual characteristics” (Dörnyei, 2009 a, p. 238). Accordingly, investigating social network structure has recently been suggested as a general approach to examining the link between person and environment (Beckner, et al., 2009). In the current thesis, I offer a network approach in which second-language (L 2) learning and use is regarded both as purposeful and as constrained by one’s social relationships. Subsequently, in a first-of-its-kind study within SLA, I apply social network analysis – a diverse array of formally-defined measures of social position and other socio-structural features – to conceptualize and empirically test the relationship between social structure and the willingness to communicate in the L 2 (L 2 WTC), defined as the “readiness to enter into discourse at a particular time with a specific person or persons, using a L 2 ” (MacIntyre, et al., 1998, p. 547). In a study of Chinese-speaking international students at a British university, trait-like L 2 WTC is found to predict cross-cultural adjustment, suggesting the role of actively engaging with one’s new cultural surroundings in establishing an adaptive person-environment fit. Subsequently, in the first study to apply modern, graph-theoretic notions of social position to a network of L 2 learners, a significant relationship is found between various notions of structural position among a network of international English-for-Academic-Purposes students, and dispositional L 2 WTC. Overall, the results support L 2 WTC as both purposeful and constrained, learned from one’s past interactions, yet pushing the individual to take advantage of opportunities to communicate in the <b>L</b> 2. Implications, <b>limitations,</b> and future directions of a social network approach to L 2 learning and use are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of precipitation over {{the broad range}} of scales of interest for climatologists, meteorologists and hydrologists is challenging in high altitudes of tropical regions, where the spatial variability of precipitation is important while in situ measurements remain scarce largely due to operational constraints. Three different types of rainfall products – ground based, satellite derived, RCM outputs – are compared here during the hydrological year 2012 / 13 in order to retrieve rainfall patterns at time scales ranging from sub-daily to annual over a watershed of approximately 10 000 km 2 in Peru. It is a high altitude catchment, located in the region of the Cordillera Blanca, with 41 % of its area above 4000 m a. s. l. and 340 km 2 glaciated. Daily in situ data are interpolated using a kriging with external drift (KED) algorithm; the satellite product is TRMM 3 B 42, which incorporates monthly gauge data; RCM outputs are obtained from WRF run with a Thompson microphysical scheme at three nested resolutions: 27, 9 and 3 km. The performances of each product are assessed from a double perspective. A local comparison with gauge data is first carried out when relevant (diurnal and seasonal cycles, statistics of rainfall occurrence); then the ability of each product to reproduce some well-known spatial features of rain fields at various time scales (from annual down to daily) is analysed. WRF simulations largely overestimate the annual totals, especially at low spatial resolution, while reproducing correctly the diurnal cycle and locating the spots of heavy rainfall more realistically than either the ground-based KED or the TRMM products. The main weakness of the KED data is the production of annual rainfall maxima over the summit rather than on the slopes, induced by a lack of in situ data above 3800 m a. s. <b>l.</b> One main <b>limitation</b> of the TRMM product is its poor performance over ice-covered areas because ice on the ground behaves in a similar way as rain or ice drops in the atmosphere in term of scattering the microwave energy. While all three products are able to correctly represent the spatial rainfall patterns at the annual scale, it not surprisingly turns out that none of them meets the challenge of representing both accumulated quantities of precipitation and frequency of occurrence at the short time scales (sub-daily and daily) required for glacio-hydrological studies in this region.

In particular, it investigates alternative solution techniques for the Boltzmann equation typically used when the Knudsen number (ratio of molecular mean free path to characteristic length scale of flow) exceeds (approximately) 0. 1. Alternative solution methods are required because the prevalent Boltzmann solution technique, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), experiences a sharp rise in computational cost as the deviation from equilibrium decreases, such as in low signal flows. To address this <b>limitation,</b> <b>L.</b> L. Baker and N. G. Hadjiconstantinou recently developed a variance reduction technique [5] in which one only simulates the deviation from equilibrium. This thesis presents the implementation of this variance reduction approach to a Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin finite element formulation in multiple spatial dimensions. Emphasis is given to alternative algorithms for evaluating the advection operator terms, boundary fluxes and hydrodynamic quantities accurately and efficiently {{without the use of}} quadrature schemes. The collision integral is treated as a source term and evaluated using the variance-reduced Monte Carlo technique presented in [10, 9]. For piecewise linear (p = 1) and quadratic (p = 2) solutions to the Boltzmann equation in 5 spatial dimensions, the developed algorithms are able to compute the advection operator terms by a factor of 2. 35 and 2. 73 times faster than an algorithm based on quadrature, respectively; with the computation of hydrodynamic quantities, the overall performance improvement is a factor of 8. 5 and 10, respectively. (cont.) Although the collision integral takes up to 90 % or more of the total computation cost, these improvements still provide tangible efficiency advantages in steady-flow calculations in which less expensive transient collision-operator calculation routines are used during a substantial part of the flow development. High order convergence in physical space has been verified by applying the implemented RKDG method on a test problem with a continuous solution. Furthermore, when applied to pressure driven Poiseuille flow through a rectangular channel, the steady state mass flux in the collisionless limit (where exact results exist) agrees within 0. 5 %, 0. 8 % and 1. 2 % of that obtained by Sone and Hasegawa [14] for aspect ratios of 1, 2 and 4 respectively under a spatial resolution of 52 x 103. For Kn = 0. 2, 1 and 10, our results agree with those obtained by Sone and Hasegawa [14] from solutions of the linearized Boltzmann-Krook-Welander(BKW) equation by comparing them at an "equivalent" Knudsen number of 1. 27 Kn [21]. These results validate the implementation and demonstrate the feasibility of the variance-reduced RKDG method for solving the full Boltzmann equation in multiple spatial dimensions. To pursue higher accuracy for this pressure driven flow problem, a p = 1 scheme was found to be more efficient than a p = 2 scheme at a coarser spatial discretization. This can be achieved by using finer spatial discretization and non-uniform spacing to generate more elements near regions of discontinuities or large variations in the molecular distribution function. by Zhengyi Lian.

40|$|In {{order to}} build a {{coherent}} representation of a discourse, the language processor {{must be able to}} resolve coreference relations between an anaphor and its antecedent. Theoretical and empirical evidence has suggested that discourse entities differ in their relative accessibility, and that this guides the choice of anaphors and identification of their referent (e. g., Ariel, 1990; Walker, Joshi, & Prince, 1998). According to the accessibility account, there is an inverse relation between the accessibility of a discourse entity and the degree of reduction of an anaphor used to refer to the entity. In seven self-paced reading experiments, this dissertation investigated the determinants of accessibility, the way accessibility interacts with referential ambiguity of anaphors, {{and the extent to which}} coreference processing in L 2 is guided by the same factors that operate in L 1 processing. Experiments 1 and 2 (English) tested the prediction that an entity in the subject position is more accessible than an entity in the object position as measured by the relative ease of comprehending temporarily ambiguous pronouns disambiguated to the subject and the relative ease of establishing coreference using pronouns compared to repeated names for a subject antecedent. Another goal of Experiments 1 and 2 was to investigate whether the function of pronouns as a marker for the most accessible antecedent is influenced by their referential ambiguity. The results revealed a clear preference for interpreting ambiguous pronouns as referring to the subject. However, name anaphors did not result in additional reading time costs compared to ambiguous pronouns even in the subject antecedent condition. Given delayed disambiguation (Experiment 2), there was an overall preference for repeated names. These results suggest that the processing of anaphors is influenced by the relative accessibility of discourse entities, but the ability of pronouns to coherently refer to accessible antecedents may be greatly modulated by the need to uniquely identify the referent of an anaphor. Experiments 3 through 5 investigated the interpretation of null pronouns and repeated names as a window into how relative accessibility of discourse entities is determined in Korean. Accessibility was manipulated by varying the grammatical role (subject vs. object) and the order of mention (SOV vs. OSV) of an entity. The results consistently revealed an advantage for subject antecedents. Although not as strong as subjecthood, the results also indicated increased accessibility of scrambled objects: the on-line subject advantage was less pronounced in the OSV order when it was presented in felicitous discourse contexts, and off-line comprehension questions were answered more accurately when the anaphor had an object antecedent compared to a subject antecedent in OSV. Experiments 6 and 7 examined the extent to which coreference processing in L 2 English by Korean speakers is guided by accessibility and referential ambiguity considerations. Unlike native speakers, L 2 learners showed an overall preference for repeated names in comparison to grammatically ambiguous pronouns, independent of the extent of referential ambiguity and the grammatical role of the antecedent. These results suggest that processing resources of L 2 learners are limited. As a consequence of this <b>limitation,</b> <b>L</b> 2 language processors face a particularly difficult challenge when having to take into account the multiple sources information needed to interpret pronouns. Taken together, these results indicate that coreference processing is influenced not only by the accessibility of the antecedents but also by the referential ambiguity of anaphors and the available processing resources of the processor. Implications are discussed in relation to theories of reference focusing specifically on what underlies increased accessibility of subjects and scrambled objects, why referential ambiguity matters, and why L 2 coreference processing is different from L 1 processing...|$|R
