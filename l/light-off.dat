50|$|During low-rpm operation, {{only one}} intake valve opens, {{allowing}} air and fuel into the combustion chamber. The other intake valve {{has only a}} slight amount of lift and its timing is staggered. As a result, the air-fuel charge drawn through the open intake valve undergoes a swirl effect. The swirl creates a stratified charge with a rich mixture near the spark plug for good <b>light-off,</b> and a progressively leaner mixture toward its periphery. This stratified charge, combined with improved EGR control, results in lower emissions especially during the critical warm-up period, and better fuel economy.

50|$|Work using Drosophila has {{dispensed}} with stimulating electrodes {{and developed a}} 3-part remote control system that evokes action potentials in pre-specified Drosophila neurons using a laser beam. The central component of the remote control system is a Ligand-gated ion channel gated by ATP. When ATP is applied, uptake of external calcium is induced and action potentials generated. The remaining {{two parts of the}} remote control system include chemically caged ATP, which is injected into the central nervous system through the fly's simple eye, and laser light capable of uncaging the injected ATP. The giant fibre system in insects consists of a pair of large interneurons in the brain which can excite the insect flight and jump muscles. A 200 ms pulse of laser light elicited jumping, wing flapping, or other flight movements in 60%-80% of the flies.

This study focused on the serial diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) to CDPF aftertreatment system found on Cummins ISB products and detecting when the CDPF is no longer catalytically active. Investigation into catalyst aging showed no statistically significant trends as a filter aged from degreened to effectively end of useful life. <b>Light-off</b> temperature shift {{was chosen as the}} method to be used to detect catalyst activity.

40|$|Infra-Red {{thermography}} and spatially-resolved capillary inlet {{mass spectrometry}} (SpaciMS) {{have been used}} to characterize propylene oxidation along a Pt/Al 2 O 3 monolith-supported catalyst, before and after heterogeneous deactivation. The combined techniques clearly show reaction location, and therefore catalyst use, and how these change with thermal and sulphur degradation. Following the heterogeneous thermal aging, the reaction zones at steady state were broader and located farther into the catalyst relative to those observed with the fresh catalyst. As well, the time for the temperature and concentration waves to travel through the catalyst during back-to-front ignition increased. These effects were more pronounced with 1500 ppm propylene relative to 4500 ppm propylene. Such trends could not be detected based on standard catalyst-outlet measurements. The <b>light-off</b> behaviour was also impacted by the aging, resulting in complex changes to the temperature front propagation, depending on the propylene concentration. With each sulphur exposure step, <b>light-off</b> temperatures increased and the time for back-to-front ignition during temperature programmed oxidation changed pattern. With 1500 ppm propylene fed, the reaction zones established during steady-state operation shifted farther into the catalyst and increased slightly in width following sulphur treatment; at very high temperature and for 4500 ppm propylene, the reaction zones were very close to the catalyst inlet and virtually indistinguishable between catalyst sulphation states. However, at lower steady-state temperatures for the higher propylene concentration, the catalyst did experience delays in reaction <b>light-off</b> and <b>light-off</b> position moved downstream in the catalyst with sulphur damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} efficiency of three way catalytic converters is mainly {{defined by the}} emperature range wherein they are operating. Traditionally, ignition retard {{has been used to}} reduce the <b>light-off</b> time of the catalyst. This is however associated with a fuel penalty. With increasing vehicle electrification, electrically heating facilities present an alternative, especially for hybrid vehicles. Nevertheless, system complexity of hybrid vehicles prevents engineers to evaluate possible heating technologies and their corresponding fuel penalty with respect to traditional solutions. This paper evaluates the application of an electrically heated catalyst on a hybrid vehicle equipped with a Natural Gas (NG) engine. The effect of heating power on <b>light-off</b> time and fuel penalty is determined, using analysis techniques emerging from integrated powertrain control. By means of a case study, the importance of an integral approach is explained by comparing the fuel penalty and {{conversion efficiency}} improvement of electric heating with that of ignition retard.

40|$|The {{influence}} of pretreatment, gas composition and metal (Ce or Co) oxide promotion on the low-temperature CO and C 3 H 6 oxidation activity over alumina-supported Pt and Pd has been studied. The monolith catalysts have either been preoxidised in O 2 /N 2 Or prereduced in H 2 /N 2 prior to evaluation {{with respect to}} <b>light-off</b> performance, using either net oxidising or net reducing CO/C 3 H 6 /O 2 /N 2 gas mixtures. Compared with unpromoted Pt, promotion with preoxidised ceria or cobalt oxide enhances the low-temperature activity significantly and lowers the <b>light-off</b> temperatures by about 60 - 70 degrees C for both CO and C 3 H 6. Prereduction of a cobalt-oxide catalyst (without precious metals) gives a dramatically improved performance compared with a preoxidised catalyst in terms of <b>light-off</b> and overall conversion. Prereduction of metal oxide promoted Pt and Pd can shift the <b>light-off</b> temperatures for CO and C 3 H 6 by up to 100 degrees C toward lower temperatures compared with preoxidised samples. When using gas mixtures containing both CO and C 3 H 6, the conversion of CO always starts at lower temperatures than the conversion of C 3 H 6 The catalysts have been characterised by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of carbon monoxide, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and specific surface area measurements (BET). The reduced cobalt containing samples adsorb large amounts of CO.

40|$|SummaryVisual motion {{perception}} {{is critical to}} many animal behaviors, and flies have emerged as a powerful model systemÂ for exploring this fundamental neural computation. Although numerous {{studies have suggested that}} fly motion vision is governed by a simple neural circuit [1 â 3], the implementation of this circuit has remained mysterious for decades. Connectomics and neurogenetics have produced a surge in recent progress, and several studies have shown selectivity for light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF) in key elements associated with this circuit [4 â 7]. However, related studies have reached disparate conclusions about where this selectivity emerges and whether it {{plays a major role in}} motion vision [8 â 13]. To address these questions, we examined activity in the neuropil thought to be responsible for visual motion detection, the medulla, of Drosophila melanogaster in response to a range of visual stimuli using two-photon calcium imaging. We confirmed that the input neurons of the medulla, the LMCs, are not responsible forÂ light-on and <b>light-off</b> selectivity. We then examined the pan-neural response of medulla neurons and found prominent selectivity for light-on and <b>light-off</b> in layers of the medulla associated with two anatomically derived pathways (L 1 /L 2 associated) [14, 15]. We next examined the activity of prominent interneurons within each pathway (Mi 1 and Tm 1) and found that these neurons have corresponding selectivity for light-on or <b>light-off.</b> These results provide direct evidence that motion is computed in parallel light-on and <b>light-off</b> pathways, demonstrate that this selectivity emerges in neurons immediately downstream of the LMCs, and specify where crucial elements of motion computation occur...|$|E

40|$|Automobile {{exhaust gas}} {{conversion}} was simulated with a reactor model based on first principles. The monolithic reactor was modelled as adiabatically operating with a uniform flow distribution over the channels and with constant heat and mass transfer coefficients. The kinetic rate equations {{in the model}} were constructed from elementary step kinetics of the individual global reactions. The model predictions for <b>light-off</b> curves compare quite well with experimental data from the literature. <b>Light-off</b> is in the sequence hydrogen, carbon monoxide, propene, but the <b>light-off</b> temperatures do not differ very much. The nitric oxide conversion as function of the reactor feed temperature passes through a maximum at high hydrocarbon conversion, but does not reach the level of 50 %, defined as <b>light-off.</b> Hydrogen is the major oxygen consumer in the front part of the reactor, while a slow reaction proceeds between CO and NO. At sufficiently high feed temperatures thermal reactor ignition occurs when the degree of CO surface coverage drops considerably. The corresponding increase of the O adatoms coverage causes increased reaction rates and a sudden temperature rise. Beyond the ignition point oxygen is mainly consumed by propene and by unconverted carbon monoxide. NO is reduced by unconverted hydrogen, while NO reduction by the hydrocarbon is not significant. Catalysts capable of increasing the NO surface coverage or the NO dissociation, or leading to a lower oxygen sticking coefficient would show a higher NO conversion maximum. The results indicate that well-known reaction mechanisms are capable to describe the behaviour of automotive exhaust gas converters, if mutual interactions of gaseous components and surface species {{are taken into account}} via elementary step kinetics...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{critical}} needs of a Three Way Catalyst (TWC) model {{is to be able}} to predict <b>light-off.</b> This is crucial for application studies and vehicle architectural studies because most of the emissions from a TWC occur before <b>light-off</b> (called cold-start emissions). Laboratory experiments give detailed insights to the reaction mechanism and analytical forms of the rate expressions as they are well-controlled and well-behaved as compared to vehicle tests. However, to predict emissions on a vehicle test, the laboratory-estimated kinetic parameters are not entirely capable because of the various uncertainties in the vehicle tests. In this work, six different vehicle data sets are used to calibrate and validate the TWC global kinetic model. Our emphasis in this work is restricted to predicting the <b>light-off</b> (cold-start emissions) in TWC. The kinetic model is calibrated using 4 vehicle data sets (which use the FTP drive cycle) using iSIGHT software package. The kinetic parameters of the various reactions occurring in the TWC are estimated to match the experimental data through exploratory and local optimization methods. A systematic approach (with increasing complexity) is used to estimate the kinetic parameters. The estimated parameters are then used to validate the model on two different vehicle data sets (one NEDC drive cycle and one FTP drive cycle) with different catalyst compositions and engine power (and hence different engine out exhaust compositions). The model with estimated kinetic parameters predicts the <b>light-off</b> reasonably well for the new data sets. The parameter estimation approach in this work is kept as generic as possible to exhaust aftertreatment devices, and a set of guidelines for parameter estimation (specifically for use in exhaust aftertreatment devices) is presented (in the Appendix) ...|$|E
