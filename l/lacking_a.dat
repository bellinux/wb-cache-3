5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, <b>lacking</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal.

Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle <b>lacking</b> <b>a</b> necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully <b>lacking</b> <b>a</b> direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E

Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To examine {{why people}} <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> regular source of {{ambulatory}} care (RSAC) and explore whether this commonly used access measure accurately identifies population subgroups {{at risk for}} barriers to continuity care. METHODS: Using data from a 1986 national telephone survey, we performed a content analysis of subjects' verbatim reports {{as to why they}} <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> RSAC (n = 5, 748). RESULTS: The 16. 4 percent of respondents who <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> RSAC gave the following reasons: 1) financial problems, 8 percent; 2) local resource inaccessibility, 5 percent; 3) not wanting a regular source of ambulatory care, 61 percent; and 4) transitory loss of their regular source of ambulatory care, 18 percent. However, some sociodemographic subgroups reported substantially more problems with access barriers, and these disparities were often not detected by the global measure, RSAC. The poor were not more likely than the non-poor to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval, [0. 6, 1. 1]), but {{were much more likely to}} <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC for financial reasons (OR = 5. 2 [2. 6, 10. 6]). Similarly, rural respondents were not more likely than urban dwellers to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC, but were more likely to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC because of local resource inaccessibility (OR = 5. 8 [2. 8, 11. 9]). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the global measure, RSAC, is not an accurate indicator of whether population subgroups have access barriers to obtaining a source of continuity care...|$|R
