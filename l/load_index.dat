40|$|The lack of {{precision}} to predict service performance through <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> {{may lead to}} wrong decisions {{regarding the use of}} web services, compromising service performance and raising platform cost unnecessarily. This paper presents experimental studies to qualify the behaviour of <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> in the web service context. The experiments consider three services that generate controlled and significant server demands, four levels of workload for each service and six distinct execution scenarios. The evaluation considers three relevant perspectives: the capability for representing recent workloads, the capability for predicting near-future performance and finally stability. Eight different <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> were analysed, including the JMX Average Time index (proposed in this paper) specifically designed to address the limitations of the other indices. A systematic approach is applied to evaluate the different <b>load</b> <b>indices,</b> considering a multiple linear regression model based on the stepwise-AIC method. The results show that the <b>load</b> <b>indices</b> studied represent the workload to some extent; however, in contrast to expectations, most of them do not exhibit a coherent correlation with service performance and this can result in stability problems. The JMX Average Time index is an exception, showing a stable behaviour which is tightly-coupled to the service runtime for all executions. <b>Load</b> <b>indices</b> are used to predict the service runtime and therefore their inappropriate use can lead to decisions that will impact negatively on both service performance and execution cost...|$|R

40|$|Nutrient {{transformation}} and phytoplankton growth {{were examined in}} 9 river-dominated sub-tropical east Australian estuaries in 1996 using modified mixing diagrams. The sampling program was rapid and strictly controlled, using 2 or 3 boats simultaneously, so that all 9 estuaries were usually sampled within 4 to 5 d of each other. River samples were collected {{at the head of}} each estuary on a flow-weighted basis, and variations in river concentrations and flushing times were used to calculate conservative mixing lines. This was to avoid ‘apparent’ non-linear distributions in the mixing diagrams associated with river-source variations on a time scale less or equal to the flushing time of the estuary. A number of general patterns of biogeochemical behaviour were observed across most, or all, of the estuaries. The 4 northern, and most likely the 5 southern, estuaries flushed fresh to the mouth during a flood in May, allowing most of the flood-borne material to escape from the system. Phytoplankton appear to exert the dominant control on nutrient transformation in the 9 estuaries, with non-biological processes only playing a minor role, if any. Eight of the 9 estuaries are potentially nutrient-limited, with nutrient concentrations falling below the upper half-saturation constants required for phytoplankton growth. The estuaries became potentially more P-limited, and less N-limited, as the wastewater loading to each system increased. During most sampling runs, maximum and mean concentrations of phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a) in the Tweed, Brunswick, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay and Hastings estuaries were significantly correlated with the wastewater DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) <b>loading</b> <b>index</b> (daily wastewater <b>load</b> per m 3 of estuary volume multiplied by the flushing time of the estuary in days). In contrast, the diffuse DIN <b>loading</b> <b>index</b> appeared more important for controlling phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in the 3 estuaries (Richmond, Clarence and Manning) that received a low wastewater DIN load. Sub-tropical Australian estuaries are characterised by a high degree of variability in nutrient delivery and phytoplankton growth. The timing and magnitude of hydrological factors appears to be the major feature that determines the differences in the temporal patterns of phytoplankton growth between sub-tropical and temperate regions. Nutrient-loading and phytoplankton growth in the 9 estuaries appears to be in phase, suggesting that stored and recycled nutrients may play a smaller role in maintaining phytoplankton growth in these systems compared to the larger partially mixed temperate systems. Management efforts in the 9 estuaries should be first directed towards reducing the wastewater DIN <b>loading</b> <b>index</b> to 3 ̆c 1, followed by management strategies focused on controlling diffuse loadings. There may, however, be a trade-off associated with reducing the wastewater <b>loading</b> <b>index</b> with a proportional reduction in fisheries production...|$|R
