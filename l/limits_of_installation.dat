40|$|Dynamic {{flexible}} risers {{are a common}} term for cables, umbilicals and flexible pipes,that are freely or semi-freely suspended between two points (offshore). Flexible pipes are mostly used to transport fluids between platforms/ships etc. to a flow-line/sea floor installation or similar. The safe operating window for the installation is limited by whether induced motion of the installation vessel giving rise to dynamic tension and curvature at the touch-down-zone (TDZ). By investigation and establishing of calculative methods to determine the actual <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> and operation, this paper wishes to further the knowledge of global torsion instability of flexible dynamical pipes in catenary configuration at the Touch-down-point (TDP). Today's methods are conservative and {{an expansion of the}} operating/installation widow will have direct economical benefits for the industry. As the filed of global torsion instability in {{flexible risers}} have already been touched upon before, this work centres around furthering this knowledge with special wight on larger cross-section diameter as found in flexible pipes. Trough analysis have been made following already established methodologies, as well as a new method made in order to linking local effects and failure modes, to global torsion problems. The results show that not all prediction methods established for offshore cables are suitable for pipes. In addition, it is seen that the most critical waves are not always the larger ones {{when it comes to the}} coupling between dynamic heave motion and torsion instability. Lastly it is found from the analysis, that dynamic flexible pipes may very well resist global torsion buckling, even when there is compression at the TDP. On top of this, dynamic flexible pipes are also very good at resisting global torsion failure, while under the influence of other failures, such as flooding of the annulus and local lateral buckling of the tensile armour. The final conclusion is that the presented opinion in newer studies on torsion instability, about the practises of today being to conservative, has been further strengthened and the limits are much larger than first anticipated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLately, high {{production}} rate welding processes for Al alloys, {{which are used}} as LNG FPSO cargo containment system material, {{have been developed to}} overcome the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> and high rework rates. In particular, plasma-metal inert gas (MIG) hybrid (PMH) welding can be used to obtain a higher deposition rate and lower porosity, while facilitating a cleaning effect by preheating and post heating the wire and the base metal. However, an asymmetric undercut and a black-colored deposit are created on the surface of PMH weld in Al alloys. For controlling the surface defect formation, the wire feeding speed and nozzle diameter in the PMH weld was investigated through arc phenomena with high-speed imaging and metallurgical analysis...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} to fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials adhesively bonded {{to the concrete}} substrate is the implementation of mechanically fastened FRP (MF-FRP) systems using steel anchors to secure the laminate to the substrate. The benefit of MF-FRP, compared to adhesive bonding for FRP flexural strengthening, is the speed <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> with unskilled labor, minimal or absent surface preparation under any meteorological condition and immediate use of the strengthened structures. Some of the potential shortcomings are: possible concrete damage during anchoring and <b>limited</b> opportunity <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> {{in the presence of}} congested internal reinforcement in the members to be strengthened. Laboratory testing and a number of field applications have shown the effectiveness of the MF-FRP method. In this paper, an analytical model is discussed for reinforced concrete (RC) members strengthened with MF-FRP strips. The model accounts for equilibrium, compatibility and constitutive relationships of the constituent materials; in particular, it accounts explicitly for the slip between the substrate surface and the FRP strip due to the behavior of the fasteners. The proposed flexural model, coupled with the computation algorithm, is able to predict the fundamentals of the behavior of RC flexural members strengthened with MF-FRP strips, in terms of both ultimate and serviceability limit states. Comparisons between the analytical predictions and the experimental results have been successfully performed...|$|R

40|$|Are public R&D {{programs}} really {{effective in}} developing innovative technologies? How many technologies developed {{in these programs}} have been successfully commercialized? What are the key factors for successful commercialization and diffusion in the market? This paper tries {{to answer these questions}} by examining the Japanese experience of public R&D in demand-side energy efficiency, focusing on two major projects conducted in the 1980 s and 1990 s. It is found that of the 34 technologies developed in the two projects, only seven have been commercialized so far, four of those seven have only a very <b>limited</b> number <b>of</b> <b>installations,</b> and only one has a growing market. The results show that, while public R&D investments have a high risk of failure, they can bring new technologies to the market after a certain lead time. In addition, several factors resulting in {{the success or failure of}} commercialization/diffusion are identified, such as long-term R&D support by the government, a marketing strategy to respond to and influence market demand, and combination of R&D and deployment policy.

40|$|Mudmats {{are used}} in the {{offshore}} oil and gas industry to support subsea infrastructure for pipeline terminations and well manifolds. Expansion and contraction of connected pipelines and jumpers due to changing thermal and pressure conditions impose fully three-dimensional loading on the foundations, dominated by horizontal, moment and torsional loading rather than high vertical loads. The mudmat foundations are rectangular, and include shallow skirts in order to increase capacity, particularly for sliding. Offshore design guidelines for shallow foundations tend to excessive conservatism; optimisation of mudmat capacity under general loading has thus become critical in order to keep foundation footprints within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> current <b>installation</b> vessels. The paper presents an alternative design method, based on failure envelopes derived from an extensive programme of three-dimensional finite-element analyses, focusing on the sliding and rotational capacity of the foundation. Starting from expressions that quantify the uniaxial capacity under each of the six degrees of freedom, failure envelope shapes for different biaxial combinations are developed. Ultimately, the allowable capacity under the six-degree-of-freedom loading is expressed in terms of a two-dimensional failure envelope for the resultant horizontal and moment loading, after due allowance for the vertical and torsional components of load. </p...|$|R

40|$|One {{measure of}} {{performance}} in adaptive architecture {{is its ability}} the respond effectively {{to the environment and}} evolving program. As architects strive to create designs that respond to external change, more and more literally and actively, they are inevitably faced with the challenge of merging the kinetic with what is inherently an "immovable". Yet traditional mechanic devices allowing freedom of movement to an assembly have proven to be very expensive and often unreliable. This is in part due to their incompatibility with a building's use and lifespan. Thus, they are either implemented permanently at great expense or are confined to the temporary and architecturally <b>limited</b> realm <b>of</b> <b>installations.</b> We can thus witness a trend in architecture moving away from the mechanic and towards the use of material behavior and deformation as a cheaper and more durable architectural solution to responsiveness. Responsive materials such as shape memory alloys (SMA's) and electroactive polymers offer new possibilities for architecture. Furthermore, an understanding of the difference between kinetics in architecture and kinetics in mechanical objects has led to investigations into evolving interplays of rigidity and flexibility within structures. This thesis tries to advance the discourse by investigating the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> elastic material deformation, and framing a niche where it is possible and fruitful for architecture to use material properties to produce adaptable space. (cont.) The work instantiates these notions into a program of informal performance and exhibition space to test how performance criteria such as acoustical absorption, transmission and reflection, visual transparency and media proliferation at an architectural scale can be mediated by this approach. by Andrey Dimitrov.

40|$|A large {{open channel}} {{designed}} {{for the study of}} self-aeration of high-velocity flows has been built and installed at the Laboratory. This 50 -ft channel has a cross section 12 in. deep and 18 in. wide and can be set at any slope from horizontal to vertical. The slope is controlled by means of a hydraulic system and is indicated with a servo system with an accuracy of 1 / 4 degree. The initial flow depth in the test flume is controlled by an electrically driven sluice gate with a rounded entrance located {{at the head of the}} flume. This depth can be controlled and indicated within 0. 001 ft throughout its 1 / 4 -in. to 6 -in. range. The water discharge is regulated by two hydraulically operated gate valves in the supply lines and is measured within an accuracy of about 1 - 1 / 2 per cent.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of energy {{conservation}} and optimization in residential environments by providing users with useful information to solicit a change in consumption behavior. Taking care to highly <b>limit</b> the costs <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> and management, our work proposes a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approach, which consists of disaggregating the whole-house power consumption into the individual portions associated to each device. State of the art NILM algorithms need monitoring data sampled at high frequency, thus requiring high costs for data collection and management. In this paper, we propose an NILM approach that relaxes the requirements on monitoring data since it uses total active power measurements gathered at low frequency (about 1 Hz). The proposed approach is based on the use of Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMM) in conjunction with context information related to the user presence {{in the house and the}} hourly utilization of appliances.
