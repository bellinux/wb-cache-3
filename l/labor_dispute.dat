30|$|Since the {{re-establishment}} of {{the disposal}} system of <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> in 1986, the Chinese state’s capacity to absorb collective struggles of workers has been growing. While the absolute number of collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> admitted by arbitral institutes increased, {{the scale and}} frequency of large-scale collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> declined. This paper argues that the individualization of <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> within arbitral channels {{is related to the}} state’s strengthening capacity to mediate collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes.</b> In addition to gradually expanding institutionalized channels, a growing number of resources and organizations have been mobilized to mediate collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes.</b> In the grand mediation era, the mediation strategies of the state are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are starting to classify <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> with different kinds of appeals and different kinds of ownership before mediation. These continuously improving and expanding mediation mechanisms produced significant effects of prevention and factorization on workers’ <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> during China’s transition. Through statistical testing of provincial-level panel data from 1999 – 2011, this article finds that mediation by labor arbitral institutes has significantly reduced the average scale of admitted <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> but failed to lower the occurrence of collective disputes. On one hand, this shows that the strategy of mediate first effectively channeled collective actions and broke up the solidarity of workers. On the other hand, it reveals the fact that arbitral mediation is highly selective. This is reflected in the strategy of “focusing on large-scale ones but ignoring small-scale ones” taken by arbitral institutes. They concentrate on the prevention of and intervention in large-scale collective disputes, and neglect those of small scale or by individuals. As a result, arbitral mediation only reduced the number of large-scale collective cases and did not directly reduce the number of small-scale cases. Statistically speaking, arbitral mediation resulted in a substantial reduction in the average scale of collective disputes but did not directly reduce the proportion of collective cases among all <b>labor</b> <b>disputes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing <b>labor</b> <b>dispute</b> over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to the riot. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E

It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a <b>labor</b> <b>dispute.</b> On October 20, arbitrator John Feerick ruled that the owners did not have to pay players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave the owners leverage in bargaining talks. Another factor favoring the owners was that their teams received money from the NBA's television broadcasters, whose contracts with the league called for payments to be made if games were not played.|$|E
30|$|In China, the {{transformation}} of economy and the reform of the labor system since the 1980 s have seen {{a large number of}} collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes,</b> yet the scale and intensity of these disputes have been effectively controlled. A trend has been observed that those disputes are more and more individualized. Especially since the new century, the size and frequency of collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> accepted by governmental arbitration institutions gradually decreased. What factors reduced the number of collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> that were handled by formal dispute resolution channels? Based on provincial-level panel data from 1999 to 2011 and quantitative analysis, this paper finds that in the transition years, the Chinese state actively strengthened various mechanisms to mediate <b>labor</b> <b>disputes,</b> which absorbed and defused the collective struggles of workers. However, these mediations significantly reduced only the scale of the collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> rather than the frequency of their occurrence. High selectivity of mediation accounts for this phenomenon: authorities focused primarily on the prevention of large-scale disputes and neglected individual or small-scale disputes. This finding responds theoretically to the discussion of the absence of massive labor movements during China’s transition and conceptually highlights the mediator role of the Chinese state, which flexibly eased the struggles of workers. Empirically, this work also discusses why the absolute number of <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> in the transition remained stubbornly high and why they were consistently mediated but unsolved.|$|R

5|$|Fifteen {{additional}} trams {{were built}} by Strømmen as series two. The first vehicle was delivered on 4 August 1989 {{and was taken}} into service on 11 October, while the last was put into service on 27 August 1990. These were numbered 126 through 140. From 7 September 1990 to 1 February 1991, tram 140 was used on the tramway in Chemnitz, Germany. Following this delivery, all lines of the tramway used SL79, although there were still many other trams needed to supplement the new trams. During the summer of 1995, tram no. 137 was used on the Djurgården Line of the heritage tramway in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to a <b>labor</b> <b>dispute</b> about privatizing {{the operation of the}} tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E

This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated, and would give a maximum age in the tram fleet to 18 years. While Oslo Sporveier at first had planned to debt-finance the purchase, by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.

30|$|Since 1987 {{when the}} formal system for {{handling}} <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> was rebuilt, {{a variety of}} mediation mechanisms {{has been used by}} authorities to resolve collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes.</b> This flexible strategy of governance took slightly different forms in different stages of implementation, but its logic of adjustment of the regime has been consistent—it aims at maximizing the absorption and resolution of collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes,</b> thereby preventing the uniting of collective interests, awareness, and actions of workers. The mediation mechanism for <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> in China between 1987 and 2012 can be divided into three general phases: from 1987 to 1992, an internal mediation model featuring mediation committees inside enterprises; from 1993 to 2007, an arbitral mediation model featuring institutes of labor arbitration; and from 2008 to 2012, a grand mediation model featuring the use of a variety of mediation power and resources integrally and strategically.|$|R

The campaign, which eventually attracted the support of religious groups, labor organizations, student groups and anti-slavery activists, {{became known as the}} Campaign for Fair Food with a stated goal to increase the wages of the pickers by 1¢ per pound picked above the 45¢ paid per bucket at the time, or about 77¢ for each 32-pound (14.5kg) bucket in 2005 US dollars. In 2005, McDonald's Corporation and Yum! signed agreements acquiescing to the group's purchasing demands, although implementation was put on hold due to threats by the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange to fine its members $100,000 if they complied; however, Burger King corporate parent Burger King Brands declined to enter into a similar agreement with the group.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the season the NHL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired resulting in a lockout. The season was threatened with cancellation before the lockout ended, ultimately the length of the <b>labor</b> <b>dispute</b> resulted in the reduction of games from the standard 82 to a shortened 48. Cory Schneider entered the season as the team's new starting goaltender, while the Canucks attempted to trade incumbent Roberto Luongo. The two goaltenders battled for playing time early in the season resulting in a goaltender controversy. After a six-game winning streak to start February the Canucks dealt with multiple injuries and suspensions resulting in the team slumping. In late March Schneider captured the starters job starting seven consecutive games helping the team to a second six-game winning streak. Vancouver dueled the Minnesota Wild in the standings before pulling away in April and winning the division. Led by Henrik and Daniel Sedin the Canucks' power play struggled dropping from fourth the previous season to twenty-third, with the Sedin twins' point production declining. Derek Roy was brought in through a trade to help deal with injuries at centre in the team's only trade of the year. Schneider was injured late in the season and missed the first two games of the playoffs. Vancouver lost the fourth game of their playoff series on a controversial call on Daniel Sedin.|$|E

In recent years the number of labor protests in Russia, including various forms of work stoppage, has increased significantly compared to previous years, but the number of legally constituted collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> and strikes has remained very low. The legislation on resolution of collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> and mounting strikes is quite restrictive in Russia, and its enforcement also encourages employees to seek alternative ways to settle collective labor conflicts. There is little empirical research on the judicial implementation of these norms and its influence on the enforcement of legislation. Therefore, this paper analyses the reasoning of courts in cases on the legality of strikes, their interpretations of the law, and the impact these decisions have on the enforcement of the legislation on resolution of collective <b>labor</b> <b>disputes</b> and strikes.
