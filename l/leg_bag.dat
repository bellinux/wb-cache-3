50|$|A {{catheter}} {{that is left}} {{in place}} {{for more than a}} short period of time is generally attached to a drainage bag to collect the urine. This also allows for measurement of urine volume. There are three types of drainage bags: The first is a <b>leg</b> <b>bag,</b> a smaller drainage device that attaches by elastic bands to the leg. A <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> is usually worn during the day, as it fits discreetly under pants or skirts, and is easily emptied into a toilet. The second type of drainage bag is a larger device called a down drain that may be used overnight. This device is hung on a hook under the patient's bedâ€”never placed on the floor, due to risk of bacterial infection. The third is called a belly bag, and is secured around the waist. This bag can be worn at all times. It can be worn under the patient's underwear to provide a totally undetectable look.|$|E
5000|$|Luz {{jumped into}} Normandy on 6 June 1944. Because {{he thought he}} would never manage {{to get out of the}} plane (he was 5th in the stick), he asked another soldier to {{exchange}} seats so he could jump sooner. Luz did after he had kicked out his <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> containing his radio and other equipment. When Luz landed, he was alone and was unable to locate any of his comrades. [...] Before his death in 1998, Luz recalled ducking behind a hedgerow for cover, looking up and seeing fellow paratroopers shot by tracer rounds.|$|E

50|$|Originally from New South Wales, Raack was {{the second}} leading wicket taker in the 2011-12 Sydney First Grade competition. That season, she also toured with the NSW Second XI for a tri-series against the Victorian Second XI, and with her <b>leg</b> spinners <b>bagged</b> a match-winning 4-11 {{in one of the}} matches. Additionally, she {{represented}} NSW at the U18 National Championship, claiming eight wickets at 8.88 with a best of 4-14.|$|R
50|$|Male {{external}} catheters, urisheaths, Texas catheters or condom catheters {{are made}} of silicone or latex (depending on the brand/manufacturer) and cover the penis just like a condom but with an opening at the end to allow the connection to the urine bag. The sheath is worn over the penis. It stays in place by use of an adhesive, that can either be built into the sheath or come as a separate adhesive liner. The urine gets funneled away from the body, keeping the skin dry at all times. The urine runs into a urine bag that is attached {{at the bottom of}} the external catheter. During the day, a drainable <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> can be used, and at night it is recommended to use a large-capacity bedside drainage bag. Male external catheters are designed to be worn 24/7 and changed daily - and can be used by men with both light and severe incontinence. Male external catheters come in several sizes and lengths to accommodate anatomical variation.|$|E
50|$|At {{this time}} a rigid {{urethrotome}} or a flexible cystoscope/urethrotome combination will be inserted and guided to {{the face of the}} stricture and a small blade towards the tip of the instrument will be deployed using a trigger mechanism to cut the stricture at locations determined by the surgeon. Upon completion of the internal incision(s), the instrument is withdrawn and an appropriately sized Foley catheter will be inserted through the repair and into the urinary bladder, and locked into place by filling its balloon (positioned inside of the bladder near the urethral junction) with sterile water. The Foley catheter serves two purposes, first, it provides drainage of the urine produced in the kidneys, and secondly, it secures the incised areas, holding them open for three to seven days to permit thorough healing of the urethra. The catheter is then attached to a urinary catheter drainage system (large bag or <b>leg</b> <b>bag)</b> via clear polypropylene tubing.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{bags were}} recovered: a black bag {{containing}} a Starline {{blood pressure cuff}} box and 3 bottles of lidocaine; a blue Costco bag (found in the closet) containing [...] "medical debris" [...] including a pulse oximeter, a lanyard, vials, an empty 20ml propofol bottle, 2 bottles of midazolam, an opened IV administration set, a urinary <b>leg</b> <b>bag,</b> a wideband bag, 2 empty dressing bags, 2 empty catheter bags, opened alcohol prep pads, dressing backings, an empty syringe packet, 4 vial tops and a needle cap. Also the saline bag with a cut in it containing the [...] "more or less empty" [...] 100ml propofol bottle that Alvarez recalls removing from the IV stand; and a light blue [...] "baby essentials" [...] bag, containing an array of bottles that included 100ml propofol and 20ml propofol bottles (filled to various levels, some opened, some closed), lorazepam, flumazenil, lidocaine, and Benoquin. Murray's business cards from his Houston practice were also found.|$|E
60|$|This patriarch now {{presented}} himself before Hepzibah, clad {{in an old}} blue coat, which had a fashionable air, and must have accrued {{to him from the}} cast-off wardrobe of some dashing clerk. As for his trousers, they were of tow-cloth, very short in the <b>legs,</b> and <b>bagging</b> down strangely in the rear, but yet having a suitableness to his figure which his other garment entirely lacked. His hat had relation to no other part of his dress, and but very little to the head that wore it. Thus Uncle Venner was a miscellaneous old gentleman, partly himself, but, in good measure, somebody else; patched together, too, of different epochs; an epitome of times and fashions.|$|R
5000|$|External urine {{collection}} {{devices are}} {{a type of}} medical product used, primarily by men, to manage urinary output and/or urinary incontinence. These devices attached {{to the outside of}} the penile area and direct urine into a separate collection chamber such as a <b>leg</b> or bedside <b>bag.</b> There are several varieties of external urine collection devices on the market today including male external catheters also known as urisheaths or Texas/condom catheters, urinals and hydrocolloid based devices.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore participants' {{experiences}} of urinary incontinence and <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> use in order to identify priorities for product redesign. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Twenty-nine <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> users and 5 carers and healthcare professionals participated in the study. They were recruited through a UK hospital Trust and a UK-wide charity for people with bladder and bowel control problems. DESIGN: The study employed a descriptive design with qualitative and quantitative elements to determine current experiences with urinary drainage leg bags and identify potential ways to improve their design. METHODS: Data collection occurred during semistructured face-to-face and telephone semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed that <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> design and performance influenced users' relationships, confidence, and ability to socialize. The most significant issues related to <b>leg</b> <b>bag</b> use were reliable functioning without leakage, secure positioning, and discretion when worn under clothing. All participants reported having experienced significant urine leakage due to usability issues with the leg bags. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents identified a number of design issues with current leg bags that need to be addressed to improve the ease of use and overall experience when using leg bags for containing urinary output. The findings have been used to define design requirements for further development of leg bags and their component parts...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} outcome of {{different}} forms of urinary drainage, particularly for urinary tract infection (UTI), operative findings and patient preference, in patients treated for acute urinary retention (AUR). Patients and methods A feasibility trial was conducted of men presenting with AUR; after {{a short period of}} indwelling catheterization (IDC) patients were taught how to use clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC). Patients who failed this were re-catheterized and taught to manage a valve, or failing this a <b>leg</b> <b>bag,</b> and then discharged home. The patients were followed to assess the occurrence of spontaneous voiding, UTI, findings at prostatectomy and patient satisfaction. Results The CISC group (34 men) had a higher rate of spontaneous voiding than the IDC group (16 men; 56 % vs 25 %). The incidence of UTI was 32 % in the CISC and 75 % in the IDC group. At TURP, 20 % in the CISC group had a UTI, compared with 69 % in the IDC group. Patients using CISC preferred it and had fewer complications than the IDC group. The CISC group had a similar ability to manage and similar acceptance of their method of drainage as the IDC group. Conclusion CISC is managed and accepted well by patients who can use the technique and results in fewer UTIs. It should be considered in patients who present with AUR, and it may delay surgery...|$|E

50|$|Freestyle Footbag is a footbag sport where players {{demonstrate}} their abilities by performing sequences of acrobatic tricks. The ending {{position of the}} bag on one trick becomes the starting position of the bag on the next trick. Tricks are created by combining different components between contacts (stalls or kicks, usually stalls). Components can be spins, dexterities (wrapping a <b>leg</b> around the <b>bag</b> in mid-air), or ducks (letting the bag pass a few inches above the neck). Contacts are usually {{on the inside of}} the foot behind the opposite support leg (clipper stall) or on the toe, however many inventive possibilities remain and are used to create a near-endless list of tricks.|$|R

Demonstrations include: (1) the vertical landing of parachute-supported capsules on water; (2) reduction of landing acceleration by shaping the impact surface for water entry; (3) problems created by horizontal velocity due to wind; (4) {{the use of}} energy absorbers (yielding metal <b>legs</b> or torus <b>bags)</b> for land or water landings; (5) problems associated with horizontal land landings; (6) {{the use of a}} paraglider to aid in vehicle direction control; (7) a curved undersurface to serve as a skid-rocker to convert sinking-speed energy into angular energy; (8) horizontal-type landing obtained with winged vehicles on a hard runway; (9) the dangers of high-speed water landings; and (10) the positive effects of parachute support for landing winged vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Opening - Thursday Parallel Sessions - June 26 Sixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe Mars Science Laboratory rover represents firsts in many aspects for interplanetary exploration. To get the rover to the planet's surface, the rover is winched down from the thrusters, substituting wheels for the usual platform, <b>legs</b> (or air <b>bags)</b> and off-ramp. The mass savings have afforded a larger rover and accompanying instrument payload. The landed platform, which is the landed rover, will carry an analytical laboratory with two instruments of unprecedented capability, a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer, which includes a Harriet cell Tunable Laser System, and X-Ray Diffractometer, an instrument type not flown since the Viking landers in 1976. In addition, the other instruments represent innovative improvements with significant increases in capability. Of particular note, an instrument new to planetary exploration, is ChemCam, a laser induced breakdown spectroscope for remote sensing of chemistry and micro-imaging. This enables elemental/chemical composition to be measured at a meters distant, greatly expanding the survey capability. The details of MSL's approaches and the implications for future missions will be discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Less {{than three}} months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: [...] "That'll cost you extra," [...] whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body. He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the <b>legs</b> in plastic <b>bags</b> and placed them in the fridge for later consumption. Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a [...] "jelly-like substance" [...] using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the fridge before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of the national-wide deployment of surveillance cameras and identity management systems has promoted {{the development of}} biometric systems. Gait as a behavioural biometric trait can be measured unobtrusively at a moderate distance, thus it is predominant in remote human tracking and identification tasks. The past two decades have witnessed a considerable development of gait recognition systems. Yet there are challenges that confine the practical application of gait analysis. The motivation of our work is to identify the problems and find corresponding solutions to explore the potentials of gait recognition and promote its applicability in open-world scenarios. Gait recognition systems use human profile as features, while the appearance of human profile, also known as silhouette, can be affected in various manners. For example, clothing changes the shape of torso (coat) or <b>legs</b> (skirt); carrying <b>bag</b> attaches extra region to the silhouette; walking surface or speed variation changes the appearance of legs. On the other hand, camera viewpoint variation changes the shape of both {{the upper and lower}} body, while segmentation errors may cause massive corruption of the gait features. We summarise them into two categories: partial interference and holistic deformation. The former has been well addressed by existing literatures. The holistic deformation on gait silhouette results in large intra-class variation, and we notice that the performance of conventional approaches decreases under such circumstance. Thus our work focus mostly on the latter challenge. Accordingly, we propose ViFS, an automatic feature selection approach that seeks for the optimal representation features from gallery set, and evaluate its performance under various conditions. We find that ViFS minimises the intra-class variation between gallery and probe data, and by introducing proper feature enhancers, we can further reduce the number of holistic deformation modalities required in the gallery set. We test the proposed method on public dataset that contains viewpoint variations, and the matching accuracy has achieved 99. 1...|$|R
40|$|Os objetivos do estudo foram: (a) relatar os procedimentos no condicionamento dos machos reprodutores no perÃ­odo prÃ©-pubere de criaÃ§Ã£o, averiguando o percentual de montas com sucesso, volume do ejaculado e concentraÃ§Ã£o espermÃ¡tica. (b) Avaliar o efeito da suplementaÃ§Ã£o de vitamina A em machos reprodutores nos parÃ¢metros: volume, motilidade, concentraÃ§Ã£o espermÃ¡tica e alteraÃ§Ãµes morfolÃ³gicas. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida no LaboratÃ³rio de Pesquisa em SuÃ­nos, da FMVZ-USP, utilizando-se de animais de linhagens hÃ­bridas sintÃ©ticas, provenientes de uma granja reprodutiva localizada no sudoeste de SÃ£o Paulo, local este, onde foi realizada a seleÃ§Ã£o dos animais a partir de 70 dias de idade e com peso mÃ©dio de 25, 16 Kg. Aos 117 dias de idade foi realizada a inspeÃ§Ã£o dos aprumos, testÃ­culos, bolsa prepucial e pÃªnis, sendo selecionados 12 animais, que foram transferidos para o referido laboratÃ³rio, aos 193 dias de idade, com peso mÃ©dio de 147, 00 Kg. O condicionamento iniciou-se aos 210 dias de idade dos animais, e, apÃ³s 8 semanas, todos os reprodutores jÃ¡ estavam saltando no manequim, havendo a estabilizaÃ§Ã£o das colheitas. A partir deste perÃ­odo os valores das caracterÃ­sticas, volume e concentraÃ§Ã£o tornaram-se estÃ¡veis, demonstrando-se a homogeneidade dos animais que serviram para a fase {{experimental}} subsequente, relativa Ã  avaliÃ§Ã£o dos efeitos da vitamina A em animais submetidos a suplementaÃ§Ã£o de vitamina A e controle. Nesta segunda fase experimental, foram verificadas diferenÃ§as significativas (p< 0, 05) quanto Ã  motilidade, concentraÃ§Ã£o espermÃ¡tica quantificada pela cÃ¢mara de Neubauer e alteraÃ§Ãµes morfolÃ³gicas, nÃ£o havendo significÃ¢ncia quanto Ã  concentraÃ§Ã£o total e volume do ejaculado. Houve significÃ¢ncia (p< 0, 05) quanto ao tempo nas 25 colheitas, semanais, quanto a concentraÃ§Ã£o, quantificada na cÃ¢mara de Neubauer e total, nÃ£o se evidenciando interaÃ§Ã£o x tratamento. Inferiu-se com o estudo que, dada Ã  condiÃ§Ã£o metabÃ³lica diferencial dos animais de genÃ©ticas hÃ­bridas sintÃ©ticas, novas averiguaÃ§Ãµes devem ser direcionada para a relaÃ§Ã£o nutriÃ§Ã£o x reproduÃ§Ã£o, devem ser averiguadas, uma vez que, os efeitos positivos da suplementaÃ§Ã£o da vitamina A na espermatogÃªnese foram destacados, principalmente nas caracterÃ­sticas que mais se relacionam com a formaÃ§Ã£o da cÃ©lula espermÃ¡ticaThe {{objectives of}} the study were: (a) Report the procedures for the conditioning of boars in the pre pubescent period of the breeding, by checking the percentage of succeed mounts, semenÅ› concentration and volume. (b) Evaluate {{the effect of the}} vitamin A supplementation in boars, related to the parameters: volume, motility, semen concentration and changes in the morphology of the spermatozoids. The research was developed in the Swine Research Laboratory from the FMVZ, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Pirassununga campus. In {{the first phase of the}} trial, which corresponded to the conditioning of the boars to the semenÅ› collection process, 12 boars were utilized. The boars for the experiment came from a breeding swine operation located at the southeast of the SP state and were born from a hybrid synthetic genetic line. They were 70 days old and weighted an average of 25. 16 Kg. At 117 days of age the inspection of the <b>legs,</b> testicles, prepuceÅ› <b>bag</b> and penis was done. 12 animals among the 24 were selected and, at 193 days of age and weighting an average of 147 kg, they were transferred to the boarsÃºnit of the referred Laboratory. The conditioning process started at 210 days of age and 8 weeks after all the boars were already mounting on the dummy, which completed the phase of the collectionsÅ›tabilization. From this period, the values of the characteristics (volume and concentration) become stable, showing the homogeneity of the animals, which were used in the next experimental phase, related to the evaluation of the vitamin A effects on both treatments (Control and Vitamin A supplementation). In this second experimental phase we found significant differences (p< 0. 05) considering motility, semen concentration determined by the Neubauer chamber and changes in the morphology of the spermatozoids, while no significant differences were found considering semenÅ› concentration and volume. There was significance (P< 0. 05) considering time in the 25 collections, weekly collections, concentrations, Neubauer chambers and the total, while the interaction time x movement was not significant. The study lead us to conclude that due to the differential condition of the animals which were born from the present hybrid genetics, it is necessary to study the relationship nutrition x reproduction, once the positive effects of the vitamin A supplementation in the semen production was emphasized, mostly in the characteristics that are related to the formation of the sperm cells...|$|R
