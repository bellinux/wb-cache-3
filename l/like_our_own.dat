It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the faint star GJ 3021B orbits {{at a distance of}} 68 AU; it is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V.|$|E

If space and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.|$|E

When Lyra discovers that the powerful Mrs.Coulter, who's hosting Lyra into her house, is running the Gobblers, she flees. Rescued by the Gyptians, Lyra joins them on a trip to the far North, the land of the armoured polar bears, in search of the missing children.|$|E

25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will <b>like</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
500|$|In Raëlian cosmology, our {{observable}} universe is an [...] "atom" [...] {{of a much}} larger level of matter (and possibly organism) and subatomic particles in our bodies also possess universes <b>like</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> but on a much smaller scale. [...] This pattern, atom within universe within atom, is believed to be infinitely repetitive, from the infinitely small, to the infinitely large. [...] The Raëlian Messages by Raël state that humanoid extraterrestrials, who were originally called under the name Elohim (singular: Eloha), verified this cosmology scientifically.|$|E
500|$|Brian Epstein {{managed the}} Beatles from 1962 until his {{untimely}} death in 1967. He had no prior experience managing artists, {{but he had}} a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, [...] "I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me". McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would entertain millions of fans until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, [...] "Love Me Do", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, [...] "Twist and Shout". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With few exceptions—one being the album title itself—Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: [...] "We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that—to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: [...] "He was <b>like</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking hogweed, hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just <b>like</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. It seems {{reasonable to assume that}} the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.|$|E
