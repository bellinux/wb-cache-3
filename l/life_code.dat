5000|$|Gandhi's {{model of}} {{education}} was directed toward his alternative {{vision of the}} social order: [...] "Gandhi’s basic education was, therefore, an embodiment of his perception of an ideal society consisting of small, self-reliant communities with his ideal citizen being an industrious, self-respecting and generous individual living in a small cooperative community.Nai Talim also envisaged a different role for the new teacher, not simply as a professional constrained by curricula and abstract standards, {{but rather as a}} person relating directly to the student {{in the form of a}} dialogue:"A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught, becomes one with them, learns more from them than he teaches them. He who learns nothing from his disciples is, in my opinion, worthless. Whenever I talk with someone I learn from him. I take from him more than I give him. In this way, a true teacher regards himself as a student of his students. If you will teach your pupils with this attitude, you will benefit much from them. Gandhi's disciple, Vinobha Bhave, developed the idea further as a means of social transformation: [...] "The crux of Nai Talim lay in overcoming distinctions between learning and teaching, and knowledge and work. Vinoba discusses the need to redefine the relationship between teacher and student, [...] "they must each regard the other as a fellow worker..." [...] Instead, the ‘teacher’ was to be skilled in a kala/hunar (and to derive sustenance from this and not a teaching salary). The student was to live, work and grow with the teacher and his/her family. In this process s/he would learn the kala/hunar — the skill as part of a way of <b>life,</b> <b>code</b> of ethics, web of relationships, etc.".Finally, Nai Talim was conceived as a response to one of the main dialectics of modernity as Gandhi saw it--the dialectic between human being and 'machine' or 'technology': [...] "In this dialectic, man represented the whole of mankind, not just India, and the machine represented the industrialized West." [...] It is for this reason, among others, that Gandhi placed such central emphasis in his pedagogy on the role of handcrafts such as spinning; they symbolized the values of self-sufficiency or Swaraj and independence or Swadeshi.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{software}} (code) on the spatial formation {{of everyday life}} are best understood through a theoretical framework that utilizes the concepts of technicity (the productive power of technology to make things happen) and transduction (the constant making anew of a domain in reiterative and transformative practices). Examples from the lives of three Londoners illustrate that code makes a difference to everyday life because its technicity alternatively modulates space through processes of transduction. Space needs to be theorized as ontogenetic, that is, understood as continually being brought into existence through transductive practices (practices that change {{the conditions under which}} space is (re) made). The nature of space transduced by code is detailed and illustrated with respect to domestic living, work, communication, transport, and consumption.

40|$|SIMCO Technologies, Inc. was {{contracted}} {{to evaluate the}} durability of the saltstone matrix material and to measure saltstone transport properties. This information will be used to: (1) Parameterize the STADIUM{reg_sign} service <b>life</b> <b>code,</b> (2) Predict the leach rate (degradation rate) for the saltstone matrix over 10, 000 years using the STADIUM{reg_sign} concrete service <b>life</b> <b>code,</b> and (3) Validate the modeled results by conducting leaching (water immersion) tests. Saltstone durability for this evaluation is limited {{to changes in the}} matrix itself and does not include changes in the chemical speciation of the contaminants in the saltstone. This report summarized results obtained to date which include: characterization data for saltstone cured up to 365 days and characterization of saltstone cured for 137 days and immersed in water for 31 days. Chemicals for preparing simulated non-radioactive salt solution were obtained from chemical suppliers. The saltstone slurry was mixed according to directions provided by SRNL. However SIMCO Technologies Inc. personnel made a mistake in the premix proportions. The formulation SIMCO personnel used to prepare saltstone premix was not the reference mix proportions: 45 wt% slag, 45 wt% fly ash, and 10 wt% cement. SIMCO Technologies Inc. personnel used the following proportions: 21 wt% slag, 65 wt% fly ash, and 14 wt% cement. The mistake was acknowledged and new mixes have been prepared and are curing. The results presented in this report are assumed to be conservative since the excessive fly ash was used in the SIMCO saltstone. The SIMCO mixes are low in slag which is very reactive in the caustic salt solution. The impact is that the results presented in this report are expected to be conservative since the samples prepared were deficient in slag and contained excess fly ash. The hydraulic reactivity of slag is about four times that of fly ash so the amount of hydrated binder formed per unit volume in the SIMCO saltstone samples is less than that expected for saltstone containing the reference amount of slag (45 wt. % of the total cementitious mixture versus 21 wt. % used in the SIMCO samples). Consequently the SIMCO saltstone samples are expected to have lower strengths, and tortuosity and higher porosity, water diffusivity, and intrinsic permeability compared to the reference case MCU saltstone. MCU reference saltstone contains nonradioactive salt solution with a composition designed to simulate the product of the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction (MCU) Unit [Harbour, 2009]. The SIMCO saltstone samples were cast in molds and cured for three days under plastic with a source of water to prevent drying. Details of the sample preparation process are presented in Attachment 2. The molds were then removed and the samples were cured at a constant temperature (76 F, 24 C) and 100 percent relative humidity for up to one year. Selected samples were periodically removed and characterized the evolution of the matrix as a function of age. In order to preserve the age dependent microstructure at the specified curing times it is necessary to stop hydration. This was accomplished by immersing the samples in isopropanol for 5 days to replace water with alcohol. The microstructure of the matrix material was also characterized as a function of aging. This information was used as a base line for comparison with leached microstructures. After curing for 137 days, specimens were cut into 20 mm disks and exposed to deionized water with a pH maintained at 10. 5. Microstructure and calcium sulfur leaching results for samples leached for 31 days are presented in this report. Insufficient leached material was generated during the testing to date to obtain physical and mineralogical properties for leached saltstone. Longer term experiments are required because the matrix alteration rate due to immersion in deionized water is slow...|$|E
40|$|Design Investigations: The {{effects on}} the power distribuestablished. A {{mathematical}} model was developed for studying shifting of the coolant stream as it moves along a rod in order to predict the temperatures of the parallel streams as they progress through the reactor. A fuelelement <b>life</b> <b>code</b> developed for computing the internal temperature structure, the amount of fission gas released, the internal pressure, the cladding strain when the internal pressure exceeds the coolant pressure, and the creep damage was used for comparing top-loading and inventedloading fuel programs for the EGCR. A statistical method was developed for estimating {{the probability that the}} hot spot on the EGCR fuel element will exceed a given temperature. A method of cooling the EGCR control rods was developed that will minimize diversion of coolant flow through leakage paths between graphite blocks. A preliminary design of a control rod cooled by this method was developed. Means for reducing the thermal stresses in the top head nozzles of the EGCR pressure vessel were studied. The stresses in the graphite sleeves of the EGCR fuel elements were calculated, and the maximum stress was found to be within the allowable limit. A study was made of the thermal stresses in the EGCR pressure-vessel support skirt, and a satisfactory design was developed. Procedures for removing ruthenium and cerium contamination from steel were outlined and incorporated in procedures for decontaminating the EGCR charge and service machines. Experimental information was obtained on the thermal characteristics of the specified EGCR fuel cluster. The effect of relative orientation of adjacent clusters on the heattransfer distribution in the downstream element was studied by means of mass-removal measurements on naphthalene-coated reds. Velocity distributions in the downstream element of two adjacent EGCR-type clusters were determined with Title I H-bar, Title II cylindrical, and Title II conical spiders at various relative orientations.

40|$|This book {{shows that}} modern professions are {{increasingly}} subject {{to an internal}} stratification into two segments. The first part is an elite segment of academics and managers based mainly on status elements. The second is a much wider competitive occupational segment of rank and file practitioners based mainly on expertise. This hypothesis is tested {{with respect to a}} 1997 / 2000 survey based on a sample of 386 professionals representative of physicians, engineers, and lawyers of two close Southern Italian provinces. These provinces can be considered “representative” of the country because the ratio between professionals and general population is as high as it is at the national level (and for physicians, lawyers and engineers, even a little higher). The elite segment may be considered as a Weberian "status group" if we prove that it is a "group which organizes itself horizontally, a community with a certain style of <b>life,</b> <b>code</b> of ethics and self-conscious identity and boundaries to outsiders". Several indicators of a status group have been selected: social origins, educational background, matrimonial and sociability choices, children's educational choices and political affiliation. The survey shows that the elite segment of physicians and lawyers may be considered as a status group, while the elite segment of engineers doesn’t. One of the most clear examples of {{the difference between the two}} segments underlined regards the reasons why the respondents have chosen medicine. The status/elite segment doctors tend to choose for extrinsic reasons (e. g. for prestige), that is they are not relative to doctors' cognitive basis. Lo strato superiore di alcune professioni configura un gruppo di status? È cioè un insieme di individui che gode di un prestigio sociale differenziale per nascita o formazione? Questo l’interrogativo iniziale, evidenziato già dal titolo, da cui hanno preso le mosse le tre ricerche sugli avvocati, gli ingegneri e i medici qui presentate. Per rispondere al quesito occorre verificare che i membri del gruppo in questione siano accomunati non solo dal livello del reddito, ma soprattutto dal sentirsi parte di una collettività che si organizza orizzontalmente e che è caratterizzata da un certo stile di vita, codice etico, identità condivisa e barriere verso gli estranei: in breve, da un ethos professionale specifico. Il libro esamina se e come ciò avviene utilizzando un’ampia serie di indicatori (livello di auto-reclutamento, orientamento politico, ruolo ricoperto nell’Ordine e nelle società scientifiche, grado di soddisfazione professionale, ecc.) e, per questa via, offre anche un accurato ritratto delle professioni coinvolte...|$|E
40|$|A {{robust and}} {{reliable}} code {{to model the}} irradiation behavior of metal and oxide fuels in sodium cooled fast reactors is developed. Modeling capability was enhanced by adopting a non-empirical mechanistic approach to the extent possible, so that to increase the ability to extrapolate the existing database with a reasonable accuracy. Computational models to analyze in-reactor behavior of U-Zr and U-Pu-Zr metallic alloy fuel pins and U 0 2 -PuO 2 mixed oxide fuel pins have been developed and implemented into a new code, the Fuel Engineering and Structural analysis Tool (FEAST). FEAST has several modules working in coupled form with an explicit numerical algorithm. These modules describe (1) Fission Gas Release and Swelling, (2) Fuel Chemistry and Restructuring, (3) Temperature Distribution, (4) Fuel Clad Chemical Interaction, (5) Fuel and Clad Mechanical Analysis and (6) Transient Creep- Fracture Model for the clad. Given the fuel pin geometry, composition and irradiation history, FEAST can analyze fuel and cladding thermo-mechanical behavior at both steady state and design-basis accident scenarios. FEAST was written in FORTRAN- 90 program language. The FEAST-METAL code mechanical analysis module implements the old Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) 's <b>LIFE</b> <b>code</b> algorithm. (cont.) Fission gas release and swelling are modeled with the Korean GRSIS algorithm, {{which is based on}} detailed tracking of the fission gas bubbles within the metal fuel. Migration of the fuel constituents is modeled by means of the thermo-transport theory. Fuel Clad Chemical Interaction (FCCI) models were developed for steady-state and transient situations, based on precipitation kinetics. A transient creep fracture model for the clad, based on the constrained diffusional cavity growth model, was adopted. FEAST-METAL has been benchmarked against available EBR-II database for (steady state) and furnace tests (transients). The results show that the code is able to predict important phenomena such as cladding strain, fission gas release, clad wastage, clad failure time and axial fuel slug deformation, satisfactorily. A similar code for oxide fuels, FEAST-OXIDE, was also developed. It adopts the OGRES model to describe fission gas release and swelling. However, the original OGRES model has been extended to include the effects of Joint Oxide Gain (JOG) formation on fission gas release and swelling. The fuel chemistry model includes diffusion models for radial actinide migration, cesium axial and radial migration, formation of the JOG, and variation of the oxygen to metal ratio. Fuel restructuring is also modeled, and includes the effects of porosity migration, irradiation-induced fuel densification and grain growth. (cont.) The FEAST-OXIDE predictions has been compared to the available FFTF, EBR-II and JOYO databases, and the agreement between the code and data was found to be satisfactory. Both metal and oxide versions of FEAST are rather superior compared to many other fuel codes in the literature. Comparing metal and oxide versions, FEAST-OXIDE has a more sophisticated fission gas release and swelling model, which is based on vacancy flow. In addition, modeling of the chemistry module of the oxide fuel requires a much more detailed analysis to estimate its impact on the thermo-mechanical behavior with a reasonable accuracy. Finally, the melting of the oxide fuel and its effect on the thermo-mechanical performance have been modeled in case of transient scenarios. by Aydin Karahan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
