500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, Lesnar {{announced}} that he was returning to action, stating, [...] "I feel like a new man. Healthy. Strong. I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to feel". His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round. The result of the fight remains controversial, as Overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight. Lesnar then announced his retirement from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying [...] "tonight was the last time you'll see me in the octagon".|$|E

2500|$|Jolson {{had been}} a popular guest star on radio since its {{earliest}} days, including on NBC's The Dodge Victory Hour (January 1928), singing from a New Orleans hotel {{to an audience of}} 35 million via 47 radio stations. His own 1930s shows included Presenting Al Jolson (1932) and Shell Chateau (1935), and he was the host of the Kraft Music Hall from 1947 to 1949, with Oscar Levant as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and he was voted the [...] "Most Popular Male Vocalist" [...] in 1948 by a poll in Variety. The next year, Jolson was named [...] "Personality of the Year" [...] by the Variety Clubs of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of [...] "Mule Train", which {{had been a}} widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how his voice had deepened with age, saying [...] "I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to." ...|$|E

According to the railroad schedule I've got in mind, Chicago and Saint Jo and Paris, France, are asterisk stops--which means you wave a red flag and get on every other Tuesday. I like this little suburb of Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. There's something or somebody doing all the time. I'm clearing $8,000 a year selling automatic pumps, and I'm living like kings-up. Why, yesterday, I was introduced to John W. Gates. I took an auto ride with a wine agent's sister. I saw two men run over by a street car, and I seen Edna May play in the evening. Talk about the West, why, the other night I woke everybody up in the hotel hollering. I dreamed I was walking on a board sidewalk in Oshkosh. What have you got against this town, Jack? There's only one thing in it that I don't care for, and that's a ferryboat." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{like to hear}} Mr. Rogers complimented. I am not stingy in {{compliments}} to him myself. Why, I did it to-day when I {{sent his}} wife a telegram to comfort her. That {{is the kind of}} person I am. I knew she would be uneasy about him. I knew she would be solicitous about what he might do down here, so I did it to quiet her and to comfort her. I said he was doing well for a person out of practice. There is nothing like it. He is <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to be. There were times when I was careless--careless in my dress when I got older. You know how uncomfortable your wife can get when you are going away without her superintendence. Once when my wife could not go with me (she always went with me when she could--I always did meet that kind of luck), I was going to Washington once, a long time ago, in Mr. Cleveland's first administration, and she could not go; but, in her anxiety that I should not desecrate the house, she made preparation. She knew that there was to be a reception of those authors at the White House at seven o'clock in the evening. She said, [...] "If I should tell you now what I want to ask of you, you would forget it before you get to Washington, and, therefore, I have written it on a card, and you will find it in your dress--vest pocket when you are dressing at the Arlington--when you are dressing to see the President." [...] I never thought of it again until I was dressing, and I felt in that pocket and took it out, and it said, in a kind of imploring way, [...] "Don't wear your arctics in the White House." ...|$|E
