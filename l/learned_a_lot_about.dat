25|$|In 1874, Rockefeller {{approached}} Pratt {{with a plan}} {{to cooperate}} and consolidate their businesses. Pratt discussed it with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. Rockefeller had apparently <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> Rogers' talents and negotiating skills during the South Improvement conflict. He quietly accepted the offer on the exact terms Rogers had laid out. In this manner, Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important independent refiners to join the Standard Oil Trust.|$|E
25|$|Just as the Soviets had <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> urban warfare, so had the Germans. The Waffen-SS {{did not use}} {{makeshift}} barricades erected {{close to}} street corners, because these could be raked by artillery fire from guns firing over open sights further along the straight streets. Instead, they put snipers and machine guns on the upper floors and roofs because the Soviet tanks could not elevate their guns that high, and simultaneously they put men armed with panzerfausts in cellar windows to ambush tanks as they moved down the streets. These tactics were quickly adopted by the Hitler Youth and the First World War Volkssturm veterans.|$|E

500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} John Dykstra {{was hired}} to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000. He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer generated, {{as they would have}} been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> using computers during production. Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, [...] "ballet in the sky." [...] The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70million to around $100million. Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{interpret}} the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. [...] Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship {{in such a}} manner that Jake knew [...] "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill." [...] Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to San Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, [...] "you <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> a woman by not sleeping with her." [...] By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the [...] "everyman," [...] and that {{in the course of the}} narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a morality play with Jake as the person who loses the most.|$|E
