5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries.

This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone inside the caldera. A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; Another very small eruption was reported in 2011.

In 1915, trench wireless sets were introduced, but the transmissions were easily intercepted by the listening Germans.|$|E

At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Polein his capacity of chancellorrequested taxation of an unprecedented <b>level</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed.

The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.|$|E
