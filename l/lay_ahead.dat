Divergent national, international approaches send conflicting signals to producers and consumers. As a result, the full potential of the internal food market of EU 28 and its impact on environment are not realized and evaluated on properly identified UNIT basis. Misidentified UNIT for measurement would not give correct results and if one installs his correct assumptions on the wrong unit, the falls results will start following each other.
