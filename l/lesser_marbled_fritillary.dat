40|$|Whilst {{the overall}} {{geographic}} {{range of the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>marbled</b> <b>fritillary,</b> Brenthis ino (Rottemburg, 1775), is currently expanding, this species is patchily distributed at a local spatial scale due to its use of flower rich semi-natural meadows and the aggregated distribution of its host plant. Therefore, understanding the dispersal patterns of this butterfly {{and the effect of}} increasing fragmentation of the landscapes in central and Western Europe on its population dynamics is key to determining whether this patchy distribution can lead to metapopulation structuring and dynamics. One way to determine the degree to which local populations are isolated from one another is to use high resolution molecular genetic markers and thence quantify gene flow and genetic drift. Eleven microsatellite loci have previously been developed for this species, but six showed evidence of null alleles, effectively violating key assumptions of the models used to infer gene flow. We therefore developed a set of new primer pairs to amplify a suite of 16 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci (number of alleles ranged from 2 - 30) of which nine were found to conform to the Hardy-Weinberg's expectations, whilst at the same time not showing any clear signature for the presence of null alleles. We further describe how these primers were optimized for landscape and metapopulation genetics studies in Belgian Ardenne...|$|E
25|$|The Limestone grasslands {{support a}} wide variety of wild flowers, and many rarer {{butterflies}} can be seen. Pearl-bordered fritillary, Duke of Burgundy <b>fritillary,</b> <b>marbled</b> white, dingy skipper and grayling are just some of species that inhabit the national park.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is known}} for its {{invertebrate}} life, including notably marsh fritillary. Other butterlies include small blue, green hairstreak, chalkhill blue, Duke of Burgundy, <b>marbled</b> white, silver-washed <b>fritillary,</b> grizzled skipper, comma and brown argus. Roman snails, heath snail and a rare oil beetle Meloe rugosus are present.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, these owls may prey on {{threatened}} species. Following {{the devastation}} to its populations from DDT, the reintroduction of the peregrine falcon to the Mississippi and Hudson Rivers was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night. Similarly, as mainly recorded in New England, attempts to reintroduce ospreys, {{after they were}} also hit hard by DDT, were effected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of roseate terns. Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the Pacific Northwest, spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation. While at least the ospreys and peregrines have rebounded admirably nonetheless, bird and mammal species that are much rarer overall sometimes fall prey to great horned owls, many in which even sporadic losses can be devastating. Among the species considered threatened, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN which are also known to be killed by great horned owls are Townsend's ground squirrels (Urocitellus townsendii), Pacific pocket mice (Perognathus pacificus), giant kangaroo rats, Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi), black-footed ferrets, greater and <b>lesser</b> prairie chickens, <b>marbled</b> murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), ivory-billed woodpeckers, Florida scrub jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), pinyon jays, Kirtland's warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) and rusty blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus). The American Bird Conservancy's “green list” includes birds with considerable population declines (many classed as near threatened by the IUCN) or other immediate threats and/or restricted populations. Altogether, great horned owls hunt 50 different species from that list.|$|R
