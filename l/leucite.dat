25|$|After M.H. Klaproth had {{discovered}} the presence of potassium in <b>leucite</b> and lepidolite, it occurred to L. N. Vauquelin that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. Knowing that alum cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient in the salt, and in 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. Soon after, J.A. Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum and alum manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as Vauquelin.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{refers to}} {{research}} {{conducted in the}} tectonic-karst depression of Campo Felice in the central Apennines (Italy), in which glacial, alluvial and lacustrine sediments have been preserved. Stratigraphic interpretations of sediments underlying the Campo Felice Plain are based on evidence obtained from nine continuous-core boreholes. The boreholes reach a depth of 120 m and provide evidence of five sedimentation cycles separated by erosion surfaces. Each cycle is interpreted as an initial response to a mainly warm stage, characterized by low-energy alluvial and colluvial deposition, pedogenesis, and limited episodes of marsh formation. In turn, a mainly cold stage follows during which a lake formed, and glaciers developed and expanded, leading to deposition of glacial and fluvioglacial deposits. The chronological framework is established by eleven accelerator mass spectrometer 14 C ages and three 39 Ar– 40 Ar ages on <b>leucites</b> from interbedded tephra layers. These age determinations indicate five glacial advances that respectively occurred during marine oxygen isotope stages 2, 3 – 4, 6, 10 and 14...|$|R

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} behaviour (up to 30 kbar) of dehydrated analcime, Na[AlSi 2 O 6], {{has been}} studied in detail using polarized microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy. Samples were compressed using a diamond anvil cell in a quasi-hydrostatic medium (glycerol or water-ice). Two transitions at 3. 7 and 11 kbar were observed. At the first transition, phase II is observed under cross polarized light as a contrasting black zone, moving from the edge to {{the centre of the}} sample. At this transition the strong Raman doublet at ~ 480 and 500 cm 1 transforms discontinuously to a singlet, which {{is similar to that of}} quasi-cubic natural analcime. This transition, with an increase of effective symmetry, seems unusual on increasing pressure. The analcime framework may be thought of as an array of four-, six-, or eight-membered interconnected rings. Phase transitions in the analcime group are considered in the literature in terms of deformations of the six-membered rings. However, the present work shows that these phase transitions should be associated with deformations of the four-membered rings (as the minimum size secondary building units) by rotation of rigid TO 4 units. The strongest Raman band frequency is correlated with the mean T-O-T angle inside the four-membered ring: a rate of 4. 5 cm 1 /degree was found for analcimes and <b>leucites.</b> Using this correlation, one can estimate from Raman data the possible deformation of four-membered rings at the phase transitions...|$|R

6000|$|Near Tagus or Banks' Cove, I {{examined}} one {{of these}} great streams of lava, which is remarkable from the evidence of its former high degree of fluidity, especially when its composition is considered. Near the sea-coast this stream is several miles in width. It consists of a black, compact base, easily fusible into a black bead, with angular and not very numerous air-cells, and thickly studded with large, fractured crystals of glassy albite, varying from the tenth of an inch to half an inch in diameter. (In the Cordillera of Chile, I have seen lava very closely resembling this variety at the Galapagos Archipelago. It contained, however, besides the albite, well-formed crystals of augite, and the base (perhaps in consequence of the aggregation of the augitic particles) was a shade lighter in colour. I may here remark, that in all these cases, I call the feldspathic crystals, [...] "albite," [...] from their cleavage-planes (as measured by the reflecting goniometer) corresponding with those of that mineral. As, however, other species of this genus have lately been discovered to cleave in nearly the same planes with albite, this determination must be considered as only provisional. I examined the crystals in the lavas of many {{different parts of the}} Galapagos group, and I found that none of them, with the exception of some crystals from one part of James Island, cleaved in the direction of orthite or potash-feldspar.) This lava, although at first sight appearing eminently porphyritic, cannot properly be considered so, for the crystals have evidently been enveloped, rounded, and penetrated by the lava, like fragments of foreign rock in a trap-dike. This was very clear in some specimens of a similar lava, from Abingdon Island, in which the only difference was, that the vesicles were spherical and more numerous. The albite in these lavas is in a similar condition with the <b>leucite</b> of Vesuvius, and with the olivine, described by Von Buch, as projecting in great balls from the basalt of Lanzarote. ("Description des Isles Canaries" [...] page 295.) Besides the albite, this lava contains scattered grains of a green mineral, with no distinct cleavage, and closely resembling olivine (Humboldt mentions that he mistook a green augitic mineral, occurring in the volcanic rocks of the Cordillera of Quito, for olivine.); but as it fuses easily into a green glass, it belongs probably to the augitic family: at James Island, however, a similar lava contained true olivine. I obtained specimens from the actual surface, and from a depth of four feet, but they differed in no respect. The high degree of fluidity of this lava-stream was at once evident, from its smooth and gently sloping surface, from {{the manner in which the}} main stream was divided by small inequalities into little rills, and especially from the manner in which its edges, far below its source, and where it must have been in some degree cooled, thinned out to almost nothing; the actual margin consisting of loose fragments, few of which were larger than a man's head. The contrast between this margin, and the steep walls, above twenty feet high, bounding many of the basaltic streams at Ascension, is very remarkable. It has generally been supposed that lavas abounding with large crystals, and including angular vesicles, have possessed little fluidity; but we see that the case has been very different at Albemarle Island. (The irregular and angular form of the vesicles is probably caused by the unequal yielding of a mass composed, in almost equal proportion, of solid crystals and of a viscid base. It certainly seems a general circumstance, as might have been expected, that in lava, which has possessed a high degree of fluidity, AS WELL AS AN EVEN-SIZED GRAIN, the vesicles are internally smooth and spherical.) The degree of fluidity in different lavas, does not seem to correspond with any APPARENT corresponding amount of difference in their composition: at Chatham Island, some streams, containing much glassy albite and some olivine, are so rugged, that they may be compared to a sea frozen during a storm; whilst the great stream at Albemarle Island is almost as smooth as a lake when ruffled by a breeze. At James Island, black basaltic lava, abounding with small grains of olivine, presents an intermediate degree of roughness; its surface being glossy, and the detached fragments resembling, in a very singular manner, folds of drapery, cables, and pieces of the bark of trees. (A specimen of basaltic lava, with a few small broken crystals of albite, given me by one of the officers, is perhaps worthy of description. It consists of cylindrical ramifications, some of which are only the twentieth of an inch in diameter, and are drawn out into the sharpest points. The mass has not been formed like a stalactite, for the points terminate both upwards and downwards. Globules, only the fortieth of an inch in diameter, have dropped from some of the points, and adhere to the adjoining branches. The lava is vesicular, but the vesicles never reach the surface of the branches, which are smooth and glossy. As it is generally supposed that vesicles are always elongated in the direction of the movement of the fluid mass, I may observe, that in these cylindrical branches, which vary from a quarter to only the twentieth of an inch in diameter, every air-cell is spherical.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In pre-Tertiary rocks <b>leucite</b> readily {{decomposes}} {{and changes}} to zeolites, analcite and other secondary minerals. <b>Leucite</b> also {{is rare in}} plutonic rocks and dike rocks, but <b>leucite</b> syenite and <b>leucite</b> tinguaite {{bear witness to the}} possibility that it may occur in this manner. The rounded shape of its crystals, their white or grey color, and absence of planar cleavage make the presence of <b>leucite</b> easily determinable in many of these rocks by inspection, especially when the crystals are large."Pseudoleucites" [...] are rounded areas consisting of feldspar, nepheline, analcite, &c., which have the shape, composition and sometimes even the outward crystalline shape of leucite; they are probably pseudomorphs or paramorphs, which have developed from <b>leucite</b> because this mineral is not stable at ordinary temperatures and can be expected under favorable conditions to undergo spontaneous change into an aggregate of other minerals. <b>Leucite</b> is very often accompanied by nepheline, sodalite or nosean; other minerals which make their appearance with some frequency are melanite, garnet and melilite.|$|E

50|$|The leucite-hearing dike-rocks {{are members}} of the tinguaite and monchiquite groups. The <b>leucite</b> tinguaites are usually pale grey or greenish in color and consist principally of nepheline, alkali {{feldspar}} and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like patches and growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered acicular prisms, among the feldspars and nephelines of the ground mass. Where <b>leucite</b> occurs, it is always euhedral in small, equant, many-sided crystals in the ground mass, or in larger masses which have the same characters as the pseudoleucites.

Rocks of this group are known from Rio de Janeiro, Arkansas, Kola Peninsula (in Russia), Montana and a few other places., In Greenland there are <b>leucite</b> tinguaites with much arfvedsonite, (hornblende) and eudialyte.

50|$|Incongruent melting {{occurs when}} a solid {{substance}} does not melt uniformly, decomposing into another solid and a liquid with different compositions.

50|$|Those <b>leucite</b> rocks {{which contain}} {{abundant}} essential plagioclase feldspar {{are known as}} <b>leucite</b> tephrites and <b>leucite</b> basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, <b>leucite</b> and augite, while the latter contain olivine in addition. The <b>leucite</b> is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass. It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline may also occur. The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are black or ashy-grey in color, often vesicular, and may contain many large grey phenocysts of <b>leucite.</b> Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens.
