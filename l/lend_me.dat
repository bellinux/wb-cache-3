Munch says, [...] "Great, let's arrest Axl Rose", a Guns N' Roses musician, when he is told the suspect in a murder is blond. During one scene, the detectives eat steamed crabs. This was {{deliberately}} included in the episode to reflect the culinary culture of Baltimore, where eating crabs is extremely popular. During a discussion about Pembleton, Crosetti compares him to the lone wolf character played by actor Gary Cooper in the 1952 western film High Noon; when trying to recall {{the title of the}} film, Crosetti said the character had a New York City type of attitude, prompting Lewis to believe he is referring to the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees, also starring Cooper.|$|E

2500|$|Alongside his {{full-time}} {{job as an}} MP, he continued editing The Spectator, writing columns for The Daily Telegraph and GQ, and making television appearances. He also published a book, Friends, Voters, Countrymen: Jottings on the Stump, which recounted his experiences with the 2001 election campaign. His next publication was 2003's <b>Lend</b> <b>Me</b> Your Ears, a collection of previously published columns and articles. In 2004 {{this was followed by}} his first novel, Seventy-Two Virgins: A Comedy of Errors, which revolved around the life of a Conservative MP and contained various biographical elements. Responding to critics who argued that he was juggling too many positions, he cited prominent Conservative politicians Winston Churchill and Benjamin Disraeli as exemplars who combined their political and writing careers. To manage the stress he took up jogging and cycling, and became so well known for the latter that Gimson suggested that he was [...] "perhaps the most famous cyclist in Britain".|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben {{full title}} to the former Zabriskie estate.

Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it." [...] On November6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg), noting [...] "My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you the money, you so generously <b>lend</b> <b>me</b> and all my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected. All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House." [...] Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909.

2500|$|The conspirators {{make clear}} that they {{committed}} this murder {{for the good of}} Rome, not for their own purposes, and do not attempt to flee the scene. Brutus delivers an oration defending his own actions, and for the moment, the crowd is on his side. However, Mark Antony makes a subtle and eloquent speech over Caesar's corpse, beginning with the much-quoted [...] "Friends, Romans, countrymen, <b>lend</b> <b>me</b> your ears!" [...] In this way, he deftly turns public opinion against the assassins by manipulating the emotions of the common people, in contrast to the rational tone of Brutus's speech, yet there is method in his rhetorical speech and gestures: he reminds them of the good Caesar had done for Rome, his sympathy with the poor, and his refusal of the crown at the Lupercal, thus questioning Brutus's claim of Caesar's ambition; he shows Caesar's bloody, lifeless body to the crowd to have them shed tears and gain sympathy for their fallen hero; and he reads Caesar's will, in which every Roman citizen would receive 75 drachmas. Antony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to drive the conspirators from Rome. Amid the violence, an innocent poet, Cinna, is confused with the conspirator Lucius Cinna and is taken by the mob, which kills him for such [...] "offenses" [...] as his bad verses.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will <b>lend</b> <b>me</b> the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E
