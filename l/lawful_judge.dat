5000|$|In story II. king Nebka {{plays the}} key-role. He is {{depicted}} {{there as a}} strict, but <b>lawful</b> <b>judge,</b> who doesn't allow mischief and misbehaviour to occur. The adulterous wife of the story's hero is punished by being burnt alive and her secret lover, revealed thanks to the loyal caretaker, is eaten alive by a summoned crocodile. Caretaker and crocodile are {{playing the role of}} justice, whilst king Nebka plays the role of the destiny. Lepper and Liechtheim evaluate the depiction of king Nebka as being fairly positive. A strict but lawful pharaoh was ideal {{for the people of the}} author's lifetime.|$|E

A este respecto, es objeto de análisis su contenido {{material}} -identificado con la tutela de la independencia e imparcialidad judiciales-, así como el contenido formal, referido a la necesidad de que el juez resulte legalmente determinado de forma previa y general. The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the treatment that the right to the <b>lawful</b> <b>judge</b> receives in the German Basic Law. In this respect, the author analyses the content of the right - which is related to the guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality -, as well as the formal requirement, referred to the necessity that the judge be predetermined by law respecting the principle of the universal application of the law...|$|E
60|$|It {{is certain}} we may {{hope to see}} the trust of a grand juryman best {{discharged}} when gentlemen of the best fortunes and understandings attend that service, but it is as certain we must never expect to see such men on juries, if for differing with a judge in opinion, when they only are the <b>lawful</b> <b>judges,</b> they are liable {{to be treated like}} villains, like perjurers, and enemies to their king and country; I say my lord such behaviour to juries will make all gentlemen avoid that duty, and instead of men of interest, of reputation and abilities, our lives, our fortunes, and our reputations must depend upon the basest and meanest of the people.|$|R
60|$|This clandestine {{correspondence}} we {{charge against}} {{him as an}} act of rebellion; for he was bound to lay before the Council the whole of his correspondence relative to the revenue and all the other affairs of the country. We charge it not only as rebellion against the orders of the Company and the laws of the land, but as a wicked plot to destroy this man, by depriving him of any opportunity of defending himself before the Council, his <b>lawful</b> <b>judges.</b> I wish to impress it strongly on your Lordships' minds, that neither the complaints of Mr. Markham nor the exculpations of Durbege Sing were ever made known till Mr. Markham was examined in this hall.|$|R
5000|$|On October 19, 2010, Judge Richard Leon of the U.S District Court of the District of Columbia {{ruled that}} Obaidullah's {{detention}} was <b>lawful.</b> [...] <b>Judge</b> Leon denied Obaidullah’s petition for writ {{of habeas corpus}} after finding he was [...] "more likely than not" [...] an insurgent.|$|R
25|$|The {{university}} asked Judge Miller on July 1, 2008, {{to lift a}} seventeen-month-old injunction preventing {{construction on}} the site of the grove, arguing that the university had satisfied all safety issues and was bearing severe economic hardship due to the delays. The plaintiffs argued that the injunction should only be lifted if the university could provide a <b>lawful</b> project. <b>Judge</b> Miller scheduled a hearing on July 17, 2008, to discuss the request.|$|R
60|$|If {{there be}} one fact {{in the world}} {{perfectly}} clear, it is this,--"that the disposition {{of the people of}} America is wholly averse to any other than a free government"; and this is indication enough to any honest statesman how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their case. If any ask me what a free government is, I answer, that, for any practical purpose, it is what the people think so,--and that they, and not I, are the natural, <b>lawful,</b> and competent <b>judges</b> of this matter. If they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is consistent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for so great a trust, and not to endeavor to prove from thence that they have reasoned amiss, and that, having gone so far, by analogy they must hereafter have no enjoyment but by my pleasure.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} language {{at issue}} was section 10 of the Patent Act of 1793:That upon oath or affirmation being made, {{before the judge}} of the district court, where the patentee, his executors, administrators or assigns reside, that any patent, which shall be issued in pursuance of this act, was obtained surreptitiously, or upon false suggestion, and motion made to the said court, within three years after issuing the said patent, but not afterwards, it shall and may be <b>lawful</b> for the <b>judge</b> of the said district court, if the matter alleged shall appear to him to be sufficient, to grant a rule, that the patentee, or his executor, administrator or assign show cause, why process should not issue against him to repeal such patent. And if sufficient cause shall not be shown to the contrary, the rule shall be made absolute, and thereupon the said judge shall order process to be issued against such patentee, or his executors, administrators or assigns, with costs of suit. And in case no sufficient cause shall be shown to the contrary, or if it shall appear that the patentee was not the true inventor or discoverer, judgment shall be rendered by such court for the repeal of such patent; and if the party, at whose complaint, the process issued, shall have judgment given against him, he shall pay all such costs, as the defendant shall be put to, in defending the suit, to be taxed by the court, and recovered in due course of law.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2014, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insinuated {{that she}} found Snowden's motives suspicious, saying [...] "We have all these protections for whistle-blowers. If he were {{concerned}} {{and wanted to be}} part of the American debate, he could have been...it struck me as...sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships...turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority." [...] Supporters and advisers of Snowden called Clinton's remarks unrealistic and pointed out several misunderstandings, telling Politico that Snowden could not have availed himself of whistleblower protections because he was a contractor, not a government employee, and because his claims would not have been seen as exposing impropriety, since the NSA telephone program was legal. As PEN America wrote, in January 2013, shortly before Snowden made his disclosures, [...] "Congress significantly weakened existing whistleblower protections for national security contractors by passing a law that removed most of their pre-existing rights. President Obama did issue a directive in 2012 that provided intelligence community contractors who pursue internal channels to raise concerns about misconduct with protection from security clearance retaliation, but the directive didn’t go into effect until after Snowden's disclosures and would not have protected him from other forms of retaliation. These confusing procedural developments aside, Snowden's case underscores a far more fundamental issue for intelligence community workers: trying to blow the whistle through internal channels is nearly impossible when it concerns an institutionally accepted program that has been <b>judged</b> <b>lawful</b> by political leaders or Congress." ...|$|R
