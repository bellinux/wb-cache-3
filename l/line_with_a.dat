5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E

On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal. The kick ricocheted {{off one of the}} uprights but through the goal posts, extending the Seminoles' lead to 2317 with 10:13 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} Florida State's kickoff {{to their}} 23-yard line. After an incomplete pass, the Hokies gained {{a first down}} at their 33-yard <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short pass. After the first down, Noel was sacked on successive plays. During the second sack, Florida State lineman Darnell Dockett collided with Noel's helmet, twisting Dockett's knee. Following the injury, Tech sent in backup quarterback Bryan Randall to attempt a long pass. The pass was intercepted by Florida State with 19seconds remaining in the game. Following the interception, the Seminoles ran out the clock and secured a 3017 win.|$|E
5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line ticket hall, three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. This will be done {{in conjunction with the}} major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create thousands of new homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E

5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, {{the second}} quarter featured three turnovers, and at half time, Penn State led 6–3 with two field goals from senior kicker Sam Ficken. On Penn State's first drive in the second half, Allen Robinson returned and caught a screen pass, which he ran for 25 yards, and then a 51-yard touchdown pass to make the score 13–3. On the ensuing drive, however, Syracuse came right back and scored a touchdown via a Jerome Smith 10-yard run. Early in the fourth quarter, Ficken made his third field goal of the day, a career-long 46 yards. Later in the quarter, Hackenberg threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to Eugene Lewis to make the score 23–10. When only down by 6 points, Syracuse got the ball around their own 45-yard <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little over two minutes left, but turned the ball over via an interception with under two minutes to play.|$|E
5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E

In the November17 game against Georgetown, with Temple maintaining a one point lead with 23seconds left, Moore missed {{the front end}} of a one-and-one foul shot. Afterwards, Greg Monroe of Georgetown hit a layup to give the Hoyas a 46–45 victory. The following game against Siena, Moore was at the foul <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> one-point lead and, with 22seconds left, hit both free throws to hand Temple a 73–69 victory. He increased his scoring average to 9.8points per game in conference play, receiving more minutes due to a head injury to teammate Juan Fernandez. On February20,2010, he scored a season-high 24points in an overtime victory over city rival Saint Joseph's, and made a critical fullcourt layup with 1.5seconds left to send the game into overtime. Moore helped Temple to a 29–5 record and a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. He was named Atlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year.|$|E
