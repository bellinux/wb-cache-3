Analysis and tests showed that two such devices, inserted by an astronaut into receptacles {{on opposite sides of}} the electronics package, would reduce the diurnal temperature variation by about 40 % and thereby would considerably increase the reliability of 50, 000 welded connections. The LSM design constraints, selection of a variable conductance technique, heat pipe/radiator design features, and thermal performance are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Ultra low {{frequency}} (ULF) monochromatic {{waves in the}} dominant frequency range 8.3 × 10 ^- 3 to 1.0 × 10 ^- 2 Hz with large amplitudes have also been detected around the lunar dayside as well as terminator region from Kaguya when Moon was in the upstream solar wind flow (Nakagawa et al. 2012). The possible source mechanisms of these waves were considered as the cyclotron resonance between the magnetohydrodynamic waves and the solar wind protons that are reflected from the Moon. The energy of the reflected protons can account for {{the energy of the}} ULF waves. Narrow band (0.04 – 0.17 Hz) ion-cyclotron waves have been reported to be present at the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> when the Moon was in the terrestrial magnetotail, based on the observation of Apollo 15 and 16 <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Magnetometers.</b> The observed differences in wave amplitude and phase at the Apollo 15 and 16 sites suggested that the wave signals were modified by the mini-magnetosphere above the Apollo 16 site. All these observations show that the electromagnetic environment around the Moon is dynamic.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{field and}} {{transfer}} function amplitudes, {{resulting from a}} transverse electromagnetic wave in the interplanetary medium scattering from the moon and its diamagnetic cavity, are presented. Calculations are made using an asymmetric scattering theory for a spherical two-layer model of the lunar electrical conductivity profile and a nonconducting cylindrical model of the downstream lunar plasma void. Both the field and transfer function magnitudes are calculated as functions of position {{on the surface of}} the moon for frequencies relevant to the observations of the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and orbiting <b>magnetometers.</b> The amplitudes of the magnetic field components on the cavity boundary are also computed as functions of frequency and distance downstream from the lunar limb. Comparisons of the results are made with those of (1) spherically symmetric descriptions of lunar electromagnetic scattering, (2) the quasi-static approximation to asymmetric scattering theory, and (3) observations of the scattering phenomenon by <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and orbiting <b>magnetometers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Theoretical and {{computational}} {{techniques were}} developed for calculating the time dependent electromagnetic response of a radially inhomogeneous moon. The techniques {{were used to}} analyze the experimental data from the LSM (<b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer)</b> thus providing an in-depth diagnostic of the Lunar interior. The theory was also incorporated into an existing computer code designed to calculate the thermal evolution of planetary bodies.

It is shown that the night side {{response of the}} moon is not that of a sphere in vacuum. Instead, hydromagnetic radiation scattered from the moon is strongly confined to {{the interior of the}} cavity formed downstream from the moon in the solar wind...|$|E
40|$|The Apollo 16 <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> (LSM) {{activation}} {{completed the}} network installation of magnetic observatories on {{the lunar surface}} and initiated simultaneous measurements of the global response of the moon to large-scale solar and terrestrial magnetic fields. Fossil remanent magnetic fields have been measured at nine locations on the lunar surface, including the Apollo 16 LSM site in the Descartes highlands area. This fossil record indicates the possible existence of an ancient lunar dynamo or a solar or terrestrial field much stronger than exists at present. The experimental technique and operation of the LSM are described and the results obtained are discussed...|$|E

The composition of geological samples from the landing site are discussed including the Cayley Formation and the Descartes highlands. The geological data substantiates the belief that lunar terra is underlain by plagioclase or anorthositic rocks. Other results are discussed for the following experiments: soil mechanics, passive and active seismic, <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and portable <b>magnetometer,</b> far camera/spectrograph, solar wind composition, cosmic ray, and spectrometer...|$|R
40|$|A {{network of}} <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and {{orbiting}} <b>magnetometers</b> {{was used to}} obtain measurements of electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the lunar interior. An exceptionally large solar transient event, when the moon was in a geomagnetic tail lobe, enabled the most accurate lunar electromagnetic sounding information to date to be obtained. A new analytical technique using a network of two <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometers</b> and a satellite magnetometer superimposes many time series measurements to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and uses both the amplitude and phase information of all three vector components of the magnetic field data. Size constraints on a hypothetical highly conducting lunar core are investigated {{with the aid of}} the permeability results...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and orbital <b>magnetometer</b> {{records are}} reexamined, to {{ascertain}} intervals {{which may be}} suitable for measuring lunar inductive response in the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosheath. Power spectral estimates of the response tangent to the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface,</b> {{defined in terms of}} transfer and gain functions, are obtained for the 0. 0001 - 0. 01 Hz frequency range. The maximum consistency of estimates from different time intervals is found when the initial analysis is limited to the tangential direction of maximum incident power, or that direction in which the ratio of signal to background noise is greatest. Spherically symmetric plasma confinement theory is used in the interpretation of transfer function data, by way of forward model calculations, under the assumption of continuous electrical conductivity increase with depth. Results are presented for internal electrical conductivity profile, metallic core radius, and selenotherm limits...|$|R
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{response of}} the Moon to excitation by the time dependent fluctuations of the interplanetary magnetic field is given for the dark or antisolar hemisphere of the Moon. Six hours of time series data from the Explorer 35 magnetometer and the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> on Apollo 12 are used to obtain the Fourier spectral amplitudes of the surface and interplanetary fields from which transfer functions are calculated for the east-west, north-south, and vertical directions at the Apollo site. A critical discussion of lunar conductivity profiles derived from night side radial magnetic field data and vacuum scattering theory is presented. Limitations are shown {{that there is no}} evidence for a lunar core as conducting as 0. 01 mhos/m...|$|E
40|$|The strong {{anisotropy}} in Apollo 15 <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Magnetometer</b> (LSM) signals {{resulting from}} electromagnetic induction in the moon, forced by fluctuations of the interplanetary magnetic field, {{is shown to}} result from intense polarization of the induced field. Arguments are given {{to show that the}} anisotropy cannot be explained wholly by asymmetric lunar induction {{in the presence of the}} diamagnetic cavity, but must be related to a regional influence. The weaker Apollo 12 anisotropy may also be associated with a regional influence. The site of Apollo 15 LSM at the edge of the Imbrium Basin suggests a preliminary model for calculations based on the possibility that Imbrium and perhaps Serenitatis are sources of the regional effect. Lastly, since the very low frequency induction seems free of the anisotropy, our earlier estimate of deep conductivity remains unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Apollo 12 and 15 <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> {{data with}} {{simultaneous}} lunar orbiting Explorer 35 data {{are used to}} plot hysteresis curves for the whole moon. From these curves a whole-moon permeability mu = 1. 029 + 0. 024 or - 0. 019 is calculated. This result implies that the moon is not composed entirely of paramagnetic material, but that ferromagnetic material such as free iron exists in sufficient amounts to dominate the bulk lunar susceptibility. From the magnetic data the ferromagnetic free iron abundance is calculated. Then for assumed compositional models of the moon the additional paramagnetic iron is determined, yielding total lunar iron content. The calculated abundances are as follows: ferromagnetic free iron = 5 + or - 4 wt. percent, and total iron in the moon = 9 + or - 4 wt. percent...|$|E
40|$|An {{upper limit}} {{is placed on}} the average crustal {{conductivity}} from an investigation of toroidal (V x B) induction in the moon, using ten-minute data intervals of simultaneous <b>lunar</b> orbiting and <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> data. Crustal conductivity is determined as a function of crust thickness. For an average global crust thickness of about 80 km, the crust surface electrical conductivity is of the order of 1 hundred millionth mho/m. The toroidal-induction results lower the surface-conductivity limit obtained from poloidal-induction results by approximately four orders of magnitude. In addition, a thermoelectric (Seebeck effect) generator model is presented as a magnetic-field source for thermoremanent magnetization of the lunar crust during its solidification and cooling. Magnetic fields from 1000 to 10, 000 gammas are calculated for various crater and crustal geometries. Solidified crustal material cooling through the iron Curie temperature in the presence of such ancient lunar fields could have received thermoremanent magnetization consistent with that measured in most returned lunar samples...|$|R
40|$|Discussion of the {{properties}} of both the stationary and portable magnetometers used in the Apollo program to measure static and dynamic fields on the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b> A stationary <b>magnetometer</b> is described in which the three orthogonal vector components of the magnetic field are measured by three fluxgate sensors which are located {{at the ends of}} three orthogonal booms and contain ferromagnetic cores driven to saturation by means of a periodic current. In the Apollo 16 magnetometer special high-stability ring-core sensors were used which provided an output voltage to the analog-to-digital converter which is proportional to the magnetic field. A portable magnetometer is described which consists of a set of three orthogonal fluxgate sensors mounted on top of a tripod connected to an electronics box by a ribbon cable. The above-mentioned stationary magnetometer simultaneously measured the time-varying components of the field which were later subtracted from the portable magnetometer measurements to give the desired resultant steady field values caused by the magnetized crustal material...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{magnetic}} field observations together with crucial plasma measurements by the Explorer 35 lunar orbiter and Apollo surface and orbital experiments have established the basic {{nature of the}} moon's interaction with the solar wind and interplanetary {{magnetic field}}. The effective absorption of the incident solar wind by the moon creates a plasma void or cavity behind the moon. The cavity-associated magnetic signature is characterized by an enhancement in magnetic field magnitude B within the cavity {{as compared with the}} mean level of B in the surrounding interplanetary plasma and dips or decreases in B near the cavity boundaries with the solar wind. Apollo particle and field measurements on the lunar surface have provided evidence of a regional interaction of the highly conducting solar wind with lunar remanent magnetic fields. Simultaneous plasma and magnetic field data, from the spectrometer and the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> at the Apollo 12 location, show the compression of the local remanent field by large solar wind and magnetosheath plasma dynamic pressures...|$|E

The corresponding global induced dipole moment is 2. 1 x 10 to the 18 th power gauss-cucm for typical inducing fields of. 1000 gauss in the lunar environment. From the permeability measurement, lunar free iron abundance is determined to be 2. 5 + or - 2. 0 wt. %. Total iron abundance is calculated for two assumed compositional models of the lunar interior: a free iron/orthopyroxene lunar composition and a free iron/olivine composition. The overall lunar total iron abundance is determined to be 9. 0 + or - 4. 7 wt. %.

40|$|The {{polarization}} of magnetometer signals detected at the Apollo 15 Hadley site by the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> {{has been studied}} to determine {{the source of the}} signal anisotropy which is observed and caused by the polarization. Instrument and data chain malfunction (cross-talk) seems ruled out. The source appears real and apparently connected with the Imbrium basin using reasonable inferences regarding the electromagnetic structure of the Moon. A theory is developed using moons with holes and conducting caps where the Imbrium basin is; results of calculations are consistent, though not unique, in specifying an anomaly in the electrical conductivity underlying Mare Imbrium. Distinct differences are noted from plasma sheet and diamagnetic cavity transfer functions, but the lobes appear, as for all other data, not to be vacuum for study of the moon. A discussion is given of problems connected with transfer of data, software, and theoretical programs from NASA Ames Research Center to the University of Arizona, and a summary is given of the conversion from IBM to CDC formats...|$|E
40|$|A larger set of {{simultaneous}} {{data from}} the Apollo 12 <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> <b>magnetometer</b> and the Explorer 35 Ames magnetometer are used to construct a whole-moon hysteresis curve, from which a new value of global lunar permeability is determined to be mu = 1. 012 + or - 0. 006.

40|$|The {{asymmetric}} lunar {{electromagnetic induction}} theory of Schubert et al. (1973) is tested by {{using data from}} the Apollo 12 <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Magnetometer</b> and from the Ames magnetometer on Explorer 35. The comparison of data and theory shows that the moon displays an induction asymmetry due to the flow of the solar wind and the formation of the diamagnetic cavity on the darkside. It is inferred that the induced field forms a magnetospheric-like configuration, with the field confined mostly to the crust of the moon. Although the magnetospheric spectrum is time-dependent for all frequencies examined, the distance traveled by the solar wind is so large that a quasi-static magnetospheric configuration can be assumed. The differential power spectrum of the interplanetary magnetic field that excites the moon is compared with the resulting induction spectrum, which has a linear differential power frequency dependence over the frequency range from. 0002 to. 02 Hz, falling off on either side of these limits. The integrated power in this band is about 5 gamma squared for the interplanetary field local north-south component and about 12 gamma squared for the induced spectrum of this component on the lunar surface...|$|E

40|$|Robotic and manned {{spacecraft}} from the Apollo era {{demonstrated that the}} <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> in daylight will charge to positive potentials of a few tens of volts because the photoelectron current dominates the charging process. In contrast, potentials of the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> in darkness which were predicted {{to be on the}} order of a hundred volts negative in the Apollo era have been shown more recently to reach values of a few hundred volts negative with extremes on the order of a few kilovolts. The recent measurements of night time <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> potentials are based on electron beams in the Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer data sets interpreted as evidence for secondary electrons generated on the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> accelerated through a plasma sheath from a negatively charged <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b> The spacecraft potential was not evaluated in these observations and therefore represents a lower limit to the magnitude of the <b>lunar</b> negative <b>surface</b> potential.

However, recent Interstellar Boundary Explorer, Chandrayaan- 1, and Kaguya observations showed that the interaction process between the solar wind ions and the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> is more complex than previously assumed. In contrast to previous assumptions, a large fraction of the impinging solar wind ions is backscattered as energetic neutral atoms.
