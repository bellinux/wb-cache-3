5|$|Also in 2015, {{work began}} on {{bypassing}} the 1960s interchange with US23 near Brighton. A {{new set of}} through <b>lanes</b> was built on I-96 between the current eastbound and westbound <b>lanes</b> with three new bridges over northbound and southbound US23, and over Old US23. The existing <b>lanes</b> of I-96 were changed to be collector-distributor <b>lanes</b> for ramp traffic. This project was completed in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|I-695 widens to nine <b>lanes</b> past {{interchange}} with I-95, {{with five}} <b>lanes</b> in the southbound direction and four <b>lanes</b> in the northbound direction. Running northwest, it crosses over Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor {{and comes to}} a partial interchange with US 1 (Southwestern Boulevard), with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. From here, it continues northwest through residential areas of Catonsville to an interchange with MD 372 (Wilkens Avenue). Narrowing to eight <b>lanes</b> total, with four <b>lanes</b> in each direction, beyond MD 372, the route continues through suburban neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with MD 144 (Frederick Road). At this point, I-695 narrows to seven <b>lanes,</b> with three southbound <b>lanes</b> and four northbound <b>lanes.</b> It continues north and interchanges with Edmondson Avenue before turning northwest and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) near the defunct Westview Mall, now a big-box complex. Beyond US 40, I-695 continues north through residential areas, narrowing to six <b>lanes,</b> with three <b>lanes</b> in each direction, before coming to a four-level stack interchange with I-70 in Woodlawn.|$|E
5|$|The four lane road splits into {{a divided}} highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a {{complicated}} interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW / Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the <b>lanes</b> from Brown's Line diverge and form the collector <b>lanes</b> of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps {{to and from}} the QEW / Gardiner pass over the southbound <b>lanes</b> and converge to form the express <b>lanes.</b> This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express <b>lanes</b> provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while the collector <b>lanes</b> provide local access between those interchanges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this report, we {{introduce}} a mono-vision based <b>lane</b> detection method (pure mono-vision without the aide {{of any other}} sensor). The <b>lane</b> detection method consists of the sub-parts of <b>lane</b> mark segment extraction, <b>lane</b> model fitting, and <b>lane</b> tracking. The <b>lane</b> mark segment extractor is based on some criteria that are only related to the inherent physical properties of the <b>lane</b> marks. The <b>lane</b> model is parameterized in the world (the ground plane) reference instead of in the image reference. The <b>lane</b> tracking is {{carried out in the}} framework of the particle filter, including the evolution and the update of the <b>lane</b> state; a mechanism that executes on-line estimation of the vehicle pitch angle is naturally incorporated in the <b>lane</b> tracking process.
