5|$|The {{evaluation}} of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM classification. This {{is based on}} the size of the primary tumor, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>involvement,</b> and distant metastasis.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>involvement</b> might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E
40|$|An {{asymmetry}} of renal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> {{has been}} found in laboratory mice (BALB/c) with spontaneous blood neoplasms (lymphomas and leukemias). Left <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is more frequently involved and its enlargement (lymphadenopathy) is significantly more expressive in compare to right <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> The difference is not related to sex of animals and histological type of neoplasm. Microscopic pictures of the affected right and left <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> also do not demonstrate differences. The involvement of other pair <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> is not shown to be asymmetrical constantly. It seems that the asymmetry of renal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> is related to more intensive glucocorticoids production by right adrenal gland in compare to left adrenal gland, consequently, higher level of antiproliferative adrenal hormones in lymph which drain from adrenal glands to ipsilateral <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the predictive role of primary tumor histopathological features in predicting inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> {{in patients with}} penile squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed pathological records from 30 consecutive patients who underwent penectomy for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. All histological specimens were reviewed by the same pathologist. We considered the following histological parameters: histological grading, growth pattern, deph invasion, tumour thickness, nuclear grading, poorly differentiated cancer rate, vascular and lymphatic embolization, eosinophilic and mononuclear infiltration and pathological stage. RESULTS: <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> occurred in 5 patients who underwent 'early' lymphadenectomy and in other 4 ones during oncological surveillance. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> metastasis resulted significantly correlated with histological grading (p = 0. 005), lymphatic (p = 0. 005) and venous (p = 0. 02) embolization, corpora cavernosa (p = 0. 03) and urethra (p = 0. 03) infiltration. Histological grading and lymphatic embolization were independent predictive variables of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> (p = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: The histological grading and lymphatic embolization {{have to be considered}} as important parameters to select patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma to undergo an 'early' lymphadenectomy...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. There {{are a lot}} {{of studies}} aiding to the opinion that the {{involvement}} degree of axilla <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> grows depending on increase of breast tumor size, and its histological and nuclear grades. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the risk of axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement,</b> as well as the relation between the tumor size, histological and nuclear grades in a group of female patients who underwent breast cancer surgery, including levels 1 - 3 axillary dissection. Methods. Investigation covered 900 patients operated on during 2005 - 2008 who underwent modified radical mastectomy including axillar dissection. We assessed a number of involved <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> depending on tumor macroscopic size (T), histological grade (HG) and nuclear grade (NG). Results. A total number of examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was 9977. The incidence of involved <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was from 18. 6 % with T 1 tumor size up to 60. 2 % with T 4 tumor size. Concerning histological grade, the number of involved <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ranged from 14. 2 % (HGI) to 45. 1 % (HGIII); while in terms of nuclear grade, the number of involved <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ranged from 17. 4 % (NGI) to 54. 5 % (NGIV). By using χ 2 -test for trend and odds ratio (OR), the results showed that the axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> degree was increased with the increase of the tumor size and its histological and nuclear grades. The risk of axillary lymphatic <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement</b> was 1. 43 times higher in the group of T 2 tumors size compared to the smaller tumors T 1 size, and even up to 6. 62 times higher in case of T 4 tumor size. It was also increasied from 1. 79 times for HGII to even 4. 98 times for HGIII, and from 1. 44 times for NGII to 5. 71 times for NGIV. Conclusion. In breast cancer patients, there is a strong correlation between tumor size, its histological and nuclear grades and the risk of axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement...</b>|$|R
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>involvement</b> is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E

25|$|But many HPV+OPC {{present with}} {{involvement}} of the lymph nodes in the neck, and hence a higher stage of disease, generally referred to as locally advanced disease. This group is mostly treated with multimodality therapy, {{with the exception of}} one of the more favourable subgroups with small primary tumours and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>involvement</b> confined to a single node no larger than 3nbsp&cm in size, which as noted are considered early stage disease. The three main options for locally advanced but operable disease are resection, neck dissection and adjuvant therapy; chemoradiation (with possible salvage surgery); induction chemotherapy followed by radiation or chemoradiation. However the last option has not been supported in clinical trials that tested it. The primary consideration of surgery for locally advanced disease is to obtain adequate negative margins and spare the patient postoperative chemoradiation. But this must be balanced against the morbidity and functional loss from extensive resection, particularly where the tongue base is involved. To avoid such morbidity, primary chemoradiation is preferred. The management of disease within the cervical lymph nodes has to be taken into account in treating locally advanced disease. Guidelines for all OPC dictate that ectracapsular extension be given postoperative chemoradiation. Where gross neck disease is evident initially primary chemoradiation is usually given.|$|E

40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{breast cancer}} {{is the most common}} {{malignancy}} in women even according to the new studies this is concluded that the breast cancer in women is the most essential and important oncology’s disease. This malignancy is a suitable example of the use of biologic markers to learn more about prediction, incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. One of this markers is cathepsin D. It is an aspartatic lysosomal protease that playes main role in multiple tumor progression stages. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the frequency of expression of cathepsin D in primary breast cancer and it’s correlation with axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>involvement,</b> grade and stage of tumor. Materials & Methods: The study was a cross-sectional one that was performed on 75 samples from patients with breast cancer who admitted in Mostafa Khomeiny Hospital (2000 - 2004). After preparing the samples, a tissue section from each sample was obtained. One of the tumoral and <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> sections were stained by H&E. We determined the type of tumor, the number of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> the stage and the grade of the tumor. Cathepsin D assessed by a immunohistochemical technique using a monoclonal antibody.
