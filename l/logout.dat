40|$|The problem {{addressed}} by {{this work was}} to reduce the time taken to train system administrators in detecting computer security problems in system audit logs. The approach taken {{was to develop a}} simulator which generates realistic audit logs that illustrate both non-malicious and malicious behavior. These logs can be used to train system administrators. The simulator was written in Prolog and used means-ends analysis to simulate seventeen combinations of general system functions which includes the following: logins, editing, file deletions, file copying, changing file access rights, obtaining superuser privileges, sending mail and <b>logouts.</b> The simulation manipulates virtual system files analogously to what real users do. This creates realistic audit file logs that include a mixture of normal and malicious activity. More impressive is that the entire source program requires only 19. 1 kbytes of space, making it small enough to be compatible with a personal computer. NANAU. S. Naval Reserve (U. S. N.

30|$|Security APIs for My Private Cloud: A {{conceptual}} model {{along with the}} security architecture is presented in Chadwick and Casenove ([2011]) that describes a set of three security APIs each designed for a specific functionality. Authentication API deals with the verification and identification of users and sends back user’s identity credentials to the Cloud. Authentication is provided via SSO, where user <b>logouts</b> are restricted to the Cloud applications only and session with the authentication IdP/server remains active. Authorization API {{on the basis of}} user’s identity attributes and access control policies decides what rights a particular Cloud user may possess and when to revoke those access rights. These security APIs enable the Cloud users to protect their Privacy in Cloud by following limited disclosure principle where users can specify their own privacy policies for the protection of their information from other users. This model enables the Cloud resource owners to monitor and log the activities of their potential users, {{in order to ensure that}} only the legitimate resource can be accessed by the user having valid delegated attributes thus offers support to Auditing and Logging principle. In order to provide support to User-Centricity, proposed model offers support to multiple IdP protocols such as SAML and OpenID and offers consistent user experience. Moreover, this model enables the user to relate his identity information across multiple SPs to raise his assurance level for authentication purposes thus offering support to Identity Federation feature as well.|$|R
