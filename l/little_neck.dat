5|$|Subway {{service would}} be {{extended}} eastward along Hillside Avenue to <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway. The line {{would be an}} extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line as a four-track line to 212th Street, and then as a 2-track line to its terminus at <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway. The segment to 184th Street was to have cost $3,455,000, while the segment to 212th Street was to have cost $16,355,000.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Clearview was {{intended}} to run along the existing right-of-ways of Utopia Parkway and Francis Lewis Boulevard. An alternate proposed routing would have run along <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Bay and through Alley Pond Park, essentially parallel to the Cross Island Parkway. By September 1956, the Clearview was mapped along 206th and 207th Streets and Hollis Court Boulevard, east of Francis Lewis Boulevard, after community opposition. The reroute {{reduced the number of}} properties to be demolished or relocated from 860 to 421. An information center was set up by the TBTA for local residents displaced by the expressway.|$|E

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while the lower level tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to <b>Little</b> <b>Neck,</b> and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> encouraged development there.|$|E

5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line was {{originally}} planned to extend farther along Hillside Avenue into eastern Queens. The line {{would have gone}} {{at least to the}} intersection of Hillside, Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (the latter two both formerly part of Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to go as far as <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The extension to Springfield Boulevard, which on contract drawings was referred to as Route 108-Section 13, would have been a two track extension of the D3 and D4 express tracks, with five stations, at 187th Street, 197th Street, Cross Island Boulevard (today's Francis Lewis Boulevard), 214th Street, and the terminal at Springfield Boulevard. All of these stations, with the exception of Springfield Boulevard, would have had two side platforms. Hillside Avenue was widened in the 1930s between 218th Street and 229th Street, in order to accommodate construction of the proposed Springfield Boulevard station. As part of the extension of the line to 179th Street in 1950, provisions were made to extend this line farther east via Hillside Avenue. East of the 179th Street there are two four track levels both used as train storage. The upper level was intended to be extended eastward, while the lower level was always intended to be used to relay and store trains. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks. The tracks continue until 184th Street.|$|E

25|$|When the Queens Village depot {{was opened}} on September 8, 1974, the Q44A was reassigned from Flushing Depot (the former North Shore Bus Company facility).

This branch diverged north at Commonwealth Boulevard, running along Commonwealth and the Grand Central Parkway service road and terminating at <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway. The Q44A was renumbered to the Q46 on April 12, 1990. The Q46 was extended from Lakeville Road to Long Island Jewish Hospital on September 7, 1997.|$|E

NY 109 changes names to <b>Little</b> East <b>Neck</b> Road North and turns southeast through Babylon. The four lane boulevard crosses into Argyle Park, crossing under the Long Island Rail Road Babylon Branch and into an intersection with CR 12 (South Railroad Avenue). NY 109 bends southward through Argyle Park, remaining four lanes into Deer Park, where it meets an intersection with NY 27A (West Main Street), the eastern terminus of NY 109.|$|R

Theses routes, however, travel a circuitous route through Northeast Queens, running north on 260th Street and <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway into <b>Little</b> <b>Neck,</b> then west along the Horace Harding Expressway service road through Bayside and Oakland Gardens. The routes turn south onto Springfield Boulevard, then west again onto 73rd Avenue. After entering Fresh Meadows, the routes turn south onto 188th Street, merging with the QM1, QM7, and QM31 routes (see below), then turn west onto Union Turnpike meeting the QM6 and QM36.|$|E

50|$|After the {{relaxation}} of Prohibition in the U.S. in 1936, many breweries began marketing beer in steel cans. The glass industry responded by devising short bottles with <b>little</b> <b>necks,</b> nicknamed stubbies, and types with short necks were called steinies. Capacities varied, with 12oz {{being the most}} common size used for soft drinks. The steinie dominated in the U.S. by 1950, and the neck became longer, such as seen with the familiar Budweiser bottle. Stubbies were popular in Canada until the 1980s. Today, standard SP Lager from Papua New Guinea {{is one of the}} few beers still sold in 12oz neckless stubbies. The U.S. steinie shape now dominates for small beer bottles the world over, in sizes from half-pint to the European 500ml. The word stubbie is now only in common use in Australia.|$|R
25|$|On January 13, 1950, a {{spur of the}} Q44A was {{approved}} to turn off at 260th Street and operate via 260th Street to <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway. Service began on February 6, 1950. Previously, all Q44A buses continued along Union Turnpike to the Nassau County line. This spur provided direct service to Glen Oaks Village, sparing its residents a half-mile walk. This extension had been requested on December 16, 1949, and the public hearing was held on January 12, 1950.|$|E

25|$|Limited-stop service {{began on}} April 18, 1977 with the {{perception}} that it would attract new riders to the route. Along with the M15, the two routes became {{the first to use}} limited service in the city. Limited-stop service would be bidirectional during the AM rush hour, and peak-direction during the PM rush hour. These limited-stop buses were labeled as expresses. Eastbound expresses only stopped at Court House (only east-bound), Main Street, 149th Street, and Springfield Boulevard before making all stops. After running local to Winchester Boulevard, westbound expresses only stopped at Cloverdale Boulevard (226th Street), Springfield Boulevard, 149th Street, Main Street, and the subway. Some buses on the Glen Oaks Branch used to continue up <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway, turning west on the Grand Central Parkway service road, and turning onto Commonwealth Road, going east on the Grand Central Parkway service road, before it terminated at <b>Little</b> <b>Neck</b> Parkway and 260th Street. Between 4:50 and 6:35 PM, local service only ran to Springfield Boulevard, and free transfers were issued to continue past Springfield Boulevard via express Q44As. The express Q44As were also intended to compete with privately owned expresses buses operated by Queens Surface–travel times were 20 minutes shorter and the fare was $5 less.|$|E
