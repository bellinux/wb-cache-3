The Constitution is the supreme <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> therefore other laws and edicts cannot conflict with it. If a conflict occurs, the Constitution applies. If the Constitution {{is not in}} conflict, but a law and a decree is, the law would be enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} to codify {{the laws of the}} medieval state on the {{territory}} of what is now Belarus (the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) took the form of Statutes of Lithuania, with the First Statute in power in 1529.

5|$|Careful {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as {{a son of a}} sovereign, he {{might not be able to}} claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system {{in the modern world}} to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E

5|$|The late 1930s saw the {{emergence}} of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. This {{was the first time}} the new government had been directly opposed, and through a clear show of federal authority, Washington established the principle that federal law is the supreme <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> and demonstrated that the federal government had both the ability and willingness to suppress violent resistance to the nation's laws. The government's response to the rebellion was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. This also was one of only two times in U.S. history that an incumbent president has personally commanded the military in the field; James Madison would command an army in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> only when made {{in pursuance of}} the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made {{under the authority of}} the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

5|$|Gradually {{there were}} {{increased}} number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior, limiting their ability to participate in society, and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians {{in the hope that}} they would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman {{imperial}} government adopted its Tanzimat modernization {{reforms in}} 1862 and originally entrusted Aqil with enforcing the new <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in northern Palestine. Part {{of these measures}} were stronger efforts to suppress the Bedouin tribes and decisively end their raiding activities. Aqil was given orders {{to prevent them from}} setting up camps in the cultivated lands of Galilee and forbade the collection of khuwwa tolls from the local inhabitants. Aqil resigned from his post when he was informed that as part of his new assignment he and his men were required to don Ottoman uniforms. He objected to the requirement, insisting that as Bedouin, they were not accustomed to wearing uniforms. He was replaced by one of his Hawwara tribesmen, but Aqil compelled his successor to resign as well. Shortly after his resignation, the requirement of uniforms was canceled and Aqil resumed his assignment.|$|E
