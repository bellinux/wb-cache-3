These indices have been called quantitative measures of genotype wide adaptation <b>levels</b> <b>I,</b> II and III, respectively. Relationships (consistency) between the three measures were studied using data for grain yield of winter wheat advanced lines from 15 preliminary multi-environment trials carried out across Polish test locations in the years 1993 – 2007. The quantitative measures are simple to interpret and useful quantitative characteristics of genotype wide adaptation <b>levels</b> <b>I,</b> II and III. High Spearman rank correlation coefficients were found between each of the pairs of the quantitative measures of genotype wide adaptation <b>levels</b> <b>I,</b> II and III within all sets of winter wheat genotypes.

The studies delivered new results on the usefulness of quantitative measures of genotype wide adaptation level for winter wheat. These findings indicate that those measures could be also useful for comparative evaluation of genotype wide adaptation level in other crops...|$|R
