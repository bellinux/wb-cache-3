40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis) {{is one of}} {{the highly}} demanded timber species in Sri Lanka. When buying teak logs, {{customers}} assess their quality by visual appraisal of surface characteristics such as visible defects. Hence, the buyers’ preference for logs with desired attributes is reflected by the price achieved in the market. In this study, we examined the influence of visually observable quality attributes of plantation grown teak logs on their market price. A set of 650 randomly selected teak logs were assessed for dimensions, shape defects, surface defects and end-defects. <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> the log, mid-circumference (under bark), diameter at top-end and butt-end, number of knots per meter, average diameter of the knots, bend fraction, percentage of heartwood, shape of the log, presence <b>of</b> <b>buttress,</b> position <b>of</b> the hollows, presence of felling damages, splits and heart rot were recorded using standard methods. Selling prices of logs were obtained from the records of log storing facilities. By using the multiple linear regressions, a price-quality model was developed to explain the impact of quality attributes on selling price. The regression model achieved a strong coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 87. Accordingly, the <b>length,</b> mid-circumference, number <b>of</b> knots per meter, bend fraction, hollow position, presence <b>of</b> <b>buttresses</b> and presence of heart rot were found to have a significant influence on the price.  The relative price reduction due to presence of a specific log defect was further examined using the derived price-quality model. The presence of high number of knots had the highest detrimental impact on price, followed by the higher bend fraction, presence of hollows at top end and/or middle of the log, presence of heart rot and presence <b>of</b> <b>buttresses</b> respectively. These findings have implications in the improved management of teak plantations. </p...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the geometry changes involved in the dative bonding from the metal to the Z-ligand complex, the bond itself can differ greatly {{depending on the type}} <b>of</b> <b>buttresses</b> involved. Typical boron-boron bonds are around 1.59 Å. However, due to the dative bond character, the metal-boron bond distance can vary greatly depending on the bonding motif, as well as the various ligands attached to the metal. The boride and borylene motifs tend to have the shortest bonds, typically from 2.00-2.15 Å. Boryl complexes have metal-boron bond distances from 2.45-2.52 Å, and borane complexes have the largest range of metal-boron bond distances, 2.07-2.91 Å. In addition, for the metal base-stabilized borane complexes, the L-ligand that donates to the metal center {{plays an important role in}} the metal-boron bond length. Typically, the donor buttresses with sulfur and nitrogen donor ligands have metal-boron bond <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> 2.05-2.25 Å, and donor buttresses with phosphorus donor ligands have metal-boron bond <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> 2.17-2.91 Å.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{adjacent}} constructions from being damaged in deep excavation project, a certain auxiliary measurement is usually adopted in restraining the ground movements due to excavation so as to protect the adjacent buildings. In recent years, buttress wall has been adopted as an auxiliary measurement in protecting the adjacent buildings in excavation; however, in concerning the way how it performances is still lack of consolidated result of verification. Neither domestic nor foreign is still in lack of regarding the study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology <b>of</b> the <b>buttress</b> wall. Thus, until so far, concerning the analysis and designing <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> wall is still staying in the empirical stage that the configuration <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> wall, including space, length and depth does not have a consistent agreement. Thus, in some cases there came with relatively large space between the buttress walls; some with longer length; some with depth started from near ground surface downward {{to the bottom of the}} diaphragm wall; some only ended to 1 / 2 depth of the diaphragm wall penetrated to underground; some started from the final excavation downward a certain depth, etc. in various configurations where each revealed different performance separately either in reducing the diaphragm wall displacement effectively or in minor. Therefore, the further study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> wall is required. For this reason, the study shall focus on a series of complete research <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> wall. As the lateral displacement of diaphragm wall in deep excavation after buttress wall has been set is a 3 -D moving behavior, we decided to apply 3 -D numerical analysis for case studies in simulating the analysis and verification, then studied the various buttress wall models in configuration so as to clarify the mechanism and behavior of diaphragm wall, in the mean time, recommend the methodology of 3 -D simulation analysis in simulation. Then, we proceed with parametric study via 3 -D numerical analysis to investigate the performance <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> wall as the basis in suggesting the principle of optimal design as well as the simplified designing chart for industrial reference. Finally, as currently the beam on elastoplastic foundation method or 2 -D plane strain numerical analysis is broadly adopted in the designing stage of excavation by the industrial field, this study shall follow these two guidelines and propose reasonable analysis method in simulation <b>of</b> setting up <b>buttress</b> wall in excavation. Expect it is helpful in the practical analysis and designing tasks. [[abstract]]深開挖工程為了避免損及鄰近構造物，在施工前，常採用一些輔助措施， 控制開挖引致之地盤位移，以達到鄰房保護的目的。近年來，扶壁常被用來作 為開挖之鄰房保護的輔助措施，然而其成效到底為何，卻一直缺少具體的驗證 結果。國內外有關扶壁機制、行為及分析方法的研究，相當的缺乏。因此到目 前為止，有關扶壁的分析及設計皆還停留在經驗的階段，對於扶壁的配置，包 括間距、長度及深度，並未有一致的看法，所以有些案例的扶壁間距相對的較 大、有些案例的扶壁長度相對較長、有些案例的扶壁深度由接近地表處開始往 下設置至連續壁底端，有些則僅至連續壁貫入深度的一半處，另有一些案例， 扶壁則僅從最終開挖面開始往下設置一段深度而已，各種設置方式皆不盡相 同，而各個案例顯現出的扶壁功效亦不盡相同，有些案例扶壁能發揮減少連續 壁側向位移的功效，有些案例則顯示功效不大，因此有關扶壁的機制、行為特 性及分析方法亟待進一步的研究。 有鑑於此，本研究將對扶壁進行一完整的研究。由於配置扶壁後之深開挖 的連續壁側向位移係屬三向度行為，因此本研究首先將採用三向度數值分析， 進行案例的模擬分析驗證，然後針對不同的扶壁配置型式進行研究，以釐清扶 壁之機制及行為特性，並建議適合的三向度模擬分析方法。其次將採用三向度 數值分析進行參數研究，以探討扶壁之成效，並據以建議最佳化設計原則，以 及簡化的設計圖表，供工程界參考使用。最後，由於目前工程界在設計深開挖 時，大多採用彈塑性基礎梁法或二向度的平面應變數值分析，因此本研究將配 合彈塑性基礎梁法及二向度的平面應變數值分析，提出設置扶壁之開挖工程的 合理分析模擬方法，希望能對實務之分析及設計工作有所助益...|$|R

40|$|The vault is {{the main}} element of a {{majority}} of historical buildings. Masonry vaults exert an inclined thrust which must be resisted by a substantial mass <b>of</b> masonry: the <b>buttress.</b> The buttress system assures the safety of the whole construction. Old Master Builders were well aware of that and the traditional structural rules addressed mainly the problem <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> design. Nowadays, the architect or engineer assessing the structural safety of a historical construction needs to estimate the safety <b>of</b> the <b>buttress</b> system with accuracy. This has been considered a simple topic, however, to estimate the safety of even a simple buttress is not an easy matter. The buttress may fracture under certain conditions with a substantial loss of stability. Besides, the buttress may show a certain leaning, it may be separated from the wall, etc. On the other hand, buttress systems are complex structures, a combination of walls and counterforts, flying <b>buttresses,</b> etc., made <b>of</b> different masonry. The matter cannot be handled in an abstract way. In the first part, an outline of the development <b>of</b> <b>buttress</b> design since ca. 1700 would serve to present the main approaches and to provide the historical context. In the second part, {{the state of the art}} <b>of</b> modern masonry <b>buttress</b> analysis is summarised, and a detailed discussion of the estimation of safety is made...|$|R
