The goal of this research project {{is to develop a}} high resolution overhead greenhouse insect scouting device that efficiently detect and collect insect pests population. Three greenhouse insect scouting methods (yellow sticky card, mobile overhead sticky card and mobile overhead vacuum) were compared to determinate collection efficiency (CE) of adult whiteflies (B. tabaci) from a Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) crop. The main objective was to estimate CE of two mobile overhead scouting methods and study the Conclusions • Since insect activity increases with temperature, collection efficiency (CE) increased for all methods at high greenhouse temperature T 2 = 28. 5 ° C. •We observed the control had significantly higher CE at T 2 = 28. 5 °C.

We assume the presence of macroscopic boundaries confining the field in a hypercube of side L. We also consider {{that the system is}} in thermal equilibrium at temperature β − 1. For spatially bounded free fields, the Bekenstein bound states that the specific entropy satisfies the inequality S < 2 πR, where R E stands for the radius of the smallest sphere that circumscribes the system. Employing the strongcoupling perturbative expansion, we obtain the renormalized mean energy E and entropy S for the 2 system up to the order (g 0) p, presenting an analytical proof that the specific entropy also satisfies in some situations a quantum bound. Defining ε (r) d as the renormalized zero-point energy for the free theory per unit length, the dimensionless quantity ξ = β <b>L</b> and <b>h</b> 1 (<b>d)</b> and <b>h</b> 2 (<b>d)</b> as positive analytic functions of d, for the case of high temperature, we get that the specific entropy satisfies S ξ.

40|$|International audienceIn flow-coating {{processes}} at low substrate velocity, {{solvent evaporation}} occurs during the film withdrawal and the coating process yields directly a dry deposit. In this regime, {{often referred to}} as the evaporative regime, several works performed on blade-coating-like configurations have reported a deposit thickness <b>h</b> <b>d</b> proportional to the inverse of the substrate velocity V. Such a scaling can be easily derived from simple mass conservation laws, assuming that evaporation occurs on a constant distance, referred to as the evaporation length, noted L ev in the present paper and of the order of the meniscus size. However the case of colloidal dispersions deserves further attention. Indeed, the coating flow leads to a wet film of densely-packed colloids before the formation of the dry deposit. This specific feature is related to the porous nature of the dry deposit, which can thus remain wet when capillary forces are strong enough to prevent the receding of the solvent through the pores of the film (the so-called pore-emptying). The length of this wet film may be possibly much larger than the menis-cus size, therefore modifying the solvent evaporation rate, as well as the scaling <b>h</b> <b>d</b> ∼ 1 /V. This result was suggested recently by different groups using basic modeling and assuming for simplicity an uniform evaporation rate over the wet film. In this article, we go a step further and investigate the effect of multi-dimensional vapor mass transfer in the gas phase on <b>L</b> ev and <b>h</b> <b>d</b> in the specific case of colloidal dispersions. Using simplified models, we first provide analytical expressions in asymptotic cases corresponding to 1 D or 2 D diffusive vapor transport. These theoretical investigations then led us to show that L ev is independent of the evaporation rate amplitude, and roughly independent of its spatial distribution. Conversely, <b>h</b> <b>d</b> strongly depends on the characteristics of vapor mass transfer in the gas phase, and different scaling laws are obtained for the 1 D or the 2 D case. These theoretical findings are finally tested by comparison with experimental results supporting our theoretical simplified approach...|$|R

40|$|Most {{children}} with medulloblastoma (MB), {{the second most}} common pediatric brain tumor, have a 70 % proba-bility of survival. However, survivors who receive aggres-sive therapy are at signifi cant risk of cognitive defi cits that have been associated with lower volumes of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). We hypothesized that cranial irradiation inhibited normal brain volume development in these survivors. We retrospectively ana-lyzed 324 MRI studies of 52 patients with histologically proven MB treated with surgery and 35 to 40 Gy cranio-spinal irradiation, with or without chemotherapy. The volume of NAWM and that of cerebrospinal fl uid were quantifi ed from a single index section and compared with those of healthy, age-similar control subjects. A quadratic random coeffi cient model was used to iden-tify trends in brain volume with increasing age. Patients treated for MB at younger ages demonstrated substan-tially less development of NAWM volume than did their healthy peers.
