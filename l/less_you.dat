25|$|The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American hip hop {{musician}} DJ Shadow, released on October 4, 2011 by Island Records. Like Shadow's previous efforts, the album's music relies extensively on sampling, and the samples used span many genres and time periods. The album sees Shadow exploring many genres and production styles, from fast-paced tracks prominently featuring guitars and scratching to slow tracks featuring pianos.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2011, DJ Shadow {{confirmed}} via his Facebook {{page that}} the album {{would be released}} in September. The same day, he also released an EP called I Gotta Rokk, which contained remixes of material from the album. This {{was followed by the}} release of another EP, I'm Excited, on July 29, 2011. However, copyright problems caused the withdrawal of the EP and delays on the release of The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{was also}} {{discreet}} about his {{religious and political}} beliefs, but {{it is known that}} he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: [...] "The <b>less</b> <b>you</b> know about me the more interesting it will be to watch me do what I do".|$|E

500|$|Point System - Depending on the {{character}} and LARP, your PC will {{have some form of}} Body and/or Armor that is measured nominally. Weapons also have a numerical value assigned, where upon a successful weapon strike you deal 'damage' equal to the number associated with your weapon type. This damage is dealt against your opponents Body/Armor. Typically, once you reach 0 body or <b>less,</b> <b>you</b> then begin the death stage which will be found in the [...] A subset of the point system is the Location System, where points vary depending on where your opponent is struck. If they are wearing armor in that location, then the 'damage dealt' effects their Armor Points (AP), versus if you strike a location without armor you deal damage against your opponents Body Points (BP). The majority of LARP's utilize this system.|$|E
500|$|Clemmons {{was arrested}} on July 1, 2009, after he {{appeared}} in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, {{as well as being}} a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as [...] "the beast". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, [...] "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the <b>less</b> <b>you</b> want them in your community." ...|$|E
500|$|... “Grunge...became an anti-consumerist {{movement}} {{where the}} <b>less</b> <b>you</b> spent on clothes, the more ‘coolness’ you had.” The style did not evolve {{out of a}} conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, [...] " [...] Kurt Cobain was just too lazy to shampoo", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "This [...] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs {{against the grain of}} the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s." [...] The flannel and [...] "...cracked leatherette coats" [...] in the grunge scene were part [...] "...of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. [...] Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the “manufactured image”, often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{also use}} an {{explanation}} of Gresham's Law as [...] "The more efficient you become, the less effective you get"; i.e. [...] "when you try {{to go on the}} cheap, you will stop selling" [...] or [...] "the <b>less</b> <b>you</b> invest in your non-tangible services, the fewer sales you will get." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better received an average score of 62, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 25 reviews. Andrew Perry of The Daily Telegraph wrote positively of the album, stating that it upholds the [...] "pioneering spirit" [...] of Shadow's debut release Endtroducing..... by [...] "regularly straying from the constrictions of classic hip hop." [...] John Bush of AllMusic cited The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better as [...] "one {{of the most}} entertaining albums of the year, with countless moments of brilliance" [...] and wrote that it [...] "sounds closer to his classic Endtroducing..... {{than any of his}} others, as though Shadow's finally willing to embrace his career landmark instead of constantly play against type." [...] Writing for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes wrote that while the album [...] "may lack his debut's soul-jazz seamlessness, it compensates with bipolar freakiness." ...|$|E

2500|$|While criticizing The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better {{for what}} he felt {{was a lack of}} a {{coherent}} mood, describing it as [...] "a highly schizophrenic collection", J.R. Moores of Drowned in Sound ultimately praised it as an improvement over The Outsider and [...] "a step in the right direction." [...] BBC Music writer Ian Wade acknowledged that while the album [...] "will only ever stand in the vast shadow that its creator has cast since releasing the unprecedented Endtroducing, The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better isn't a bad album at all, and will likely grow into something far more impressive, something that isn't quite evident on first play. Like The Private Press, it could be one the listener returns to down the line and wonders how it didn't initially click." [...] Sam Richards of NME, however, felt that the album sounded [...] "like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second single from The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better, [...] "I Gotta Rokk", was {{released}} on May 17, 2011 as a digital EP featuring the title track and remixes of tracks from the album. Nate Patrin of Pitchfork wrote that the EP's tracks [...] "suggest a new direction more {{along the lines of}} what people expected from [...] 10 years ago" [...] and graded the release 7.0/10. It was later featured on the Super Bowl XLIX TV spot for the 2015 film Terminator Genisys. [...] "I'm Excited", featuring Afrikan Boy, was premiered on DJ Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 program on July 7, 2011 and was intended to be the follow-up single in promotion of the album. However, the release of an accompanying EP was shelved due to issues involving an uncleared sample on its title track, which was ultimately excluded from the final track listing of The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better. The music video for [...] "I'm Excited", directed by Ian Pons Jewell, {{was released}} on August 24, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, Shakespeare {{finishes}} the sonnet (as expected) with a couplet: two consecutive rhyming lines. Each line contains ten syllables, {{and the second}} line is composed only of one-syllable words. Some scholars attribute the monosyllable closing line of the poem {{as a tribute to}} 16th century poet, George Gascoigne. Gascoigne is quoted as saying, [...] "The more monosyllables that you use, the truer Englishman you shall seemed, and the <b>less</b> <b>you</b> shall smell of the Inkhorn".|$|E

[...] Following intervention from the office of mayor David Miller, the increase was reduced to 6%. [...] Pitfield justified the proposed increase by saying, [...] "This is not {{to be thought of as}} taxation. It's a user fee. If you want to pay <b>less,</b> <b>you</b> can use less." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Dave Simpson {{described}} the album as [...] "a hit-and-miss affair", while Spins Rob Harvilla similarly characterized it as [...] "equal parts frustrating and admirable", though also [...] "nowhere near as antagonistic as 2006's hyphy-saturated The Outsider". David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that [...] "anyone who picks up The <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know {{has a right}} to be disappointed, especially considering the name of the artist on the spine." [...] However, he nonetheless {{described the}} album as a [...] "perfectly enjoyable listen" [...] in spite of its shortcomings and a [...] "return to form for Shadow, his best work since Private Press, and, most importantly, fun to listen to." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave most praise to the album's [...] "dark, shape-shifting mood pieces".|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{the role}} for Empire lasted three weeks. The actor {{was pleased with}} the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his {{performance}} on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the gun prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted his head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that [...] "the <b>less</b> <b>you</b> do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes". Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.|$|E
