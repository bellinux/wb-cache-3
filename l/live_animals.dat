40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to assess {{challenges}} and opportunities of <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of Somali region a case study of Jigjiga zone. In order to assess the challenges and opportunity of <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of Somali region of Jigjiga zone, a total (census) of 20 individual <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters were surveyed. In the process of answering the basic questions, a questionnaire that include demographic profiles, trading practices, factors that challenge <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export was designed in open ended, closed ended and likert scales. Moreover, interviews were held with top officials of ARDB, RCA and animal health bureau. After the data has been collected, it was analyzed using simple statistical techniques (tables and percentages) and descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviations). The results of the study indicates the limited availability of financial institutions, unavailability of formal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters institutions, high marketing costs, multiple taxations, bureaucracy of government institutions, harassment by petty officials, and overall loose relationship with government bodies were challenging <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of the Jigjiga zone. It also shows that exporters were highly benefited from high trust and strong relationship with their business partners, familiarity with animal quality attributes demanded in importing countries and strong clan arrangements. The study also found that formal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export of the area is increasing but the illegal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export was highly challenging the formal <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters and the revenue of the region. Along this, the study found different participants acting in <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> export system. Based on the major findings, recommendations were forwarded to existing and potential <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> exporters, and concerned government bodies...|$|R

5|$|Tarrare (c.1772–1798), {{sometimes}} spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, {{noted for}} his unusual eating habits. Able to eat {{vast amounts of}} meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned {{out of the family}} home as a teenager. He travelled France {{in the company of a}} band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.|$|E

The <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> {{on some of the}} target ships were supplied by the support ship , which brought 200 pigs, 60 guinea pigs, 204 goats, 5,000 rats, 200 mice, and grains containing insects to be studied for genetic effects by the National Cancer Institute.

By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes {{during the winter}} months.

Amongst the cargo carried by was often <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.|$|E
