5|$|In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} phylogenetic study of the {{evolutionary}} relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) – and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the <b>llama</b> (L. glama) and the vicuña (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the alpaca and <b>llama.</b> Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E

Shaun befriends the <b>llamas</b> and the flock play a {{football}} game against the <b>llamas.</b> Timmy finds the flute {{that came with the}} <b>llamas</b> and tests it, discovering that he can hypnotize the <b>llamas.</b> However, Timmy loses the flute and the <b>llamas</b> destroy it. The <b>llamas</b> go on a vandalizing spree, culminating in taking a quad bike and destroying the sheep house just as Bitzer finishes repairing it. The flock becomes angry with Shaun for bringing the <b>llamas.</b> Meanwhile, The Farmer and Bitzer discover that the <b>llamas</b> have taken over the Farmer's house.

40|$|<b>Llamas</b> (Lama glama) are {{frequently}} used as guard animals by sheep producers {{as part of}} their predation management programs. However, few data are available concerning physical and behavioral attributes that distinguish between effective and ineffective guardian <b>llamas.</b> Our study addressed this issue and evaluated aggressiveness of <b>llamas</b> toward dogs. Initially, we identified physical and behavioral traits of individual <b>llamas.</b> Twenty <b>llamas</b> were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups (n= 5 per group). We used focal group sampling techniques to rank individual <b>llamas</b> according to frequencies with which they displayed alertness, leadership, dominant, aggressive, and threatening behaviors as well as postures indicating dominance or subordination. We then examined the behavior of individual <b>llamas</b> with sheep. Finally, we documented interactions among <b>llamas,</b> sheep, and a surrogate predator (border collie). Our results showed that leadership, alertness, and weight of <b>llamas</b> were correlated with aggressiveness displayed toward the dog (ps= 0. 064, 0. 012, and 0. 039 respectively). These traits are easily recognized and can be used by producers to select <b>llamas</b> as livestock guardians...|$|R
25|$|Differential {{characteristics}} between <b>llamas</b> and alpacas {{include the}} <b>llama's</b> larger size, longer head, and curved ears. Alpaca fiber is generally more expensive, {{but not always}} more valuable. Alpacas {{tend to have a}} more consistent color throughout the body. The most apparent visual difference between <b>llamas</b> and camels is that camels have a hump or humps and <b>llamas</b> do not.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, <b>llama</b> and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry {{has a long}} history, {{starting}} with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms. Major changes {{took place in the}} Columbian Exchange when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool. A wide range of other species such as horse, water buffalo, <b>llama,</b> rabbit and guinea pig are used as livestock {{in some parts of the}} world. Aquaculture of fish, molluscs, and crustaceans, and the keeping of bees and silkworms is widespread. Insects for human consumption are raised in several countries; for example, the production of crickets is a profitable industry in Thailand.|$|E

40|$|Predation, {{especially}} by canid predators, {{is a significant}} cause of sheep loss for many producers. In recent years, the use of <b>llamas</b> to protect sheep from predators has gained recognition as a depredation control method. I conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of <b>llamas</b> in reducing canid predation on domestic sheep. Twenty-one <b>llamas</b> were placed with Utah sheep producers. Data collected from these flocks over 20 months were compared to similar data collected from flocks without <b>llamas.</b> Comparisons between treatment and control flocks included (l) proportion of flocks with losses to predators, (2) mean predation rates on ewes and lambs, and (3) lamb predation rate distributions. Two surveys were conducted during the study to assess producer opinions on the inclusion of <b>llamas</b> in their sheep management programs. In all 3 comparisons of lamb losses between treatments and controls, losses sustained by control flocks in Lambing Season l (LS l) {{were significantly higher than}} those of flocks with <b>llamas.</b> Among treatment flocks, losses were similar for LS l and Lambing Season 2 (LS 2). Among controls, LS 2 losses dropped to the level of treatment flocks. My results suggest predation may have to reach some threshold before guard <b>llamas</b> have an effect on losses. Results of surveys of producers with <b>llamas</b> indicated they support the use of <b>llamas</b> as guard animals for sheep...|$|R
