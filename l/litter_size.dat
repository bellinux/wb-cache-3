5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small <b>litter</b> <b>size,</b> which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|Banded {{guitarfish}} mate in March/April {{and give}} birth in shallow, sandy bays in late spring/summer. <b>Litter</b> <b>sizes</b> are 4-11 {{and the average}} birth size is 18 cm.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} at the University of Alberta linked the reproductive ecology of polar bears in Canada's Hudson Bay with decreasing <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> and loss of sea ice.|$|R
5000|$|Like most sharks, {{the species}} is yolk-sac viviparous. [...] The species has been {{observed}} with <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> of 4-16 pups, with pups developing a yolk sack in utero.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel mates in April–July {{and there}} is a 34- to 37-day {{gestation}} period. In the Northern Hemisphere, the average <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful. They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months. Anestrus in females lasts from September until February.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
50|$|The {{speckled}} smooth-hound is ovoviviparous {{with eggs}} that develop within the female and hatch into juvenile fish which are about 30 cm at birth. <b>Litter</b> <b>sizes</b> are typically seven.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the Mekong {{freshwater}} stingray {{consists of}} invertebrates {{from the river}} bed. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous with <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> possibly as small as one pup.|$|R
50|$|Very {{little is}} known of the slender harvest mouse's reproduction. <b>Litter</b> <b>sizes</b> seems to range from 2 to 4, but three being average. The {{reproductive}} season is likely extended from late winter to mid-autumn.|$|R
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and <b>litter</b> <b>size,</b> but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental viviparity, in which the developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining of the uterus bears a series of parallel lengthwise folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
50|$|Gestation for white-throated woodrats lasts 37 to 38 days, {{and young}} {{are most often}} born in spring and early summer. In Arizona, mean <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> were 1.95 young/litter (n=93 litters) and 2.5 young/litter (n=27 litters).|$|R
50|$|Female {{dogs are}} known to come into heat twice a year and <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> range from {{generally}} 4-7 puppies. In the native village breeding is completely natural {{with more than one}} male mating with a female.|$|R
25|$|<b>Litter</b> <b>sizes</b> {{range from}} four to eight cubs. Only females care for the young. Cubs open their eyes at around 38–40 days old, are weaned at 50–54 days and leave their mother (disperse) at 61–68 days old.|$|R
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to be excellent swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the short-tail {{stingray}} {{consists of}} invertebrates and bony fishes, including burrowing and midwater species. It tends to remain within a relatively limited area throughout the year, preferring deeper waters during the winter, {{and is not}} known to perform long migrations. Large aggregations of rays form seasonally at certain locations, {{such as in the}} summer at the Poor Knight Islands off New Zealand. Both birthing and mating have been documented within the aggregations at Poor Knights. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother; the <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> is 6–10. The short-tail stingray is not aggressive but is capable of inflicting a potentially lethal wound with its long, venomous sting. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, usually surviving to be released. Because its population does not appear threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5000|$|Like other ichthyosaurs, Ophthalmosaurus {{gave birth}} to its pups tail-first to avoid {{drowning}} them. Skeletons of unhatched young {{have been found in}} over fifty females on fossil finds, and <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> ranged from two to eleven pups.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the female}} and her young {{will live in}} family groups, males are usually solitary. <b>Litter</b> <b>sizes</b> average one to two pups, but up to four can be born at a time. Their diets include fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and birds.|$|R
40|$|A common {{question}} {{in the analysis of}} binary data is how to deal with overdispersion. One widely advocated sampling distribution for overdispersed binary data is the beta-binomial model. For example, this distribution is often used to model litter effects in toxicological experiments. Testing the null hypothesis of a beta-binomial distribution against all other distributions is difficult, however, when the <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> vary greatly. Herein, we propose a test statistic based on combining Pearson statistics from individual <b>litter</b> <b>sizes,</b> and estimate the p-value using bootstrap techniques. A Monte Carlo study confirms the accuracy and power of the test against a beta-binomial distribution contaminated with a few outliers. The method is applied to data from environmental toxicity studies. ...|$|R
5|$|The diet of {{the slender}} smooth-hound is diverse, but {{dominated}} by small, benthic bony fishes and decapod crustaceans. It exhibits a specialized form of aplacental viviparity with oophagy: the females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30–80 ova, of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes {{the rest of}} the ova and stores the yolk material in its external yolk sac. The growing embryo is mainly sustained by this yolk sac during gestation, though it may be additionally supplied with histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The typical <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> is two pups, one per uterus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the slender smooth-hound as Least Concern; it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers, and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E
50|$|Like the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh {{often has}} a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is normal. <b>Litter</b> <b>sizes</b> are usually from four to six puppies, but litters as small as one and as large as ten occur.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} 22 to 23 centimeters long. It is brown or gray with a pale underside. In the summer it {{develops}} a chestnut wash along the shoulders. Most {{babies are born}} in June, with <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 1 to 9.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 48 - 53) Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) is a homozygous recessive disorder {{characterized by}} the M 712 T mutation. Humans who inherit this disorder develop skeletal muscle wasting, which is largely attributed to a sialic acid deficiency. In order to develop a treatment for HIBM, a suitable animal model must be developed. Thus, my aim was to use the rotarod mechanism to determine if mice homozygous for the HIBM disorder developed a similar phenotype as humans. I also aimed to determine the differences in <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> between affected and normal mice. I used the rotarod treadmill to assess the muscular strength of three groups: mice homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type for the mutant M 712 T allele. I also compared the <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> of both heterozygous and normal mice breeding pairs. To perform genotyping on the mice, I used polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis. I {{found that there were}} insignificant differences between the three groups regarding rotarod performance time. As a group, heterozygotes performed the worst (1. 30 seconds), followed by homozygotes (1. 37 seconds), and then wild-type mice (1. 60 seconds). Also, the strain of the mice dictated the severity of the M 712 T mutation. Regarding <b>litter</b> <b>sizes,</b> normal mice had greater <b>litter</b> <b>sizes</b> than mice heterozygous for the M 712 T mutant allele. Either our rotarod machine is not an ideal indicator of animal strength, or mice with the M 712 T mutation do not exhibit the muscle-wasting phenotype. The experiment should be repeated with a larger sample size, and histology studies should be performed to confirm the presence of muscle wasting...|$|R
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average <b>litter</b> <b>size,</b> with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E
5|$|The winghead shark is {{viviparous}} {{like the}} rest of its family, with the developing young sustained to term by a placental connection to the mother. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteri. Compartments form inside the uteri during pregnancy, one for each embryo. In the waters around Mumbai, the mating season is in July and August during the monsoon. The males bite at the sides of the females as a prelude to copulation. Females can reproduce every year; the <b>litter</b> <b>size</b> ranges from 6 to 25 pups, and increases with the size of the female. The gestation period lasts 8–9 months off western India, and 10–11 months off northern Australia. Pregnant females have been reported to quarrel with each other.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-orange {{pigments}} of the smalleye hammerhead seem to {{have been}} acquired from the penaeid shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, the main food of juvenile sharks, and from sea catfish and their eggs, the main food of adults. The golden color may serve to conceal it from predators such as larger sharks. This species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of five to 19 pups every year following a gestation period of 10 months. Reproductive seasonality, <b>litter</b> <b>size,</b> and size at maturity vary between geographical regions. Because of its abundance, the smalleye hammerhead is an economically important bycatch of artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout its range and is used as food. In recent years, overfishing has caused marked declines in its numbers off Trinidad, northern Brazil, and probably elsewhere. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature to list it under vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Twenty-four {{clinically}} {{sexually mature}} New Zealand white rabbits consisting of (4 buck and 20 does) {{were used to}} study the effect of concentrate and Talinum triangulare combinations by breeding does during pregnancy on litter performance traits.
