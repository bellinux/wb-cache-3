50|$|Signals from odor {{sensation}} {{are sent}} from the olfactory bulb through mitral and tufts cell axons via the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> and synapse {{at the primary}} olfactory cortex. The primary olfactory cortex includes the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, the anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, the periamygdaloid complex, and the rostral entorhinal cortex. A unique characteristic of olfaction is its independence from the thalamus. The odor signals are sent directly from the sensory receptor neuron to the primary cortex. However, communication between the primary and secondary olfactory cortex requires connections with the thalamus.|$|E
50|$|When odorants {{enter the}} nasal cavity, they bind to odorant receptors {{at the base}} of the {{olfactory}} epithelium. These receptors are bipolar neurons that connect to the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, traveling through the cribriform plate. At the glomerular layer, axons from the olfactory receptor neurons intermingle with dendrites from intrinsic olfactory bulb neurons: mitrial/tufted cells and dopaminergic periglomerular cells. From the olfactory bulb, mitral/tufted cells send axons via the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> (the cranial nerve I) to the olfactory cortex, which includes the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, and parts of the amygdala. From the entorhinal cortex, axons extend to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which then proceed to the orbitofrontal cortex.|$|E

A very high density of AII receptors was found in the subfornical organ, paraventricular and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, and area postrema. A high concentration of receptors was found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts,</b> nuclei of the accessory and <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts,</b> triangular septal nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, locus coeruleus, and inferior olivary nuclei.

Low concentrations of sites were seen in caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and gray matter of the spinal cord. These studies have demonstrated that AII receptors are distributed in a highly characteristic anatomical pattern in the brain.

Fishes were arranged into five groups: fish with intact <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts</b> (LOT), fish with intact medial <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> (MOT), fish with tracts totally sectioned (TOTAL, both LOT and MOT), sham operated, and nonoperated fish. The five groups were submitted to either alarm substance extract and food stimulus or to distilled water (control) and food stimulus. Fish reacted to food independently of which tract (LOT, MOT or TOTAL) was sectioned; vision seems necessary and elemental to detect and deflagrate food response. Latency of the responses to each reaction was different between groups. None of the fish with sectioned tracts reacted to alarm substance extract, while sham- and nonoperated fish showed the typical alarm behavior response, leading {{to the conclusion that}} olfaction is essential for mediating alarm response.

50|$|Odors {{enter the}} nose (or {{olfactory}} rosette in fishes) {{and interact with}} the cilia of olfactory receptor neurons. The information is sent via the olfactory nerve (Cranial Nerve I) to the olfactory bulb. After the processing in the bulb the signal is transmitted caudally via the axons of mitral and tufted cells in the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract.</b> The tract forms on the ventrolateral surface {{of the brain and}} passes through the AON, continuing on to run the length of the piriform cortex, while synapsing in both regions. The AON distributes the information to the contralateral olfactory bulb and piriform cortex as well as engaging in reciprocal interactions with the ipsilateral bulb and cortex. Therefore, the AON is positioned to regulate information flow between nearly every region where odor information processing occurs.|$|E
50|$|The pallial {{amygdala}} contains {{mainly the}} so-called basolateral amygdala, encompassing the lateral, basolateral (basal) and basomedial (accessory basal) nuclei, plus the anterior, amygdalopiriform and posterolateral corticoid areas at its surface. The medial pallium also {{may contribute to}} the pallial amygdala, forming the amygdalohippocampal nucleus and the posteromedial corticoid area. It has been postulated that the neurons forming the nucleus of the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> derive from the dorsal pallium and migrate tangentially into its final position caudal to the olfactory tuberculum. Situated ventral to the pallium in the basic vertebrate forebrain plan (though representing a topologically rostral field in neural plate fate maps) is another region of telencephalic gray matter known as the subpallium, which is the progenitor area for the basal ganglia, a set of structures that {{play a crucial role in}} the executive control of behavior. The subpallium region has distinct striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic subregions, which are stretched obliquely between the septal midline and the amygdala at the posterior pole of the telencephalon. At least the striatum, pallidum and diagonal domains extend into the amygdala, representing there the subpallial amygdala, forming its central and medial nucleis, as well as the amygdaloid end of the bed nucleus stria terminalis complex.|$|E
50|$|The mitral cells {{leave the}} {{olfactory}} bulb in the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract,</b> which synapses on five major {{regions of the}} cerebrum: the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the amygdala, the piriform cortex, and the entorhinal cortex. The anterior olfactory nucleus projects, via the anterior commissure, to the contralateral olfactory bulb, inhibiting it. The piriform cortex has two major divisions with anatomically distinct organizations and functions. The anterior piriform cortex (APC) appears to be better at determining the chemical structure of the odorant molecules, and the posterior piriform cortex (PPC) has a strong role in categorizing odors and assessing similarities between odors (e.g. minty, woody, and citrus are odors that can, despite being highly variant chemicals, be distinguished via the PPC in a concentration-independent manner). The piriform cortex projects to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which then projects to the orbitofrontal cortex. The orbitofrontal cortex mediates conscious perception of the odor. The three-layered piriform cortex projects {{to a number of}} thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, the hippocampus and amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex, but its function is largely unknown. The entorhinal cortex projects to the amygdala and is involved in emotional and autonomic responses to odor. It also projects to the hippocampus and is involved in motivation and memory. Odor information is stored in long-term memory and has strong connections to emotional memory. This is possibly due to the olfactory system's close anatomical ties to the limbic system and hippocampus, areas of the brain that have long been known to be involved in emotion and place memory, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Sniffing, a {{behavior}} that enhances detection and localization of odorants, is typically assumed to require behavioral arousal. In {{an effort to}} determine whether sniffing and arousal are dissociable, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) was presented to 8 -day-old rats while respiration and behavioral state were monitored. Pups sniffed {{in response to the}} highest concentrations of DMDS, exhibiting a lower olfactory threshold when awake. Surprisingly, sniffing occurred even while pups remained asleep. Sniffing was mediated by the olfactory system, as evidenced by the abolition of sniffing when the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts</b> were cut and the retention of rapid arousal in response to a trigeminal stimulant, acetic acid. Finally, sleeping pups presented with acetic acid awakened without sniffing. Thus, although olfactory threshold increases during sleep, sleeping does not preclude sniffing. Sleep in mammals can be defined by using electrographic cri-teria—including changes in the electromyogram (EMG) and elec-troencephalogram (EEG) —and behavioral criteria—including a relaxed posture and increased sensory thresholds (Campbell & Tobler, 1984; Rechtschaffen & Kales, 1968).

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{olfaction}} {{is essential for the}} occurrence of sexual behavior in male goldfish. Sex pheromones from ovulatory females elicit male sexual behavior, chasing and sperm releasing act. In female goldfish, ovarian prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) elicits female sexual behavior, egg releasing act. It has been considered that olfaction does not affect sexual behavior in female goldfish. In the present study, we reexamined the involvement of olfaction in sexual behavior of female goldfish. Olfaction was blocked in male and female goldfish by two methods: nasal occlusion (NO) which blocks the reception of olfactants, and <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> section (OTX) which blocks transmission of olfactory information from the olfactory bulb to the telencephalon. Sexual behavior of goldfish was induced by administration of PGF to females, an established method for inducing goldfish sexual behavior in both sexes. Sexual behavior in males was suppressed by NO and OTX as previously reported because of lack of pheromone stimulation. In females, NO suppressed sexual behavior but OTX did not affect the occurrence of sexual behavior. Females treated with both NO and OTX performed sexual behavior normally. These results indicate that olfaction is essential in female goldfish to perform sexual behavior as in males but in a different manner. The lack of olfaction in males causes lack of pheromonal stimulation, resulting in no behavior elicited. Whereas the results of female experiments suggest that lack of olfaction in females causes strong inhibition of sexual behavior mediated by the <b>olfactory</b> pathway. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> section is considered to block the pathway and remove this inhibition, resulting in the resumption of the behavior. By subtract sectioning of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract,</b> it was found that this inhibition was mediated by the medial <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts,</b> not the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts.</b> Thus, it is concluded that goldfish has gender-typical olfactory regulation for sexual behavior...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now known}} that removal of the {{olfactory}} bulbs increases basal gonadotropin secretion and prevents short-photoperiod-induced testicular regression in Syrian hamsters. The experiments {{described in the present}} paper were an attempt to determine which neuronal systems associated with the olfactory bulbs are responsible for this influence on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis. In the first experiment, removal of the vomeronasal organ failed to influence gonadotropin secretion or testes weight in hamster on long or short photoperiod, suggesting that the vomeronasal-accessory olfactory pathway is not individually responsible for the effect of the olfactory bulbs on gonadotropin secretion. In the second experiment, bilateral transection of the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts</b> (LOT) did prevent short-photoperiod-induced testicular regression and the associated decrease in gonadotropin secretion. Since the nervus terminalis is confined {{to the surface of the}} medial olfactory bulb pathway, the results of LOT transection indicate that the nervus terminalis, which itself contains gonadotropin releasing hormone, does not mediate the influence of the olfactory bulbs on gonadotropin secretion.

The projections from the AC to the posterior insular cortex, were studied in 5 male adult rats by retrograde marking of neurons with pseudorabies virus (PRV). After inoculation of PRV into the insular cortex, rats were sacrificed after 51, 57 or 72 hours. The serial sections of AC were examined by using immunohistochemistry, with an antibody against PRV. The goal of this study was to identify the nuclei of rat AC with the presence of PRV, to estimate the density of PRV, and also to note the speed of PRV propagation from the posterior insular cortex to AC. Clear distribution of PRV particles in amygdaloid nucleus was observed in the rat brain after 72 hours while in earlier sacrificed animals (51 and 57 hours) there was no positive reaction. The high density of PRV-immunoreactive neurons was in the ipsilateral lateral and basolateral nucleus, as well as in the amygdalohippocampal area. The lower density was in the ipsilateral basomedial, central, medial, posterior cortical nucleus, and nuclei of <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tracts,</b> as well as in the contralateral basomedial nucleus.

The study of more primitive animals, however, shows a phylogenetic division into a primitive centromedial group and a more recent basolateral group (Johnson, 1923; Koikegami, Fuse, Yokoyama, Watanabe, & Watanabe, 1955). The centromedial group is composed of the central and medial nuclei and the nucleus of the <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract.</b> The small-celled medial portion of the basal nucleus is also sometimes included...|$|E

FBM (1 00 - 500. tM) {{had little effect on}} neuronal membrane proper-ties and on postsynaptic potentials evoked by electrical stim-ulation of <b>lateral</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>tract</b> terminals, whereas it reduced the duration of presumed Ca spikes induced by intracellular Cs loading. In contrast, the muscarinic receptor agonist ox-otremorine-M (1 0. tM) or the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist 1 -aminocyclopentane- 1 S- 3 R-dicarboxylic acid (1 0 p. M) induced a sustained membrane depolarization with repetitive firing, an increase in input resistance and the appearance of a slow poststimulus afterdepolarizing potential. These effect...|$|E
