Administered alone, ME (2. 5 and 5. 0 mM/kg), EE (2. 5 and 5. 0 mM/kg) or BE (0. 75 and 1. 25 mM/kg) resulted in a decrease of red blood cells (RBC), packed cell volumes (PCV), and hemoglobin concentration (HGB), {{as well as an}} increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count (Ret). In the rats co-ex- posed to ethanol and EGAEs, a significantly less pronounced hematological changes in comparison with animal exposed to these ethers alone were seen. The rats simultaneously exposed to ethanol and both ME and EE at the lower dose demonstrated mainly protection from the alterations in <b>leukocyte</b> <b>system.</b> In contrast, in the rats which consumed ethanol and were simultaneously treated with the higher dose of ME or EE (5. 0 mM/kg) the amelioration of same hematological parameters were displayed. The intake of ethanol along with BE treatment at both doses resulted in markedly ameliorated hematological parameters, compared to those which were changed by BE alone. In conclusion, the decrease of the hemolytic effects of EGAEs is ethanol dependent. Ethanol is a substrate of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and affinity of this enzyme to ethanol is greater than that to glycol ethers. It is possible that ethanol results in the change in EGAEs metabolism...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} cloned two thyroid-specific cDNAs encoding {{new members of}} the NADPH oxidase family. ThOX 1 and ThOX 2 proteins are colocalized with thyroperoxidase at the apical membrane of human thyroid cells. In the present study we have determined their subcellular localization and maturation {{in relation to their}} enzymatic activity. A majority of ThOX proteins accumulated inside the cell and only a small fraction was expressed at the surface. Western blots demonstrated that ThOX's are glycoproteins of 180, 000 and 190, 000. When totally deglycosylated the molecular weight of both ThOX 1 and ThOX 2 drops to 160, 000. Ca 2 + stimulates the basal H 2 O 2 generation in PC Cl 3 cells at a level corresponding to 20 % of the leukocyte H 2 O 2 production stimulated by PMA. Nonthyroid cell lines transfected with ThOX 1 and ThOX 2 show only a single immunoreactive band in Western blot analysis, corresponding to the protein of 180, 000. This "immature" protein remains exclusively intracellular and does not present any enzymatic activity. This is not modified by coexpression of thyroperoxidase and p 22 Phox. Transfection of ThOX cDNAs into PLB-XCGD cells does not reconstitute their NADPH oxidase activity. We conclude that (1) the thyroid contains some elements of the leukocyte H 2 O 2 -generating system but not all of them; (2) ThOX's are predominantly or exclusively located inside the cell in thyrocytes or in transfected cells, respectively, and as such they are inactive; (3) ThOX's cannot replace gp 91 Phox in the leukocyte; and (4) the thyroid H 2 O 2 -generating system is analogous to the <b>leukocyte</b> <b>system</b> with regard to ThOX's and gp 91 Phox but very different in other aspects. Additional thyroid-specific components are probably required to get complete protein processing and full enzymatic activity in the thyroid. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|Abstract Background Leukocytes play an {{important}} role in the human immune system. The family of leukocytes is comprised of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. Any infection or acute stress may increase or decrease the number of leukocytes. An increased percentage of neutrophils may be caused by an acute infection, while an increased percentage of lymphocytes can be caused by a chronic bacterial infection. It is important to realize an abnormal variation in the leukocytes. The five types of leukocytes can be distinguished by their cytoplasmic granules, staining properties of the granules, size of cell, the proportion of the nuclear to the cytoplasmic material, and the type of nucleolar lobes. The number of lobes increased when leukemia, chronic nephritis, liver disease, cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency occurred. Clinical neutrophil hypersegmentation has been widely used as an indicator of B 12 or folate deficiency. Biomedical technologists can currently recognize abnormal leukocytes using human eyes. However, the quality and efficiency of diagnosis may be compromised due to the limitations of the biomedical technologists' eyesight, strength, and medical knowledge. Therefore, the development of an automatic <b>leukocyte</b> recognition <b>system</b> is feasible and necessary. It is essential to extract the leukocyte region from a blood smear image in order to develop an automatic <b>leukocyte</b> recognition <b>system.</b> The number of lobes increased when leukemia, chronic nephritis, liver disease, cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency occurred. Clinical neutrophil hypersegmentation has been widely used as an indicator of B 12 or folate deficiency. Results The purpose of this paper is to contribute an automatic leukocyte nuclei image segmentation method for such recognition technology. The other goal of this paper is to develop the method of counting the number of lobes in a cell nucleus. The experimental results demonstrated impressive segmentation accuracy. Conclusions Insensitive to the variance of images, the LNS (Leukocyte Nuclei Segmentation) method functioned well to isolate the leukocyte nuclei from a blood smear image with much better UR (Under Segmentation Rate), ER (Overall Error Rate), and RDE (Relative Distance Error). The presented LC (Lobe Counting) method is capable of splitting leukocyte nuclei into lobes. The experimental results illuminated that both methods can give expressive performances. In addition, three advanced image processing techniques were proposed as weighted Sobel operator, GDW (Gradient Direction Weight), and GBPD (Genetic-based Parameter Detector). </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The human <b>leukocyte</b> antigen <b>system</b> (HLA) {{contains}} many highly variable genes. HLA genes {{play an important}} role in the human immune system, and HLA gene matching is crucial for the success of human organ transplantations. Numerous studies have demonstrated that variation in HLA genes is associated with many autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, typing HLA genes by serology or PCR is time consuming and expensive, which limits large-scale studies involving HLA genes. Since it is much easier and cheaper to obtain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data, accurate computational algorithms to infer HLA gene types from SNP genotype data are in need. To infer HLA types from SNP genotypes, the first step is to infer SNP haplotypes from genotypes. However, for the same SNP genotype data set, the haplotype configurations inferred by different methods are usually inconsistent, and it is often difficult to decide which one is true. Results: In this paper, we design an accurate HLA gene type inference algorithm by utilizing SNP genotype data from pedigrees, known HLA gene types of some individuals and the relationship between inferred SNP haplotypes and HLA gene types. Given a set of haplotypes inferred from the genotypes of a population consisting of many pedigrees, the algorithm first constructs a weighted similarity graph based on a new haplotype similarity measur...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate that RvD 1 actions on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are pertussis toxin sensitive, decrease actin polymerization, and block LTB 4 -regulated adhesion molecules (Î² 2 integrins). Synthetic [3 H]-RvD 1 was prepared, which revealed specific RvD 1 recognition sites on human <b>leukocytes.</b> Screening <b>systems</b> to identify receptors for RvD 1 gave two candidatesâALX, a lipoxin A 4 receptor, and GPR 32, an orphanâthat were confirmed using a Î²-arrestin-based ligand receptor system.
