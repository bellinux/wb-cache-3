5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> shortness of breath, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, petechiae (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> fever, and joint pain are common.

25|$|Hippocrates, in Book 1 of his Of the Epidemics, {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} the disease: fever, colorless urine, cough resulting in a thick sputa, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> thirst and <b>appetite.</b> He notes that most of the sufferers became delirious before they succumbed to the disease. Hippocrates and many other at the time believed phthisis to be hereditary in nature. Aristotle disagreed, believing the disease was contagious.|$|R
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection.

50|$|Sodium {{arsenite}} can be inhaled or absorbed {{through the}} skin. Along with its known carcinogenic and teratogenic effects, {{contact with the}} substance can yield symptoms such as skin irritation, burns, itching, thickened skin, rash, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> pigment, poor <b>appetite,</b> a metallic or garlic taste, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, decreased blood pressure, and headache. Severe acute poisoning may lead to nervous system damage resulting in weakness, poor coordination, or “pins and needles” sensations, eventual paralysis, and death.|$|R
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite.</b> The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

50|$|MDD is {{a medical}} {{condition}} that includes abnormalities of affect or mood, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sleep and <b>appetite,</b> and feelings <b>of</b> worthlessness and hopelessness. The relationship between depression and self injury is unclear. Although some studies indicate {{that those who have}} engaged in NSSI before are more likely to experience depression and symptoms of depression, other findings have failed to find any correlation between self injury and MDD. However specific symptoms of depression have been found in NSSI such as a negative cognitive schema, suicidal ideation, lower self-worth, and dysphoria.|$|R
40|$|Mucosal {{surfaces}} have {{a fundamental}} participation in {{many aspects of}} the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection pathogenesis. In Brazilian HIV- 1 infected subjects, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> weight and <b>appetite</b> are among the most debilitating symptoms. In this review we describe a defined mucosal immunogen that has profound but transient effects on HIV viral load, and we suggest that gut associated lymphoid tissue under constant immunostimulation is likely to provide a major contribution to the total levels of HIV.

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} of mild reductions in growth rate with prolonged stimulant treatment in children, but no causal relationship has been established and reductions {{do not appear to}} persist long-term. Weight loss almost always corresponds with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite,</b> which may result from the medication. Severe weight loss is very uncommon though. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>appetite</b> is very temporary and typically comes back as daily effects of stimulates wear off. Nausea, dizziness, and headaches, other side effect, can also indirectly affect appetite and result in weight loss.|$|E

40|$|Rats with {{bilateral}} lesions of {{the lateral}} hypothalamus (LH) fail to exhibit sodium <b>appetite.</b> Lesions <b>of</b> the parabrachial nuclei (PBN) also block salt appetite. The PBN projection to the LH is largely ipsilateral. If these deficits are functionally dependent, damaging the PBN {{on one side}} and the LH on the other should also block Na appetite. First, bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the LH were needed because the electrolytic damage used previously destroyed both cells and axons. The ibotenic LH lesions produced substantial weight loss and eliminated Na appetite. Controls with ipsilateral PBN and LH lesions gained weight and displayed robust sodium appetite. The rats with asymmetric PBN-LH lesions also gained weight, but after sodium depletion consistently failed to increase intake of 0. 5 M NaCl. These results dissociate <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sodium <b>appetite</b> from the classic weight loss after LH damage and prove that Na appetite requires communication between neurons in the LH and the PBN...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} prospectively {{the relationship}} between appetite, food composition, nutritional habits and weight <b>loss</b> following administration <b>of</b> topiramate (TPM) and to identify predictors for TPM induced weight loss. Methods: 22 patients with epilepsy who were started on TPM were prospectively followed for 6 months and contacted again after a mean follow-up time of 37. 1 months. Results: Body mass index (BMI) loss occurred in 59 % of patients, with a mean weight <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> 9. 5 kg after 6 months while receiving TPM without further weight loss at the long term follow-up. Weight loss was associated with reduction in appetite without affecting food composition. Predictors for BMI loss after 6 months were high initial BMI and body fat. After 3 weeks of treatment with TPM, the recorded parameters did not predict BMI loss but at 3 months, weight <b>loss,</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>appetite</b> and amount <b>of</b> food intake were predictive for the amount <b>of</b> BMI <b>loss</b> after 6 months. Topiramate (TPM) is approved as an antiepileptic drug and for migraine prophylaxis. Although it is known to induce weight loss, 1 – 8 the mechanism leading to weight loss is unclear. The present study aimed to prospectively evaluate {{the relationship between}} appetite, food composition, nutritional habits and weight loss following treatment with TPM and to identify predictors for weight loss after 6 months...|$|R

25|$|Dogs {{that develop}} the disease {{show signs of}} the illness within 3 to 7 days. The signs may include lethargy, vomiting, fever, and {{diarrhea}} (usually bloody). Generally, {{the first sign of}} CPV is lethargy. Secondary signs are <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> weight and <b>appetite</b> or diarrhea followed by vomiting. Diarrhea and vomiting result in dehydration that upsets the electrolyte balance and this may affect the dog critically. Secondary infections occur {{as a result of the}} weakened immune system. Because the normal intestinal lining is also compromised, blood and protein leak into the intestines leading to anemia and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protein, and endotoxins escaping into the bloodstream, causing endotoxemia. Dogs have a distinctive odor in the later stages of the infection. The white blood cell level falls, further weakening the dog. Any or all of these factors can lead to shock and death.|$|R
