5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were <b>low</b> <b>on</b> fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were <b>low</b> <b>on</b> fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before dawn}} on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla {{surprised}} the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged {{the other three}} while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired {{by one of the}} destroyers in Narvik. Commander Bey's other two ships were very <b>low</b> <b>on</b> fuel and all three were running <b>low</b> <b>on</b> ammunition, so he decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the intertropical convergence zone.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 19. The wave moved westward, but was difficult to track due to its proximity to Hurricane Lisa and another large tropical wave. It passed through the Lesser Antilles, and slowly organized as convection increased due to an upper level <b>low.</b> <b>On</b> October 5, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and developed an area of low pressure two days later.

5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. A few Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group attached to the 1st Army Group which had survived an early morning raid on their airfield the previous day, mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running <b>low</b> <b>on</b> artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica along with its artillery support, and remained in the town during the night.
