5000|$|The {{school in}} {{partnership}} with the Salesian province leadership proceeded to search for a property in Boston fulfilling the necessary requirements. The school leadership looked in a few locations, including Jamaica Plain and the South End. A 14 January 1954 Jamaica Plain Citizen article read:"New School to be Built on Rockwood St.Don Bosco Technical School Will Offer Facilities For 1,000 StudentsConstruction of a new Don Bosco Technical School with facilities for more than 1000 students will be started on Rockwood Street, Jamaica Plain, sometime in March, it was disclosed this week. The New School, a $1,000,000 three-building project, will replace the present school which was founded on Byron street, East Boston in 1946 to provide technical as well as academic training. Present school facilities are inadequate {{to take care of the}} number of students who have requested to enroll in the past few years, officials said. The new school will contain facilities for technical, academic, recreational and religious instruction of its students.To Occupy 23 AcresThe plant will occupy more than 23 acres. Two buildings, facing each other, will border on Rockwood Street.The third will set behind these two structures and face the street. One of the front buildings will house the teaching staff. Directly opposite will be a building containing a chapel, gymnasium and cafeteria. The rear building will house classrooms, a library, science laboratories and the woodworking, printing, auto mechanics and radio-television shops. The new gymnasium and chapel will be connected by a sliding door which when opened will increase the gym when large crowds are expected for service. The school operated by the Salesian Fathers and Brothers of Saint John Bosco, started in East Boston with 16 seventh grade students. The school now has an enrollment of 200 pupils and grammar school classes have been discussed. The first building of the proposed project is expected to be ready for students in February or next year."Another Jamaica Plain Citizen article from 19 August 1954 announced the choice of the South End site where the school was located from 1954 until its closure in 1998:"Don Bosco Trade To Be Located On Site Of Brandeis School Seen In Best Interests Of Local Area ResidentsThe abandonment of the Jamaica Plain site for the Don Bosco Trade School in favor of the former Brandeis High School on Warrenton Street, South End, was announced today by Councilman Edward F.

McLaughlin was the first public official to suggest a delay in construction and recommended the Brandeis school as a site. The school had been declared surplus and was considered one of the best equipped and centrally located high schools for a trade institution.

Sanitary engineers had a defined job of protecting human health and preventing the spread of disease by treating wastewater and producing potable water.

Notre Dame {{is the major}} sponsor of this joint initiative. The competition was aimed to help young people engage with Australia’s first saint {{and encourage them to}} consider and express what she meant to them. The winning video, sponsored by Notre Dame, will be shown live at the Canonisation event in both Rome and Sydney (St Mary’s Cathedral) and via SKY webcam. Family and friends of the ten competition finalists gathered at Notre Dame to hear the judges’ decision and see Deputy Vice Chancellor, Professor Hayden Ramsay, present young film maker, Kieran Williams, with a first prize of 5000, for his film, Suffering with a Smile. Mr William’s three-minute feature focused on Daniel Khoury, who died of cancer aged 9. Daniel’s courageous fight and selflessness throughout his suffering paralleled events in the life of Mother Mary MacKillop. “I wanted to look at one aspect of Mary’s life that made her a saint and then I reflected on people in my own life whom I believed lived saintly lives,” said Mr Williams. “Daniel went through enormous suffering, but despite all of that he remained cheerful and positive and that is what inspired me. ”Kieran’s entry will be shown to thousands of viewers during the Canonisation celebrations in Rome and at Sydney’s St Mary’s Cathedral on October 17. The judging panel, including Notre Dame Executive Dean of Arts 2 ̆ 6 Sciences, Professor Gerry Turcotte, 2 GB Radio Presenter Alan Jones, Australian Director Claire McCarthy, and Sr Patricia Malone of the Josephites, said the film captured how Mary MacKillop was ‘alive today’. The 2000 second prize went to Alfio Stuto for his film, Mary of the Cross and third prize, an IT package, was won by Thomas Ricciardiello and Anh Ngugen for their film based on Mary’s iconic quote, “Never see a need without doing something about it. ”When presenting the prizes, Professor Ramsay said he was impressed by the young cinematographers’ understanding of Mother Mary’s Saintliness. “The best part about watching all the videos was encountering young people who firmly believe that our saint-to-be is alive and working in 2010; she is alive in heaven and so she is at work interceding for us on earth,” said Professor Ramsay. “Blessed Mary MacKillop lived for her Sisters, for young people and for education; today we are proud to bring her Sisters and our young people together at the Broadway site where Catholic education was being delivered when Mary was young – and where it is still being delivered today. ” During the event, Foxtel launched their docu-drama, Blessed Mary: A Saint for All Australians, which will screen on the History Channel, October 10, and coincide with the Canonisation.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} if essential oils misted in broiler houses reduce environmental fungi counts. The investigation {{was conducted in}} three experimental rooms, where broiler chickens were reared between 1 to 42 d of age. Every three days, the rooms were fogged with pure water (control) or with aqueous solutions of peppermint or thyme oils. On the next day, fogging samples from the air, flat surfaces, and litter were collected and quantitatively and qualitatively analysed for fungal contamination. The treatment with essential oils showed promising results. In the room fogged with thyme oil, aerial fungi growth was not as evident as in the control room, and presented the lowest average fungi count. Thyme oil was also the most effective in reducing fungi colonization on drinker surfaces and litter. The use of peppermint oil also reduced the population of air, wall, surface and litter fungi, although some exceptions were noted. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Saccharomyces genera were identified most frequently. The effect of essential oils was noticeable in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two <b>weeks,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> counts of Aspergillus sp. were 75 % (thyme oil) and 46 % (peppermint oil) lower {{in comparison with the}} control group.

The Icelandic government decided in mid-October to apply for this combined sovereign bailout package, of which the IMF had offered to pay $2.1bn and the bilateral bailout loans being offered had a size of $3.0bn, and the negotiations to settle the terms for the bailout package <b>lasted</b> almost four <b>weeks.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> time came for the bailout loan to be formally approved by the Board of the IMF, it however became clear that the Icesave dispute also first needed to be resolved, before the bailout loan could be transferred. Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said that the Netherlands would oppose activation of the IMF loan, unless a mutual agreement first was reached over Icesave.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic illness that may often follow a relapsing-remitting course. Many {{of the factors that}} may be {{associated}} with the spontaneous remission of this disease (i. e. not related to specific treatment) remain to be determined. In the present report, we review the medical history of a patient with a long history of moderate to severe Crohn's whose complete remission immediately followed the development of a febrile infection. The patient first developed symptoms of Crohn's in her late adolescent years. At the time of diagnosis at age 23, she was placed on mesalamine - without effective control her disease symptoms. Due to progressive deterioration, the patient underwent a bowel resection at age 25. Soon afterwards symptoms recurred, gradually increasing in severity. In February 2005, at age 36, the patient developed a painful abscess associated with a rectal fistula. Other symptoms at the time included chronic bone and stomach pain, swollen joints, and debilitating fatigue. Surgical correction was scheduled in mid-March. In late February, the patient developed a respiratory infection associated with fevers of 103 - 104 °F. After the onset of fever, the abscess pain disappeared and this was soon followed by a disappearance of all other disease symptoms. By the time the corrective surgery occurred, she had no Crohn's symptoms. Her remission <b>lasted</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> previous symptoms then reappeared. The patient has subsequently used a variety of conventional therapies, but still suffers from severe symptoms of her disease. In recent years, a growing body of literature has emphasized the important role that innate immunity plays in the etiology of Crohn's disease; however, a key component of innate immunity, the febrile response, has been overlooked. Other cases of spontaneous remission following febrile infection in inflammatory bowel disease have been reported. Moreover, induction of a febrile response was in the past used as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, but was later replaced by surgery and corticosteroids. Further exploration of this arm of the innate immune response may provide new opportunities for patients where conventional therapies fail to secure relief. </p...|$|R

Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> attendants at <b>the</b> Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunity}} induced in mice by vaccination {{with living}} attenuated cultures of tubercle bacilli {{was measured by}} two criteria. (a) Increase in survival time of the vaccinated animals after infection with a dose of virulent bacilli sufficient to kill all the unvaccinated controls within 10 to 20 days. (b) Difference {{in the number of}} living bacilli recovered from the spleen and lungs of vaccinated and normal animals infected with a small dose of virulent bacilli. The level of immunity induced was found to depend upon the extent of multiplication in vivo of the bacilli used for vaccination. This in turn was conditioned by the degree of attenuation characteristic of the bacterial strain used in the preparation of the vaccine, the amount of vaccine injected, the route of vaccination, and the time interval between vaccination and challenge infection. It was possible to prevent or retard the development of immunity by treating the mice in course of immunization with a drug, isoniazid, capable of interrupting the multiplication in vivo of the bacilli used as vaccine. Although immunity regularly developed and <b>lasted</b> for many <b>weeks</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> proper conditions of vaccination were used, the immune response was never sufficient to protect the animals against ultimate death from infection with virulent tubercle bacilli. The prolongation of life in the vaccinated mice was not consequent on a direct bactericidal effect but rather on a retarded or interrupted multiplication of the virulent bacilli in vivo. The quantitative bacteriological techniques {{used in the present study}} would appear to be of value for the analysis of certain problems of immunity, and for the appraisal of vaccines and techniques of vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{microbiological}} and physico-chemical changes throughout three cheesemaking replicates of Italian Formaggelle di capra cheese made from raw goat milk. Therefore, during the process, three samples of milk, curd and cheese at 3, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 30 days of ripening old cheese were taken from three cheesemaking replicates. The average of total mesophilic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae count in raw milk was 5. 27 ± 0. 57 and 3. 8 ± 1. 02 Log cfu/mL, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria was the predominant bacterial group during the process, and they developed in different ways {{in each of the}} media used (M 17 and MRS agar). Variability of microbial concentrations was observed between three cheesemaking replicates. A correlation between the presence of higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae in milk and the presence of other contaminants bacteria such as Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase-positive and coagulase-positive staphylococci was observed. In cheesemaking replicate n. 2, E. coli level was 5. 07 ± 0. 03 Log cfu/mL and increased by about 1 log until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of ripening, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> level decreased to 5. 69 ± 0. 2 Log cfu/mL. The milk used for the cheesemaking replicate n. 2 was found to be contaminated also by coagulase-positive staphylococci (3. 18 ± 0. 06 Log cfu/mL), but the behaviour of this group appeared to be very variable. In this study a first step of process control and microbial groups study was performed and the cheesemaking process was registered in the website www. ars-alimentaria. it, the Italian site supported by the Italian Board of Health...|$|R
