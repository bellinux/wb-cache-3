The present study examined the genetic architecture and genetic association between schizotypy and genetic <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> schizophrenia among multigenerational, multiplex schizophrenia families. Genetic schizotypy factors were identified that significantly correlated with genetic <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> schizophrenia, although some relations were unexpected in direction. These genetic factors did not correlate with genetic <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> major depressive disorder or substance dependence. Results suggest that genetic schizotypy factors may {{have the potential to}} be particularly useful endophenotypes in genetic linkage analyses of schizophrenia...|$|R

In 2000 the school was accepted into pre-accreditation status by the American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE), which is separate from regional accreditation bodies and was renamed Southern Virginia University. In 2003 it was granted full accreditation by the AALE. In June 2010 the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools awarded initial candidacy to SVU. Two years later, in June 2012, the university received full regional accreditation.|$|E

As of July 10, 2009, the new GM has over $40 billion in cash, with the company's reorganized liability total of $48.8 billion which includes $24.4 billion to be paid to the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust, $9 billion to the U.S. and Canadian governments, and $15 billion in <b>liabilities</b> <b>to</b> suppliers and other bills. GM is slated to pay $10 billion to the VEBA trust in December 2009, with the remainder being paid in increments from 2012-19. GM isn't required to make contributions to its pension fund until 2013, but it may elect to if needed, since the company contributed $15.2 billion to its pension fund in 2003. Stock market conditions cause the fund value to fluctuate. In February 2009, GM's combined pension fund had about $85 billion in assets, $56 billion in assets for hourly pensions and $29 billion in assets for salaried pensions.|$|E

40|$|Background Few studies {{examining}} the genetic architecture of cigarette smoking {{have focused on}} adolescents or examined developmental changes in additive genetic, shared environment and unique environmental influences on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> initiate cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked. The {{aim of this study}} is to add to the literature on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using a nationally representative sample. Method Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult twin pairs (ages 14 - 33) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We ran a series of developmental causal-contingent-common pathway models to examine whether additive genetic, shared and unique environmental influences on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> the initiation of cigarette use are shared with those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results We found evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette use. Early in adolescence genetic and environmental influences work independently on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> these behaviors becomes correlated as individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions These findings provide insight into the causal processes underlying the <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and environmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked...|$|R

2500|$|Credit/default: Default risk is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time. [...] For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus. A key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating. Different tranches within the ABS are rated differently, with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating, and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings. Almost all mortgages, including reverse mortgages, and student loans, are now insured by the government, meaning that taxpayers are {{on the hook for}} any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively over-inflated. In other words, there are no limits or curbs on over-spending, or the <b>liabilities</b> <b>to</b> taxpayers.|$|E
2500|$|William Clay Ford Jr., {{great-grandson}} of Henry Ford (and {{better known}} by his nickname [...] "Bill"), was appointed Executive Chairman in 1998, and also became Chief Executive Officer {{of the company}} in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming {{the first member of}} the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of President and Chief Operation Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as President and CEO, with Ford continuing as Executive Chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral. Chairman Bill Ford has stated that [...] "bankruptcy is not an option". Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at approximately [...] as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid [...] of its future <b>liabilities</b> <b>to</b> the fund. The agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.|$|E
