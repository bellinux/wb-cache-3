25|$|Human VF are paired {{structures}} {{located in}} the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human VF are roughly 12 – 24mm in length, and 3–5mm thick. Histologically, the human VF are a <b>laminated</b> <b>structure</b> composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, {{main body of the}} VF, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SLP), the intermediate layer (ILP), and the deep layer (DLP). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The most common way being to look at the ECM content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form {{what is known as the}} vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.|$|E
60|$|This whole great pile of rock has {{suffered}} much metamorphic action, as is very {{obvious in the}} gradual formation and appearance of the crystals of albitic feldspar and of epidote--in the bending together of the fragments-- in {{the appearance of a}} <b>laminated</b> <b>structure</b> in the feldspathic slate--and, lastly, in the disappearance of the planes of stratification, which could sometimes be seen on the same mountain quite distinct in the upper part, less and less plain on the flanks, and quite obliterated at the base. Partly owing to this metamorphic action, and partly to the close relationship in origin, I have seen fragments of porphyries--taken from a metamorphosed conglomerate--from a neighbouring stream of lava--from the nucleus or centre (as it appeared to me) of the whole submarine volcano-- and lastly from an intrusive mass of quite subsequent origin, all of which were absolutely undistinguishable in external characters.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the finest}} streaks of colour in the stony layers, {{alternating}} with the obsidian, can be distinctly seen {{to be due to}} an incipient crystallisation of the constituent minerals. The extent to which the minerals have crystallised can, also, be distinctly seen to be connected with the greater or less size, and with the number, of the minute, flattened, crenulated air-cavities or fissures. Numerous facts, {{as in the case of}} geodes, and of cavities in silicified wood, in primary rocks, and in veins, show that crystallisation is much favoured by space. Hence, I conclude, that, if in a mass of cooling volcanic rock, any cause produced in parallel planes a number of minute fissures or zones of less tension (which from the pent-up vapours would often be expanded into crenulated air-cavities), the crystallisation of the constituent parts, and probably the formation of concretions, would be superinduced or much favoured in such planes; and thus, a <b>laminated</b> <b>structure</b> of the kind we are here considering would be generated.|$|E

60|$|Whatever may {{be thought}} of the {{explanation}} here advanced of the <b>laminated</b> <b>structure</b> of the rocks of the trachytic series, I venture to call the attention of geologists to the simple fact, that in a body of rock at Ascension, undoubtedly of volcanic origin, layers often of extreme tenuity, quite straight, and parallel to each other, have been produced;--some composed of distinct crystals of quartz and diopside, mingled with amorphous augitic specks and granular feldspar,--others entirely composed of these black augitic specks, with granules of oxide of iron,--and lastly, others formed of crystalline feldspar, in {{a more or less}} perfect state of purity, together with numerous crystals of feldspar, placed lengthways. At this island, there is reason to believe, and in some analogous cases, it is certainly known, that the laminae have originally been formed with their present high inclination. Facts of this nature are manifestly of importance, with relation to the structural origin of that grand series of plutonic rocks, which like the volcanic have undergone the action of heat, and which consist of alternate layers of quartz, feldspar, mica and other minerals.|$|E
60|$|Taking {{for data}} the {{appearances}} of the Earth's crust {{in a narrow}} district of Germany; observing the constant order of superposition of strata, and their respective physical characters; Werner drew the inference that strata of like characters succeeded each other in like order over the entire surface of the Earth. And seeing, from the <b>laminated</b> <b>structure</b> of many formations and the organic remains contained in others, that they were sedimentary; he further inferred that these universal strata had been in succession precipitated from a chaotic menstruum which once covered our planet. Thus, on a very incomplete acquaintance with a thousandth part of the Earth's crust, he based a sweeping generalization applying to the whole of it. This Neptunist hypothesis, mark, borne out though {{it seemed to be}} by the most conspicuous surrounding facts, was quite untenable if analyzed. That a universal chaotic menstruum should deposit a series of numerous sharply-defined strata, differing from one another in composition, is incomprehensible. That the strata so deposited should contain the remains of plants and animals, which could not have lived under the supposed conditions, is still more incomprehensible. Physically absurd, however, as was this hypothesis, it recognized, though under a distorted form, one of the great agencies of geological change--the action of water. It served also to express the fact, that the formations of the Earth's crust stand in some kind of order. Further, it did a little towards supplying a nomenclature, without which much progress was impossible. Lastly, it furnished a standard with which successions of strata in various regions could be compared, the differences noted, and the actual sections tabulated. It was the first provisional generalization; and was useful, if not indispensable, as a step to truer ones.|$|E

In this paper, reliability and sensitivity are evaluated by using first order reliability method (FORM), response surface method (RSM) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The study aims to find a numerical method to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> efficiently and accurately. An example of laminate with a large number of variables is analyzed. The results obtained by using different methods are compared in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

50|$|Fibre-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{can be divided}} into two main categories normally referred to as short fibre-reinforced materials and continuous fibre-reinforced materials. Continuous reinforced materials will often constitute a layered or <b>laminated</b> <b>structure.</b> The woven and continuous fibre styles are typically available in a variety of forms, being pre-impregnated with the given matrix (resin), dry, uni-directional tapes of various widths, plain weave, harness satins, braided, and stitched.|$|E

50|$|The {{procuticle}} in most land Arthropoda, particularly insects, {{is covered}} externally with a thin, waxy, water-resistant outer layer containing no chitin. That outer layer is the epicuticle, {{and it is}} much thinner than the procuticle. The chitinous procuticle consists of two major layers, the outer exocuticle and the inner endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is a <b>laminated</b> <b>structure</b> of layers of interwoven fibrous chitin and protein molecules, while the exocuticle is the layer in which any major thickening, armouring and biomineralization occurs.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage {{technology}} {{has become a}} possible solution {{to address the problem}} of global warming due to the increasing use of fossil fuels. The application of this technology by many carbon dioxide emitting industrial units is still hindered by the process and equipment cost associated with the capture of carbon dioxide. Zeolites have become a major player in this field due to their high adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide. Traditional use of zeolites in the form of pellets or beads has issues relating to high mass transfer resistance and increased energy consumption required to overcome high pressure drop for such systems. Novel structured adsorbents have been developed to manage these problems but they require high precision and cost for their manufacture. Although they are superior to beads/pellets in terms of breakthrough characteristics, they have very low loading of adsorbent. To overcome the limitations of high cost and low loading of non-particulate structures and the disadvantages of the conventional adsorbent structures, new preparatory techniques for adsorbent structures are being researched. For more practical applications, a zeolite structured adsorbent needs to be created that has high adsorption capacity, low pressure drop, high mass transfer and provides overall high system efficiency. In addition, the very large scale of the flue gas capture application demands that the adsorbent structure should be made using low cost materials and processes. Motivated by the low cost of papermaking technology, we have studied and adapted this technique to create a highly loaded, large surface area sheet structure. Zeolites have already found use in the paper industry as fillers and retention aids and can therefore be easily adapted to current paper mills to create <b>structured</b> <b>laminate</b> adsorbents. This project looks towards creating zeolite <b>laminate</b> <b>structured</b> adsorbent using papermaking techniques for carbon dioxide capture. The selection of materials for the preparation of <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> is initially done to create structures that are strong and have high porosity with high loading of zeolite. An easy method of preparing <b>laminate</b> zeolite sheet <b>structures</b> is also outlined. This leads to the next part of the project which is characterisation of the zeolite <b>laminate</b> sheet <b>structures.</b> Although few materials were used in preparation of the sheets, the many variables involved in sheet forming would make it very time consuming to create each unique sheet structure and characterise the properties. Hence, to speed up the process, a partial factorial design method was used to characterise the laminate sheets. 16 experiments were completed. SEM and mercury porosity methods were used to characterise the porosity of the sheet structures. These results show that porosity of the structure is mainly affected by the amount of silica present in the structure. Nitrogen adsorption and carbon dioxide adsorption measurements were studied to determine the loading in the <b>laminate</b> sheet <b>structures,</b> since the adsorption capacity is completely dependent on the zeolite. The strength of the <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> were measured using a novel testing method as it was difficult to apply the routine strength measurement methods to some of the weak laminate samples. Considering the application of the <b>laminate</b> <b>structures,</b> a vibratory sieve was used to determine the comparative strength of the different structures from the partial factorial design. It was found that <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> with either 40 - 55 wt% micron zeolite or 30 wt% nano zeolite had adequate strength for breakthrough testing. Structures with higher loading of zeolite fell apart very easily. The kinetics of the laminate samples were also measured using the Rate of Adsorption software in ASAP 2010. These results show that the presence of nano zeolite increases the adsorption kinetics of the <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> and on the whole the <b>laminate</b> <b>structure</b> had higher kinetics when compared to powder or beads due to overcoming macropore diffusion resistance. The structures which had the best characteristics from the partial factorial design were used for breakthrough testing. Testing for different porosities, it was found that structures with high porosity i. e. samples having 40 wt% zeolite had higher effective diffusivities and lower pressure drop when compared to structure with low porosity i. e. samples having 20 wt% zeolite. Other methods of increasing spacing between the folds of the <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> were also tested and using a wire to create spacing was found to be the best method to lower pressure drop. In some instances, the effective diffusivities were reduced while in other instances they were the same. But the method of winding to produce <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> for breakthrough testing produced highly variable results. An idea of printing hydrophobic channels on the paper samples was considered to improve breakthrough characteristics of the <b>laminate</b> <b>structures.</b> Since printing is easy, cheap and can be adapted to a large industrial setting, this method of creating channels for gas flow in the <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> has many advantages. An initial assessment of this method showed that using AKD to create hydrophobic patterns on the sheet was successful as different levels of depth were observed between the AKD treated and untreated sections in the final <b>laminate</b> <b>structure.</b> To create distinguishable regions of AKD treated and untreated sections, the amount of the zeolite loading and ceramic loading were also fixed at 8 g zeolite and 6. 5 g ceramic fibres. A method of printing parallel hydrophobic channels was established and the sheets were coated with two different weight % of colloidal silica (40 wt% and 20 wt%). These differing amounts of colloidal silica create <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> with different depths of channels as seen from SEM imaging. Breakthrough assessment of the printed <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> show that the structures with 20 wt% silica have higher effective diffusivities and lower pressure drop when compared to structures with 40 wt% silica or structures without hydrophobic printing, showing that <b>laminate</b> <b>structures</b> with printed channels is a very attractive adsorbent structure for CO 2 capture...|$|R
