500|$|According to Chaudhuri, {{unlike the}} Western feminist {{movement}}, India's movement was initiated by men, and later joined by women. But feminism as an initiative by women started independently a <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> Maharashtra by pioneering advocates of women's rights and education, Savitribai Phule, {{who started the}} first school for girls in India, Tarabai Shinde who wrote India's first feminist text, and Pandita Ramabai who criticized patriarchy and caste-system in Hinduism, married outside her caste and converted to Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone {{gave her}} first public speeches on women's {{rights in the}} fall of 1847, first at her brother Bowman’s church in Gardner, Massachusetts, and a <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> {{neighboring}} Warren. Stone became a lecturing agent for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in June, 1848, persuaded by Abby Kelley Foster that the experience would give her the speaking practice she still felt she needed before beginning her women’s rights campaign. Stone immediately proved to be an effective speaker, reported to wield extraordinary persuasive power over her audiences. She was described as “a little meek-looking Quakerish body, with the sweetest, modest manners and yet as unshrinking and self-possessed as a loaded canon.” One of her assets, in addition to a storytelling ability that could move audiences to tears or laughter as she willed, was said to be an unusual voice that contemporaries compared to a “silver bell,” and of which it was said, “no more perfect instrument had ever been bestowed upon a speaker.” ...|$|E

500|$|When {{it takes}} off, the Atlantic puffin patters {{across the surface}} of the water while vigorously {{flapping}} its wings, before launching itself into the air. The size of the wing is a compromise between its uses above and below water and its surface area is small relative to the bird's weight. To maintain flight, the wings need to beat very rapidly at a rate of several times each second. The bird's flight is direct and low over the surface of the water and it can travel at [...] per hour. Landing is awkward; it either crashes into a wave crest or, in calmer water, does a belly flop. While at sea, the Atlantic puffin has its annual moult. Land birds mostly lose their primaries one pair at a time to enable them still to be able to fly, but the puffin sheds all its primaries at one time and dispenses with flight entirely for a month or two. The moult usually takes place between January and March but young birds may lose their feathers a <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the year.|$|E

2500|$|Probably the {{earliest}} solos played on euphonium were cornet transcriptions, especially variations on popular airs, {{such as those}} found {{at the back of}} Jean-Baptiste Arban's Complete Method for Cornet. [...] A <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> the early twentieth century, the American cornettist Herbert L. Clarke wrote a body of virtuosic solos, including Carnival of Venice, Bride of the Waves, and From the Shores of the Mighty Pacific, that were and still are often performed on euphonium. [...] In such cases, no adaptation or arrangement is necessary; a euphoniumist reads the original notation in B-flat treble clef, transposing down a major ninth, and performs the piece exactly as written, merely sounding an octave below the cornet.|$|E
2500|$|There began that continual [...] "tossing and shifting" [...] of the deposed prelates [...] "{{from one}} keeper to another, from one prison to another", which William Allen [...] {{describes}} as {{one part of}} their [...] "martyrdom". The Council, in June, 1565, sent them all back to the Tower, although a <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> a letter of Parker (January 1566), Bullingham is mentioned as though again for a time Bishop Bourne's actual or intended keeper, while all the captive prelates continue {{during the next two}} years to be referred to as then in the public prisons. After nearly ten years of this, Bishop Bourne died, at Silverton in Devonshire, having been there committed (apparently not long) to the custody of George Carew, Archdeacon of Exeter and Dean of Windsor. There he was buried in the church.|$|E

[...] However, in The Chinese Gold Murders, which describes Dee's initial appointment and first criminal cases, the judge encounters two highwaymen, euphemistically called [...] "men of the greenwood", Ma Joong and Chiao Tai, who attempt to rob him but are so impressed with his character that they give up their criminal careers and join his retinue on the spot. (This encounter is recounted in a short flashback passage in the original Di Gong An, taking place when the two are already long-serving loyal members of his retinue). [...] A <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> The Chinese Lake Murders, a third criminal, Tao Gan, an itinerant confidence trickster and swindler, similarly joins.

2500|$|Until the mid-1860s, {{the village}} was usually spelt Cranley. The Post Office succeeded in getting the {{spelling}} changed to avoid confusion with nearby Crawley in West Sussex. The older spelling is preserved by the Cranley Hotel {{in the middle of}} the village. The origin of the name is recorded in the Pipe Rolls as both Cranlea in 1166 and Cranelega in 1167. A <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the Feet of Fines of 1198 the name is written as Cranele. Etymologists consider all these versions to be the fusion of the Old English words [...] "Cran", meaning [...] "crane", and [...] "Lēoh" [...] that together mean 'a woodland clearing visited by cranes'. The name is popularly believed to come from the large crane breeding grounds that were supposed to have been historically located at Vachery Pond, locally known as simply Vachery. The figure of a crane adorns the old drinking water fountain of 1874 which can still be found {{in the middle of the}} village in 'Fountain Square', and a pair of cranes adorn the crest of the recently granted civic Coat of arms of Cranleigh Parish Council.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} any known {{experiment}} to detect motion through the aether led Hendrik Lorentz, starting in 1892, {{to develop a}} theory of electrodynamics based on an immobile luminiferous aether (about whose material constitution Lorentz didn't speculate), physical length contraction, and a [...] "local time" [...] in which Maxwell's equations retain their form in all inertial frames of reference. Working with Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré, having earlier proposed the [...] "relativity principle" [...] as a general law of nature (including electrodynamics and gravitation), used this principle in 1905 to correct Lorentz's preliminary transformation formulas, resulting in an exact set of equations that are now called the Lorentz transformations. A <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the same year Albert Einstein published his original paper on special relativity in which, again based on the relativity principle, he independently derived and radically reinterpreted the Lorentz transformations by changing the fundamental definitions {{of space and time}} intervals, while abandoning the absolute simultaneity of Galilean kinematics, thus avoiding the need for any reference to a luminiferous aether in classical electrodynamics. Subsequent work of Hermann Minkowski, in which he introduced a 4-dimensional geometric [...] "spacetime" [...] model for Einstein's version of special relativity, paved the way for Einstein's later development of his general theory of relativity and laid the foundations of relativistic field theories.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circumstances}} {{of the time and}} the country turned Coehoorn's attention to the art of fortification, and the events of the late war showed him that existing methods could no longer be relied upon. Coehoorn gained most of his knowledge and insights on the building of fortification by having to capture many of them himself. His first published work, Versterchinge de Vijfhoeks met alle syne Buytenwerken (Leeuwarden, 1682), at once aroused attention, and involved the author in a lively controversy with a rival engineer, Louys Paan (Leeuwarden, 1682, 1683; copies are in the library of the Dutch Ministry of Defence). The military authorities were much interested in his work, and entrusted Coehoorn with the reconstruction of several fortresses in the Netherlands. This task he continued throughout his career and his experience made him the worthy rival of his great contemporary Vauban. He formulated his ideas a <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> [...] his chief work, New fortress Construction (Nieuwe Vestingbouw op een natte of lage horisont, Leeuwarden, 1685), in which he laid down three systems, the characteristic feature of which was the multiplicity and great saliency of the works, which were calculated and in principle are still eminently suited for, flat and almost marshy sites such as those in the Low Countries. Essential to his new approach was the ability to fight an active defence on the outer shores of the enveloping ditch, made possible by constructing an extra protective wall around the fortification.|$|E
