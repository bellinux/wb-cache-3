40|$|Learning {{style is}} an individual's way in obtaining {{information}} in learning. A lecturer {{is supposed to}} know some information related to students' learning styles particularly <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students {{so that they are}} able to attend the activities in the class and comprehend the given materials. This study focused on identifying the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students' learning styles in Reading class at UMM, the problems in applying learning styles, and the solutions for solving the problems in applying learning styles. Descriptive qualitative research was employed in this study {{due to the fact that}} this study explored about <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students' learning styles, the problems they faced, and the the solutions for solving the problems. The respondents of this study were students categorized as <b>low</b> <b>achiever.</b> In addition, the criteria of <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students were based on their scores in Reading subject that was 54 and below. Grounded on the results and discussion of the study, it could be concluded that there were three kinds of learning styles applied by <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students in Reading class (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic). Besides, the problems faced by <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students in Reading class comprised: (1) the condition of the class was noisy; (2) the lecturer was too fast in explaining the material; (3) the learners felt bored for the same teaching activity; (4) the presentation activities did not run well.

40|$|This thesis reports students’ reading {{strategies}} and reasons for using those strategies in comprehending reading materials at one Senior High School in Ternate, North Maluku, Indonesia. This {{study was conducted}} to find out the reading strategies most frequently used by high achiever students, middle <b>achiever</b> students and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students. It also investigated the similarities and differences of reading {{strategies and}} the students’ reasons for using those strategies in comprehending English text. According to Oxford (1990), the strategy consists of direct and indirect strategies. A direct strategy includes memory, cognitive, and compensation strategies while an indirect strategy deals with metacognitive, affective and social strategies. This study utilized a qualitative research design to get deep understanding about reading strategies most frequently used by high, middle, and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students, the similarities and differences of reading strategies, and the students’ reasons in using those strategies. The data were taken from two sources namely questionnaire and interview. The data from the questionnaires covered the students’ reading strategies and the similarities and differences of reading strategies while the interview data covered students’ reasons in employing reading strategies. The analysis of the data from questionnaires indicated that high achiever students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by metacognitive, memory, compensation, affective and social reading strategies. The middle achiever students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by metacognitive, affective, social, and memory strategies while the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by social, metacognitive and affective strategies. The result of the study also indicated that there were 11 similarities of reading strategies which were employed by the different level of students (high, middle, and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students) in different context to create/construct a context, social interaction, and as a form of self-improvement. The data from the interview revealed that all the students used reading strategies to understand a text however the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students employed those strategies to do the exercises which were given by their English teacher. Based on the findings, this study recommends that the English teacher should encourage the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students to employ reading strategies most frequently used by high achiever students. For the further study, the researcher should consider on how to apply those reading strategies in improving the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students’ achievement and the relationship between reading strategies and reading comprhension. This study also recommends that the government should conduct teacher training and provide reading materials such as: books, magazine and newspaper in English to motivate the students in doing reading activities and increase their reading skills...|$|R

The subjects of the research are six students, {{three of them are}} high achiever students and the three others are <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students. This {{research is}} done by classifying the data using the learning strategies classification conducted by O’Malley and Chamot. The type of this research is case study. The data are obtained from the interview and document to the subjects. The result of this research shows that the subjects use various learning strategies classified by O’Malley and Chamot in learning materials in English. Those learning strategies used by the subjects are similar and the others are not. Although they use same strategies, some of those strategies are implemented differently. The differences of learning strategy used by the subjects are in metacognitive and cognitive strategies. The learning strategies that are only used by high achiever students are: advance organization (metacognitive strategies), grouping, auditory representation, and transfer (cognitive strategies). The other learning strategies are used by both high <b>achiever</b> and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students, even by one student of each achiever. Beside the differences in learning strategies used by high <b>achiever</b> and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students above, there are some strategies that are implemented differently by those subjects.

50|$|Smaller {{classes are}} widely {{believed}} to benefit all pupils because of individual attention from teachers, and low-attaining pupils are seen to beneﬁt more at the secondary school level, where the content level is more challenging. Pupils in large classes drift off task because of too much instruction from the teacher to the whole class instead of individual attention, and low-attaining students are most affected. Students benefit in later grades from being in small classes during early grades. Longer periods in small classes resulted in more increases in achievement in later grades for all students. In reading and science, <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> benefit more from being in small classes. The benefits of small class sizes reduce the student achievement gap in reading and science in later grades. In contrast, in East Asian countries like Japan, larger class sizes are valued for the opportunities they give children to rub shoulders and socialize in the group, especially at the lower levels, and particularly preschool.|$|E

50|$|According to the BFLPE it {{is better}} for {{academic}} self-concept (ASC) to be a high achiever in a reference group of relative <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> {{than it is to}} be a high achiever in a reference group of high achievers. The BFLPE is thought to be produced by two opposing social comparison effects, assimilation and contrast effects. An assimilation effect is when the individual’s self-concept is pulled toward the comparison target, leading to a positive relationship between self-concept and the comparison group. A contrast effect is when the individual’s self-concept is pushed away from the comparison target, leading to a negative relationship between self-concept and the comparison group. According to Schwarz and Bless’s (1992) inclusion/exclusion model of judgment, assimilation effects occur when the target of comparison is included in the mental representation of the self or viewed as similar to the self. Conversely, contrast effects occur when the target of comparison is excluded from the mental representation of the self or viewed as distinct from the self. Since academic self-concept tends to be negatively related with group achievement, it is assumed that the contrast process is stronger than the assimilation process.|$|E
