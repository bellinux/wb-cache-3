A conventional flow rate of water is reduced at nano-scale through a split device to push the content of the on-line loop into the column. No mixing occurs between solvents inside the loops, due to the low flow rate and the reduced loop diameter. Valve actuation allows the selection of the on-line loop to obtain the solvent gradient. The evaluation of the system performance takes into account gradient accuracy, precision, delay time, shape (linear, convex, or concave), and organic solvent consumption. Results highlight the reliability and the competitiveness of the system, especially in terms of accuracy and precision.

40|$|Observations {{revealed}} that {{various kinds of}} oscillations are excited in solar flare regions. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the flare emissions are commonly observed {{in a wide range}} of wavelengths. Recent observations have found that fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are quasi-periodically emitted from some flaring sites (quasi-periodic propagating fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves; QPFs). Both of QPPs and QPFs imply a cyclic disturbance originating from the flaring sites. However, the physical mechanisms remain puzzling. By performing a set of two-dimensional MHD simulations of a solar flare, we discovered the local oscillation above the <b>loops</b> <b>filled</b> with evaporated plasma (above-the-loop-top region) and the generation of QPFs from such oscillating regions. Unlike all previous models for QPFs, our model includes essential physics for solar flares, such as magnetic reconnection, heat conduction, and chromospheric evaporation. We {{revealed that}} QPFs can be spontaneously excited by the above-the-loop-top oscillation. It was found that this oscillation is controlled by the backflow of the reconnection outflow. The new model revealed that flare loops and the above-the-loop-top region are full of shocks and waves, which is different from the previous expectations based on a standard flare model and previous simulations. In this paper, we will show the QPF generation process based on our new picture of flare loops and will briefly discuss a possible relationship between QPFs and QPPs. Our findings will change the current view of solar flares to a new view in which they are a very dynamic phenomenon with full of shocks and waves. Comment: 30 pages, 9 figures, published in Ap...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{series of}} flares with {{exceptionally}} hard spectral indices {{in the hard}} X-ray band occurred on 3 October 1993. The non-thermal bremsstrahlung spectra may extend to a few keV in these events, {{one of which was}} detectable in the Yohkoh Bragg Crystal Spectrometer at 7 keV {{as well as by the}} hard X-ray instruments at higher energies. We present Yohkoh soft and hard X-ray imaging, spectroscopy and energetics analysis of these events, with the idea that flares with such flat spectra (powerlaw as hard as 1. 98 below 33 keV) might differ appreciably from ordinary flares. The series of events is strongly homologous, with no systematic variations in structure over a period of 3. 5 hours except for jet-like ejecta accompanying Type III/V bursts. Unlike other hard events, these flares are large (footpoint separation about 3 10 4 km) and therefore well resolved by the Yohkoh imaging instruments. The time variations match the Neupert effect. The hard and soft X-ray images also show footpoint brightening and <b>loop</b> <b>filling.</b> The spikes with the flattest spectra have the weakest Neupert-effect signature, but no perceptible time delays between the hard X-ray time profile and the soft X-ray time derivative. These events do not produce superhot emission but are probably microwave-rich. We find no evidence for large-scale magnetic reconnection in the development of these flares. We note two discrepancies between the observations and the existing numerical hydrodynamic models of flare energetics, and suggest that rapid spike events of this type provide good tests of such models.

Usually they have lengths {{of the order of}} the barometric scale height in the corona that is 50 Mm. Previously {{it has been suggested that}} miniature versions of hot loops exist. These would have lengths of only 1 Mm barely protruding from the chromosphere and spanning across just one granule in the photosphere. Such short loops are well established at transition region temperatures (0. 1 MK), and we investigate if such miniature loops also exist at coronal temperatures (> 1 MK). We used extreme UV imaging (EUV) observations from the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0. 3 " to 0. 4 ". Together with EUV imaging and magnetogram data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data from Hinode we investigated the spatial, temporal and thermal evolution of small loop-like structures in the solar corona above a plage region close to an active region and compared this to a moss area within the active region. We find that the size, motion and temporal evolution of the loop-like features are consistent with photospheric motions, suggesting a close connection to the photospheric magnetic field. Aligned magnetograms show that one of their endpoints is rooted at a magnetic concentration. Their thermal structure, as revealed together with the X-ray observations, shows significant differences to moss-like features. Considering different scenarios, these features are most probably miniature versions of hot loops rooted at magnetic concentrations at opposite sides of a granule in small emerging magnetic loops (or flux tubes).

Siphon flows {{that are}} driven by a gas {{pressure}} difference between two photospheric footpoints of different magnetic field strength connected by magnetic field lines are a well-studied phenomenon in theory, but observational evidence is scarce.

Methods. We derived the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of several photospheric spectral lines and two chromospheric spectral lines, Ca ii H 3968. 5 Å and He i 10830 Å, in spectropolarimetric observations of NOAA 10978 done with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP-II) and the POlarimetric LIttrow Spectrograph (POLIS). The structure can be clearly traced in the LOS velocity maps and the absorption depth of He i. The magnetic field configuration in the photosphere is inferred directly from the observed Stokes parameters and from inversions with the HELIX+ code. Data from the full-disk Chromospheric Telescope (ChroTel) in He i in intensity and LOS velocity are used for tracking the temporal evolution of the flow, along with TRACE Fe ix/x 171 Å data for additional information about coronal regions related to the structure under investigation. Results. The inner end of the structure is located in the penumbra of a sunspot. It shows downflows whose strength decreases with decreasing height in the atmosphere.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to study whether the observed EUV emission in individual coronal loops in solar active regions can provide constraints on the volumetric heating function, and to develop a diagnostics for the heating function for a subset of loops that are found close to static thermal equilibrium. We reconstruct the coronal magnetic field from SDO/HMI data using a non-linear force free magnetic field model. We model selected loops using a 1 D stationary model, with a heating rate dependent locally on the magnetic field strength along the loop, and calculate the emission from these loops in various EUV wavelengths for different heating rates. We present a method to measure a power index β defining the dependence of the volumetric heating rate EH on the magnetic field, EH ∝ Bβ, and controlling also the shape of the heating function: concentrated near the loop top, uniform and concentrated near the footpoints. The diagnostics is based on the dependence of the electron density on the index β.
