500|$|When {{she retired}} from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory {{returned}} to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining <b>life</b> <b>tenancy.</b> Her Galway home had long been {{a focal point for}} the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, Seán O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole", [...] "I walked among the seven woods of Coole", [...] "In the Seven Woods", [...] "Coole Park, 1929" [...] and [...] "Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931".|$|E
500|$|Sir John was {{succeeded by}} his estranged son Sir George Dashwood, 5th Baronet. For {{the first time}} since the death of the 2nd Baronet in 1781, West Wycombe became again a favoured residence. However, the estate was heavily in debt and Sir George was forced to sell the unentailed estates, {{including}} Halton, which was sold in 1851 to Lionel de Rothschild for the then huge sum of £54,000 (£ in [...] ). The change in the Dashwoods' fortunes allowed for the refurbishment and restoration of West Wycombe. Sir George died childless in 1862, and left his wife, Elizabeth, a <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> of the house while the title and ownership passed briefly to his brother and then a nephew. Lady Dashwood's continuing occupation of the house prevented the nephew, Sir Edwin Hare Dashwood, 7th Baronet, an alcoholic sheep farmer in the South Island of New Zealand, from living in the mansion until she died in 1889, leaving a neglected and crumbling estate.|$|E

50|$|A further {{limitation}} {{is the rule}} against perpetuities in many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of <b>life</b> <b>tenancies</b> and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests. In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.|$|R
50|$|It {{appears that}} Clinton's land-holding {{must have been}} {{primarily}} <b>life</b> <b>tenancies</b> since his descendants' property was not nearly so great. His son and successor, also named Geoffrey, became engaged in a violent quarrel with the Earl of Warwick early in the reign of King Stephen of England. The Clintons nearly lost everything, {{but in the end}} a settlement was reached (probably in the summer of 1138) by which the younger Geoffrey de Clinton married Warwick's daughter Agnes.|$|R

2500|$|In addition, {{it seems}} {{certain that the}} kings were overthrown in c. 500 BC, {{probably}} {{as a result of}} a much more complex and bloody revolution than the simple drama of the rape of Lucretia related by Livy, and that they were replaced by some form of collegiate rule. It is likely that the revolution that overthrew the Roman monarchy was engineered by the patrician caste and that its aim was not, as rationalised later by ancient authors, the establishment of a democracy, but of a patrician-dominated oligarchy. The proverbial [...] "arrogance" [...] and [...] "tyranny" [...] of the Tarquins, epitomised by the Lucretia incident, is probably a reflection of the patricians' fear of the Tarquins' growing power and their erosion of patrician privilege, most likely by drawing support from the plebeians (commoners). To ensure patrician supremacy, the autocratic power of the kings had to be fragmented and permanently curtailed. Thus, the replacement of a single ruler by a collegiate administration, which soon evolved into two Praetors, later called Consuls, with equal powers and limited terms of office (one year, instead of the <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> of the kings). In addition, power was further fragmented by the establishment of further collegiate offices, known to history as Roman magistrates: (three Aediles and four Quaestors). Patrician supremacy was assured by limiting eligibility to hold the republican offices to patricians only.|$|E

5000|$|In the Republic of Ireland ground rents {{have been}} a feature of urban <b>life.</b> While most <b>tenancy</b> reform {{legislation}} has been enacted for agricultural land (see Irish Land Acts), urban occupiers / tenants {{have been a}}llowed to [...] "buy out" [...] their ground rents from landlords, and so effectively change a long lease into a freehold interest, most recently under Acts of 1978 and 2005. Notably, ground rents in Castlebar, County Mayo have been withheld following the controversial disappearance of Lord Lucan in 1974.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} part of this century, there have been extensivefforts by business, government, and the media to promote urban and {{suburban}} home ownership as a superior way of <b>life</b> to <b>tenancy.</b> President Hoover captured this attitude in an important national speech in 1931 : "they never sing songs about a pile of rent receipts " [15, p. 2]. Ironically, one of the main goals of this broad coalition was to make owning more like renting in one crucial respect: the flow of cash expenditures. If people could purchase a house with a small initial outlay and modest monthly payments, then the economic barriers to home ownership would disappear for the majority of moderate income families. Installment selling was the key to success and the essential instrument was the long-term, high-leverage, amortized first mortgage loan. Dramatic institutional changes in mortgage lending, public policy, and the real estate industry brought about an increase in the percentage of non-farm owner occupied housing in America from 37 % in 1900 to 64 % today. A nationwide "Own Your Own Home " campaign was launched in 191...|$|R

50|$|In 1370 Eric III succeeded Albert V as Duke of Saxe-Bergedorf-Mölln, {{a highly}} indebted branch duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg.

50|$|Brigham Young {{never lived}} to see the {{completed}} mansion; he died on August 29, 1877. The settlement of Young's estate was divided into three parts: church properties in Young's name, properties belonging to his private estate, and properties where legal ownership was unknown. In his will, Young had provided both Mary Ann Angell Young and Harriet Amelia Folsom Young a <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> in the Gardo House, {{and in order to}} secure their claims, the two women occupied the mansion briefly while it was still under construction. Although the legal ownership of the mansion was in question, the settlement credited it to Young's heirs instead of to the church, at the highly inflated figure of $120,000. Of this sum, approximately $20,000 was paid to Mary Ann Angell Young and Harriet Amelia Folsom Young.|$|E
