5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area <b>like</b> <b>Chicago.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands <b>like</b> <b>Chicago</b> and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Lincolnshire is {{a suburb of}} the city of Chicago in the {{southern}} reaches of Lake County; <b>like</b> <b>Chicago,</b> Lincolnshire is located in the extreme northeastern region of the state of Illinois.

25|$|Still, the NYSE was {{determined}} to re-open on September 17, almost {{a week after the}} attack. During this time Rockefeller Group Business Center opened additional offices at 48 Wall Street.

25|$|Folk music, {{which often}} carried {{the stigma of}} left-wing {{associations}} during the 1950s Red Scare, was driven underground and carried along {{by a handful of}} artists releasing records. Barred from mainstream outlets, artists like Seeger were restricted to performing in schools and summer camps, and the folk-music scene became a phenomenon associated with vaguely rebellious bohemianism in places like New York City (especially Greenwich Village), North Beach, and in the college and university districts of cities <b>like</b> <b>Chicago,</b> Boston, Denver, and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|By July 1934, Dillinger {{had dropped}} {{completely}} out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis <b>like</b> <b>Chicago,</b> {{he was able to}} lead an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the center of the federal agents' dragnet happened to be Chicago.

25|$|Realizing {{that the}} New York Central now {{depended}} heavily on connecting lines to reach Midwestern cities <b>like</b> <b>Chicago,</b> Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis, Vanderbilt decided to add Amasa Stone to the Central's board of directors. Stone was first {{appointed to the}} board in 1867, and probably served until December 1868. In April 1868, Stone {{played a major role}} in bringing together Cornelius Vanderbilt and the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Vanderbilt very much wanted the New York Central to carry both raw and refined oil being shipped by Rockefeller. On April 18, 1868, Vanderbilt asked Rockefeller (then visiting New York City) to meet with him. Rockefeller refused, sending only his business card. He believed Vanderbilt would try to charge him high freightage rates, and Rockefeller knew he could get his oil to refineries and consumers without Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt persisted, however, and later that afternoon sent Amasa Stone to visit Rockefeller at Rockefeller's hotel. The two Clevelanders spoke for several hours, and Stone convinced Rockefeller to see Vanderbilt. The two men met that evening, and began a long and fruitful business relationship.|$|E

Thus extreme heat waves are {{rare in the}} Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about [...] ). The Seattle area is the most cloudy region of the United States, {{due in part to}} frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Despite having a reputation for frequent rain, Seattle receives less precipitation than many other U.S. cities <b>like</b> <b>Chicago</b> or New York City.

500|$|Self-syndicated {{newspaper}} columnist Michael McManus {{once said that}} his goal in writing his weekly column was [...] "to suggest answers to problems of the old industrial states." [...] In March 1982 a substantial article by McManus appeared in the Bangor Daily News. [...] In the article, McManus proposed several reasons why a city, <b>like</b> <b>Chicago,</b> Pittsburgh, or Scranton might find {{the addition of a}} tourist attraction like Steamtown beneficial. [...] McManus went on to explain why the business was failing in Vermont. [...] Among the reasons the article gave for poor attendance at the Vermont site were: past failed management, an isolated location and the lack of signs on Interstate 91, which the state opposed. In addition to these problems, the roof of the largest storage shed on the site collapsed under heavy snow the previous winter, damaging several pieces of equipment. Among the injured were the Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1293 and the Meadow River Lumber Company No. 1 Shay (shown in the infobox).|$|E

500|$|With {{their love}} of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to {{what became known as}} pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones {{combined}} pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion [...] "layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies"; Descendents [...] "wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys–inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places <b>like</b> <b>Chicago</b> and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, [...] "It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the early-to-mid-1960s, slot {{car racing}} became a fad, {{and like many}} other companies, Revell {{attempted}} to enter the fray by using its plastic model car bodies with mechanicals underneath—fit for the track. In 1965 Revell acquired International Raceways, planning high grade race tracks that could fill whole rooms. [...] It {{may have been too}} much too late: The competition was too keen and the slot car hobby was already starting to wane in influence. [...] Slot car kings <b>like</b> <b>Chicago's</b> Strombecker would eventually be purchased by Tootsietoy and end up making simple plastic cars and other toys. By 1967, Revell's experiment in the hobby had racked up a nearly half-million dollar loss.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} the most architecturally {{significant}} churches of the Archdiocese of Chicago were built as national parishes by Lithuanian immigrants such as Holy Cross, Providence of God, Nativity BVM which is dedicated to Our Lady of Šiluva, and the now demolished St. George's in Bridgeport. Opulently decorated with a proclivity towards Renaissance and Baroque ornamentation, Lithuanian churches were designed {{in the spirit of}} the architecture of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's heyday. <b>Like</b> <b>Chicago's</b> Polish Cathedral's, these churches were statements meant to recall an era when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania spanned from the Baltic to the Black Sea, having been built at a time when Lithuania was under Russian occupation and incorporating Lithuanian imagery in its decor such as the Vytis to invoke pride in Lithuanian culture.|$|R
2500|$|One {{interpretation}} is that Johnson intended the song to be a metaphorical description of an imagined paradise combining {{elements of the}} American north and west, far from the racism and poverty inherent to the Mississippi Delta of 1936. [...] <b>Like</b> <b>Chicago,</b> California was a common such destination in many Great Depression-era songs, books, and movies. [...] Music writer Max Haymes argues that Johnson's intention was [...] "the land of California or that sweet home Chicago". Another suggests it is a reference to Chicago's California Avenue. It is a thoroughfare which runs from the far south to the far north side of Chicago and predates Johnson's recording.|$|E

[...] He was a practicing realist during the Age of (William Dean) Howells and a local colorist of Chicago and the Midwest. [...] His work constitutes a vast comedy of Midwestern manners and, indeed, a comedy of late 19th-century American manners.

2500|$|The term dixieland {{was first}} coined by Dan Emmett in his song [...] "Dixie's Land" [...] in 1859.

Dixieland music can be defined {{in a number of}} ways, though its origin {{is to be found in}} New Orleans, present first in the music of King Oliver. It quickly spread north and became popularized along with the migration of southern blacks to areas <b>like</b> <b>Chicago.</b> Today the term is used in reference to the music, which provides a general description of any form of jazz that is derived from early New Orleans jazz.|$|E
