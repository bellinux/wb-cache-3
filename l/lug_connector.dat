50|$|The AlumiConn {{miniature}} <b>lug</b> <b>connector</b> {{can also}} be used for a permanent repair. The only special tool required for an electrician installing them is a special torque screwdriver that should be readily available to qualified electrical contractors. Proper torque on the connectors set screws is critical to having an acceptable repair. However, use of the Alumiconn connectors is a relatively newer repair option for older aluminum wiring compared to other methods, and use of these connectors can have some of the same or similar problems with limited enclosure space as the COPALUM connectors.|$|E
50|$|The pin's {{diameter}} is nominally 4 mm. The pin has {{one or more}} lengthwise springs that bulge outwards slightly, {{giving the}} appearance of a banana. Taking the springs into account, the actual diameter of a banana plug is typically a bit larger than 4 mm when not plugged in. When inserted into a matching 4 mm socket the springs press against the sides of the socket, improving the electrical contact and preventing the pin from falling out. The other end of the plug has a <b>lug</b> <b>connector</b> to which a length of flexible insulated equipment wire can be attached, which is either screwed, soldered, or crimped into place. An insulating plastic cover is usually fitted over this rear end of the connector.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new current and voltage transducer for MV networks which {{will provide a}} higher visibility of the operating status of the circuits {{to which they are}} connected. The immediate attraction of the system is the ease with which it can be installed both in new builds or retrofitted to existing systems. The unit takes advantage of well-established cable termination technology. It has a voltage connection to the MV circuit at the termination's <b>lug</b> <b>connector</b> and a current transducer mounted around the primary conductor. The paper introduces the basis of the design and details of the interface scheme. It also discusses areas where this unit can provide the foundation for smart distribution networks...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the gender}} of tubing and {{plumbing}} fittings is usually obvious, {{this may not be}} true of electrical connectors because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female D-subminiature connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the [...] "maleness" [...] of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of male pins, rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like XLR. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp <b>lug</b> <b>connectors</b> which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp <b>lug</b> <b>connectors</b> the end alone is not obviously female.|$|R
50|$|Corrosion of the {{external}} metal parts of the lead-acid battery results from a chemical reaction of the battery terminals, <b>lugs</b> and <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
