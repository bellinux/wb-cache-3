5|$|During the 18th century Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Thomas Lawrence <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Bath. John Maggs, {{a painter}} {{best known for}} {{coaching}} scenes, was born and lived in Bath with his artistic family.|$|E
5|$|George Pickingill (c. 1816 – 10 April 1909) was an English farm {{labourer}} who <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> {{the village of}} Canewdon in the eastern English county of Essex. Widely {{considered to be a}} cunning man, or vocational folk magician, he reportedly employed magical means to offer cures for ailments and to locate lost property, although was also alleged to have threatened to place curses on people.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{countries}} have made treaties regulating travel {{and access to}} the job markets (non-government/non-military-related work): A citizen of an EU country can <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> indefinitely <b>in</b> other EU countries and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland (and citizens of these countries can <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> EU countries). The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand allows citizens of the two countries to <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the other country. A citizen of a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) can <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> other member states.|$|R

5|$|Many {{famous people}} <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Birbhum, {{specially}} at Santiniketan. Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen {{is one of}} them. Rabindranath Tagore made this district his home and established his great centre of learning, Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan. Jaydev Kenduli, which until recently {{was believed to be}} the birthplace of the 12th century Sanskrit poet Jayadeva, is {{on the bank of the}} river Ajay.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, most Norwegians <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> {{buildings}} {{that were designed}} and built according to vernacular building traditions, what in Norwegian is known as byggeskikk. These practices varied somewhat by region and climatic conditions and evolved over time, but were largely based on use of wood and other locally available resources.|$|E
5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Amsterdam {{for the rest of}} his life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E

5|$|Later {{residents}} of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet {{and founder of the}} Society for Psychical Research, Frederic Myers, who was born in Keswick, and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching. The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Keswick. Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including photographs, from the Abrahams' era.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{was born}} in Italy and was ennobled by the Kingdom of Sardinia but <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> France, {{creating}} a number of prestigious works for the royalist French government in the 1830s. He made his name by creating equestrian statues; one, of the Duke of Wellington, was erected in Glasgow in 1840. By the 1840s, however, his popularity in continental Europe was in decline. The French Revolution of 1848, which saw the final overthrow of the French monarchy, prompted him to resettle in London and seek new patrons among the British elite.|$|E
5|$|Other museums include: the Thorvaldsens Museum, {{dedicated}} to the oeuvre of romantic Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen who <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Rome; the Cisternerne museum {{dedicated to}} modern glass art, located in former cisterns that come complete with stalactites formed by the changing water levels; and the Ordrupgaard Museum, located just north of Copenhagen, which features 19th-century French and Danish art and is noted for its works by Paul Gauguin.|$|E

5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E
5|$|While {{visiting the}} White House in 1971 during his father's service as Special Assistant to the President, Henry Kissinger confided in the 11 years-old Huntsman {{that he was}} {{secretly}} traveling to China. He worked as a White House staff assistant in President Ronald Reagan's administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Taipei, Taiwan. In the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was born}} and raised in Kent, Connecticut. His parents, Ronald Milton MacFarlane (born 1946) and Ann Perry (née Sager; 1947–2010), were born in Newburyport, Massachusetts. His sister is voice actress Rachael Ann MacFarlane (born 1976). He has roots in New England going back to the 1600s, and is a {{descendant}} of Mayflower passenger William Brewster. MacFarlane's parents met in 1970, when they both <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Boston, Massachusetts, and married later that year. The couple moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann began working in the Admissions Office at South Kent School. She later worked in the College Guidance and Admissions Offices at the Kent School, a selective college preparatory school, where Ronald was a teacher.|$|E

5|$|Norse sagas telling {{parts of}} the story of Augvald include the Saga of Olaf Tryggvason (both by Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla and by Oddr Snorrason), the Saga of Half & His Heroes and the Flateyjarbok. He also appears in the later Historia rerum Norvegicarum and other works of the Icelandic {{historian}} Thormodus Torfæus, who <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Kopervik, Karmøy. In addition, Augvald is mentioned in the Avaldsnes parish register, and in local Karmøy legends. Scholars have been very sceptical about the reliability of the legendary sagas, which were dismissed as being of little value even in the early 20th century, before the establishment of general source criticism. The legendary sagas' value as sources has not been re-evaluated in recent times.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie {{family of}} bell founders and clockmakers <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Chew Stoke {{for more than}} 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They {{produced}} more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E
5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E

5|$|The garrisons of the Device Forts {{comprised}} {{relatively small}} teams {{of men who}} typically <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> the fortifications. The garrisons would maintain {{and care for the}} buildings and their artillery during the long periods of peacetime and, in a crisis, would be supplemented by additional soldiers and the local militia. The size of the garrisons varied according to the fortification; Camber Castle had a garrison of 29, Walmer Castle 18, while the West Tilbury Blockhouse only held 9 men. The ordinary soldiers would have lived in relatively basic conditions, typically on the ground floor, with the captains of the fortifications occupying more elaborate quarters, often in the upper levels of the keeps. The soldiers ate meat and fish, some of which might have been hunted or caught by the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{then made}} him the press secretary for former Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes. From his appointment onwards, he <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Canberra. Hughes had changed political parties several times and was infamous for his erratic style and the government wanted Fingleton to moderate him. The leader of the United Australia Party, Hughes had particularly worried Prime Minister John Curtin by frequently and publicly excoriating US General Douglas Macarthur, who was commanding the Allied forces in the Pacific. Curtin needed someone to quieten Hughes, as Macarthur had threatened to leave if the denouncements continued. Fingleton spent three months working for the temperamental Hughes and was not successful in curbing his aggressive oratory. He then worked in censorship, deciding which portions of Curtin's press briefings were reportable; Fingleton tried to take a liberal line on press freedom. Fingleton also worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio Australia while serving in the censorship department.|$|E
