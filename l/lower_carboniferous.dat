The valves are termed brachial and pedicle. The brachial valve bears on its inner surface the brachia ("arms") from which the phylum gets its name, and which support the lophophore, used for feeding and respiration. The pedicle valve has on its inner surface the attachment to the stalk-like pedicle by which most brachiopods attach themselves to the substrate. (R.C.Moore, 1952) The brachial and pedicle valves are often called the dorsal ("upper" [...] / pedical) and ventral ("lower" [...] / brachial), but some paleontologists regard the terms [...] "dorsal" [...] and [...] "ventral" [...] as irrelevant since they believe that the [...] "ventral" [...] valve was formed by a folding of the upper surface under the body. The pedicle valve is typically larger than the brachial. In most articulate brachiopod species, both valves are convex, the surfaces often bearing growth lines and/or other ornamentation.

500|$|The River Irwell {{catchment}} area {{extends from the}} moors above Bacup to the Manchester Ship Canal. The climate of the {{catchment area}} is wetter than the UK average, with rainfall of [...] per annum compared to [...] per annum, and the rivers quickly respond to rainfall. The topography varies considerably, with the upper reaches dominated by the Pennine moors {{at an altitude of}} between [...] and [...] AOD and the bottom of the catchment consisting of relatively flat land, which lies between [...] and [...] AOD. The watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys, which contributes to high rates of run-off, as does the underlying solid geology. This comprises Lower Coal Measures overlying Millstone Grit, both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water. The Millstone Grit is, in turn, underlain by limestone rocks from the <b>lower</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> period.

Whereas all sites are characterized by hematite as the main magnetic carrier and a reversed-polarity magnetic remanence, we found a pattern of variation in {{magnetic properties}} along the integrated column for Patquía For-mation. The <b>Lower</b> Member (Late <b>Carboniferous)</b> showed higher intensity of natural and saturation isothermal remanent magnetisation (NRM and SIRM, respectively) than the Permian Upper Member. The fall in NRM in-tensity from the Lower to Upper Member of the Patquía Formation {{may be related to}} a change in quantity and/ or grain-size of the hematite pigment, which may reflect the change in environmental and/or depositional setting. As for directional values of NRM, paleomagnetic poles reported for both sections are clearly different. The lower section provided a pole position coincident with Late Carboniferous poles for Gondwana, while the upper section poles are departed from the Early Permian position. We cannot decide whether the Upper Member pole is due to a primary magnetisation at 290 Ma or to a remagnetisation at ~ 260 - 270 Ma; even so, the obtained paleomagnetic pole is robust and indicates a rapid apparent polar wander in a ~ 30 o counter clockwise rotation of the region, after deposition of the Late <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>lower</b> section, and in coincidence with the San Rafael Orogenic Phase. ...|$|R

40|$|Carboniferous rocks had a {{great impact}} on the {{landscape}} and industrialisation of western Europe, hence a distinction between ‘Carboniferous limestone’ and ‘Coal Measures’ since the dawn of geological science. André Dumont (1852) and Omalius d’Halloy (1853) already distinguished a ‘Houiller sans houille’ (Coal Measures without coal), subsequently named ‘Namurian’ by Purves in 1883. Whereas the lower boundary was quite clear – the quick transition from carbonates to siliciclastics – the boundary of the Namurian with the overlying coal-rich Coal Measures was subject to different interpretations and miscorrelations. International status of the Namurian as a chronostratigraphical stage was acquired in 1927 at the first International Carboniferous Congress, as part of a general classification scheme for the West European Carboniferous. Boundaries were based on ammonoid biozonation, selected to coincide with major events affecting the regional lithological framework. The twofold subdivision of the Carboniferous, Dinantian - Silesian or Mississippian – Pennsylvanian Subsystems, has been a matter of debate since the second Carboniferous Congress in 1935. Dinantian and Silesian were ratified for the <b>Lower</b> and Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> in 1971 although the western European Upper Carboniferous was not considered very suitable for intercontinental correlation, due to its position in the Variscan closure zone of the Pangaea supercontinent. The definition in 1985 of a Mid-Carboniferous Boundary and GSSP at Arrow Canyon, Nevada paved the way to adoption of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Subsystems for the <b>Lower</b> and Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> in 1999. As a consequence, the status of the Namurian stage has been reduced to a regional European Stage. This decision has also practical consequences as the Namurian straddles this Mid-Carboniferous Boundary. Actually, the time span for the Namurian is 326. 4 – 315 Ma and the accepted GTS age for the Mid-Carboniferous boundary is 318. 1 Ma. The lower part of the Namurian is equivalent to the Mississippian Serpukhovian stage, {{the upper part of the}} Namurian is equivalent to part of the Pennsylvanian Bashkirian stage. Application of the global time scale in western Europe is hindered, however, by poor correlation potential of the fossil record and by insufficient radiometric dating. Continued use of the Namurian stage is allowed, on condition that global equivalents are indicated, and that ambiguous terms such as <b>Lower</b> and Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> are avoided, except when related to historic concepts...|$|R

40|$|Fining-upwards cyclothems {{found in}} five {{boreholes}} in the <b>Carboniferous</b> (<b>Lower</b> Bashkirian) of the Lublin Basin were analysed sedimentologically. It was {{established that the}} cyclothems represent fluvial deposits, and the lithofacies were grouped into lithofacies associations. Most lithofacies associations represent three types of sand-bed braided rivers: (1) high-energy, (2) deep and (3) distal sheetflood-affected. Other associations represent hyperconcentrated flows. Both coarse-grained (type I) and fine-grained (types IIa and IIb) occur among the fining-upward cyclothems. The formation of most thick cyclothems was related mainly to allocyclic factors, i. e. {{a decrease in the}} river’s gradient. The thickest fining-upward cyclothems are characteristic of hyperconcentrated flows and braided-river channels. The aggradation ratios were commonly high. During the early Namurian C and early Westphalian A (Early Bashkirian), {{the eastern part of the}} Lublin Basin was located close to the source area. The sedimentary succession developed due to a transition from high-energy braided-rivers and hyperconcentrated flows to lower-energy braided rivers, controlled by a rise of the regional base level...|$|R

The Zumpango Unit is dominated by phyllite and quartzites, but the Progreso Unit is more highly deformed and is dominated by quartzite that is locally interbedded with pillow basalt, and intruded by a suite of mafic dikes. Geochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic data indicate that the basalts and the mafic dikes are tholeiitic, have N-MORB affinities and are moderately fractionated. Deposition of the Progreso Unit was coeval with Carboniferous extrusion of high metamorphic grade rocks of the Acatlán complex above of an active subduction zone, and deposition of Mississippian {{rocks in the}} adjacent Oaxaquia terrane.

Host reactions in the periderm cells are rare, {{with the exception of}} small callosities. Although {{it is not possible to}} conclusively identify the (precise) systematic affinities of the fungi, this discovery is significant because it demonstrates that one of the most common plant tissues in the Carboniferous (i. e. lycophyte periderm) provided a suitable habitat for several endophytic organisms at the same time.
