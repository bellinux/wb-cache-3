50|$|A {{slurry pump}} {{is a type}} of {{centrifugal}} pump, <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> or peristaltic hose pump in physics principle that increases the pressure of liquid and solid particle mixture (aka slurry), through centrifugal force (a rotating impeller) and converts electrical energy into slurry potential and kinetic energy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{frequently}} used in food applications because they handle solids without damaging the product. Particle size pumped {{can be much}} larger in <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> than in other positive displacement types. Since the lobes do not make contact, and clearances are not as close as in other Positive displacement pumps, this design handles low viscosity liquids with diminished performance. Loading characteristics are {{not as good as}} other designs, and suction ability is low. High-viscosity liquids require reduced speeds to achieve satisfactory performance. Reductions of 25% of rated speed and lower are common with high-viscosity liquids.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{industries}} including pulp and paper, chemical, food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology. They are popular in these diverse industries because they offer superb sanitary qualities, high efficiency, reliability, corrosion resistance and good clean-in-place and steam-in-place (CIP/SIP) characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Because rotary <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> need to {{maintain}} a clearance between the lobes, a single stage Roots blower can pump gas across only a limited pressure differential. If the pump is used outside its specification, the compression of the gas generates so much heat that the lobes expand {{to the point that}} they jam, damaging the pump.|$|R
50|$|Named {{after the}} Roots {{brothers}} who invented it, this <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> displaces the liquid trapped between two long helical rotors, each fitted {{into the other}} when perpendicular at 90°, rotating inside a triangular shaped sealing line configuration, both {{at the point of}} suction and at the point of discharge. This design produces a continuous flow with equal volume and no vortex. It can work at low pulsation rates, and offers gentle performance that some applications require.|$|E
50|$|The Roots type blower is a {{positive}} displacement <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> which operates by pumping a fluid {{with a pair of}} meshing lobes not unlike a set of stretched gears. Fluid is trapped in pockets surrounding the lobes and carried from the intake side to the exhaust. The most common application of the Roots type blower has been as the induction device on two-stroke Diesel engines, such as those produced by Detroit Diesel and Electro-Motive Diesel. Roots type blowers are also used to supercharge Otto cycle engines, with the blower being driven from the engine's crankshaft via a toothed or V-belt, a roller chain or a gear train.|$|E
50|$|Stothert & Pitt {{commenced}} rotary <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> manufacture with a licence in 1919. Molasses {{and other}} viscous liquids were handled in heated pumps. Up until 1937, installed lobe pumps {{were still in}} use unloading molasses tank ships.A further licence to make twin screw pumps was acquired from Houttuin pumps of Utrecht, the Netherlands in 1935, with manufacturing starting in 1936. Just {{a few years later}} about 1100 twin screw pumps were supplied to the RAF for use in RAF stations all over the world during World War II.Stotherts were the leading in multiphase pump technology in the 1980s but the R&D expenditure did not lead to many pump sales and Stothert & Pitt, a company quoted on the London Stock Exchange, lost its independence and shut in 1989.In 1999 Albany took over the manufacture of Stothert & Pitt Twin Screw, Centrifugal and Lobe pumps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are similar}} to {{external}} gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} casing. Unlike external gear <b>pumps,</b> however, the <b>lobes</b> do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external timing gears located in the gearbox. Pump shaft support bearings are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the pumped liquid, pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|R
25|$|The exact {{amount of}} water needed for the dough depends on the final shape of the pasta. Long pastas should have less {{moisture}} content (and therefore less water) so {{they will be able}} to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are piston pumps in which the water flow rate is controlled by adjusting the piston stroke, screw feeder, and gear and <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> where the speed of the rotation determines the water flow. In more advanced systems, electronic devices are used to regulate the water flow.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the gear tooth flank in involute segments for the determination of conjugate gear tooth profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the generating rack and the mating wheel, the actual tooth flank is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{time-dependant}} {{calculation of}} flow in a <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> is presented. Calculations are performed using the arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerean (ALE) method. A grid manipulator {{is needed to}} move the nodes between time steps. The used grid manipulator {{is based on the}} pseudo-force idea. This means that each node is fictitiously connected with its 8 neighbours via fictitious springs. The equilibrium of the resulting pseudo spring forces defines the altered position of the nodes. The grid manipulator was coupled with a commercial flow solver and the whole was tested on the flow through a three-lobe <b>lobe</b> <b>pump.</b> Results were obtained for a rotational speed of 460 rpm and incompressible silicon oil as fluid...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe fictitious domain (FD) {{method is}} an {{interesting}} method of flow calculation for domains where mesh generation is not straightforward. This method {{has been reported in}} literature to be able to simulate flow in relatively open domains with incompressible fluids. In this paper a FD technique is tested for flow calculations inside closed geometries and for compressible flow. The computational fluid dynamics code FLUENT, versions 5. 4 and 6. 0, has been extended with user-defined functions and has been used for the analysis of incompressible flow in a <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> and the analysis of compressible flow in a tooth compressor. The results show that the FD method can be made to work for incompressible flow, although further development is necessary for compressible flow...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} a method is {{described}} {{that allows the}} simulation {{of the flow of}} an incompressible fluid through arbitrarily shaped two dimensional domains which move in any prescribed time varying fashion. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in their Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation are discretized on a triangular grid using a finite volume method. Fully implicit time integration makes the method stable for any time step. Central differencing is used for the diffusive fluxes while upwind differencing based on flux-difference splitting for incompressible fluids is used for the convective fluxes. A detailed description is provided for the discretization in two dimensions, with a collocated arrangement of pressure and Cartesian velocity components as dependent variables. A description of the grid generation process is given. Results are shown for the flow in a rotating <b>lobe</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E

40|$|The National Advanced Biofuels Consortium {{is working}} to develop {{improved}} methods for producing high-value hydrocarbon fuels. The development of one such method, the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process, is being led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The HTL process uses a wet biomass slurry at elevated temperatures (i. e., 300 to 360 °C [570 to 680 °F]) and pressures above the vapor pressure of water (i. e., 15 to 20 MPa [2200 to 3000 psi] at these temperatures) to facilitate a condensed-phase reaction medium. The process has been successfully tested at bench-scale and development and testing at a larger scale is required to prove {{the viability of the}} process at production levels. Near-term development plans include a pilot-scale system on the order of 0. 5 to 40 gpm, followed by a larger production-scale system on the order of 2000 dry metric tons per day (DMTPD). A significant challenge to the scale-up of the HTL process is feeding a highly viscous fibrous biomass wood/corn stover feedstock into a pump system that provides the required 3000 psi of pressure for downstream processing. In October 2011, PNNL began investigating commercial feed and pumping options that would meet these HTL process requirements. Initial efforts focused on generating a HTL feed and pump specification and then providing the specification to prospective vendors to determine the suitability of their pumps for the pilot-scale and production-scale plants. Six vendors were identified that could provide viable equipment to meet HTL feed and/or pump needs. Those six vendors provided options consisting three types of positive displacement pumps (i. e., diaphragm, piston, and <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps).</b> Vendors provided capabilities and equipment related to HTL application. This information was collected, assessed, and summarized and is provided as appendices to this report...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Despite the {{tremendous}} development in CNC programming facilities, linear and circular cuts {{parallel to the}} coordinate planes {{continue to be the}} standard motions of modern CNC machines. However, the increasing industrial demand for parts with intricate shapes cannot be satisfied with only these standard motions. The proportion of parts which are not covered by the standard CNC motions is certainly growing, due to the increasing industrial demand for intricate shapes. So for that we have decided to develop a new CANNED cycle with the help of MACRO (parametric) programming on Hypo cycloid, combined EP-hypo cycloid curve and last for Bezier surface also. we found that this canned cycle would be useful for different application such as cycloidal speed reducer, <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> rotor and surface milling without requiring external arrangement like CAD modeling, CNC interpolator etc...|$|E
40|$|An {{internal}} <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> (ILP) {{is suitable}} for machine tool oil hydraulics, automotive engines, compressors, and vari-ous other devices. In particular, the ILP is {{an essential component of}} an automotive engine, used to feed lubricant oil through the system. The main components of an ILP are its rotors. The outer rotor is typically characterized by lobes with an elliptical shape, and the inner rotor profile is a conjugate to the outer profile. This paper describes a theoretical analysis of an ILP and the development of an integrated automated system for rotor design. This system is composed of three main modules and has been developed using AutoLISP for the AutoCAD program. The system generates a new lobe profile and automatically calculates flow rate and flow rate irregularity according to the lobe profile generated. Results obtained from the analysis can enable oil pump designers and manufacturers to become more efficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{theoretical}} analysis of the internal <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> which is a particular type of positive displacement rotary pump. The main components of the pump are the rotors: usually the outer one is characterised by lobes with circular shape, while the inner rotor profile is determined as conjugate to the other. For this reason the first topic presented here is the definition of the geometry of the rotors starting from the design parameters. The choice of these parameters is subject to some limitations in order to avoid inner rotor undercutting and to limit the pressure angle between the rotors. Now we will consider the design optimisation. The first step is the determination of the instantaneous flow rate in function of the design parameters. This allows us to calculate two performance indexes commonly used for the study of positive displacement pumps: the flow rate irregularity and the specific flow rate. These indexes are used to optimise the design of the pump and to obtain the sets of optimum design parameters. Finally further considerations are presented regarding the calculation and the use of other performance indexes, the specific slipping and the rotor curvature, which are particularly suitable for giving more elements for the analysis of this case...|$|E
5000|$|The systems use an {{individual}} injection pump {{mounted on the}} engine block for each cylinder so it is primarily designed for OHV or [...] "cam in the block" [...] engines. The fuel pumps are driven by an extra camshaft <b>lobe</b> where each <b>pump</b> unit {{is connected to the}} injector via a short precise length high-pressure fuel line as opposed to Unit Injector systems which combines both a pump and an injector element in a compact unit.|$|R

The name of this pump is "Mj" and it {{is a product of the}} Motorpal, a. s. company. This thesis also contains an analysis of the contact pressures between the cam <b>lobe</b> and the <b>pumping</b> element's roller tappet. This includes comparing three different shapes of the roller and their influence on the magnitude of contact pressures. Calculations of the plunger helix and of the fuel delivery's impact on the relative position of plunger are also present...|$|R
40|$|The {{pulmonary}} vasopressor {{response to}} acidemia was studied in intact dogs in a hemodynamically separated <b>lobe</b> which was <b>pump</b> perfused with systemic arterial or venous blood {{at a fixed}} rate. The magnitudes of the lobar vasopressor responses to perfusion with blood rendered acidic by infusions of hydrochloric lactic, and acetic acids, and by hypercapnia (membrane oxygenator) were significantly different. Although the PH of the perfusing blood in each group fell to similar extents (pH 7. 1 - 7. 0), the lobar pressor response was greatest with hydrochloric acid (HCl), smaller with lactic and acetic acids, and absent with hypercapnia. A lobar vasopressor response also occurred during lobar perfusion with blood which had been extracorporeally acidified with HCl or acetic acid, but then returned to control pH by infusions of sodium bicarbonate and Tris before reaching the lung. A lobar vasopressor response also resulted from pump perfusion of the lobar artery with femoral venous blood during perfusion of the isolated ipsilateral femoral artery with similarly treated aortic blood. However, no lobar vasopressor response resulted from pump perfusion of the lobar artery with blood removed transseptally from a right pulmonary vein during acidification (HCl) of the right pulmonary artery (to pH 7. 0) ...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{technology}} to deliver foreign gene(s) to a specific organ/tissue {{is one of the}} major challenges in gene therapy. Here, we show liver- and lobe-specific gene transfer following the continuous microinstillation of plasmid DNA (pDNA) onto the liver surface in mice. Naked pDNA was continuously instilled onto the right medial liver <b>lobe</b> using syringe <b>pump</b> in male ddY mice. Our previous studies showed liver- and lobe-selective gene expression after instillation of 30 m l of pDNA solution onto the liver surface, but gene expression was also found in the other liver lobe, kidney and spleen. To improve target site selectivity of gene expression, the instillation volume was decreased; however, non-specific gene expression in the other liver lobe and diaphragm was still detected. To prevent immediate diffusion of the pDNA solution, we performed continuous microinstillation of pDNA using a syringe pump; as a result, target site selectivity was greatly improved. As for instillation speed, 5 min infusion was enough to prevent diffusion of pDNA solution. Furthermore, transfection efficiency in the target site was maintained when instillation speed was slowed. Wiping off residual pDNA solution from the applied liver lobe resulted in a further improvement in selectivity, suggesting not only immediate diffusion, but also gradual diffusion, are important factors for successful target site-specific gene transfer. Information in this study will be useful for further development of an effective gene delivery system targeted to a specific organ/tissue by use of other non-viral or viral vectors...|$|R
