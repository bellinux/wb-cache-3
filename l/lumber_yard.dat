Realizing {{the severity of the}} situation, the firefighters concentrated their efforts on trying to save the surrounding structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, another lumber merchant, William Hoge, {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} the mansion. Under similar circumstances to those of nearby Abingdon, properties surrounding Colross underwent industrialization {{with the construction of}} a warehouse complex and ancillary industrial buildings associated with Alexandria Hay & Grain. The mansion at Colross became a storage facility within a <b>lumber</b> <b>yard</b> operated by another planing mill owner. In 1927, the mansion and the adjacent warehouses were substantially damaged by a tornado, making the mansion uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineer}} Coleman Sellers {{questioned the}} origin and weight of the board used with the balance spring apparatus. Sellers wrote that a standard mahogany board weighs around thirteen and half pounds but the one used in Crookes' experiment may have been at fault at only six pounds. Crookes responded to Sellers claiming the board weighed six pounds and {{this was not a}} mistake, he also stated he had the board for about sixteen years and it was originally cut in a <b>lumber</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Lackawanna County, PA106 {{continues on}} a southeastern trend, crossing through homes {{before returning to}} the deep forestry in Greenfield Township. The route continues further, passing through a <b>lumber</b> <b>yard,</b> where it turns southward and further southeastward into the community of Finch Hill. In Finch Hill, PA106 passes Our Mother of Sorrows Cemetery and intersects with PA247 (Lakeland Drive) {{in the center of the}} town. After PA247, PA106 passes through a small residential district before reaching the Homestead Golf Course. The route passes along the southern side of the golf course and turns eastward after passing to the north of Merli-Sarnoski Park.|$|E

25|$|After a {{disastrous}} fire leveled {{much of the}} downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings {{in the area to}} be built of 'fireproof' materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose from the ashes sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked more at home in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. Whipped up by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a <b>lumber</b> <b>yard</b> {{on the edge of the}} community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties, however, and for a second time a stately brick downtown core rose from the ashes. Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.|$|E

25|$|Great Falls {{was founded}} in 1883. Businessman Paris Gibson visited the Great Falls of the Missouri River in 1880, and was deeply {{impressed}} by the possibilities for building a major industrial city near the falls with power provided by hydroelectricity. He returned in 1883 with friend Robert Vaughn and some surveyors and platted a permanent settlement {{the south side of}} the river. The city's first citizen, Silas Beachley, arrived later that year. With investments from railroad owner James J. Hill and Helena businessman Charles Arthur Broadwater, houses, a store, and a flour mill were established in 1884. The Great Falls post office was established on July 10, 1884, and Paris Gibson was named the first postmaster. A planing mill, <b>lumber</b> <b>yard,</b> bank, school, and newspaper were established in 1885. By 1887 the town had 1,200 citizens, and in October of that year the Great Northern Railway arrived in the city. Great Falls was incorporated on November 28, 1888.|$|E
25|$|PA669 {{begins at}} the state line as a {{continuation}} of MD 669 {{in the community of}} Elk Lick Township, Pennsylvania. The route progresses northward as Springs Road, passing through the rural regions of southern central Pennsylvania. Around the intersection with Ash Hill Road, the highway passes a light demographic of homes, but as PA669 turns to the northwest at Upper Springs Road, begins to grow. The highway enters the community of Springs, Pennsylvania, a portion of Elk Lick Township. Through Springs, PA669 becomes surrounded by light forestry and residences, turning to the north once again at an intersection with Shoemaker Hill Road. For a short stretch after Shoemaker Hill Road, PA669 becomes a rural highway, crossing through fields. However, this changes as the highway enters the community of Niverton. In Niverton, PA669 passes some residences and a large <b>lumber</b> <b>yard,</b> but after curving eastward at Fisher Road and Savage Road, Springs Road and PA669 return to their rural nature.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, {{the heart}} of Walkerville was Walker’s distilling business, “Hiram Walker and Sons” which was {{established}} in 1858. Walker’s business created {{an expansion of the}} town that included, malt houses, cooperage, copper shop, planning mill, <b>lumber</b> <b>yard,</b> brick yard, and a ferry between Walkerville and Detroit. The trip from his house in Detroit to his businesses in Walkerville took approximately an hour and a half. Due to this, Walker decided to invest in a ferry that would travel between Detroit and Walkerville as to save time and be of assistance to the public. In 1880 he finally decided to rent a ferry that would travel from Detroit and Walkerville. The ferry he would lease was called “The Essex” which was a steam ship built in, 1858 in Walkerville. He installed a dock system on his land in Walkerville that would allow people to board the ferry. in its beginnings the ferry was not very useful for the people of Walkerville as it mainly served as a personal transportation service for Walker himself. It did not follow a set schedule and did not make very many trips on any given day. However, in the following year of 1881, a set schedule was developed and the ferry as a public service began. It was also during this year that another ferry, called “Ariel”, replaced “The Essex” due to the termination of the lease.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{harvesting}} of Midwestern {{white pine}} forests {{played a major}} role in America's westward expansion through the Great Plains. A quarter million white pines were harvested and sent to <b>lumber</b> <b>yards</b> in Chicago in a single year.|$|R
5000|$|Beaver Lumber, once Canada’s leading {{supplier}} of lumber, building materials and related products and services, began in 1883 as the Banbury Bros. Lumber Company in Wolseley, Saskatchewan. Banbury Bros. Lumber Company bought its local rival, Gibson Lumber, in 1904 {{and two years}} later joined with the Regina Lumber and Supply Co., creating a business with twelve <b>lumber</b> <b>yards.</b> A thirst for expansion resulted in the Banbury brothers striking a deal with some Winnipeg <b>lumber</b> <b>yards.</b> A new name was needed that was in some way connected to wood, so when Edwin Banbury suggested [...] "Beaver", the company identity was created in 1906 and would become an institution in parts of Canada for another 90 years.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} years {{following}} the establishment of Zelma, the village had a thriving business community with a general store, <b>lumber</b> <b>yards,</b> a hotel, bakery, flour mill and grain elevators; most of these business had disappeared {{by the end of}} the 1940s.|$|R
500|$|Hamar had {{previously}} been a venue for international speed skating events at Hamar stadion. The town was therefore selected to host the two skating venues. In December 1989, {{it was decided that}} the new venue would be built at Åkervika, a Ramsar site [...] outside downtown Hamar. A compromise was reached whereby the stadium was moved [...] from its original location, two birdwatching towers were built, and a <b>lumber</b> <b>yard</b> was moved. Nature and Youth remained opposed to the plans, stating the location [...] "has destroyed part of one of the world's most important bird reserves".|$|E
500|$|Robert King, {{an early}} proprietor, opened a brick and tile factory at the {{southern}} terminus of Main Street in 1896 with the capacity of carrying out 15,000 bricks every 10 hours. Harrisburg also saw the opening of several saw mills. The Snellbaker and Company Saw Mill and <b>Lumber</b> <b>Yard</b> opened in 1895, as well did J.B Ford Harrisburg Planing Mill the same year. The mill had the capacity of producing [...] of lumber every 10 hours. [...] The Barnes Lumber Company in Harrisburg started as a sawmill operation in 1899. Since 1904 it has retailed a complete line of lumber and building materials and is the oldest, currently active mill in the city.|$|E
500|$|Civilian units, called [...] "villagers", {{are used}} to gather resources; they are either male or female—gender does not affect their abilities. Resources {{can be used to}} train units, {{construct}} buildings, and research technologies, among other things; for example, players can research better armour for infantry units. The game offers four types of resources: food, wood, gold, and stone. Food is obtained by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and shore fishing and fishing from boats. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees. Gold is obtained from either gold mines, trade or collecting relics in a monastery, and stone is collected from stone mines. Villagers require checkpoints, typically depository buildings (town center, mining camp, mill, and <b>lumber</b> <b>yard),</b> where they can store gathered resources.|$|E

500|$|Afterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey {{together}} and forces {{them both to}} accompany him to the apartment of Ben, his suave, effeminate partner in crime who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben lip-syncs a performance of Roy Orbison's [...] "In Dreams," [...] sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a <b>lumber</b> <b>yard</b> and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey stands up to Frank by punching him. Frank's cronies drag Jeffrey {{out of the car}} and Frank kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of [...] "In Dreams." [...] Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is the Yellow Man—an officer named Lieutenant Detective Tom Gordon. Later, at Sandy's home, her father is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance {{together and}} profess their love, only to be confronted by Sandy's boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds Dorothy—naked, battered, and distressed—on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy reveals her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing Sandy to become upset and to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.|$|E
