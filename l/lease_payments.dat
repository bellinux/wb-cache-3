The Caledonian negotiated with the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway and believed it had captured them, but the SCR had other ideas.

They agreed to the terms in December, and the LNWR obtained an Act of Parliament in June 1847 to authorise the arrangement. The Shrewsbury and Stafford Railway was opened on 1 June 1849, and <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> began a month later on 1 July.

In 1880, the NJM was reorganized as the New Jersey Midland Railroad (NJM), and attention was turned to the lucrative coal fields of eastern Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{banning of}} betting in Sweden, {{as well as other}} events such as rainy summers and wet winters, AB Malmö Idrottsplats started to have {{financial}} difficulties and applied to the municipality for help. The annual <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> were cancelled in 1899 and replaced with a subsidy of 1,500 kronor a year, conditional on local schoolchildren receiving free access to the pitch for a few hours each day. Stora Hallen ("The great hall"), an adjoining building that had served first as a tennis arena, then riding stables, was redeveloped in 1910 into a dance hall and restaurant called Boston Palace. This was done in the hope of increasing the ground's profits as it was struggling financially. The redevelopment was criticised by some who contended that dancing was an immoral pastime with nothing to do with sport. The financial difficulties continued into the 1910s and the city was forced to raise the yearly grant for Malmö IP. IFK Malmö and Malmö FF, the city's main association football clubs, by this time regularly played home games at the ground. When Malmö hosted the Baltic Exhibition in 1914, Malmö IP hosted relevant sporting events during June and July. The exhibition forced the municipality to rearrange the area surrounding the sports field and the surrounding road network was redrawn. Malmö IP was given a large compensation for this as the sports field area was affected by the changes.|$|E
