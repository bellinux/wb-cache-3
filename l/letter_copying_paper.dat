50|$|A few {{alternatives}} to hand copying were invented between the mid-17th {{century and the}} late 18th century, but none {{had a significant impact}} in offices. In 1780 James Watt obtained a patent for <b>letter</b> <b>copying</b> presses, which James Watt & Co. produced beginning in that year. <b>Letter</b> <b>copying</b> presses were used by the early 1780s by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.

50|$|Using <b>letter</b> <b>copying</b> presses, copies {{could be}} made up to twenty-four hours after a letter was written, though copies made within a few hours were best. A copying clerk would begin by {{counting}} the number of master letters to be written during the next few hours and by preparing the copying book. Suppose the clerk wanted to <b>copy</b> 20 one-page <b>letters.</b> In that case, he would insert a sheet of oiled <b>paper</b> into the <b>copying</b> book in front of the first tissue on which he wanted to make a <b>copy</b> of a <b>letter.</b> He would then turn 20 sheets of tissue paper and insert a second oiled paper. To dampen the tissue paper, the clerk used a brush or <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> damper. The damper had a reservoir for water that wet a cloth, and the clerk wiped the cloth over the tissues on which copies were to be made. As an alternative method of dampening the tissue paper, in 1860 Cutter, Tower & Co., Boston, advertised Lynch's patent paper moistener.|$|R

The {{study also found that}} there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper.</b> Another study, which was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.|$|R

50|$|Carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> {{was first}} {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the <b>copy.</b> Carbonless <b>paper</b> was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The <b>copies</b> were often <b>paper</b> of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.|$|R

In this study, a novel method for identifying the <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> brand is proposed for forensics application using only a commodity scanner and without modifying the document. The scanned document image margin is cut into image blocks. After the image preprocessing, 114 -D texture features are extracted from these image blocks including Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GCM) features and Fourier spectrum features. The decision for each piece of paper is given by voting the decision results of the image blocks. The experimental results are provided finally to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R
