40|$|Abstract A new AFM (atomic force microscopy) nano-tribology method using a T-shape {{cantilever}} with an off-axis tip (Nat Nanotechnol 2 : 507 – 514, 2007) {{has been}} developed for measuring friction coefficient at nanometer scale. In this method, signals due to both bending and twisting of the T-shape AFM cantilever are detected simultaneously. For a T-shape AFM cantilever, the bending {{is caused by the}} normal load and the twisting is caused by both the normal and the lateral loads. The twisting gener-ated by the normal load is calibrated in advance. Conse-quently, the twisting only due to the lateral load can be decoupled from the total <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> signal. And the friction coefficient can be finally determined based on a conversion relationship between the normal and <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> signals of the AFM photodetector. A practical procedure for minimizing Abbe ́ error in friction coefficient measurement has also been introduced. The proposed new method is simple and accurate, and requires the least operation for friction coefficient measurement at nanome-ter scale...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSolar cell models {{implemented}} in simulation packages (for example Sentaurus TCAD) are typically restricted either {{to only one}} or two dimensions, or to small scales. They therefore neglect effects of local inhomogeneities or large scale phenomena such as lateral transport to fingers or busbars. In this paper, we use a distributed circuit model to investigate lateral inhomogeneity effects on silicon wafer solar cells. The circuit is constructed of different unit elements based on the one-diode model. To calculate the characteristics of the circuit, we use the freely available software LTspice IV (Linear Technology Corp). The presented model is used to simulate the distributed current flow in a solar cell. First, the design of the distributed circuit model is described. Then, the current-voltage characteristics obtained by the distributed circuit model are compared with those obtained from measurements. Finally, one kind of large-scale <b>lateral</b> effect, the <b>voltage</b> distribution across the solar cell area, is analysed. Due to <b>lateral</b> ohmic <b>voltage</b> drops, the electric potential at the cell surface is shown to be higher in the middle between two busbars or fingers than close to them...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDirectly from {{luminescence}} images it can {{be shown}} that, for constant average injection (lumped dark current) and for not-too-large <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> differences, besides the sign, the current flow direction doesn’t play any role for the voltages present, so the series resistances {{in the dark and}} under illumination are the same. This fits to the results of a linear-response based series resistance description, treating <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> differences on large-area silicon solar cells in linear order in the series resistance as deviation from the case of zero resistance. In this approach it is found that for constant lumped dark current, emitter and grid of a large-area solar cell can be described as a passive network. Therefore, no difference occurs in the voltage distribution caused by inward and outward currents except for the sign. This contradicts several literature works reporting a smaller lumped series resistance of silicon solar cells in the dark than under illumination. However, we show that this contradiction is just a result of the series resistance definition applied in the respective works or that {{it can be}} the result of unsuitable measurement conditions. In a numerical modeling of a large-area silicon solar cell as a 1 D distributed structure, using exactly the same parameters as Araújo et al. [IEEE-TED 33 (3), 391 – 401 (1986) ] but calculating the lumped series resistance from the integrated Joule losses, we obtain completely different results than Araújo et al. : Under short-circuit condition, the series resistance stays constant, and there is no difference between the open-circuit and dark series resistance; the latter show the same dependence on the diode current density...|$|E

Channel length scaling shows that the linear mobility for electrons remains higher than 0. 1 cm 2 / V s when reducing the channel length to a few micrometers. Field-enhanced injection favors downscaling at a ﬁxed <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> and reduces the contact resistance to 11 k cm at high gate voltages for channels {{of only a few}} micrometers.

To understand the effect of the location and size of the oxide slits on the final doping profile, an one-dimensional analytical model is developed.

The experimental results show a significantly lower breakdown voltage in reversed bias current–voltage characteristics than the conven- tional Schottky diodes and also greater <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> shift in reverse bias operation than the forward bias. This can be ascribed to the increased localized electric fields emanating from the {{sharp edges and corners}} of the nanostructured morphologies.

40|$|We present {{studies of}} the Coulomb {{blockade}} and Kondo regimes of transport through a quantum dot connected to current leads through spin-polarizing quantum point contacts (QPCs). This structure, arising from the effect of lateral spin-orbit fields defining the QPCs, results in spin-polarized currents {{even in the absence}} of external magnetic fields and greatly affects the correlations in the dot. Using equation-of-motion and numerical renormalization group calculations we obtain the conductance and spin polarization for this system under different parameter regimes. We find that the system exhibits spin-polarized conductance in both the Coulomb blockade and Kondo regimes, all in the absence of applied magnetic fields. We analyze the role that the spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes of the QPC play in determining the charge and net magnetic moment in the dot.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{spatially}} resolved {{measurement of the}} minority carrier diffusion length in silicon wafers and in silicon solar cells is introduced {{that is based on}} measuring the ratio of two luminescence images taken with two different spectral filters. Good agreement is observed with the diffusion length distribution obtained from a spectrally resolved light beam induced current (LBIC) map. In contrast to the determination of diffusion lengths from one single luminescence image, the method proposed here gives absolute values of the diffusion length without the need for a separate calibration. It is also much less sensitive to <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> variations across the cell area as caused by local variations of the series resistance. It is shown that measuring the ratio of two luminescence images allows distinguishing shunts or surface defects from bulk defects. The method is applicable in principle to both, photoluminescence and electroluminescence measurements.

40|$|AbstractDouble side {{collecting}} silicon {{solar cells}} {{such as the}} emitter wrap through and the both sides contacted and collecting concept are one possibility to maintain high efficiencies even on low lifetime material. To investigate the intrinsic advantages and limitations of this concept we use {{the solution of the}} continuity equation under low level injection conditions for a double side collecting (n+pn+) and a single side collecting (n+pp+) solar cell. In general, compared to the single side collecting structure, the double side collecting structure yields the highest advantages concerning the roduct of the short circuit current density and the open circuit voltage Jsc·Voc on highly doped material with diffusion lengths in the range of half the cell thickness. A realistic calculation of the fill factor of such devices is done using two dimensional numerical simulations. It is shown that a major reduction of the fill factor is caused by laterally varying voltage induced non-generation losses and ohmic losses, both caused by the majority carrier flow in the base.

40|$|In back-contact solar cells, both {{external}} polarities {{are located}} at the back surface of the device, which allows for higher photocurrent generation on cell level and reduced series resistance on module level, leading to higher energy conversion efficiencies compared to conventional solar cells and modules. However, the majority charge carriers, which are generated near the back emitter, have to flow laterally e. g. through the base {{in order to reach}} the external majority carrier contact. In the present work, we analyse the lateral series resistance by means of measurement and simulation for high-performance metal wrap through (HIP-MWT) solar cells. We compare theoretical models and experimental methods to extract the effective series resistance from simulated and measured current–voltage characteristics and show that <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> variations significantly increase the local recombination current. If the width of the gap between the external majority carrier contacts is reduced from the typical value of 3. 5 mm to ideally 0 mm, we expect an increase of the energy conversion efficiency of approximately 0. 1 %abs. for cells with three continuous rear emitter contacts on 125 mm× 125 mm large silicon wafers. In a simulation study, the bulk doping concentration NA and the bulk lifetime are varied yielding an optimal base resistivity of 0. 6 Ω cm– 1. 5 Ω cm for HIP-MWT solar cells based on Czochralski-grown silicon in the degraded state of the boron–oxygen defect and an optimal resistivity of less than 1. 0 Ω cm for the case of bulk lifetimes larger than ~ 300 µs...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{the author}} {{presents}} theoretical and experimental studies {{for understanding the}} fundamentals of nanostructured thin film based Schottky diodes when they were applied as hydrogen sensors. Metal and nanocrystalline semiconducting nanomaterials can provide a significantly higher {{surface to volume ratio}} as compared to bulk materials. Nanomaterials can also exist with sharp edged features in their surface morphology to induce enhanced localised electric fields. Both of these characteristics can therefore provide innovative sensors with considerably improved static and dynamic sensing performance. The configuration of the sensors studied herein were based on Pt / nanostructured semiconducting metal oxide / SiC using molybdenum oxide (MoO 3) and zinc oxide (ZnO). The author deposited MoO 3 nanostructured thin films on SiC substrates by a thermal evaporation technique. Four types of MoO 3 morphologies (nanoplatelets, nanoplatelets-nanowires, randomly orientated nanoplatelets and nanoflowers) were examined. The author also deposited ZnO nanostructured films on SiC by evaporation-condensation, pulse laser deposition and radio frequency (RF) sputtering techniques. Three types of ZnO morphologies (nanoplatelets-nanowires, nanograins and nanorods) were obtained. These semiconducting metal oxides with different morphologies were investigated as gas sensing layers in Schottky diodes for hydrogen sensing applications. The static (sensitivity, stability) and dynamic performance of these diodes towards hydrogen gas were investigated. Their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured and the change in barrier height and <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> shift was examined under a constant current mode of operation. The developed, novel sensors were studied in both the forward and reverse biased conditions. The author identified that operation in reverse bias exhibited a larger voltage shift as compared to the forward bias operation. This observation was associated to the presence of enhanced localised electric fields that originate from the edges and corners of the nanostructured morphologies. These enhanced electric fields significantly lower the reverse Schottky barrier height and allow a greater flow of current. The author linked the enhanced electric field theory in literature, to the results obtained in order to investigate the electrical properties of metal oxides based on nanorod and nanoplatelet morphologies. By curve fitting the measured I-V data to modified reverse bias Schottky diode equations, and important parameters such as the enhancement factor can be obtained and used to describe the ratio of the localised electric fields to the applied field. The Schottky diodes examined in this thesis using nanostructured MoO 3 and ZnO as the sensing layer are highly promising as the results indicate that they exhibit high sensitivity towards hydrogen gas over a range of temperatures, as well as dynamic performance and good short term stability...|$|E
40|$|In this research, novel nanostructured {{thin film}} based Schottky diodes for gas sensing {{applications}} were developed and investigated. The author explored the sensing potential {{of these devices}} and comprehensively studied {{a large group of}} nanostructured thin films, as the gas sensing layers, with aspirations of enhancing sensor’ performance compared to the conventional based sensors. To the best of author’s knowledge, the author developed several nanostructured metal-oxide based Schottky diodes with morphologies that have not been reported previously in literature and presented the first scientific investigation of Pt/graphene-like nano-sheets/SiC based gas sensors. The nanostructured materials were deposited on SiC and GaN substrates and characterised. These materials were then applied in the fabrications of Schottky diodes and their gas sensing performance was investigated towards different gaseous species. Hydrogen gas was assessed below explosive level. Propene and NO 2 gases were also sensed at above hazardous concentrations for human’s health. Two different types of sensors were investigated: Pt/nanostructured semiconducting metal-oxide and Pt/graphene-like nano-sheets devices. The operational principles of the devices as well as their gas sensing mechanisms are discussed. These sensors comprised of thin Pt layers (as both Schottky contact and catalyst) and nanostructured thin films (as the gas sensing layers), which are deposited on substrates with ohmic contacts. SiC and GaN were the selected substrates, as they are wide band semiconducting materials, making them suitable for high temperature applications. To enhance these devices’ sensitivity, author used nanostructured forms of the semiconducting metal-oxides (TiO 2, SnO 2, ZnO, RuO 2, MoO 3, WO 3) and graphene-like nano-sheets. The electrical characteristics and gas sensing performance of the sensors were obtained in the presence and absence of target gas at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 620 °C. The Pt/nanostructured metal-oxide based Schottky diodes exhibited a significantly lower breakdown voltage and larger <b>lateral</b> <b>voltage</b> shift upon exposure to the target gas in reverse bias mode of operation than that in forward bias as compared to conventional Schottky diodes. This was associated to the enhanced localized electric fields originating from the sharp edges and corners of the high aspect ratio nanostructures. To the best of author’s knowledge, for the first time it was shown that these enhanced localized electric fields lowered the Schottky barrier height energy at the reverse bias condition, allowing greater charge carrier flow and hence enhanced sensitivity. It was found that amongst the sensors investigated, the devices based on MoO 3 nanostructures exhibited the highest sensitivity (a voltage shift of 5. 7 V towards 1 % hydrogen) with excellent baseline stability and a fast response (t 90 %) of 40 s. For the Pt/graphene-like nano-sheet/SiC devices, a unique theoretical approach was developed. To the best of author’s knowledge, this theoretical explanation was the first description of the behaviour of the Pt/graphene-like nano-sheet/SiC junctions. The author attributed the unusual behaviour of such junction to the semi-metal like properties of the graphene-like layer, which was placed between Pt and SiC substrate. The sensors showed response to hydrogen gas; while the response towards NO 2 was not significant. Therefore, these devices could sense selectively hydrogen at the presence of NO 2...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{cylindrical}} outer {{hair cell}} (OHC) of Corti’s organ drives cochlear amplification by a voltage-dependent {{activation of the}} molecular motor, prestin (SLC 26 a 5), in the cell’s lateral membrane. The voltage-dependent nature of this process leads to the troublesome observation that the membrane resistor-capacitor filter could limit high-frequency acoustic activation of the motor. Based on cable theory, the unique 30  nm width compartment (the extracisternal space, ECS) formed between the cell’s lateral membrane and adjacent subsurface cisternae (SSC) could further limit the influence of receptor currents on <b>lateral</b> membrane <b>voltage.</b> Here, we use dual perforated/whole-cell and loose patch clamp on isolated OHCs to sequentially record currents resulting from excitation at apical, middle, and basal loose patch sites before and after perforated patch rupture. We find that timing of currents is fast and uniform before whole-cell pipette washout, suggesting little voltage attenuation {{along the length of}} the lateral membrane. Prior treatment with salicylate, a disrupter of the SSC, confirms the influence of the SSC on current spread. Finally, a cable model of the OHC, which can match our data, indicates that the SSC poses a minimal barrier to current flow across it, thereby facilitating rapid delivery of voltage excitation to the prestin-embedded lateral membrane...|$|R
