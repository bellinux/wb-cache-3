This paper proposes a new quantified SWOT analytic method incorporated with the vote-ranking method. The indices of SWOT are voted, weighted and quantified to assess the competitive strategy, from top to the bottom, meanwhile the total weighted scores method {{will be used to}} get the best strategy alternatives. The competitive strategies of the Taiwanese Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Environmental Management Systems (EMS) are taken as a case study, where eighteen certificated ISO 9000 or ISO 14000 <b>auditors</b> (or <b>lead</b> <b>auditors)</b> are invited to establish a decision group. Under the impact of environmental factors, the results show that company’s image and profitability is the most important strategy for SMEs within the global markets. Lastly, Taiwanese SMEs apperceive the significance of EMS and also recognize the importance to survive within the diversified competing market environment, whereas they need to build up its environmental management that has to suit the EMS specification and attention. The findings are also applicable for other developing countries within the global markets or barriers...|$|R
40|$|Many fraud {{detection}} problems involve {{large numbers}} of financial transactions such as those associated with credit cards, accounts receivables, payments to vendors, payrolls, or other expense accounts (Panigrahi 2006; Bolton and Hand 2002). Computer Assisted Auditing Tools and Techniques (CAATTs) e. g., ACL (2006) allow auditors to perform digital analysis based on Benford’s Law (Benford 1938) for scrutinizing high volumes of complex financial data and detecting unintentional errors or fraud (AICPA 2008; Panigrahi 2006; Coderre 1999). However, the advantages that these software packages offer for assessing data conformity to Benford’s Law are limited due to {{problems associated with the}} underlying traditional statistical procedures. Specifically, previous studies (e. g., Cho and Gaines 2007; Geyer and Williamson 2004; Nigrini 2000) have issued caveats on the use of traditional statistical tests such as chi-square goodness-of-fit or Z-tests in the context of Benford’s Law because applications of these tests to large data sets may falsely <b>lead</b> <b>auditors</b> to believe that evidence of fraud exists when in fact there is none. Nigrini (2000) defines this situation as the problem of “excessive power ” (p. 75). Similarly, Geyer and Williamson (2004) note that “…one has to be careful in such situations…where the sample size may be very large, for this [Z] test is almost certain to rejec...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether lengthy audit delays <b>lead</b> to <b>auditor</b> changes in the {{subsequent}} year. The paper hypothesizes that a lengthy interaction between clients and their auditors reflects high audit risk factors relating to management integrity, internal controls, and the financial reporting process. It argues that auditors are more likely to drop clients with long audit delays because they would like to avoid these types of audit risks. Design/methodology/approach – Using logistic regressions, the paper first tests whether a lengthy audit delay <b>leads</b> to an <b>auditor</b> change. It then examines whether as audit delays increase, auditor changes are more likely to be downward than lateral. Findings – The results support the hypothesis that Big N auditor-client realignments occur following long audit delays. Further, as the length of the delay increases, the paper finds that there are more downward changes. Research limitations/implications – An implication of our study is that a long audit delay represents a publicly observed proxy for the presence of audit risk factors that <b>lead</b> to an <b>auditor</b> change. Practical implications – This study suggests that all else constant, investors should consider a lengthy audit delay as indicating that there has been deterioration in the quality of the client-auditor interaction. An audit delay also presents an observable proxy for successor auditors to consider while evaluating risks associated with a new client. Originality/value – The results of our study increase our understanding of how Big N auditors manage their client portfolios to mitigate their exposure to risk factors.

40|$|Auditors use {{substantive}} {{analytical procedures}} to make assertions about the adequacy and appropriateness of client balances. The analytical procedure process consists of auditors creating independent account expectations and corroborating unusual fluctuations through obtaining and evaluating additional audit evidence. Prior analytical procedure {{research has found}} that knowledge of clients' unaudited account balances biases auditors' expectations towards the current year figures. However, this research has failed to examine the impact of biased expectations on the subsequent stages of analytical procedures. This dissertation assesses the full impact of biased account expectations on auditors' use of analytical procedures. I experimentally test the hypotheses of my dissertation through administering an experiment to senior level auditors. After inducing an account expectation bias that favors the client account balance in half the participants, I examine the auditors' cognitive investigation into an unusual account fluctuation. The results indicate that a biased account expectation negatively affects auditors' judgment quality. In particular, a biased expectation <b>leads</b> <b>auditors</b> to favor hypotheses and additional information that supports the proposition that the client's balance is reasonably stated. Alternatively, auditors with unbiased account expectations are more willing to consider all hypotheses and are able to identify the most pertinent additional information to the decision task. As a result of the different decision strategies employed, auditors who form unbiased account expectations are significantly more likely than auditors with biased account expectations to identify the correct relationship among the underlying data and the proposed hypotheses during a substantive analytical procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to examine audit firm size, the provision of non-audit services (NAS) and audit tenure as factors that influence the likelihood that an auditor agrees with allowing audit exemption. This study employs a 2 × 2 × 2 within-subject experimental design. Respondent auditors were required to evaluate 8 case scenarios. A total of 79 questionnaires were returned and used for data analysis. General Linear Measurement (Repeat Measure) was used to analyse the data. The study found that an audit firm size has {{a significant impact on the}} likelihood that an auditor agrees with offering audit exemption. The larger the size of the firm, the greater is the likelihood of agreeing with allowing audit exemption. Therefore, it is suggested that small audit firms (with 5 or fewer employees) merge and focus on activities that contribute more added value such as consultancy. In so doing, auditors from these firms would be required to improve their knowledge and capacity by offering these services and not merely focusing on traditional audit work for SMEs. This is because SMEs are known to have limited resources and capacity and thus would be expected to have poor internal control. The requirement of a mandatory audit for such firms might <b>lead</b> <b>auditors</b> to compromise their independence. Thus, the government and the Malaysian Institute of Accountant (MIA) should help small audit firms to develop the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to perform non-audit services...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{examines}} {{whether the}} Big 4 audit quality {{is associated with}} auditor industry expertise, measured as both individual partner- and audit firmlevel leadership. We focus on a sample of listed firms in Taiwan, where audit reports must be audited and signed by the two signing auditors {{as well as by}} an audit firm. For accruals analyses, we find that differential discretionary accruals due to industry expertise are driven by a combination of firm and partner expertise. For audit opinion analyses, we find that differential likelihood of a modified audit opinion (hereafter, MAO) is primarily attributable to signing auditor specialists. We also find that firm-level specialists alone are not associated with a higher likelihood of issuing a MAO. However, firm-level specialists, in combination with signing auditor specialists, can add something over and above the effects of the signing auditor specialists alone. Second, we further examine whether there is differential audit quality between signing <b>auditors</b> (i. e., <b>lead</b> and concurring <b>auditors).</b> We find that clients of <b>lead</b> signing <b>auditor</b> specialists, either alone or in conjunction with concurring auditor specialists, have smaller accruals {{and are more likely to}} receive a MAO compared to those of nonspecialists. However, concurring auditor specialists alone are not associated with higher audit quality, in terms of either smaller accruals or a higher MAO likelihood. Thus, we conclude that industry expertise is not homogeneous across individual auditors within the same audit firm in Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Audit, {{a crucial}} process in any Quality Management System (QMS) is popularly {{defined as a}} systematic, {{independent}} and documented practice for obtaining and evaluating evidence objectively {{to determine the extent}} to which audit criteria (conformance and effectiveness) are fulfilled. In an institution of higher learning, the audit process is used to ensure that performance and effectiveness of the management of academic department activities and other supporting processes are in line with quality standards set by the institution. University of Malaya (UM) became the first public university in Malaysia to implement a QMS across all departments and faculties within the institution and being accredited for it. In December 2002, UM attained the MS ISO 9001 : 2000 Certification for Quality Management System and this international recognition was also acknowledged by the Malaysian Book of Records in 2006. With this certification, the Standard necessitates UM to conduct internal audit at planned intervals. During the early stages, audits were conducted every 6 to 8 months and later when the implementation of QMS had stabilized it was conducted on an annual basis. UM is a large institution and requires a considerable number of staffs to be trained as auditors; with the intention of involving them during audit exercises. In ensuring competent auditors, these staffs were sent to various audit courses. To date, UM has more than 400 trained internal auditors of which 80 are certified <b>lead</b> <b>auditors.</b> Since 2002, there have been eight internal audits conducted and the results and important outcomes of these exercises are used to continually improve the management system of the various departments in UM. However, the experience in the audit process in UM is not without challenges. Among the challenges faced included lack of cooperation from auditees and/or their representatives, audit time constraints, service period of auditors, and number of auditors. Despite these shortcomings, the audit process was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the management of various core processes across the institution and more importantly, some departments actually carried out self-audits indicating positive perception and general acceptance. The knowledge gained is then used to improve the management system of the departments in order to provide better quality services...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{capital structure}} signalling to auditors. Financial structure has adverse selection that can negatively affect auditors’ perception of firm value or risk, which can <b>lead</b> the <b>auditor</b> to charge high price. We expect firms’ financial structure to positively relate with auditors’ pricing. Using panel data analysis methodology to analyse data of 311 firm-year observations of non-finance firms covering the period 2012 - 2015, pooled OLS regression {{results suggest that}} financial structure is positively related to auditors’ price. We find that equity, but not debt, is significantly related to auditors’ price. These results hold after controlling for auditor type. The positive relations suggest lower perceptions of firm value (hence high risk) by auditors, thereby making firms to pay higher auditors’ price. This suggests that auditors penalise equity financed firms more than debt financed firms, probably because auditors interpret equity financing as firms’ inability to raise debt. Based on the findings, we recommend that auditors should monitor the capital structure of their clients to guide them in pricing their services. We also recommend that corporate finance managers should rebalance their firms’ capital structure cognisant {{of the fact that}} it signals to auditors...|$|R
