5|$|In the city, Tintin {{is framed}} as a terrorist, arrested, {{and sentenced to}} death by firing squad; but survives when a {{revolution}} topples the government, and the new leader, General Alcazar, appoints Tintin his aide-de-camp. Alonso and Ramón capture Tintin, and interrogate him in the hope of <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> missing fetish, but he escapes and apprehends them.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The Mach-Zehnder interferometer's {{relatively}} large and freely accessible working space, and its flexibility in <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> fringes {{has made it}} the interferometer of choice for visualizing flow in wind tunnels, and for flow visualization studies in general. It is frequently used {{in the fields of}} aerodynamics, plasma physics and heat transfer to measure pressure, density, and temperature changes in gases.|$|E

5|$|The lateral and {{torsional}} stiffness {{of the rear}} frame and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially. Long wheelbase and trail and a flat steering-head angle {{have been found to}} increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> front fork torsional axis as low as possible.|$|E
5|$|After <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters {{only the}} nests that contain P. rebeli caterpillars. It {{is able to}} enter the nest without being swarmed because it {{releases}} a chemical that causes the worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the caterpillars, it marks the individuals most likely to survive by ovipositing in them. Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> {{site of a}} CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak {{without the need for}} a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, NSC {{operated}} Tromsø Satellite Station (TSS), {{which was}} used as a ground station for a limited number of satellites. After Rolf Skår was appointed director of NSC, plans were launched to try to win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen.|$|E
5|$|Olds, whose B-17s were {{deployed}} to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg, {{was given the}} assignment of <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> Rex as far at sea as possible, and assigned Major Vincent J.

5|$|Smith's {{authority}} was undermined when Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, and other church members also claimed to receive revelations. In response, Smith dictated a revelation which clarified his {{office as a}} prophet and an apostle, and which declared that only he held the ability to give doctrine and scripture for the entire church. Shortly after the conference, Smith dispatched Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and others {{on a mission to}} proselytize Native Americans. Cowdery was also assigned the task of <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> site of the New Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The boys ran to {{town for}} help, and several men, {{including}} local businessman Watson Stanley Fisher, 24, came to investigate.

His right thigh was severely injured and he bled to death at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch at 5:30p.m. Stilwell's body was recovered 150feet (46m) upstream from the Wyckoff dock on July 14.|$|E
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E

On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from <b>locating</b> <b>the</b> British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E
5|$|Data {{determines that}} the only way to restore the realities is to send Worf via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise of his universe, passing through the fissure and using the shuttlecraft's engines to reseal it.
