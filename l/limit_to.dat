5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
