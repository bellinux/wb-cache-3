5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
25|$|The basic Arabic {{alphabet}} contains 28 letters. Adaptations of the Arabic {{script for}} other languages added and removed some letters, as for Kurdish, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Sindhi, Urdu, Malay, Pashto, Arwi and Malayalam (Arabi Malayalam), {{all of which}} have additional letters as shown below. There are no distinct upper and <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> forms.|$|E
25|$|Road {{signs in}} the United Kingdom are governed by an {{extremely}} complex and detailed set of guidelines. The basic units of measurement used by sign designers are the 'x-height' (the height of the <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> 'x') and the 'stroke width' (sw) (4 sw = 1 x-height). The sizes of borders, symbols and arrows and the spacing and layout of the sign face are expressed in sw, {{so that all the}} elements remain in proportion. The x-height of a sign is dictated mainly by the speed of traffic approaching it, hence 300mm x-heights are common on motorways, whereas parking signs are mostly at 15mm or 20mm x-height.|$|E
50|$|The PLATO {{system used}} a further variant of 6/12 display code. Noting that <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letters</b> were {{most common in}} typical PLATO usage, the roles were reversed. <b>Lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letters</b> were the norm, and the escape {{character}} preceded upper <b>case</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new method to construct approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems using semidefinite programming. It consists of expressing each combinatorial object in the original problem as a constellation of vectors in the semidefinite program. When we apply this technique to systems of linear equations mod p with at most two variables in each equation, we can show {{that the problem is}} approximable within (1 - #(p)) p, where #(p) > 0 for all p. Using standard techniques, we also show that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a constant ratio, independent of p.

50|$|This {{effect is}} usually {{restricted}} to text set in all caps, because Cyrillic letter-forms {{do not match}} well with <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> Latin <b>letters.</b> In Cyrillic typography, most upright <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letters</b> resemble smaller upper <b>case</b> <b>letters,</b> unlike the more distinctive forms of Latin-alphabet type. Cursive Cyrillic upper and <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letters</b> are more differentiated. Cyrillic letter-forms were derived from 10th-century Greek, but the modern forms have more closely resembled those in the Latin alphabet since Peter the Great's civil script reform of 1708.|$|R

2500|$|Up until 1920, {{standard}} gauge electric locomotives {{were given the}} letter F and a <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> for the maximum speed level.

2500|$|Conder tokens {{are named}} after James Conder {{who was an}} early {{collector}} and cataloguer of these tokens. [...] Building {{on the work of}} Conder and a few other intermediary reference works, the definitive and exhaustive work on attributing Conder tokens used by modern collectors is that of Dalton and Hamer. [...] Each token is identified based on one of four large geographic regions (England, Anglesey and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland), then further by county. Within the county of issue, each unique combination of obverse and reverse design is assigned a number (referred to as the D number), and variations in edge lettering are further differentiated by a <b>lower</b> <b>case</b> <b>letter</b> following the number designation. [...] In general, the tokens are organized within each county such that pennies are listed first (lowest D numbers), then halfpennies, and finally farthings (highest D numbers). [...] It is also quite common for collectors to refer to a token by the specific city, business, or series of the issue within the larger county category. [...] A few tokens were issued in denominations other than the penny, halfpenny, and farthing, and these less common denominations are also indexed in Dalton and Hamer. [...] The vast majority of tokens indexed in D from the period were struck in copper, even those in odd denominations of threepence, one shilling, and others.|$|E
