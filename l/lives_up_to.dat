5|$|Certain {{scholars}} have always defended {{the value of}} specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, {{has argued that the}} <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as Lives of the Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these {{are not part of the}} original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} born blind, gaining sight after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at three months, but {{remain in the}} birth den for six months before leaving to {{accompany}} their mother on hunts. They will continue in their mother's company for {{one to two years}} before leaving to establish a territory for themselves. Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.|$|E
5|$|Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer {{during the}} latter's magic {{show in a}} street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to {{sacrifice}} an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to organotin toxins, there has been renewed interest in copper as the active agent in ablative or self polishing paints, with reported service <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5 years. Modern adhesives permit application of copper alloys to steel hulls without creating galvanic corrosion. However, copper alone is not impervious to diatom and algae fouling. Some studies indicate that copper may also present an unacceptable environmental impact.|$|E
25|$|In southeastern Europe, H. pomatia {{lives in}} forests, open habitats, gardens, vineyards, {{especially}} along rivers, confined to calcareous substrate. In central Europe, {{it occurs in}} open forests and shrubland on calcareous substrate. It prefers high humidity and lower temperatures, and needs loose soil for burrowing to hibernate and lay its eggs. It <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2100 m above sea level in the Alps, but usually below 2000 m. In the south of England, it is restricted to undisturbed grassy or bushy wastelands, usually not in gardens; it has a low reproduction rate and low powers of dispersal.|$|E

25|$|Cruach Ardrain {{currently}} has one Munro “Top” located on its slopes, the 959 metre Stob Garbh (Rough Peak) situated 1km {{away on the}} northern ridge. Stob Garbh <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its name by being rocky and needs care when being traversed. It can be by-passed {{on the west side}} but the path is steep and slippery and it is best to stick to the path over the crest. The original 1891 edition of Munro's Tables lists another Top at an intermediate point on the ridge, Stob Garbh South East Top at 925m. This Top was deleted in the 1921 edition. The north west ridge has two intermediate summits, Meall Dhamh (814 metres) and Grey Heights (686 metres), before dropping steeply to Glen Falloch through a conifer plantation.|$|E
25|$|Fefe Dobson's self titled {{debut album}} is {{generally}} pop-rock, {{as well as}} some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn't want to be a pop-star and wanted to make her own type of music, and quickly left the label. For Dobson second official album Joy she worked producers David Lichens, Jon Levine, Howard Benson and Bob Ezrin on Joy, Dobson <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the portraits of her heroes she first hung during the recording of her first album—Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, The Vines and Jeff Buckley. She co-wrote most of the songs on the album, usually composing on guitar, her choice of instrument.|$|E
25|$|Is {{considered}} by some as the most representative festival {{of the city that}} <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the nickname he carries. The festival {{is one of the most}} important in Peru and is done in early October of each year, by the Lions Club of La Libertad Region. The first festival was held in 1950, and has been held annually since. The flower festival has a rich and varied program of over a hundred activities to meet the tastes and interests of Trujillo people and thousands of domestic and foreign tourists. The activities are carried out for a month in which the city takes on a festive environment, thousands of domestic and foreign tourists arriving in the town for various events like the coronation of the Queen of Spring, competition horses step, the parade of foreign queens and Spring Corso through the main avenues of the city, where visitors revel in the maneuvers of the Guaripolas. The festival closes with the spring parade or corso and a private party organized by the Lions Club.|$|E

25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and helpless, and {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, the kittens weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which blacken {{at the age of}} three months, and blue eyes, which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will start moving independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though the kittens will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of African wildcat kittens over {{the first two weeks of}} their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. The kittens are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13–14 years.|$|E
25|$|With {{the use of}} non-edible {{vegetable}} oils produced by trees such as Millettia Pinnata (formerly Pongamia Pinnata) or the Moringa oleifera tree, both which grow on borderline or non-arable land, the food versus fuel debate becomes less of an either/or question. Apart from their facility of growing in non-arable and/or marginal land, these trees offer major advantages over peanut, soy-bean, sunflower, etc., in that they have long <b>lives</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100 years), very low maintenance (since the intensive husbandry {{is limited to the}} first few years of their producing lives) and can provide cash-crops to rural areas, such as rural India. In the case of Millettia Pinnata and a few others, the fact that they are nitrogen-fixing legumes is another very important factor, in that they do not deplete the soil. Among other benefits of these trees is that they have root-systems that penetrate much deeper and do not compete with shallow-rooted plants, like grass (once the trees have attained a certain maturity). This means that the land can be used for multiple purposes, such as grazing for animals. Yet another benefit of using Millettia Pinnata to produce bio-diesel is that it can tolerate low rainfall (as little as 250 ml per year), far below what most food-crops require, thus reducing yet more their potential to compete.|$|E
