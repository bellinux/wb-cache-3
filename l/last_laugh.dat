5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Loxton top-scored with 39 as Australia batted first and were bowled out for 204 after the first day was washed out. He then took 0/18 from eight overs and made 52 in the second innings before being run out while batting with Harvey as the match ended in a draw. In the second innings, Loxton attempted to attack the bowling of Malcolm Hilton—who had troubled Bradman in the first innings—in an attempt to throw him off his game. However, Hilton had the <b>last</b> <b>laugh</b> and removed Bradman for the second time.|$|E
5|$|While {{few other}} purely Expressionistic films were made, Caligari {{still had a}} major {{influence}} over other German directors, {{and many of the}} film's Expressionist elements – particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters – became prevalent in German cinema. Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) and The <b>Last</b> <b>Laugh</b> (1924), G. W. Pabst's Secrets of a Soul (1926), and Lang's Metropolis (1927) and M (1931). The success of Caligari also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films {{over the next few years}} moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios, which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema. Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers – such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni – and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the Nazi Party. Additionally, the success of Caligaris collaborative effort – including its director, set designers and actors – influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making teamwork a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic.|$|E

The Seahawks would regain the lead in the fourth quarter with Mare's 39-yard and 46-yard field goal. However, the Bears got the <b>last</b> <b>laugh</b> as Cutler hooked up with wide receiver Devin Hester on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett). Seattle tried to rally, but Chicago's defense held on for the win.|$|E
25|$|Cronje {{once again}} came up against Australia {{and once again}} ended on the losing side. In the {{triangular}} one day series they won the group with Australia just scraping through, they also won the first 'final' but South Africa lost the last two finals. During the group matches Cronje had threatened to lead his team off after Pat Symcox had missiles thrown at him, Symcox had the <b>last</b> <b>laugh</b> ending the match with 4/24. Before the Test series started he scored consecutive centuries against Tasmania and Australia A these were his first in two years.|$|E
25|$|A few overs of {{relative}} calm followed, Hayden forging runs with Martyn but never looking too assured, and his dismissal, came in an over where Australia had actually looked on top. However, Simon Jones got the <b>last</b> <b>laugh</b> over Hayden – only to later be reprimanded by the ICC for his celebrations. England kept muscling on, and despite never playing {{on top of}} their game they got four more wickets before the scheduled close of play. Giles got two of those, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and then an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.|$|E

Shortly afterward, Cobra forces in Europe fell to a unified attack by regular military forces. In the wake of this conflict, most of Cobra's high command disappeared, and Cobra Commander himself became an international fugitive. Soon after, the military disbanded the G.I. Joe team.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs won 56 {{games in}} the {{succeeding}} 2007–08 season, but relinquished the Southwest Division title to the New Orleans Hornets due to a tie-breaker. The Spurs had the <b>last</b> <b>laugh,</b> though, defeating the Hornets in seven games. But their chance of defending their title was denied by the Los Angeles Lakers in five games of the conference finals. After that, age and injury took its toll on the Spurs, as they proceeded to win only a single playoff series in three years (2010, vs. Dallas 4–2 of the first round), before getting upset by the Memphis Grizzlies {{in the first round}} of the 2011 NBA Playoffs despite finishing with 61 wins.|$|E
25|$|England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was {{dismissed}} for a duck by Wasim Akram, followed by Alec Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother caused Imran {{to give an}} early second spell to his main pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote {{the fate of the}} match. Two deliveries from the left arm fast bowler dismissed Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off Aaqib Javed to seal England's last hope. When the cards were laid down, captain Imran Khan had the <b>last</b> <b>laugh</b> when Richard Illingworth was caught by Ramiz Raja off his delivery to finish off the final and crown Pakistan world champions of cricket.|$|E

25|$|Scott Styris conceded 56 {{runs with}} the ball for Middlesex Crusaders in this National League game, but his four wickets near the end cut short Glamorgan's chase to bring Middlesex to victory. The Crusaders had been {{inserted}} by Glamorgan Dragons captain Robert Croft, against a Dragons side whose National League season had seen their best performances, as both Championship, Twenty20 and C had seen them finish below ninth. After Ed Smith departed for 6, fifties from Paul Weekes and Owais Shah sent Middlesex to 133 for 1. Dean Cosker took two quick wickets, but 37 off 27 balls from left-hander Ed Joyce helped Middlesex {{to a total of}} 239 for 5. Peter Trego then removed both openers, before Alex Wharf took him for runs (ending with 40 off 20 balls), and Trego ended with one maiden over, two wickets, and 31 runs off three overs. Wharf was eventually caught by Smith, but David Hemp, Dan Cherry and Richard Grant all added more than 30 in stands with Mike Powell, and at 219 for 5, Glamorgan needed 21 for the last five wickets. Styris had the <b>last</b> <b>laugh,</b> however, taking three wickets in the late overs and bowling Glamorgan out with eight balls remaining in their quota to leave Powell stranded on 83 not out.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, {{creaming}} a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} <b>last</b> <b>laugh,</b> as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising along at a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E

At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding." [...] She went on to further describe her vocals as [...] "spectacular." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his influence, Patiño is {{frequently}} {{the victim of}} the Supreme's abuse, even having his own death sentence dictated to him, although in the end he outlives his master. González Echevarría questions whether Patiño [...] " [...] the <b>last</b> <b>laugh?</b> Did he achieve some sort of posthumous power?" [...] This is suggested both because he outlived Dr. Francia, and also because the pen ostensibly used to write the book was given to the author by Patiño's descendant. Therefore, [...] "the editor, who arranges the various texts and annotates them, who thereby exercises final authority over Dr. Francia's versions of himself, is the heir of Policarpo Patiño." [...] The power relationship between the Supreme and his secretary is a microcosm of the book as a whole, with Dr. Francia dominating Patiño completely, even though the latter is intimately associated with the dictator having power at all, given the power he derives from writing.|$|E
