5|$|According to a 1765 Encyclopédie entry, Castaing's {{machine was}} capable of {{applying}} the edge <b>lettering</b> to 20,000 coins daily.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} <b>lettering</b> work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters customized <b>lettering</b> treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's Vertigo line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is black with white <b>lettering,</b> Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech is without a bubble at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E
5|$|Bold <b>lettering</b> {{indicates}} active {{with team}} player. The statistics are counted for Asia League games only.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add <b>lettering</b> and {{decoration}} {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such <b>lettering</b> was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with <b>lettering</b> which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} livery is {{in white}} color {{with a red}} dragon on the cowling and on the vertical stabiliser; and the airline's name written in Chinese red <b>lettering</b> and in English black <b>lettering</b> {{above and below the}} front passenger windows, respectively. In addition, there is a 30cm Oneworld logo next to the first left door and a Swire Group logo on the aft of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Though {{production}} of hammered coinage ceased in France in 1645, edge <b>lettering</b> wasn't immediately reintroduced to that nation's milled coinage. At some point prior to 1679, Jean Castaing, a French engineer, invented a machine to apply edge <b>lettering</b> to coins, and in 1685, {{he approached the}} French government with a proposal to use his machine in that nation's mints. King Louis XIV favoured the invention, but his financial minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, believed {{that it would not}} be economically viable to pay the expenses required to put it into use. In 1686, over Colbert's objection, the French Council of State entered a contract with Castaing wherein all of the nation's gold and silver coinage would include edge <b>lettering</b> created by his machine.|$|E
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the <b>lettering</b> and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. <b>Lettering</b> and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{printing}} in {{the main}} image, the <b>lettering</b> and the value numerals {{on the front of}} the banknotes will be raised.|$|E
5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid malachite green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, {{members of the class}} under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow <b>lettering.</b> The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to malachite green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow <b>lettering.</b> Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E
5|$|The English-language Adventures of Tintin {{books were}} {{originally}} published with handwritten <b>lettering</b> created by cartographer Neil Hyslop. 1958's The Crab With the Golden Claws {{was the first}} to be published with Hyslop's <b>lettering.</b> Hyslop was given versions of Hergé's artwork with blank panels. Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane-like material, aiming to fit within the original speech bubble. Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit. In the early 2000s, Tintin's English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop's handwritten <b>lettering,</b> instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts. This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Hergé's estate managers Moulinsart, who decided to replace localised hand-lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide.|$|E
5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} is proof that none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge <b>lettering</b> on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge <b>lettering</b> was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E
5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except <b>lettering</b> similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge <b>lettering</b> at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised <b>lettering</b> on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised <b>lettering</b> used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Inscribed on {{the front}} of the dome, above the main entrance, are two poetic lines, written by Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis in the Welsh and English languages. The <b>lettering</b> is formed by windows in the upstairs bar areas and is {{internally}} illuminated at night.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{consensus}} favours an Anglo-Saxon, probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux tapestry. This famous {{narrative of}} the Conquest is not a true woven tapestry but an embroidered hanging worked in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for <b>lettering</b> and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.|$|E
5|$|The DC Comics edition, {{distributed}} throughout North America, contained an error on page 130, {{in which the}} <b>lettering</b> was removed from a speech balloon. The publication was shipped with a sticker of the missing text, which readers could place over the wordless balloon to complete the page.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale <b>lettering,</b> which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue <b>lettering.</b>|$|E
5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines. Serif <b>lettering</b> and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were chrome-plated, as were the nameplates, which had a black background.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. <b>Lettering</b> and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E
5|$|The parapet {{has three}} {{horizontal}} rows of inscriptions; {{on the upper}} and lower rows is smaller <b>lettering</b> that is often not visible in reproductions. In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, not least due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1688, in {{response}} to counterfeiting and {{to raise money to}} support the Nine Years' War, Castaing proposed a method of reshaping and restriking existing coins, which was ultimately accepted. Castaing's edge <b>lettering</b> machine was used on the overstruck coins, and the Royal Mint supervisor Martin Masselin, the individual who undertook the process, was obligated to pay Castaing for its use. In 1691, Masselin was dismissed, as he and his clerks were found to have stolen from the Mint during the reformation of the coinage, and Castaing was appointed to perform the edge <b>lettering</b> and restriking in his place. A second reform took place in 1693. Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 on charges of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins to be reminted; according to his wife, Marie Hippolyte Castaing (née Bosch), the allegations were false, originating from opponents who lost money {{as a result of his}} machine's introduction to the French Mint and the resulting monetary reforms.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as his}} {{building}} projects Wilfrid also commissioned works to embellish the churches, including altar cloths made of silk woven with gold threads, and a gospel book written on parchment dyed purple, with gold <b>lettering.</b> The gospels were then enclosed in a gold book cover set with gems. When the church he had built at Ripon was consecrated, a three-day feast was held to accompany the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Besides similar fonts, many {{signs and}} objects made in Britain {{during the period}} of Gill Sans' dominance, such as the famous Keep Calm and Carry On poster, {{received}} hand-painted or custom <b>lettering</b> similar to Gill Sans. Fighter Command during the war used a standard set of letters similar to it. Matthew Carter, later a prominent font designer, recalled in 2005 that when his mother cut linoleum block letters for him to play with during the Blitz they were based on it.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with <b>lettering</b> and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge <b>lettering</b> on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge <b>lettering</b> prior to striking.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white <b>lettering</b> on a black background.|$|E
5|$|His {{collection}} is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces {{dating from the}} 10th century. One example is a Quranic page of North African origin written with gold <b>lettering</b> in the Kufic script – {{it is more than}} 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are well represented in calligraphic as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of Ottoman callgraphies, manuscripts and paintings.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in white on a red background, instead of the more familiar red or black <b>lettering.</b> The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association {{surveyed}} {{its members}} and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the Washington state flag 47th out of the 72 flags surveyed, with a score of 4.53 points out of 10. Washington's flag was criticized for its complicated seal, use of <b>lettering,</b> and similarities to other U.S. state flags that used seals on solid colors.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the <b>lettering</b> was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E
5|$|She {{has several}} tattoos, {{including}} {{a black and}} pink nautical star {{on the back of}} both of her elbows; a pink and red dragon surrounding kanji <b>lettering</b> that translates to 'Trust No One' going down the right side of her torso; symbols on the small of her lower back; and a butterfly on her right hip. She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E
5|$|Tandy {{drew the}} inside {{sketches}} {{for the first}} 26 volumes of the series as well as painting the covers of the first 26 volumes {{with the exception of}} volume 11– the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover <b>lettering</b> and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|The Sandman is a {{comic book}} series written by Neil Gaiman and {{published}} by DC Comics. Its artists include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel, and Michael Zulli, with <b>lettering</b> by Todd Klein and covers by Dave McKean. Beginning with issue No. 47, it was placed under the Vertigo imprint. It {{tells the story of}} Dream of the Endless, who rules over the world of dreams. The original series ran for 75 issues from January 1989 to March 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that they}} are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The <b>lettering</b> opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, <b>lettering</b> can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The <b>lettering</b> must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|When the Rockets {{debuted in}} San Diego, their colors were green and gold. Road uniforms {{featured}} the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block <b>lettering.</b> This {{was the only}} uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.|$|E
