40|$|The genus Populus {{represents}} one of the most economically important groups of forest trees. It is composed by approximately 30 species used for wood and non-wood products, phytoremediation and biomass. Poplar is subjected to several biological and environmental threats although, compared to annual crops, we know far less about the genetic bases of biotic stress resistance. <b>Woolly</b> poplar <b>aphid</b> (Phloeomyzus passerinii) is considered a main pest of cultivated poplars in European and American countries. In this work we present two high density linkage maps in poplar obtained by a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach and the identification of QTLs involved in Ph. passerinii resistance. A total of 5, 667 polymorphic markers (5, 606 SNPs and 61 SSRs) identified on expressed sequences have been used to genotype 131 plants of an F 1 population P ×canadensis obtained by an interspecific mate between Populus deltoides (resistant to <b>woolly</b> poplar <b>aphid)</b> and Populus nigra (susceptible to <b>woolly</b> poplar <b>aphid).</b> The two linkage maps, obtained following the two-way pseudo-testcross mapping strategy, have been used to investigate the genetic bases of <b>woolly</b> poplar <b>aphid</b> resistance. One major QTL and two QTLs with minor effects (mapped on LGV, LGXVI and LG XIX) explaining the 65. 8 % of the genetic variance observed in the progeny in response to Ph. passerinii attack were found.

2500|$|Aphids {{are in the}} {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the Sternorrhyncha {{division of}} the order Hemiptera. Late 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon [...] "Homoptera" [...] to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (e.g., cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder Heteroptera containing {{a large group of}} insects known as the true bugs. Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank. The most recent authoritative classifications place all extant taxa into a single large family Aphididae. Despite their names, taxonomically, the <b>woolly</b> conifer <b>aphids</b> like the pine aphid, the spruce aphid, and the balsam <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> are not true aphids, but adelgids, and lack the cornicles of true aphids.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard fireblight (Erwinia amylovora), <b>woolly</b> apple <b>aphid</b> (Eriosoma lanigerum) and collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to <b>woolly</b> apple <b>aphid.</b> Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793. Much later it was shown that the cultivar was also very resistant to collar rot and a useful breeding parent for this resistance.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1960 The balsam <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> (Adelges piceae (Ratz)), an European pest of conifers, {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Pacific Northwest shortly after 1930. Control measures of a chemical, silvicultural, or biological nature have been proposed. However, present control methods are either too costly or do not result in satisfactory control of the aphid. Several insect species were reported as predaceous upon the balsam <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> in Europe, eastern Canada, and the Pacific Northwest. European predators of this pest have been imported into eastern Canada {{in an effort to}} find a satisfactory control measure. Several species of insects from Europe were imported into the Pacific Northwest from 1957 through 1959. Laricobius erichsonii was successful in becoming at least temporarily established in this region and was chosen for further study. The purpose of the thesis project was to obtain information on the establishment, life history, habits, and effectiveness of this beetle in Oregon and Washington. Studies were begun in May of 1958 and terminated in November of 1959. Two species of the genus Laricobius are indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. Franz has studied the life history and ecology of L. erichsonii in Europe, and Clark and Brown have made observations of establishment, spread, life history, habits, and effectiveness in eastern Canada. In 1958 and 1959, 10, 125 L. erichsonii, adults were collected in Czechoslovakia and sent to the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station in Portland, Oregon, for release in the Pacific Northwest. Predators were released either freely or in cages at eight different areas in Oregon and Washington. Temporary establishment occurred at all of the release areas regardless of varied weather and elevational differences. Some 52 larvae were collected and mounted on slides in 1959. Of these larvae, no first, one second, four third, and 47 fourth instars were present. First and second instar larvae tend to stay within the aphid's wax masses, while third and fourth instar larvae wander about the bark in search of food. Moulting was observed. At the various release areas, larvae were recovered from May 23 through August 26 of 1959 and adults from May 5 through September 2. Two pupae were laboratory-reared from five, field-collected fourth instar larvae. Under laboratory conditions, one fourth instar larva consumed or destroyed seven eggs and two adults in a period of one and one-half hours. L. erichsonii adults prefer aphid adults but attack other stages. Range of observed dispersal, a year following release, ranged from zero to 75 feet from the point of original release. A study was initiated at Benton-Lane, Oregon, to study the effectiveness of L. erichsonii in reducing balsam <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> populations. Trend of host populations was evaluated at approximately two week intervals on six unprotected and two protected (control) one-inch-square bark plots on a pole-sized grand fir surrounded by a six-foot-cube study cage. On the protected plots, the average aphid population increased from 31 to 131 individuals in the period from May 1 through November 23 of 1959, while on the unprotected plots it increased from 47 to 64 individuals. A t-test was calculated to see if the differences between protected and unprotected plot populations were significant. The t-value obtained was 4. 3, which showed that the differences were significant at the one per cent significance level. It is felt that populations of the balsam <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> will be greatly reduced when L. erichsonii can combine with other predators that are fairly host specific and that prey on all stages of the aphid...|$|R
40|$|The balsam <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid,</b> Adelges piceae (Ratz.), is an {{introduced}} pest of European origin.

Severe damage is caused by high numbers of aphids feeding in the crowns and on the stems of trees. In Newfoundland, rapid deterioration of tree crowns predominates; stem attack occurs infrequently and in widely dispersed spots (Carroll and Bryant, 1960).

The cypress aphid is becoming such a major pest in Kenya's forests that the search for likely predators has moved as far as the Rocky Mountains in America.
