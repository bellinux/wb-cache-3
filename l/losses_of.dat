40|$|This policy brief {{deals with}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{citizenship}} of the European Union (EU) {{due to the}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nationality of a Member State.

Due {{to the fact that}} Member States are in principle autonomous in nationality matters, their rules on <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> nationality, and implicitly <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the citizenship of the European Union, differ considerably.

RESULTS: <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> heterozygosity was found in 35. 3 % (18 of 51) of specimens and was detected more often in stage III and IV (50 %) than in stage I and II cancers (14. 3 %) (p < 0. 05).
