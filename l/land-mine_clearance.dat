From 1998 to 2011, donations amounted to €75.5million (17 {{percent of the total}} of €450million spent on demining during that period). Most donations were from foreign contributors, including NGOs and foreign governments (among them Japan, Germany, Monaco, Luxembourg and the United States). The European Union was also a significant contributor during that period, providing €20.7million. , the Croatian Mine Action Centre has been allocated approximately 400million kuna ( [...] 53million euros) a year for demining. An estimated further €500million (or more) will be needed to remove all remaining land mines from Croatia by 2019, the deadline for <b>land-mine</b> <b>clearance</b> set by the Ottawa Treaty. The Croatian Mine Action Centre spends approximately 500,000 kuna ( [...] 66,600 euros) a year to maintain minefield warning signs (including the replacement of stolen signs).|$|E

30|$|MAF {{constitutes}} {{a metaphor for}} a broad class of problems including robotic exploration, navigation, object identification, manipulation and transport. Cleaning, harvesting, search and rescue, <b>land-mine</b> <b>clearance</b> and planetary astrobiology are real world applications {{that could be considered}} as instances of foraging robots. Even if the sophisticated foraging observed in social insects provides both inspiration and system level models for artificial systems, foraging remains an active research problem for various reasons: most of the developed foraging systems are adapted to real world problems, they are in research laboratories for validation and mostly studied through simulation in Multi-Agent platforms like Netlogo used by Wilensky (1997) and Starlogo used by Resnick (1996), in robotic-based platforms like Swarmanoid of Dorigo et al. (2013) or through real robots with ARGoS in Pinciroli et al. (2012). The high complexity of foraging which requires a large number of skills tightly integrated within the physical robot, as stated by Winfield (2009).|$|E
