40|$|Organic {{farming is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} {{segments}} of U. S. agriculture. As consumer interest continues to gather momentum, many U. S. producers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are specializing in growing, processing, and marketing an ever-widening array of organic agricultural and food products. This report summarizes growth patterns in the U. S. organic sector in recent years, by market category, and describes various research, regulatory, and other ongoing programs on organic agriculture in the U. S.

5000|$|The scheme {{replaced}} eleven previous subsidy schemes {{which were}} based on the production of crops and/or <b>livestock</b> e.g. dairy <b>premium</b> and arable area payments scheme. Initially the payments had a bias towards paying producers who historically received the highest subsidies. The payment bias works on a sliding scale with a move away from historic payments towards land based payments with payments in 2012 having no historic element.|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{have been}} {{developing}} organic farming {{systems in the}} United States for decades. State and private institutions also began emerging during this period to set organic farming standards and provide third-party verification of label claims, and legislation requiring national standards was passed in the 1990 s. More U. S. producers are considering organic farming systems in order to lower input costs, conserve nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets, and boost farm income. Organic farming systems rely on practices such as cultural and biological pest management, and virtually prohibit synthetic chemicals in crop production and antibiotics or hormones in livestock production. This report updates U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates of land farmed with organic practices during 1992 - 94 with 1997 estimates, and provides new State- and crop-level detail. organic farming systems, organic certification, certified organic acreage and <b>livestock,</b> price <b>premiums,</b> nation organic rules, speciality agriculture, high-value crops, farmers' markets, Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|Azt vizsgÃ¡ltuk, hogy a kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÃ¶zÅ‘ mennyiségÅ±, zsÃ­r- és fehérjetartalmÃº tejet termelÅ‘ szarvasmarhafajtÃ¡k (holstein-frÃ­z, magyar tarka, jersey) esetében miképpen alakulnak a tejtermelés bevételei és kÃ¶ltségei, valamint azt, hogy a koncentrÃ¡ltabb tejért fizetett felÃ¡rak és a feldolgozÃ¡sukban jelentkezÅ‘ kÃ¶ltségmegtakarÃ­tÃ¡s milyen arÃ¡nyban Ã¡llnak egymÃ¡ssal. MegÃ¡llapÃ­thatÃ³ volt, hogy a tehenészetek mindhÃ¡rom fajtÃ¡nÃ¡l, a jelenlegi Ã¡rviszonyok mellett, némi jÃ¶vedelmet csak a kÃ¶ltségvetési tÃ¡mogatÃ¡soknak kÃ¶szÃ¶nhetÅ‘en érnek el. A tejtermelésben a fajtÃ¡k versenyképessége legpontosabban a termelési érték és a takarmÃ¡nykÃ¶ltség kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÃ¶zete alapjÃ¡n Ã­télhetÅ‘ meg, az egyéb kÃ¶ltségek tÃ¶bbségének alakulÃ¡sa ugyanis nem a fajtÃ¡tÃ³l fÃ¼ggÅ‘. A magyar tarka a tejtermelésben nem versenyképes az egyhasznÃº tejelÅ‘ fajtÃ¡kkal. A tÃ¶bb tejet termelÅ‘ holstein-frÃ­z és a koncentrÃ¡ltabb tejet adÃ³ jersey gazdasÃ¡gi mutatÃ³iban lényeges kÃ¼lÃ¶nbségek nincsenek, a jersey kevesebb, de drÃ¡gÃ¡bb takarmÃ¡nyt igényel. A tej feldolgozÃ¡sakor a tejipar a jersey egységnyi mennyiségÅ± koncentrÃ¡ltabb tejébÅ‘l tÃ¶bb vajat és sajtot tud elÅ‘Ã¡llÃ­tani, azonban az egy tehénre jutÃ³ termékmennyiség vonatkozÃ¡sÃ¡ban a fajtÃ¡nak kisebb az elÅ‘nye. A holstein-frÃ­z tejébÅ‘l készÃ¼lÅ‘ vaj és sajt gyÃ¡rtÃ¡sakor tÃ¶bb értékes melléktermék keletkezik. A magasabb zsÃ­rszÃ¡zalék utÃ¡n a tejipar Ã¡ltal fizetett felÃ¡r Ã¡ltalÃ¡ban nagyobb, a fehérjetartalom utÃ¡ni felÃ¡r viszont kisebb, mint a feldolgozÃ¡sban jelentkezÅ‘ kÃ¶ltségmegtakarÃ­tÃ¡s Ã¶sszege. A koncentrÃ¡ltabb tejet termelÅ‘ fajtÃ¡k nagyobb mértékÅ± elterjesztése a jelenlegi kÃ¶rÃ¼lmények kÃ¶zÃ¶tt nem jelent szÃ¡mottevÅ‘ elÅ‘nyt a hazai tejtermelésben. [...] We {{looked at}} the costs of and incomes from milk {{production}} {{in the event of}} cattle varieties (Holstein Fries, Hungarian Piebald, Jersey) producing different quantities of milk with different fat and protein content. We also {{looked at the}} relationship between the premium paid for more concentrated milk and the cost savings achievable in the course of its processing. If was found that at the current prices, dairy farms only make some profit thanks to the governmental subsidies, regardless of the cattle variety the keep. The competitiveness of dairy cattle varieties is best compares on the basis of differences in their production value and feed cost, as the majority of other costs does not depend on the variety. In terms of milk production, the Hungarian Piebald variety cannot compete with the single-purpose dairy cattle varieties. There are {{no significant differences between the}} economic parameters of Holstein Fries, which produces more milk, and Jersey, which produces more concentrated milk: Jerseys require less but more costly feed. When milk is processed, the dairy industry can produce more butter and cheese from one unit of the more concentrated milk produced by Jersey cows, but the advantage of this variety is smaller when expressed in terms of product quantity per cow. In the course of turning the milk of Holstein Fries cows into butter and cheese, various valuable by-products are obtained. The premium paid by the dairy industry for the higher fat content is generally higher, while the premium paid for the protein content is generally lower than the cost savings achieved in the course of processing. Under the current circumstances, increasing the share of varieties producing more concentrated milk would not provide significant advantage in the domestic milk production market. tejhozam, tejzsÃ­r, tejfehérje, tejfeldolgozÃ¡s, felÃ¡rak, milk yield, milk fat, milk protein, milk processing, <b>premiums,</b> <b>Livestock</b> Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|R
