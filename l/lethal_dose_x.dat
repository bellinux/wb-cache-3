No changes were observed in animals receiving sublethal <b>doses</b> of <b>X</b> ray.

40|$|Larvae of Galleria mellonella {{are useful}} models for {{studying}} the virulence of microbial pathogens or for evaluating the potency of antimicrobial agents. In this work we demonstrated that prior exposure of larvae to non-lethal doses of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia increases the resistance of larvae to a <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (1 <b>x</b> 107 20 μl- 1) 24 h later. Exposure of larvae to a conidia concentration of 1 x 104 20 μl- 1 leads {{to an increase in}} hemocyte density but an inoculum of 1 x 105 conidia leads to enhanced expression of antimicrobial peptides, increased binding of proteins (e. g., arylophorin, prophenoloxidase, apolipophorin) to conidia and elevated hemocyte density. These results suggest that a low dose of conidia (1 x 104) predominantly activates the cellular immune response but that a higher <b>dose</b> (1 <b>x</b> 105) that is still not lethal activates a humoral immune response to the greatest extent. While insects have an immune system analogous to the innate immune response of mammals these results suggest that it is capable of assessing the extent of the microbial challenge and mounting a ‘proportionate’ immune response which may have important survival advantages...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{monoclonal}} antibody LMBH 5 {{was derived from}} mice which had been immunized with A/Victoria/ 3 / 75 (H 3 Ng) -type recombinant, secreted hemagglutinin (HA), and were subsequently challenged with a potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of <b>X</b> 31 [A/Aichi/ 2 / 68 (H 3 N 2) × A/PR/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) ] virus. LMBH 5 reacted strongly with the native and low-pH-induced conformations of the HA of A/Aichi (X 31 strain) and A/Victoria (X 47 strain), but very weakly with the native structure of the HA of A/Philippines/ 2 / 82 (X 79 strain) {{and not at all}} with the HA of A/Guizhou/ 54 / 89 H 3 (NIB 25 strain). However, the acid-induced conformations of the latter two viruses were recognized by LMBH 5. The antibody prevented infection of MDCK cells with X 31 and X 47, whereas X 79 virus was partially neutralized by LMH 5. X 31 monoclonal escape variants had single amino acid substitutions (Ser 227 → Pro) near the interface. The data obtained suggest that the neutralizing LMBH 5 reacts with a fairly conserved epitope of influenza A (H 3 N 2) virus, which as a result of antigenic drift becomes inaccessible in the native state of the HA...|$|R
40|$|The {{small bowel}} (SB), an organ replete with lymphocytes, may provoke graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after {{transplantation}} (Tx). Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been suspected of mediating the tissue lesions of GVHD, {{we sought to}} determine whether TNF could be detected in the serum of rats undergoing GVHD after SBTx or lymphocyte transfer. For this purpose, postoperative serum TNF activity was determined in Lewis x Brown Norway (LBNF 1) hybrid rats suffering from GVHD after undergoing transplantation of an entire (group 1; n = 8) or a segmental (group 2; n = 4) Lew SB, or after i. p. injection with <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> (500 <b>x</b> 10 (6)) of Lew lymphocytes (group 3; n = 3). Control LBNF 1 received i. p. small <b>doses</b> (50 <b>x</b> 10 (6)) of Lew lymphocytes (group 4; n = 4). Serum TNF activity was assessed using the WEHI bioassay. In rats with acute and lethal GVHD after entire SBTx (group 1) or injection with large doses of lymphocytes (group 3), TNF activity gradually increased and reached high levels {{by the time the}} rats were agonal. In segmental SBTx rats (group 2), GVHD was less severe than in entire SBTx rats. Similarly, the increase in TNF activity was less intense and only transient since it had returned to control levels by the time the rats had completely recovered from GVHD. In control rats primed with small doses of lymphocytes (group 4), GVHD did not occur and no increase in TNF activity was detected. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Prophylactic {{administration}} of recombinant human interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) in mice enhanced survival and produced complete recovery from an otherwise lethal acute bacterial infection. IL- 2 was administered {{as a single}} intraperitoneal or intravenous bolus dose to CDI mice 18 h before challenge with a <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli type O 2 (minimal 100 % <b>lethal</b> <b>dose,</b> 6 <b>X</b> 10 (7) CFU per mouse). At IL- 2 dosages of 7 X 10 (6) U/kg, 90 % of treated CDI mice survived as compared to 0 % for the excipient buffer control animals (P less than 0. 001). This protective effect was also demonstrable in immune-deficient beige mice. The IL- 2 effect was dose dependent; protection was consistently observed in mice pretreated with IL- 2 at doses ranging from 1. 8 X 10 (6) to 7 X 10 (6) U/kg. However, at 3. 5 X 10 (5) U/kg the protective effect was more variable. The route of {{administration of}} IL- 2 was shown {{to play an important}} role; when IL- 2 and challenge bacteria were given by the same route (either intravenously or intraperitoneally), protection was readily observable, but when IL- 2 and challenge bacteria were given by different routes, little or no protective effect was observed. The protective effect was fully inducible as early as 1 h after IL- 2 administration and was effective against various strains of gram-negative bacteria, indicating that the probable mode of action represents control of the establishment of infection by increased activity of the nonspecific host defense mechanisms. The IL- 2 effect was abrogated by the administration of carrageenan, suggesting a possible role of macrophages. These data demonstrate that IL- 2 may be a potentially useful adjunct for the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in both clinical and veterinary medicine...|$|R
40|$|ST- 246 is a low-molecular-weight {{compound}} (molecular weight = 376), that is potent (concentration that inhibited {{virus replication}} by 50 % = 0. 010 microM), selective (concentration of compound that inhibited cell viability by 50 % = > 40 microM), and active against multiple orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, monkeypox, camelpox, cowpox, ectromelia (mousepox), and variola viruses. Cowpox virus variants selected in cell culture for resistance to ST- 246 {{were found to}} have a single amino acid change in the V 061 gene. Reengineering this change back into the wild-type cowpox virus genome conferred resistance to ST- 246, suggesting that V 061 is the target of ST- 246 antiviral activity. The cowpox virus V 061 gene is homologous to vaccinia virus F 13 L, which encodes a major envelope protein (p 37) required for production of extracellular virus. In cell culture, ST- 246 inhibited plaque formation and virus-induced cytopathic effects. In single-cycle growth assays, ST- 246 reduced extracellular virus formation by 10 fold relative to untreated controls, while having little effect on the production of intracellular virus. In vivo oral administration of ST- 246 protected BALB/c mice from lethal infection, following intranasal inoculation with 10 <b>x</b> 50 % <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD(50)) of vaccinia virus strain IHD-J. ST- 246 -treated mice that survived infection acquired protective immunity and were resistant to subsequent challenge with a <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (10 <b>x</b> LD(50)) of vaccinia virus. Orally administered ST- 246 also protected A/NCr mice from lethal infection, following intranasal inoculation with 40, 000 x LD(50) of ectromelia virus. Infectious virus titers at day 8 postinfection in liver, spleen, and lung from ST- 246 -treated animals were below the limits of detection (< 10 PFU/ml). In contrast, mean virus titers in liver, spleen, and lung tissues from placebo-treated mice were 6. 2 x 10 (7), 5. 2 x 10 (7), and 1. 8 x 10 (5) PFU/ml, respectively. Finally, oral administration of ST- 246 inhibited vaccinia virus-induced tail lesions in Naval Medical Research Institute mice inoculated via the tail vein. Taken together, these results validate F 13 L as an antiviral target and demonstrate that an inhibitor of extracellular virus formation can protect mice from orthopoxvirus-induced disease. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for Botrytis populations exposed to UV radiation to develop tolerance to the Trichodermametabolite 6 -pentyl-alpha-pyrone (6 -PAP) and the 6 -PAP analog massoialactone was determined using 14 different Botrytis isolates. There was significant isolate variation in germination of Botrytis conidia after UV exposure. Plating conidia onto sublethal doses of 6 -PAP yielded no 6 -PAP tolerant mutants. After UV irradiation, two Botrytis mutants grew on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP, while 59 mutants grew on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of massoialactone. 6 -PAP mutants were cross resistant to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of massoialactone, whereas massoialactone mutants {{were not able}} to grow on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP.

40|$|The role of {{superoxide}} anion (O 2 -) and nitric oxide (NO) {{in the host}} defense mechanism against Salmonella typhimurium (LT- 2) was examined by focusing on xanthine oxidase (XO) as an O 2 (-) -generating system and on inducible NO synthase (iNOS). When ICR mice were infected with a 0. 1 50 % <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (2 <b>x</b> 10 (5) CFU) of S. typhimurium, bacterial growth in the liver reached a peak value 3 days after infection (10 (4. 32) CFU/g of liver) and decreased thereafter. XO activity in the liver became maximum at 7 days after infection; the value was 34. 6 +/- 1. 4 mU/g of liver at 7 days (compared with 11. 0 +/- 1. 3 mU/g of liver before infection). The time profile of NO production in the liver as determined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy was consistent with that of XO activity. Histological examination of infected liver showed the formation of multiple microabscesses with granulomatous lesions consisting of polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells, and iNOS-expressing cells were localized in the confined areas of the microabscesses. When XO inhibitors such as allopurinol and 4 -amino- 6 -hydroxypyrazolo[3, 4 -d]pyrimidine (AHPP) were administered to the infected mice, the mortality of the mice was significantly increased (10 of 21 and 11 of 20 for the allopurinol- and AHPP-treated groups, respectively, versus 2 of 20 for control mice), and bacterial growth was significantly enhanced. A similar exacerbation of the infection was obtained with N(omega) -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) treatment of the mice. Of considerable importance is that granuloma formation in the liver was poorly developed by treatment with either XO inhibitors or L-NMMA. These results suggest that XO and NO {{play an important role}} in the antimicrobial mechanism against S. typhimurium in mice...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the 100 -kilobase (kb) plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium in the virulence of this organism for mice. Three strains, LT 2 -Z, SR- 11, and SL 1344, which possessed 100 -kb plasmids with identical restriction enzyme digestion profiles, were cured of their respective 100 -kb plasmids after Tnmini-tet was used to label plasmids. Curing wild-type virulent strains SR- 11 and SL 1344 raised peroral 50 % <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> from 3 <b>x</b> 10 (5) and 6 x 10 (4) CFU, respectively, to greater than 10 (8) CFU. Both wild-type strains had intraperitoneal 50 % <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of less than 50 CFU, whereas the intraperitoneal 50 % <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> for cured SR- 11 and SL 1344 were less than 50 and 400 CFU, respectively. Reintroduction of the Tnmini-tet-labeled, 100 -kb plasmid restored wild-type virulence. Invasion from Peyer's patches to mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens after peroral inoculation was the stage of pathogenesis most affected by curing S. typhimurium of the 100 -kb plasmid. Wild-type S. typhimurium replicated in spleens of mice inoculated intravenously {{to a greater extent than}} did plasmid-cured derivatives. Wild-type and cured strains equally adhered to and invaded Henle- 407, HEp- 2, and CHO cells; furthermore, the presence of the 100 -kb plasmid was not necessary for replication of S. typhimurium within CHO cells. The 100 -kb plasmid had no effect on phagocytosis and killing of S. typhimurium by murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, wild-type and plasmid-cured strains were resistant to killing by 90 % normal human, rabbit, and guinea pig sera. All wild-type and plasmid-cured S. typhimurium strains possessed complete lipopolysaccharide, as determined by silver staining solubilized cells in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. We have confirmed {{the role of the}} 100 -kb plasmid of S. typhimurium in virulence, primarily in invasion to mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens after peroral inoculation of mice. Involvement of the 100 -kb plasmid in infection of mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens suggests a role for the plasmid in the complex interaction of S. typhimurium with cells of the reticuloendothelial system...|$|R
