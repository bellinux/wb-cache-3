This work {{was devoted to}} check the effect of temperature (50 - 170 °C), time (0.5 - 4  hours), water content in the mixture (0 - 80 %) and pressure (0.1 - 3.2 MPa) in the dissolution of <b>legume</b> <b>straw.</b> At temperatures below 90 °C almost no water evaporation was observed due to possible strong interactions between water and [bmim][Cl]. For temperatures above 100 °C the vaporised steam condenses and is recycled in the liquid phase. It was demonstrated that dissolution was increased as temperature increases. The various periods of time applied in the pre-treatment {{had no effect on}} the dissolution. Pre-treatment performed at high pressures, such as 3.2 MPa, increased the <b>legume</b> <b>straw</b> dissolution while retaining the initial lignin content found in the original biomass [55]. A 20 % water content in the IL provided the best dissolution of <b>legume</b> <b>straw.</b> These results enabled an optimised pre-treatment at 150 °C for 2  hours under ambient pressure, with a maximum of a 29.1 wt% <b>legume</b> <b>straw</b> dissolved in the aqueous-[bmim][Cl] mixture with water content of 20 wt%. The optimised process demonstrated a lignin extraction of 48.2 % from the original lignin content in the <b>legume</b> <b>straw.</b> However, only 32.4 % was recovered by adding water as a precipitate solvent. The biomass regeneration provided cellulose with an amorphous structural conformation as occurred in pre-treatments with dried ILs [55]. The authors also evaluated the ability of aqueous-[bmim][Cl] mixture in dissolving cotton pulp and no dissolution was observed. It was assumed that a strong interaction between cellulose and IL may exist with a proper amount of water to promote the dissolution of biomass [55].|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{the easiest}} way to recover the IL is to {{evaporate}} the antisolvent after the regeneration process, although this process would finish with several impurities present in the IL, originated from the dissolved biomass [29, 34, 51, 55, 56, 63]. For instance, [bmim][Cl] was recycled by simple evaporation of water from the aqueous/IL solution obtained after separation of the regenerated <b>legume</b> <b>straw.</b> The yield of the recycled [bmim][Cl] varied from 94 % to 98 %. However, a large quantity of impurities were determined, which changed the colourless initial IL to an amber colour for the recovered IL [55]. To overcome this limitation, sophisticated recovery processes were developed. Li et al. studied the [emim][DEP] recovery using two different antisolvents, namely water and methanol [91]. The liquid stream after regeneration was washed several times with diethyl ether. During washings, salt was formed and then dissolved in chloroform/methanol mixture. Subsequently, the remaining liquid was passed through a column filled with neutral activated alumina and the mixture solvent was then evaporated to obtain the recovered [emim][DEP]. The yield of the recycled IL using methanol as antisolvent was higher (96 %) than that observed in the case of water (91 %), although the amount of the regenerated biomass was lower with methanol [91]. Tan et al. used [emim][ABS] for pre-treatment and NaOH aqueous solution as the antisolvent, which resulted in a total mass of IL recovery between 96.1 % and 99.4 % demonstrating a good recovery potential and high final purity [78]. Here the IL solution was neutralised and water removed by evaporation resulting in collecting IL and NaCl as precipitated solids. Acetonitrile was added to dissolve selectively the IL, while NaCl remained as a solid to be filtrated in the next step. The IL was finally recovered by acetonitrile evaporation [78]. Lan et al. also performed a similar IL recovery process for [bmim][Cl] [93].|$|E

Assessment of the {{nutritive value}} of cereal and legume straws based on {{chemical}} composition and in vitro digestibility. Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 85, (9), 1550 - 1557 Keywords: cereal straw ? <b>legume</b> <b>straw</b> ? nutritive value ? gas production ? in vitro digestibility ? extent of degradation Sponsorship: DEFRAThe nutritive value of 17 straws was determined {{on the basis}} of their chemical composition, in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility and rumen fermentation kinetics (from gas production curves measured in vitro). Five roughages were from the cereal species Avena sativa (oat), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Secale cereale (rye), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Zea mays (maize stover). The other 12 samples were legume straws, two samples from each of the species Cicer arietinum (chickpea), Lens culinaris (lentil) and Phaseolus vulgaris (bean) and one sample from each of the species Lathyrus sativus (chickling vetch), Lupinus albus (white lupin), Pisum sativum (field pea), Vicia articulata (one-flowered vetch), Vicia ervilia (bitter vetch) and Vicia sativa (common vetch). All samples were collected after harvesting from different farms located in Le?n (northwestern Spain). Based on their chemical composition, digestibility and gas production characteristics, species could be clustered into two groups with a significant linkage distance, one for cereal straws that merged at a level of similarity of 80 % and the other for legume straws with a degree of similarity of 50 %. Species varied widely and significant differences (P < 0. 05) were observed between the two groups of straws. Legume straws showed higher crude protein (74 ? 6. 1 vs 29 ? 2. 2 g kg- 1 DM) and lower fibre (584 ? 18. 1 vs 793 ? 27. 5 g neutral detergent fibre kg- 1 DM) contents than cereal straws and, consequently, DM digestibility coefficients (0. 670 vs 0. 609; standard error of difference 0. 0054) and metabolisable energy values (7. 4 ? 0. 15 vs 5. 7 ? 0. 24 MJ kg- 1 DM) were significantly greater in legume than in cereal straws.

40|$|Poor feed {{utilisation}} {{and seasonal}} feed availability are considered contributory factors leading to less-than-optimal livestock productivity on smallholder farms in Babati, Tanzania. Cereal and legume crop residues, such as dry or green maize stover and bean haulms, are commonly fed to livestock {{but are also}} of low quality and they are poorly used by farmers. Improving the efficiency with which the crop residues {{can be used as}} animal feed appears the first step towards solving critical feed shortage. Studies on maize crop residue uses and trade-offs on smallholder crop-livestock farmers have proven on an economic perspective that it is logical to prioritise its use for feed over soil fertility management. A study was conducted to assess availability of types, quantity and quality of crop residues and other feed resources for livestock on farms. The study aimed to understand how cereal and legume crop residues are harvested, stored, processed and used in different farms. It also aimed to identity gaps in managing crop residues in intensified systems and factors that may affect adoption. Post-harvest forage processing technologies such as feed choppers offer potential to enhance use of crop residues for livestock feeding. This not only reduces feed wastage but also enhances feed intake and quality. It also has potential to improve quantity and quality of manure. Following the study a feed chopping technology to enhance utilisation was introduced to farmers. The findings showed that the average household tropical livestock unit (TLU) is 3. 8 (se = 0. 15). Crop residues are the major contributor to livestock diet in the dry season. The most dominant cereal crop residues are maize stover (57 %) and rice straw (20 %) while the most common <b>legumes</b> <b>straws</b> are pigeon pea (4 %); bean (12 %), groundnut (5 %) and cowpea (2 %) haulms. On average the maize stover yield on farms is 9. 3 t ha- 1 (se = 0. 28). There is a lot of feed waste on farms due to chopping by using a machete. Yield of maize stover from a hectare of land can sustain one TLU of livestock for 247 days. United States Agency for International Developmen...|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{production}} activities among small-scale farmers of semi-arid (Agro-ecological zone 1) and sub-humid (Agro-ecological zone 2) areas of Zambia are integrated with crop {{production activities}} {{in what is}} termed as crop/livestock farming system. This is a closed system in which production of one enterprise depends on the other. In Zambia, crop production depends on draught animals for tillage of cropping area, animal manure for fertilisation of crops while livestock depend on crop residues for dry season feeding. Good quality grass is generally available in adequate amounts to support reasonable level of livestock productivity during the rainy season. But livestock rely on low quantity and poor quality, highly fibrous perennial grass from veld and fibrous crop residues during the dry season. These resources are inadequate to support optimum livestock productivity activities. Poor nutrition results in low rates of reproduction and production as well as increased susceptibility to diseases. With the increasing human population cropping land is expanding, leading to increased production of crop residues. This has however, reduced the grazing land available for ruminant production. In Zambia large quantities of crop residues (stovers, husks and <b>straws,</b> <b>legume</b> tops and hulls, sugar cane tops, cassava leaves, potato vines, etc.) are left in the field where they are wasted each year because small-scale farmers lack the knowledge {{on how best to}} use them. There is a need to find ways to reverse this situation by adapting known and workable technologies to local conditions and by introducing new approaches for improving the use of crop residues and poor quality fibrous feeds. Efforts should also be made to enlarge feed resource base. The technologies should be simple and effective. In the presence of a dynamic market system, livestock production in a crop/livestock system could be intensified and made profitable for small-scale farmers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of high fiber (NDF, ADF) forages on DM intake, digestibility and production using lactating cattle and steers. In vitro and in situ experiments explored the effect of inoculants, inoculant/enzyme, and various combinations of fibrolytic enzymes on DM disappearance, cell wall composition and changes in Cornell carbohydrate and protein degradation fractions. Cell walls of grasses contain high proportions of polysaccharides of low digestive value. The degradation of these cell walls by the rumen microbes is slow and incomplete especially in high fiber forages. Feed additives or processing that facilitate a faster breakdown of the forage cell walls may also increase the rumen turnover rate and the efficiency of feed utilisation through reduced grain supplementation. In the first experiment (chapter three) the feed intake and milk production potential of two napier grass varieties were evaluated. The possibility of using an all crop LAB inoculant in conserving napier grass as silage, was investigated using a late-cut barley silage crop, characterized by high ADF and NDF as a model. The preceding led to the use of a combined LAB inoculant and a fibrolytic enzyme additive on both early and late-cut barley. We also performed several experiments (chapter six and seven) whose main objective was to increase the DM solubility, reduce cell wall fractions and study the effect of enzymes on Cornell carbohydrate and protein fractions in various alfalfa hay, grass hay, barley silage, oat straw and fenugreek hay and straw. Overall the results from all the experiments showed that treating of high fiber (ADF and NDF) forages with inoculants or inoculant/enzyme products did not significantly alter their ensiling or feeding value. Animal performance (DM intake, digestibility and milk yield and composition) was not significantly improved when animals were fed inoculant or inoculant/enzyme treated forages. The use of combinations of various fibrolytic enzymes (additives) reduced the cell wall fractions ADF and NDF in both legume hay, grass hay, cereal silage and <b>legume</b> and cereal <b>straws.</b> These enzymes enhanced more DM disappearance in temperate grasses than in tropical grasses. Fibrolytic enzymes decreased the rapidly degradable protein and unavailable carbohydrate fractions but increased the rapidly degradable and the total available carbohydrate fractions. The causes of the inconsistencies in enzyme treatments on barley silage compared to alfalfa hay or other forages was elucidated by significant shifts in the Cornell carbohydrate and protein degradability fractions of treated forages. The use of fibrolytic enzymes as direct-fed additives or in ensiling forages holds the future for improving both the preservation and digestibility of both tropical and temperate high fiber forages.
