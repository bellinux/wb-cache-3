50|$|SDI was an {{extremely}} ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting <b>laser</b> <b>battle</b> <b>stations,</b> space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray lasers were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|R
50|$|Approved for {{acquisition}} by the Pentagon during 1991 {{but never}} realized, Brilliant Pebbles was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic {{system that was}} meant to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large <b>laser</b> <b>battle</b> <b>stations</b> and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites.It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 March 1983, President Ronald Reagan {{announced}} a new national missile defense program formally called the Strategic Defense Initiative but soon nicknamed [...] "Star Wars" [...] by detractors. President Reagan's stated goal was not just to protect the U.S. and its allies, but to also provide the completed system to the USSR, thus ending {{the threat of nuclear}} war for all parties. SDI was technically very ambitious and economically very expensive. It would have included many space-based <b>laser</b> <b>battle</b> <b>stations</b> and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites designed to intercept hostile ICBMs in space, along with very sophisticated command and control systems. Unlike the previous Sentinel program, the goal was to totally defend against a robust, all out nuclear attack by the USSR.|$|R
50|$|The {{events of}} Winter Hawk {{transpire}} {{over a few}} days in which the Soviet Union will launch into orbit {{the first in a series}} of <b>laser</b> <b>battle</b> <b>stations,</b> the existence of which they have kept a closely guarded secret. The launch is meant to coincide with the signing of a new and apparently groundbreaking treaty dramatically reducing nuclear weapons to be kept by both sides, but excluding space based weapons such as the one the Soviets will be launching, mostly because none are known to exist. The Americans know of the weapon because a Soviet technician named Philip Kedrov has been supplying them information, operating under the code-name “Cactus Plant”. The Soviet space weapon places the Americans in a painful dilemma: they can neither sign a treaty that will dramatically cede the balance of power to the Soviet Union, nor can they back out of the treaty lacking proof of the Soviet weapon. The only alternative is a deep cover extraction mission of Kedrov and his evidence from the Soviet’s space launch complex, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The mission, involving two stolen Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters to be flown by CIA pilots — one of whom is CIA pilot Mitchell Gant — is codenamed “Winter Hawk”.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} Jimmy Carter's presidency, and {{continued}} strongly through the subsequent presidency of Ronald Reagan, the United States rejected disarmament and tried to restart the arms race through the production of new weapons and anti-weapons systems. The central part of this strategy was the Strategic Defense Initiative, a space based anti-ballistic missile system derided as [...] "Star Wars" [...] by its critics. However, the SDI would require technology {{that had not yet}} been developed, or even researched. This system would require both space and earth based <b>laser</b> <b>battle</b> <b>stations.</b> It would also need sensors on the ground, in the air, and in space with radar, optical, and infrared technology to detect incoming missiles. [...] During {{the second part of the}} 1980s, the Soviet economy was stagnating and unable to match American arms spending. The Soviets feared the SDI because the U.S. would have an edge if it ever came to nuclear war. Numerous negotiations by Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to come to agreements on reducing nuclear stockpiles, but the most radical were rejected by Reagan as they would also prohibit his SDI program. However, due to enormous costs and far too complex technology for its time, the project and research was cancelled.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> program in July 1996 into the recruit training pipeline at Recruit Training Center Great Lakes, it has received much publicity and many accolades from notable military and civilian leaders. They claim the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> has advanced recruit training farther and has meet the changing cultural environment of recruits and the Navy better than any other training program in recent history. The Navy also declares <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> as a rite of passage for Sailors, similar to the Marine Corps' recruit training event, the Crucible. This thesis examines the creation, implementation, and outputs of the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> program to determine its overall effectiveness as a training program as a rite of passage. Literature reviews on instructional systems design and rites of passage were conducted to compare it to the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> program. As a result, <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> was determined to be questionable as a functional training program with little background research performed on design and implementation rationale, and minimally effective as a rite of passage. The Navy should conduct a formal training analysis utilizing models and criteria presented to this thesis to properly determine what changes should be conducted or even if a Battle Stations-type program is needed to meet the Navy's boot camp concerns.
