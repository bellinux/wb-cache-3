This population study of healthy subjects evaluated the changes in overweight/obesity prevalence in 2003, compared with 1993, and determined the association of age, sex and <b>leisure-time</b> <b>activity</b> with body mass index (BMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI). Design Two transversal samples of convenience. Participants Healthy volunteers (1993, n= 802; 2003, n= 1631). Methods Fat-free mass was determined using the bioelectrical impedance multiple regression equation. Multivariable linear regression, including confounding variables (age, sex, <b>leisure-time</b> <b>activity),</b> was used to model the body composition evolution between the 1993 and the 2003 subjects. Results BMI and FMI were higher in 2003 than in 1993, P< 0. 001. FFMI was not higher in 2003 than in 1993, P= 0. 38. More subjects were overweight/obese in 2003 than in 1993 (27. 5 versus 17. 2 %, chi-square P< 0. 001), and had a high FFMI (30. 2 versus 21. 8 %, chi-square P< 0. 001) and high FMI (28. 0 versus 20. 3 %, chi-square P< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} {{is known to}} have health benefits across population groups. However, less is known about changes over time in socioeconomic differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> and the reasons for the changes. We hypothesised that class differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> would widen over time due to declining physical activity among the lower occupational classes. We examined whether occupational class differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> change over time in a cohort of Finnish middle-aged women and men. We also examined whether a set of selected covariates could account for the observed changes. Methods The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort mail surveys; the respondents were 40 - 60 -year-old employees of the City of Helsinki at baseline in 2000 - 2002 (n = 8960, response rate 67 %). Follow-up questionnaires were sent to the baseline respondents in 2007 (n = 7332, response rate 83 %). The outcome measure was <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity,</b> including commuting, converted to metabolic equivalent tasks (MET). Socioeconomic position was measured by occupational class (professionals, semi-professionals, routine non-manual employees and manual workers). The covariates included baseline age, marital status, limiting long-lasting illness, common mental disorders, job strain, physical and mental health functioning, smoking, body mass index, and employment status at follow-up. Firstly the analyses focused on changes over time in age adjusted prevalence of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> Secondly, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for covariates of changes in occupational class differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> Results At baseline there were no occupational class differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> Over the follow-up <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> increased among those in the higher classes and decreased among manual workers, suggesting the emergence of occupational class differences at follow-up. Women in routine non-manual and manual classes and men in the manual class tended to be more often physically inactive in their leisure-time (30 MET hours/week) than those in the top two classes. Adjustment for the covariates did not substantially affect the observed occupational class differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> at follow-up. Conclusions Occupational class differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> emerged over the follow-up period among both women and men. <b>Leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> needs to be promoted among ageing employees, especially among manual workers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{socioeconomic}} differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> One explanation may be socioeconomic differences in relevant psychosocial conditions. The Malmö Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective cohort study including inhabitants in Malmö, Sweden. The baseline questionnaire used in this cross-sectional study was completed by the 11, 837 participants born 1926 - 1945 in 1992 - 1994. <b>Leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> was measured by an item presenting a variety of activities. These activities were aggregated into a summary measure of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> that takes both the intensity and duration of each specific activity into consideration. The effects of the psychosocial variables on the socioeconomic differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> were calculated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The quartile with the lowest degree of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> was not evenly distributed between the socioeconomic groups. Socioeconomic differences were seen as odds ratios 1. 5 for skilled and 1. 5 for unskilled male manual workers, compared to the high level non-manual employees. An OR 1. 6 was observed for female unskilled manual workers. Self-employed men and female pensioners also had a significantly increased risk of low <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> Adjustment for age, country of origin and previous/current diseases {{had no effect on}} these SES differences. Finally, adjusting for social participation almost completely erased the SES differences. Among the psychosocial variables, social participation was the strongest predictor of low physical activity, and a strong predictor for socioeconomic differences in low <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> Social participation measures the individual's social activities in, for example political parties and organisations. It therefore seems possible that some of the socioeconomic differences in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> are due to differing social capital between socioeconomic groups.

Men were classified into four classes of occupational activity. Among 1, 158 men with complete data, those who participated in any heavy-intensity <b>leisure-time</b> <b>activity</b> had reduced odds of CMD 5 years later (below median vs. none: adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) = 0. 61, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 40, 0. 93); median or above vs. none: OR(adj) = 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 35, 0. 83).

Long-term sickness absence (LTSA) spells of ≥ 3 consecutive weeks were retrieved from a social-transfer payment register from 2005 to 2007. Results 341 men and 620 females experienced a spell of LTSA during the period. Cox analyses adjusted for age, gender, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, chronic disease, social support from immediate superior, emotional demands, social class and occupational or <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> showed a decreased risk for LTSA among workers with moderate (HR 0. 85, CI 0. 72 to 1. 01) and high (HR 0. 77, CI 0. 62 to 0. 95) <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> in reference to those with low <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity.</b> In contrast, an increased risk for LTSA was shown among workers with moderate (HR 1. 59, CI 1. 35 to 1. 88) and high (HR 1. 84, CI 1. 55 to 2. 18) occupational physical activity referencing those with low occupational physical activity.

The overall prevalence of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> was 30. 2 %, being 20. 2 % amongst participants of low socioeconomic status, 25. 4 % in the medium and 40. 6 % in the high socioeconomic status group. A greater perception of social cohesion was associated with increased <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> only amongst participants of the lowest socioeconomic status even after adjusting for individual characteristics. The results demonstrate the importance of social cohesion for the promotion of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> in economically disadvantaged groups, supporting the need to stimulate interventions for enhancing social relationships in this population...|$|R
40|$|The study {{purpose was}} to examine the strength, {{direction}} and shape of the associations of environmental perceptions with recreational walking and leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, using pooled data from four study sites (Baltimore [USA], Seattle [USA], Adelaide [Australia] and Ghent [Belgium]). Moreover, site- and gender-specificity of the associations were examined. In total, 6014 adults (20 – 65 years, 55. 7 % women) completed the Neighborhood Environmental Walkability Scale and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Both a ‘recreational walking-friendliness’ index and a ‘leisure-time activity friendliness’ index had a positive linear association with recreational walking and leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, respectively. The associations were significant in all study sites except Ghent. Present findings were clearly site-specific, imposing possible challenges for built environment recommendations. In Belgium, interventions to promote <b>leisure-time</b> <b>activity</b> may need to target promotion of existing opportunities rather than built environment improvements...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to identify factors associated with happiness in the elderly. A cross-sectional, population-based {{study was conducted in}} 1, 431 elderly under the ISA-Camp 2008 project. The survey used a two-stage probabilistic cluster sample. Prevalence of happiness was measured over time according to socio-demographics variables, health behaviors, and health conditions. High prevalence of happiness was associated with: marital status (married), active working, activity and insufficient <b>leisure-time</b> <b>activity,</b> occasional consumption of alcoholic beverages, daily consumption of fruit, vegetables, and leafy vegetables, normal body mass index, and sleeping less than 10 hours/night and sleeping well. The highest prevalence of long-term happiness was observed among elderly with no reported illness, with better self-rated health, and with less disability. Happiness was strongly related to health indicators, suggesting the adequacy of complementary use of this indicator for evaluating health promotion programs in the elderly...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research in this dissertation {{is the development of}} a model of behavioral change specific for the prediction and explanation of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> behavior. The new model has to be applicable as the theoretical foundation of the GALM behavioral change strategy. In this strategy, sedentary older adults aged 55 - 65 are stimulated to participate in <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activities.</b> The research in this thesis can be subdivided into three parts. The first part consists of theoretical research on <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> in relation to behavioral change. The second part consists of the development of instruments necessary to identify sedentary older adults and to measure the determinants of <b>leisure-time</b> physical <b>activity</b> behavior. The third part consists of evaluation research into the potential validity of the new behavioral change model and a discussion of these initial results. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|R
