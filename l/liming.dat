For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate.

In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of <b>liming</b> rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional {{regulation}} is fundamental for the precise development of all organisms. Through tight regulation, necessary genes are activated at proper {{spatial and temporal}} patterns, while unnecessary genes are repressed. A large family of regulator proteins that have been demonstrated {{to be involved in}} various developmental processes by activation and repression of target genes is the homeodomain family of proteins. To date, the function of many of these homeoproteins has been elucidated in diverse species. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the function of these proteins has not been fully understood. In this study, the molecular mechanism of the function of a LIM-homeoprotein, <b>Lim</b> 1, was examined. In addition to the homeodomain, <b>Lim</b> 1 contains two <b>LIM</b> domains that are highly conserved among species. This high conservation along with data from in vitro studies on Xenopus <b>Lim</b> 1 suggests that the <b>LIM</b> domains might be important for the function of <b>Lim</b> 1 as a transcriptional regulator. Here, the functional importance of the <b>LIM</b> domains of <b>Lim</b> 1 was determined by using a novel gene-targeting strategy in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. A cre-loxP system was used in conjunction with the unique genomic organization of <b>Lim</b> 1 to obtain four types of mutant ES cell lines that would allow for the in vivo analysis of the function of both the <b>LIM</b> domains of <b>Lim</b> 1 together and also singularly. These four mutant <b>Lim</b> 1 alleles either contained base-pair changes at the <b>LIM</b> encoding exons that alters zinc-binding amino acids of the <b>LIM</b> domains or contained only exogenous loxP sequences in the first intron of <b>Lim</b> 1, which serves as the control allele. These mutations in the <b>LIM</b> domains would presumably abolish the zinc-finger tertiary structure of the domain and thus render the domain non-functional. Mice carrying mutations at both the <b>LIM</b> domains of <b>Lim</b> 1, L 1 L 2, die around E 10 without anterior head structures anterior to rhombomere 3, identical in phenotype to the <b>Lim</b> 1 null mutants in spite of the presence of mutant <b>Lim</b> 1 RNA. This result demonstrates that the integrity of both the <b>LIM</b> domains are essential for the function of <b>Lim</b> 1. This is further supported by the phenotype of mice carrying mutation at only the second <b>LIM</b> domain of <b>Lim</b> 1, L 2. The L 2 mice although still carrying one intact <b>Lim</b> 1 <b>LIM</b> domain, also die in utero. The L 2 mice die at varying times, from around E 8 to E 10 with anterior defects in addition to other axial defects which have yet to be fully characterized. The results of this study so far demonstrates that the integrity of both <b>LIM</b> domains are required for the function of <b>Lim</b> 1. ...|$|R

25|$|Potamogeton polygonifolius is {{tolerant}} of acid conditions and therefore {{has not been}} affected by the widespread acidification of upland habitats in Britain. However, in very acidified pools in Holland (pH < 5), catchment <b>liming</b> increased the abundance of this and other threatened species.

25|$|For {{many generations}} {{the main source}} of {{employment}} in the parish was agriculture. The village lands were divided into two parts—infield and outfield. The infield was cultivated for the growing of crops and the outfield was pasture. Crops grown included wheat, barley and peas. Turnips were a successful later addition. The scrubland and clay soil of the parish meant lots of hard work re-claiming land, drainage work, and <b>liming.</b> Wheat and barley were taken by cart to Dalkeith, Peebles and Melrose for the making of bread and beer, and carts returning from Dalkeith brought lime for the soil.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, {{introduced}} CaCO3 {{into the}} Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts. His {{hope was that}} the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it did {{increase the amount of}} aluminium ions {{in the area of the}} brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that CaCO3 can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water. Since the 1970s, such <b>liming</b> has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|Serial {{manufacturing}} of the WS-10 {{and integration}} with the J-11, {{proved to be}} more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the Washington Times suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions. Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, Shenyang <b>Liming</b> Aircraft Engine Company employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures. Several subsequent batches temporarily reverted to the original, Russian AL-31F turbofans. The engines manufacturing problems had finally been solved by the end of 2009 and the WS-10A had reportedly proved mature enough to power the Block 02 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The earl was an enthusiast for canal building, {{which would}} allow for {{agricultural}} improvement on his Petworth estates by bringing in chalk from Houghton for <b>liming,</b> and coal to replace scarce supplies of firewood, releasing more land for food production. The first venture was the Rother Navigation, making the River Rother navigable to Midhurst. Failing, {{during the time of}} Canal Mania, to find any reliable contractor able to undertake the construction most of the work was done by the earl's own estate workers. Starting from Stopham the Navigation reached Petworth in 1795 and Midhurst in 1796. A branch to Haslingbourne, south of Petworth, was then built, known as the Petworth Canal. This was originally intended to be extended north to link to the River Wey, but following unfavourable surveys the plan was abandoned when the cost of locks needed to reach the north side of Petworth proved prohibitive.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} {{persistent}} sandbars in the Camel estuary: the Doom Bar; the Town Bar at Padstow, about [...] upstream; and the Halwyn Bank just upstream of Padstow, where the estuary changes direction. All three are of similar composition; {{a large proportion}} of their sediment is derived from marine mollusc shells, and as a consequence it includes a high level of calcium carbonate, measured in 1982 at 62 per cent. The high calcium carbonate content of the sand has meant that it has been used for hundreds of years to improve agricultural soil by <b>liming.</b> This use is known to date back to before 1600. High calcium carbonate levels combined with natural sea salt made the sand valuable to farmers as an alkaline fertiliser when mixed with manure.|$|E

2500|$|Many British {{soils are}} quite acidic, {{and a large}} {{proportion}} of British farm land needs repeated applications of alkalines (traditionally lime) to remain fertile. [...] Nitrites are soluble, so rain rapidly carries them away. [...] Acid rain increases soil acidity, but even normal rain tends to be slightly acid, increasing the natural acidity of British soil. [...] Rainfall in Britain exceeds the rate of evaporation. [...] This means that in freely drained areas, soil base material is washed away, which leads to a higher concentration of organic acids in the ground. [...] This relatively high soil acidity is one of the factors that lead to <b>liming.</b> [...] Lime tends to counteract soil acidity, and with fine particulate soils such as clays, also encourages the formation of a better soil crumb structure that will aerate and help with drainage.
