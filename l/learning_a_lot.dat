The radio personality Robb Wilton acknowledged <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> from him, {{and although he}} felt that Robey [...] "was not very funny", he could time a comic situation perfectly. Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey [...] "still didn't make me laugh," [...] although he described him as [...] "a legend" [...] whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's [...] "droll like humour" [...] and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and Grock's clowning. Cotes wrote: [...] "His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest." ...|$|E
500|$|Defending Flynn's personality, Levi {{explained}} that [...] "Deep down, Flynn {{has a good}} core, although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity, love and naiveté of Rapunzel." [...] The actor concluded that [...] "These are two very different characters that end up <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> from each other on a rather crazy adventure." [...] According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, Flynn [...] "teaches [...] about courage". Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character's relationship with Rapunzel as a [...] "partners-in-crime sort of chemistry, filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own." [...] Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name, Eugene Fitzherbert, which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as [...] "more humane". Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn [...] "a charismatic bad boy", comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks' [...] (2003). Similarly, The New York Times Brooks Barnes felt that [...] "Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney, and Flynn ... is glib {{in a way that}} many people now associate with DreamWorks." [...] On Flynn's thievery, Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character [...] "only steals because he's basically a nice-guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities". According to Tison Pugh, author of The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, Flynn [...] "amalgamates the comedy-action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn, layering them over a fairy-tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film's setting", while serving as a source of comic relief at times. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries [...] "most of the [...] modern humor". Likewise, Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film's [...] "main source of action, humour and, eventually, romance".|$|E
