The standardisation of other units of measurement also made some progress since the 15th century, but at a different pace.

Standardisation is commonly put forward as a means to reduce variability and improve quality. It is also expected to embody a base-line for improvement. A great deal of the criticism of lean production is associated with standardisation. Main concerns are that it could lead to monotony and intensification of work. The main question of the paper is: how does an increasing <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> affect the psychosocial work environment of production workers? A total of 48 production workers from three Swedish production companies participated in a survey.

Examining the characteristics of the service technologies and related industries, this study focuses on the structure, participants and roles <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> the layers within the emerging mobile remote physiological monitoring industry. The study concludes that the structure of the emerging mobile remote physiological monitoring industry will be oriented about service provision, be integrated with other personal / patient data storage services and be heavily influenced by the interplay of technological developments, the health market structure, existing players and regulation. Additionally, the keys players are likely to be the system integrators and service providers concentrating on large institutional customers. A focus of the paper is analysing both the causes and implications of a modular, horizontally layered industry structure likely to result from the mix of technologies, suppliers and customers as this market develops. The paper discusses why, although horizontal specialisation is the most likely outcome, there is little risk of key layers becoming commoditised.

Consequently the rates of job mobility are higher in less standardized educational systems. The educational standardization defining occupations as bundles of specific skills can be viewed as a means of facilitating the labour market matching by reducing the transaction costs for the employer as well as the individual looking for a job. At the same time this means a high risk of losing one’s investment in vocational education to an occupational change as the specific skills and certificates might not be transferable to other occupations, leading to poorer job opportunities.|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} industry is urged {{to improve its}} production processes on different aspects. Building is to become: less expensive, more qualitative, less damaging {{to the environment and}} less exhaustive for construction workers. The use of robot technology is one of the possibilities {{that can be used to}} improve production on these aspects. However the current commercial robots have short comings that make them difficult or impossible to use in today's construction processes. One of the problems is the programming of robots. Because of the lack of repetition in construction processes, robot programs are often single use programs that have to be rewritten for each robot task. The costs of robot programming using today's programming methods are too high. This paper describes how an approach called task instruction can be used for construction robots. Task instructions are high level building instruction such as 'build garage' or 'spray ceiling coating'. The hypothesis is that robot operation plans can be generated from generic task knowledge together with project specific design and engineering information. However this requires certain <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> building tasks and storage of informatio...|$|R

Comparisons were based on both ecological and financial parameters relevant for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in Germany. Parameters include recently developed multimetric assessment indices, their stream type specific core metric results, time effort and costs. While RIVPACS and MAS sorting produced similar results in terms of ecological assessment, time effort and costs, Live-sorting differed notably in all three respects.

To offer apprenticeships, SMEs must therefore be able to rely on framework conditions {{that allow them to}} use apprentices {{with a high degree of}} flexibility in the work process and do not require them to employ apprentices as skilled workers after the apprenticeship period (otherwise, firms would not be able to offer new apprenticeship positions). Moreover, flexibility for firms would have to be paired with a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> in training contents and curricula (at least at the national level) and external skills certification. Such measures would guarantee that apprentices can use their skills with other employers in the labour market, independent of where they completed their apprenticeships. As a result, apprenticeships would gain in attractiveness, which is important because otherwise potentially qualified apprentices may opt for other educational tracks if their expected return to enrolling in an apprenticeship programme is not sufficiently high. At the same time, particularly small firms would become more desirable apprenticeship providers for talented school leavers and other potential apprentices.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of Palaeolithic symbolic material culture {{has often been}} taken {{as an indication of}} cognitive complexity, which limits interpretations to rare, late and localised events. This thesis develops an alternative method of interpretation through an empirical and psychologically supported chain of inference which avoids these limitations. It tests a hypothesis which predicts that material culture produced by varying methods of social learning will differ in their range of relative morphological variability due to varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> copy error. For Palaeolithic assemblages, high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> might only be possible with the high fidelity transmission involved in complex social learning methods which utilise theory of mind (the ability to think about thoughts). Theory of mind, in turn, is highly correlated to linguistic ability; as both these abilities are gradient, using theory of mind as a proxy for language ability means Palaeolithic communities can be attributed with not just a binary presence or absence of language, but semantic and syntactic abilities which correlate with stages of theory of mind acquisition in modern humans. This thesis presents a knapping experiment where participants replicate model handaxes in different simulated social learning environments. Results show that different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> morphological variation in the tools they produce support that high fidelity social learning methods produce a lower range of morphological variability. Results suggest that the origins of language lie somewhere before the origins of Acheulean technology, and that teaching and grammatical language were in the behavioural repertoires of Middle Palaeolithic hominins...|$|R
40|$|Special Issue:Disaster risk {{reduction}} for natural hazards: Putting research into practiceEarly warning systems (EWS) are extensive systems that integrate different components of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) for {{the provision of}} timely warnings to minimise loss of life, and to reduce economic and social impact on vulnerable populations. Historically, empirical research has focused on the individual components or subsystems of EWS, such as hazard monitoring, risk assessment, forecasting tools and warning dissemination. Yet, analyses of natural hazard disasters indicate that, in most cases, it is not the individual components of EWS that cause failure, but the processes that link them. This paper reviews several case studies conducted over the last thirty years, to present common emerging factors that improve links between the different components of EWS. The factors identified include: (1) establishment of effective communication networks to integrate science research into practice; (2) development of effective decision-making processes that incorporate local contexts by defining accountability and responsibility; (3) acknowledgment of the importance in risk perception and trust for an effective reaction; (4) consideration of the differences among technocratic and participatory approaches in EWS when applied in diverse contexts. These factors show the importance of flexibility and the consideration of local context in making EWS effective, whereas increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> within EWS nationally and globally, might challenge the ability to incorporate the required local expertise and circumstances.

The World Tourist Organisation (UNWTO: 2008) takes into consideration categories of web page quality evaluation such as: information <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the destination web site, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> accuracy, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> consistency, type and quality of interaction with visitors, value of visual identity. Web site development requires a user centered design process with permanent evaluation of the evolving design. The aim of this research is to explore web site design quality factors in order to adopt web page quality to a profile of destination visitors. This paper analyses online marketing concepts as new tools and processes that enable customer relation systems and ensure an interactive approach to potential customers. The fundamental empirical research was based on 11 Croatian destinations, both inland and coastal types, in order to analyse and identify <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> in online marketing quality. The focus was on the official local tourist board sites as destination tourism organisations. Destinations included in the research were: Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Opatija, Osijek, Zadar, Šibenik, Varaždin, Plitvice, Hvar and Rijeka. It is confirmed that the Web structure did not meet the requirements of modern tourists according to the selected categories. For example, the Šibenik official page is written only in the Croatian language. Furthermore, it is found that in addition to a non-existent domain policy, there is no commonly accepted visual identity that would be followed. The platforms of the web sites do not have a common system or tool. The evaluation indicates that only Zagreb's site offers a direct booking engine which proves that the destination is in line with the modern trends of online marketing. There is a strong, positive and statistically significant connection between the quality of internet pages of chosen tourist destinations and the number of tourist arrivals in that destination. From the web designers perspective, this research should help in the future web site development process in order to define the business objectives, context and key scenarios of use...|$|R

This paper proposes a research method to investigate relative values and complementarity between online and offline interactions in a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s buying process, examining differences within and between steps. A range of information source types and functional resource options will be researched for both effectiveness and efficiency benefits as well as emotional preferences for both online and offline interactions. The research will focus on online and offline steps in (a) information gathering, (b) evaluation and decision making and (c) eventual purchase of the components required for an unfamiliar long haul recreational travel experience. The antecedent step of destination selection and post purchase service consumption and behaviour will be excluded owing to subjective factors that could interfere {{with the findings of}} the 3 steps selected for investigation.
