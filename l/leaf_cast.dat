60|$|A blood-red October moon {{shed the}} fulness of its {{light on the}} silent houses, and the trees, still {{clinging}} to <b>leaf,</b> <b>cast</b> black shadows across the lawns and deserted streets. The very echoes of their footsteps on the pavement seemed to enhance the unreality of their surroundings: Some of the residences were already closed for the night, although the hour was not late, and the glow behind the blinds of the others was nullified by the radiancy from above. To Hodder, the sense of their isolation had never been more complete.|$|E
60|$|After seeing this, the {{director}} showed us some very curious and exquisite specimens of castings, such as baskets of flowers, {{in which the}} most delicate and fragile blossoms, the curl of a petal, the finest veins in a leaf, the lightest flower-spray that ever quivered in a breeze, were perfectly preserved; and the basket contained an abundant heap of such sprays. There were likewise a pair of hands, taken actually from life, clasped together as they were, and they looked like parts {{of a man who}} had been changed suddenly from flesh to brass. They were worn and rough and unhandsome hands, and so very real, with all their veins and the pores of the skin, that it was shocking to look at them. A bronze <b>leaf,</b> <b>cast</b> also from the life, was as curious and more beautiful.|$|E
60|$|I need {{scarcely}} insist {{farther on}} the marked {{distinction between the}} works of the old masters and those of the great modern landscape-painters in this respect. It is one which the reader can perfectly well work out for himself, by the slightest systematic attention,--one which he will find existing, not merely between this work and that, but throughout the whole body of their productions, and down to every leaf and line. And a little careful watching of nature, especially in her foliage and foregrounds, and comparison of her with Claude, Gaspar Poussin, and Salvator, will soon show him that those artists worked entirely on conventional principles, not representing what they saw, but what they thought would make a handsome picture; and even when they went to nature, which I believe to have been a very much rarer practice with them than their biographers would have us suppose, they copied her like children, drawing what they knew to be there, but not what they saw there.[22] I believe you may search the foregrounds of Claude, from one end of Europe to another, and you will not find the shadow of one <b>leaf</b> <b>cast</b> upon another. You will find leaf after leaf painted more or less boldly or brightly out of the black ground, and you will find dark leaves defined in perfect form upon the light; but you will not find the form of a single leaf disguised or interrupted by the shadow of another. And Poussin and Salvator are still farther from anything like genuine truth. There is nothing in their pictures which might not be manufactured in their painting-room, with a branch or two of brambles and a bunch or two of weeds before them, to give them the form of the leaves. And it is refreshing to turn from their ignorant and impotent repetitions of childish conception, to the clear, close, genuine studies of modern artists; for it is not Turner only, (though here, as in all other points, the first,) who is remarkable for fine and expressive decision of chiaroscuro. Some passages by J. D. Harding are thoroughly admirable in this respect, though this master is getting a little too much into a habit of general keen execution, which prevents the parts which ought to be especially decisive from being felt as such, and which makes his pictures, especially the large ones, look a little thin. But some of his later passages of rock foreground have, taken in the abstract, been beyond all praise, owing to the exquisite forms and firm expressiveness of their shadows. And the chiaroscuro of Stanfield is equally deserving of the most attentive study.|$|E

5000|$|The left door (facing the reliefs {{from outside}} the cathedral) is 328 cm high and 84 cm wide, the right 323 cm high and 83 cm wide. Both are between 1.5 and 2.5 cm thick. They were cast in bronze using the lost wax casting {{technique}} {{in a mixture of}} copper, tin {{with a small amount of}} lead, with some fine detail being added after casting by engraving tools. The left <b>leaf</b> was <b>cast</b> in one piece, but the right was made in 24 cast sections which were then soldered together. Both the lion-headed knockers, which do not align correctly, were also cast separately and soldered. The doors of Hildesheim Cathedral, of about 1015, had pioneered the casting of a large door mostly covered with reliefs in a single piece, which was considerably more difficult than the usual technique of earlier Italian bronze doors, which used bronze relief casts fixed to a wooden core. Plain doors with no figurative decoration had already been cast whole in Germany - for example for Charlemagne's early 9th century Palatine Chapel at Aachen, following Roman techniques preserved by the Byzantines. The Gniezo left door follows the Hildesheim method. The relief is also typically much higher on the left door, as much as 75% on some figures, where few on the right door reach 25%. [...] Around the central panels runs a decorative frieze of Mosan-style [...] "rinceaux", or scrolling foliage, with small figures of astrological personifications and other subjects at intervals.|$|R
5000|$|Reed {{launched}} his nature inspired range of furniture in 1999 at Decorex, London {{and it was}} at this time that Derek Pullen, Head of Sculpture Conservation, Tate Collections described Reed's <b>Leaf</b> Chair in <b>cast</b> aluminium as [...] "a very well resolved and elegant design.” In 2002 Mark made Penshurst Dining Table for Fortnum & Mason, London. During this period he worked mainly within the sphere of furniture and interior design, but then turned his attention to sculpture, setting up a foundry in his studio and thus began casting his own bronzes. [...] His initial sculptures explored his fascination with nature and he quickly became known for his tree sculptures in forged steel, the individual branches are heated in the forge and then tapered on the anvil, so the fluid shape of the tree begins to 'grow'. On the birth of his first son in 2004 Reed’s own experiences of family life led to a new direction in his work, with his fork and spoon sculptures in stainless steel. In 2004 he worked on his first public commission- Bronze and Cast Iron Tree Planters for The Prince's Trust and the City of London, unveiled by the Lord Mayor of the City.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The lasting {{impression}} I carried with me after visiting Chewton was the crushed quartz fragments erupting through the much mined, altered surface. Local quartz provides the medium {{and location of}} the outdoor component of Regeneration placed so that the elements would eventually regain their hold on the form created. Quartz is a magical, potent material existing before and outliving human time. This aspect of timelessness was central to my appreciation of the material and recognition of what form to configure the quartz. Nature to nature, place to place, within me I carry some knowledge, some blood, some cultural memory of my ancestors. One ancestor, Woretermoeteyenner, was a Tasmanian Aboriginal woman who traveled widely during her life, meeting and working with people of many cultures through {{the first half of}} the 1800 s. Woretemoeteyenner's name means eucalyptus leaf and I feel strongly connected to her in the presence of these majesterial beings. A representation of a Tasmanian eucalypt leaf is one object, left signaling my visit, that I feel able to leave behind outside here as an ephemeral marker from deep within. In planning a circular journey between the indoor gallery and the outside installation site I developed the indoor work as a point of departure and return. A trail of six bronze leaves tracking up a eucalypt trunk provide a different means of memorial than the more unstructured external quartz leaf that changes with every rain. The golden bronze refers to the alluvial goldfields of Chewton and also the alchemical magic of molten metal. Each <b>cast</b> <b>leaf</b> traces a generation from Woretermoeteyenner to me, the same leaf, our regeneration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{stratigraphy}} of the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene {{has been}} revised in Avesnois thanks to drillings supporting a geological mapping project. Detailed sampling and {{analyses were performed}} along selected drillings, among which sedimentological, mineralogical, chemostratigraphic (δ 13 Corg), biostratigraphic and palynological data have been obtained. New Mbs/Fms are defined around the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (PEb) and compared to the lithostratigraphic nomenclatures of the Belgian and Paris Basins (Steurbaut, 1998; Aubry et al., 2005). Biostratigraphy based {{on the study of}} foraminifera and mammal fauna, palynological content and chemostratigraphy enable correlation to be established between adjacent basins as well as sea level and landscape evolutions to be refined during this critical interval. Upper Thanetian marine units In the AVE 007 -drilling (Mormal Forest, Locquignol, between Englefontaine, Landrecies and Maroilles villages), the Coniacian chalk is overlain by a flint conglomerate, whose sandy-clayey matrix contains Thanetian pollen and dinocysts. Widespread in Avesnois and containing often reworked Upper Cretaceous foraminifera and occasionally glauconite, this unit constitutes the Vervins Mb (cf. 'Argile à silex de Vervins' interpreted as a marine conglomerate by Gosselet, 1879). It is often overlain by the Mondrepuis-Bettrechies Sand Mb (cf. 'Sable verts de l'Avesnois'), a thin sandy glauconiferous unit, more clayey and silty westward (cf. 'Tuffeau de Valenciennes' Mb). The three Mbs constitute the Hainaut-Valenciennois Fm and can be correlated to the Belgian Grandglise Mb (upper part of the Hannut Fm) and Bois-Gilles Fm, and to the Paris Basin Châlons-sur-Vesles and Bracheux Fms, all Thanetian in age. Uppermost Paleocene to lowermost Eocene terrestrial units In AVE 007 the Vervins Mb is unconformably overlain by flint gravels (Mormal Mb), then a pyritic sand (Le Quesnoy Sand Mb, cf. 'Sables et Grès du Quesnoy' of Gosselet, 1890), and a lignitic clay (Locquignol Mb), silty and ochreous at the top. All but the top ochreous paleosol contain spores and pollen grains and are devoid of dinocysts, they were thus probably deposited in terrestrial environments. The Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) of the PEb begins below the top of the sandy unit and continues in the lignitic clay. The palynological study confirms the Locquignol Mb's earliest Eocene age and allows correlation with the base of the Tienen Fm. To the East of AVE 007 along the Belgium-France border, fluvial fossiliferous gravels and sands have been studied in past sand quarries (Erquelinnes Sand Mb). Above a sharp unconformity, they i) overly Upper Thanetian marine sands (Bois-Gilles Fm, NP 9 a, then Grandglise Mb, NP 8), ii) contain a mammal fauna referred as MP 7 in the Mammalian biochronological scale for the European Paleogene (Missiaen et al., 2013) and iii) record {{the first part of the}} CIE onset in the basal fossiliferous gravel and marl beds. Three km west of Erquelinnes and toward AVE 007 a few drillings have recognized a sandy and pyritic unit containing resinite fragments, lignite and peat beds (Vieux Reng Mb), overlying a thin basal flint gravel bed (Mormal Mb). These five Mormal, Le Quesnoy, Locquignol, Vieux-Reng and Erquelinnes Sand Mbs form the Sambre Fm. Such fluvial gravels and sands, more or less lignitic, clayey or marly are widespread in northern France and southeastern Belgium. They belong to the so-called Upper "Landenian" and are correlated to the Tienen Fm. In AVE 007, they record the CIE onset marking the PEb and 2. 5 m of Upper Paleocene fluvial units, in contrast with Belgian drillings such as Doel and Kallo where a hiatus is present at the PEb. Lower Ypresian hiatus and marine units In AVE 007, a laminated silty unit overlies the Locquignol Mb, contains dinocysts Wetzeliella sp. and agglutinated foraminifera similar to those of the base of the Orchies Clay Mb. Widespread in Avesnois-Valenciennois that marine unit is named Avesnois Mb, it is locally richer in very fine sand, and correlated to the base of the Kortrijk Clay Fm (Ieper Gp). In Avesnois, Sparnacian lagoonal units are absent upon the terrestrial ones described above, again marking a reverse trend when compared with the Belgian and adjacent Basins. This may result from restricted terrestrial environments coinciding with Variscan accidents and structural highs between the Artois anticline and Ardenne Masssif, or to their deposition followed by subsequent erosion prior to the Lower Ypresian marine transgression (cf. sea level drop 2 of Dupuis et al, 2011). Correlations and PETM impact on land All terrestrial units here described fill fluvial channels incised in marine Thanetian and older units such as the Cretaceous or the Variscan basement in Avesnois and Belgium, as already reported elsewhere in northern France (cf. sea level drop 1 of Dupuis et al., 2011). They exhibit locally cross stratification, lignite, flora or vertebrate fauna, for example at Leval, Hoegaarden and Dormaal, and/or are intensively silicified with scarce root or <b>leaf</b> <b>casts.</b> Similar fluvial sediments and silcretes are recognized in the first Sparnacian units and paleogeography of the Paris, Dieppe-Hampshire and London Basins, where the PEb is also present, the CIE being recorded on thicknesses between 3 m (as in AVE 007) to > 20 m (as in Sinceny). These features may be regarded now as constant in those Sparnacian landscapes recording the PETM, with very rapid lateral and vertical facies shift, particular paleosols, a few fossiliferous fluvial to lacustrine units and variable deposition rates/sediments preservation. Terrestrial sediments, flora and fauna have been described there before the CIE onset as well, for example at Cobham, Vasterival or Rivecourt (e. g. Smith et al., 2014). Lihons, an intermediate outlier situated between AVE 007 and Sparnacian sites of those basins has further been investigated: marine Thanetian sands are overlain by thin fluvial, lacustrine then lagoonal sediments, the two latter recording the CIE of the PETM on an interval 4 m thick. Here again the basal terrestrial sediments have been deposited before the PEb. In AVE 007, depositional environments are fluvial for the Mormal and Le Quesnoy Mbs, and evolve toward flood plain then palustrine ones for the Locquignol Mb, probably here after the river bed migration, but still recording sporo-pollen fluvial inputs from the hinterland, the whole indicating a rather humid subtropical climate. Compared to the Locquignol Mb, the sporopollinic assemblage of the Mormal and Le Quesnoy Mbs (below the CIE onset) is different, particularly regarding the Normapolles distribution, the Tricolpates, Tricolporates and Monocolpates relative pollen abundances and the pollen ratio of Plicapollis pseudoexcelsus/Juglandaceae. In the three Mbs, rapid vertical variations characterize pollen and fern spores assemblages, with peaks of particular taxa reaching 25 % of the total counts, such as for P. pseudoexcelsus, T. platycaryoides, C. dorogensis, P. mcgregorii, T. robustus. They suggest rapid floral changes in the catchment and/or sources changes in the surrounding landscapes compartments for the rivers supplying the fluvial sediments. Resinite particles are irregularly abundant as well as microcharcoals are occasionally abundant, notably slightly before the CIE onset and 1. 5 m above it, still within the CIE. The clay mineral assemblage is homogeneous along marine Thanetian units and strongly dominated by Illite-Smectite (IS) mixed layers, whatever the facies, while it is more variable in the marine Ypresian silts (abundant IS, followed by Kaolinite, Illite, Chlorite and Vermiculite). In contrast terrestrial units are dominated by IS followed by Kaolinite, Illite and very rare Chlorite, and no variation is observed across the PEb. Those data would suggest that major environmental changes have regionally begun before the PETM, at the very end of the Paleocene, when terrestrial realm has settled, in relation with a regional uplift. Clay minerals reflect constant reworking of preexisting weathering profiles established upon Cretaceous strata and Variscan basement, while vegetation modifications are subtle and more likely attributable to changes of depositional environment...|$|R
