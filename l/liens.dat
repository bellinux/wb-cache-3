Hampshire Building and Loan Association No. 1 was incorporated by West Virginia Secretary of State Henry S. Walker on March 11, 1890. White was one of six corporators, with two shares ($35 each), of the Romney Manufacturing, Land and Improvement Company, which was created for the acquisition of land near Romney {{for the establishment of a}} hotel or summer resort and the development of residential real estate. The Romney Manufacturing, Land and Improvement Company was incorporated by Walker's successor, William A. Ohley, on July 10, 1890.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax <b>liens,</b> the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E

50|$|In the {{mechanics}} <b>lien</b> process, a <b>lien</b> release (also {{known as a}} release of <b>lien</b> or a cancellation of <b>lien)</b> is a document that is usually voluntarily filed by a <b>lien</b> claimant, such as a subcontractor, in exchange for payment or a promise of payment from a general contractor or a property owner. Therefore releasing a <b>lien</b> is a delicate process, because <b>lien</b> claimants generally want to be paid before they release the <b>lien,</b> and the <b>liened</b> party wants the <b>lien</b> released before they make payment. Unlike a <b>lien</b> waiver which negates the right to file a <b>lien</b> in the future, a <b>lien</b> release cancels a <b>lien</b> {{that has already been}} placed.|$|R

40|$|<b>LIEN</b> IN THE CZECH LAW Summary <b>Lien</b> {{is one of}} {{the typical}} private rights. <b>Lien</b> is tenure.

It is tenure to an alien property, which is reflected by the object owner restricts the right of ownership in favor of the <b>lien</b> creditor. The essence of the <b>lien</b> is to secure claims of a <b>lien</b> creditor. That may satisfy his claim from the proceeds of liquidation of the collateral, if not properly and timely met.
