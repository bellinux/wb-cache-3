40|$|For {{more than}} 50 years, IPERS has {{provided}} a core retirement plan covering most Iowa local and state public employees. With approximately 300, 000 members and almost 2, 400 covered employers, IPERS is the largest public retirement system in Iowa. The Legislature designed IPERS to provide monthly <b>lifetime</b> <b>annuities</b> that supplement social security benefits and personal savings, enabling public employees to care for themselves in retirement. The Legislature also intended for IPERS to be an employee benefit that would help Iowa’s public employers recruit and retain qualified personnel. As a defined benefit plan, the monthly benefit IPERS members receive is calculated using a formula. A member’s benefit increases as his or her years of service and salary increase. Because IPERS is a defined benefit plan, the Legislature is assured that the money contributed by public employees and their employers for retirement is used as intended. The benefit is paid as a <b>lifetime</b> monthly <b>annuity.</b> IPERS members cannot borrow or withdraw their money while in public employment...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{different}} types of pension plans available in those Latin American countries which have pension systems based on individual capitalization accounts with defined contributions. Based on ideas first put forward by Yaari (1965) and developed by Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) and Brown (1999), we set out an optimization model to determine the expected utility of each type of pension plan according to the different preferences and perceptions of the individual. We also carry out an analysis of individual welfare based on the concept of equivalent wealth. Finally, other characteristics are gradually incorporated into the basic model in order to answer whether the types of pension plans available should be limited exclusively to <b>lifetime</b> <b>annuities,</b> {{as is the case in}} most countries with pay-as-you-go systems and in some coun-tries with capitalization systems, or whether the individual should have some degree of freedom to choose according to his personal circum-stances and preferences...|$|R

40|$|The Markowitz {{mean-variance}} {{model is}} widely accepted as {{the gold standard}} for asset allocation on the way to retirement. Unfortunately, this framework only considers the risk and return tradeoff in the financial market. It does not consider the longevity risk people face during retirement. And, while a variety of recent papers in the Journal of Financial Planning have discussed the mechanics and importance of payout (also known as <b>lifetime)</b> <b>annuities,</b> the industry literature currently lacks a coherent and formal model of how much wealth should be allocated in-and-between asset classes within a payout annuity. To fill this gap, our paper revisits the importance of longevity insurance – while discussing the problems with fixed payout annuities [...] and then moves on to address the proper asset allocation between conventional financial assets and variable payout annuity products. As in the classical Markowitz framework, our focus is on maximizing a suitably defined objective function in an intuitive, comprehensible, and practical manner. In addition to the usual risk and return information from the financial markets, our modeling framework requires inputs on the relative strength of retiree’s bequest motives, subjective health status, and liquidity restrictions. To illustrate the model, we provide some specific case studies and numerical examples to show how a financial planner can actually apply asset allocation ideas within-and-between payout annuity products and conventional asset classes...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time in history, many older Americans will likely retire with large {{stockpiles}} of money and will have to determine how to carefully manage these assets. Our study results suggest that converting retire-ment wealth into an annuity that guarantees a lifetime income may help retirees manage their spending and ensure they will not outlive their savings. What are Annuities? Annuities are financial instruments that convert wealth into a guaranteed stream of lifetime income. The annual income generated depends on the age at which the annuity begins and on current market interest rates. 1 Although annuities provide insurance against outliving one’s resources, few retirees purchase them. Today’s retirees typically rely on lifetime payments from tra-ditional defined-benefit (DB) pensions and Social Security—which represent 55 percent of total wealth for typical married adults and 59 percent of total wealth for unmarried adults—to finance their retirement. So far this strategy has served most retirees well, since only one-third of those married and one-quarter of those unmarried have financial assets of more than $ 100, 000 per person. However, this is likely to change in the future due to the decline in DB pensions and the growth in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and defined-contribution (DC) pensions, which include 401 (k) plans. Traditional DB pensions, common for yesterday’s retirees, provide <b>lifetime</b> <b>annuities</b> beginning at retire-ment and promise benefits typically as a multiple of years worked and earnings received {{near the end of the}} career. DC plans in which employers (and generally employees) make contributions to a retirement account in the participant’s name, often specified as a particular share of salary or a given dollar amount, are now the most common type of retirement benefit. At retirement, workers receive the funds that have accumulated in their accounts. Most employers do not offer annuities to their DC plan participants, and although they can use the proceeds to purchase annuities in the marketplace, only 4 percent of workers in DC pension plans convert their account balances into annuities when they leav...|$|R
40|$|Social {{security}} systems {{in many countries}} face problems of high and escalating disability costs. This paper analyzes how disability costs have been controlled in Chile. The disability insurance system in Chile is much less well-known than the pension part, but it is equally innovative. It differs from traditional public disability insurance in two important ways: 1) it is largely pre-funded, sufficient to cover a <b>lifetime</b> disability <b>annuity</b> and 2) the disability assessment procedure includes participation by private pension funds (AFPs) and insurance companies, who finance the benefit and have a direct pecuniary interest in controlling costs. We hypothesize that these procedures and incentives will keep system costs low, by cutting the incidence of successful disability claims. Using the Cox proportional hazard model based on a retrospective sample of new and old system affiliates (ESP 2002), we conclude that observed behavior is broadly consistent with thi...|$|R
