25|$|The {{origin of}} the name is obscure. It may derive from the Latin virga meaning a rod, perhaps {{referring}} to the wooden jacks that rest {{on the ends of}} the keys, but this is unproven. Another possibility is that the name derives from the word virgin, as it was most commonly played by young women, or from its sound, which is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> girl's voice (vox virginalis). A further view is that the name derives from the Virgin Mary as it was used by nuns to accompany hymns in honour of the Virgin.|$|E
25|$|It {{is notable}} {{that as the}} context in which the {{characters}} evolved, Michel also is shown getting older. While he looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man of about twenty years at the beginning of his adventures, he is seen progressively reaching middle-age. Recently his appearance is younger than previously. Other fictional characters are also shown getting older. In recent years, their general appearance has become steady. In spite of this he is still depicted as quite young for a man who has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna.|$|E

A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does what he feels like. He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of}} his experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

500|$|Damon's {{attempts}} at essaying leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000's All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance were commercially and critically unsuccessful. Variety {{said of his}} work in All the Pretty Horses: [...] " [...] just doesn't quite seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man who's spent his life amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike any sparks with [...] Cruz." [...] He was similarly deemed [...] "uncomfortable being the center" [...] of Robert Redford's The Legend of Bagger Vance.|$|E
500|$|Producer Barry Rosen said, [...] "We {{were very}} lucky that [...] were so human-grounded, {{so we could}} really play off of them {{and the way they}} looked at things that [...] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on." [...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E
500|$|From Earth-based {{radar and}} {{spacecraft}} {{images of the}} crater edge, Shackleton appears to be relatively intact; much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> crater {{that has not been}} significantly eroded from subsequent impacts. This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep, which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle. In addition, {{it is possible that the}} interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of [...] since its formation.

500|$|Coghill {{was cast}} as Tony on 20 June 2008. He deemed {{the role the}} most {{challenging}} he had ever played, but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse. Of his off-screen relationship with McGarty, Coghill explained that it helped {{that she does not}} look or act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> child, deeming her [...] "fantastic to work with", as well as [...] "very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress", commenting: [...] "There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008.|$|E
500|$|The protagonist is a nameless middle-aged soldier {{living the}} life of a [...] "junker"—scavenging useful items among ruined cities to survive. He enters a {{derelict}} city searching for undamaged goods and finds an abandoned planetarium on the roof of a building he first thinks is a military facility. There, he meets Yumemi Hoshino, a gynoid designed to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> girl who annoys him greatly due to her constant talking. The protagonist has a tough personality that comes from trying to survive in a dystopic world. He carries a grenade launcher with him and covers himself with a waterproof coat to protect his skin from the toxic rain. For drinking water, his canteen has a water purifier that can purify the rain. He is constantly searching for rarer substances such as cigarettes and alcohol which can be sold at high prices.|$|E
500|$|On [...] "London Song", Jim Abbott at The Orlando Sentinel {{said the}} syncopated guitar {{performance}} complements Title TKs [...] "world-weary attitude," [...] {{just as the}} sisters' [...] "tough lost years ... obvious from Kim's disconnected delivery on songs about hard times". By contrast, NY Rocks Jeanne Fury noted the track's upbeat, quirky energy. In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad [...] "Off You" [...] as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Medias Will Bryant {{was struck by the}} song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall. Rolling Stones Arion Berger said [...] "Off You" [...] is [...] "as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and full of hope, can't help sounding <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes." ...|$|E

500|$|Yumemi is a goodhearted but {{extremely}} talkative gynoid attendant of {{an abandoned}} planetarium; she is designed to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> girl. Yumemi is slightly damaged and completely unaware {{of the changes that}} have occurred in the past 30 years, as none of the facilities and databases that she connects to exist anymore. Therefore, she treats the protagonist like a regular guest by calling him , speaks of the world as it was before the war, and fails to understand any information he tells her, other than things related to her job at the planetarium. The name [...] "Hoshino Yumemi" [...] itself is a pun—"hoshi" [...] means star or planetary body; [...] "no" [...] is a possessive particle; [...] "yume" [...] is a dream or a reverie; [...] "mi" [...] means see. Yumemi is the only character shown to the audience of the game.|$|E

Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood stated that during the performance Rihanna dominated the stage pointing that she looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> version of Grace Jones.

500|$|Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave an {{unfavorable}} review. Although sex in popular music {{is considered a}} standard concept, Willman states the only reason the album would cause a reaction is because of Jackson's well-known conservative nature. He comments: [...] "So be it. Jackson's first album in four years is destined for a long ride at No. 1, not because it's any great piece of work, but largely for its aphrodisiacal aspirations." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "f musical variety and daring lyrics were all that mattered, Janet would make the grade. But the album {{has a lot to}} prove. It is the first delivery under her $40 million contract with Virgin, and its title—which translates as 'Janet, period'—is meant as a declaration of independence from her oddball siblings... She still sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman from a male-dominated family who is searching for her identity and voice. Mostly, though, Janet sounds like a mess—period." [...] David Sinclair of The Times wrote: [...] "In the steamy, post-Madonna climate of the 1990s, Jackson is not about to let thoughts of love {{get in the way of}} the mechanics of lust, and like many of her superstar contemporaries she tends to confuse sex with soul." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The One After the Superbowl" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Lisa Davis of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the guest appearances [...] "a blatant ploy to boost ratings." [...] The Charlotte Observers Tim Goodman said the episode's [...] "pathetic infusion of 'star appeal'" [...] made him [...] "nauseous" [...] and {{commented that the}} producers [...] "should just make Bernie Kopell a regular {{and turn it into}} the Love Boat all over again." [...] Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman also noted the similarities with the television series Love Boat, known for its many guest stars: [...] " [...] had a couple of chuckles, but came off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> Love Boat." [...] Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "fragmented, poorly paced, and only sporadically funny. Cramming the already crowded ensemble with celebs may have been a ratings grabber ... but the results are forced sitcomedy and stilted acting," [...] specifically citing Van Damme. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that the episode [...] "feels like nothing more than a big stunt to follow the big game." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the cameos of Willard and Castellaneta [...] "offers easily the best parts of the program." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Marion McMullen from the Coventry Evening Telegraph, Davies explained that the Gothic elements to the novel gave him inspiration to add dream sequences and fantasies to the script. He told McMullen, [...] "I've been very faithful to the book, {{but one of the}} differences has been writing the scenes showing Catherine's fantasies. Catherine is a great reader of horror fiction – the gothic novel was fairly popular in those days, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> girl today who would read a lot of rather steamy romances. In this production, we see some of Catherine's fantasies, some of which are quite steamy for a young girl." [...] Davies admitted that he was proud of his reputation for [...] "sexing up" [...] the novels he had adapted and commented that none of his scenes were gratuitous. He told McMullen that he often looked for excuses to get the characters out of their clothes, as he felt they were always being [...] "buttoned up to the neck". Producer Keith Thompson said Davies had made Northanger Abbey a bit more erotic than the novel and thought the script had [...] "a wonderful cheekiness to it." [...] Davies chose to use a narrator to speak Austen's words and help set the scene {{at the beginning and end}} of the film.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} Superboy stories, Lana {{was the girl}} who lived {{next door to the}} Kent family in Smallville, and was a romantic interest of Superboy.

5000|$|The Daily World praised Bridwell's {{distinctive}} vocals and {{singled out}} [...] "Laredo" [...] as a stand out song on Infinite Arms. Spin magazine said, [...] "With its midtempo stroll, crunchy Southern guitar, and Ben Bridwell's silky vocals, 'Laredo' sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> cousin of 'Weed Party' from the band's 2006 debut album, Everything All the Time." ...|$|R
