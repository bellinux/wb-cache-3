In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, {{but in many cases}} it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with Imagination one of the victims; Hamling closed down both Imagination and its sister magazine to invest the money in Rogue instead. The last issue of Imagination was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of Imagination omitted its <b>letter,</b> <b>book</b> review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E
500|$|In August 1979 Warrior {{began her}} [...] journey to her {{temporary}} {{home in the}} Coal Dock at Hartlepool for restoration as a museum ship. She arrived on 2 September 1979 and began the £9 million restoration project, largely funded by the Manifold Trust. The Maritime Trust decided to restore Warrior to her 1862 condition with the aim that no further major work would be necessary for the next 20 years. The {{first two years of}} the restoration were generally devoted to safely removing material added after her first commission, like the poop deck and the [...] of concrete decking. Intensive research was done to find detailed descriptions of the ship and her equipment as of 1862 to make the restoration as accurate as economically feasible. Sources included surviving official records, and the papers of those who had served on the ship during her active service. Bolt-holes and ridges in the paint gave clues to the location of some fittings and fixtures, and the sketch plans of Midshipman Henry Murray, found in Captain Cochrane's <b>Letter</b> <b>Book,</b> showed the locations of the armament, moveable fittings and stores.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Nicholas Exton's date of birth, youth or early years. He first appears in public records as having been elected as Member for Middlesex for the June 1369 parliament. By the early [...] 1380s he had become an [...] "active" [...] {{spokesman}} for the Fishmongers' Guild, {{of which he was}} a member. This, as the guild controlling the sale of a staple food, was immensely powerful in the politics of the City of London. At some point the King had appointed him a collector of the port's wool customs and subsidies, and he was also a Surveyor of Murage Mayor of the Westminster staple. These were all positions, comments one historian, [...] "close to the purse strings of the government and the city." [...] Also around the same time, he was elected alderman for Billingsgate Ward, which throughout his career he was to serve as on another seven occasions. Exton's guild was a particularly powerful one in the city politics of the day, and had a monopoly on the wholesale fish market; the then-current Mayor, John Northampton, who had a populist agenda was seemingly determined to break such monopolies and open London's markets up to the less-prosperous. Exton, perhaps [...] "naturally" [...] it has been said, joined Northampton's political opponents, chief of whom among them was the later Mayor Nicholas Brembre. Exton's advocacy for the Guild appears to have lead him to make robust and vigorous comments regarding his opponents, {{to the extent that it}} was noted in the 1382 Letter-Book that Exton had made [...] "opprobrious words used to the aforesaid mayor [...] "- for which it seems that Exton was removed from the office of alderman less than a week later (although he may have requested his own removal). At the same time he was deprived of his citizenship, imprisoned for a year, heavily fined and forced to leave the city, albeit temporarily. Only a month later, though, in September 1382, he was arguing the same points in parliament. The fishmongers (and by extension the other victualling guilds), stated Exton, were entitled to the same rights of exclusivity as other companies: [...] "If the retail in fish was to be thrown open to foreigners for the common good," [...] paraphrases one commentator on Exton's remarks, [...] "then so should all the others." [...] This line of argument provided Northampton's supporters the opportunity to claim that Exton was speaking in defiance of the traditional liberties of the city (and, therefore [...] "a manifest injury to all citizens" [...] as that year's <b>Letter</b> <b>Book</b> tells us).|$|E

2500|$|One {{of the big}} {{breaks for}} the Illinois State Archives came when Norton {{discovered}} paperwork that provided proof of Illinois' land ownership. [...] With the Illinois State Archives considered a subdivision of the public library, Norton was provided with no additional support or clerical staff and often found herself combing through the refuges of state buildings. [...] On one venture she found a governor's <b>letter</b> <b>book</b> from 1823 which gave evidence that a [...] "Post and Paul survey" [...] of the Illinois and Michigan canal had been done and that the map had been forwarded to the federal government. [...] This find, by clarifying land ownership, quite possibly saved the state {{large amounts of money}} that could have been spent on ensuing court fees. [...] This find also gave Norton some of the repertoire and evidence needed to convince her superiors of the utilitarian value of archives.|$|E
