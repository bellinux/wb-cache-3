The problem is that although most of these analyses are very helpful in understanding what went wrong and why the “toolkit” did not work in a given context, they do not tell us how to improve our efforts going forward.

40|$|ABSTRACT Changing {{composition}} of workforce in organizations and its ever rising aspirations has compelled man-agement everywhere {{to be more}} and more concerned about the quality of life at the work place. Changes in economic policies, globalization of the economies {{of the world and the}} compulsion of facing competition both in domestic and inter-national markets have been posing a serious challenge to all concerned viz., employees, employers and government. This coupled with ever changing technology and increased access to information has necessitated studying organizations with respect to their productivity, efficiency and quality of service rendered. NLC is one of the biggest public sector enterprises in India. If the public sector organization <b>like</b> NLC fails <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the demand for QWL enhancement of non-managerial employees, it will eventually be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared with private sector organizations. However, we have very little information at the grass root level to comprehend what QWL means in the Indian context and what its implications for research?

A large and growing number of online systems support massive collaboration to produce public repositories of information. As the prevalence, scale, and variety of these systems grows, {{it is essential to}} examine the motivations of individuals who contribute to them. This project is founded on the premise that just two categories – contributors and non-contributors – do not accurately capture either the specific products of online collective action or the variety of incentives that drive it. We need not assume, for example, that the same incentives will motivate an individual to edit content on Wikipedia, to join a social networking site <b>like</b> LinkedIn, or <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> queries on Yahoo!

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the raw textile defect detection problem using independent components approach with insights from human vision system. Human vision system {{is known to}} have specialized receptive fields that <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> certain type of input signals. Orientation-selective bar cells and grating cells are examples of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex that are selective to periodic- and aperiodic-patterns, respectively. Regularity and anisotropy are two high-level features of texture perception, and we can say that disruption in regularity and/or orientation field of the texture pattern causes structural defects. In our research, we observed that independent components extracted from texture images give bar or grating cell like results depending on the structure of the texture. For those textures having lower regularity and dominant local anisotropy (orientation or directionality), independent components look similar to bar cells whereas textures with high regularity and lower anisotropy have independent components acting like grating cells. Thus, we will expect different bar or grating cell <b>like</b> independent components <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> defective and defect-free regions. With this motivation, statistical analysis {{of the structure of the}} texture by means of independent components and then extraction of the disturbance in the structure can be a promising approach to understand perception of local disorder of texture in human vision system. In this paper, we will show how to detect regions of structural defects in raw textile data that have certain regularity and local orientation characteristics with the application of independent component analysis (ICA), and we will present results on real textile images with detailed discussions...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a real and actual phenomenon, which threat nature {{stability}} and human life; their effects are already felt in some region of the planet. Southern and eastern parts of the Mediterranean basin are amongst those regions, increased extreme weather events and strong climate fluctuations that exceed the global average like heat waves, heavy rainfall of short duration and recurring storms were recorded recently. Considered as the major component of an ecosystem since they {{play a critical role}} in soil protection, air quality, flood reduction, and a significant economic role in rural areas and for the national economy as a whole; forest ecosystems have been central to the debate and climate change issues. In Morocco, this high significance is added to their crucial role in the hydrological balance and cross-cutting implications for socio-economic and human development. In fact, Morocco has a complex and important floristic and faunistic diversity mainly represented by forest ecosystems. It conceals valuable genetic resources both for the country itself and for the Mediterranean countries community. However, biodiversity and genetic resources are in increased threat especially in the absence of specific studies on climate change impacts in vulnerable areas such as forests. In addition to forests, insects are amongst the most affected and <b>responding</b> organisms <b>to</b> climate change because of its strong direct influence on their development, reproduction, and survival. Moreover, insects have short generation times and high reproductive rates, so they are more <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> quicker <b>to</b> climate change than long-lived organisms, such as plants and vertebrates. Warming can potentially affect several aspects of insect life-cycle and ecology, especially those directly controlled by energy availability variables such as degree. Consequently, potential responses include changes in phenological patterns, changes in habitat selection, and expansion and contraction of geographic and altitudinal ranges. Their ability to quick response makes them good indicators of current human- driven climate change. In this context fits our study which aims the inventory of Coleoptera and Hymenoptera associated with the Moroccan relict fir forests of Talassemtane National Park, in a way to reveal their response and their use as bioindicators in biomonitoring of forests. The sampling was led in 2 successive years (2013 - 2014), during 7 months (from April to October) using PolytrapTM and colored traps placed in 20 plots in the Talassemtane Fir and oak forest, combined with active field research; 74 family of Coleoptera and 34 families of Hymenoptera were recorded. Among those families are bio-indicators specially saproxylic beetles, parasitoid wasps, rare and endemic species. A First statistical test proves that there is a significant correlation between Temperature degrees and insects’ arrival; also, an altitudinal effect on insects’ distribution is demonstrated. In spite of the fact that the integration of insects in forest monitoring in Morocco still innovative, due to the lack of knowledge and the taxonomic obstacle related to this group of invertebrates; such studies are necessary to establish new management policy and improve actual forest management practices...|$|R
