5000|$|A {{liquefied}} {{natural gas}} (LNG) spill can happen during an accident or an intentional act such as terrorism. LNG is normally stored and transported in liquid form at a temperature of approximately [...] If this cooled <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released</b> from a storage facility, pipeline, or LNG transport ship, then it begins to warm. As LNG warms above its storage temperature, the liquid begins to vaporize. The resulting gas produced by this warming is typically methane, which is the major component (with some ethane) of natural gas.|$|E
50|$|Siphons are {{sometimes}} employed as automatic machines, {{in situations where}} it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common {{example of this is}} a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released,</b> emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as floats, chains, levers, and valves, but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism.|$|E

When submitted to a constant shear stress, an initially spherical particle deforms quickly to adopt a stable ellipsoidal form. Upon reaching a first stress threshold, some <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released</b> from the particle. This liquid release is determined by a critical deformation value above which the gel cannot retain all of its solvent. At stresses above a second threshold value, small droplets of liquid are secreted from the particle and move away in the flow direction...|$|E

40|$|The {{coexistence}} of multiple droplet breakup instabilities in a Step-emulsification geometry is studied. A liquid filament, which is confined in one dimension by channel walls {{and surrounded by}} a co-flowing immiscible continuous phase, decays into droplets when subject to a sudden release of confinement. Depending on the filament aspect ratio and liquid flow rates, an unexpectedly rich variety of droplet breakup regimes is found. All of these breakup regimes are composed of two basic instabilities, i. e. a step- and a jet-instability, that coexist in various combinations on the same filament. Surprisingly, even an asymmetric breakup regime is found, producing droplet families of significantly different diameters, while the filament is subject to a fully symmetric flow field. We suggest key physical principles explaining the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the transitions between individual droplet breakup regimes. The particular ability to produce distinct droplet families from a single filament is demonstrated to allow for simultaneous concentration and encapsulation of particles into one droplet family while excess bulk <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released</b> into another family of droplets...|$|E
40|$|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a {{cryogenic}} liquid consisting predominantly of methane compressed to 1 / 600 th of its gaseous volume for transportation. A release of LNG on water during marine operations can occur due to several factors. Upon release, a spreading liquid can form a pool with rapid vaporization, {{leading to the}} formation of a flammable vapor cloud. Safety analyses {{for the protection of the}} public and property involve the determination of consequences of such releases. The evaluation of consequences resulting from a spill of LNG on water involves the determination of the rate (vaporization rate/source-term) at which flammable hydrocarbon vapor is produced and the dynamics of the spreading pool. Two key parameters which affect pool spreading and vaporization, namely the heat flux to the LNG pool and the turbulence present within the cryogenic pool, are quantified separately through experiments. The heat flux from two different substrates comprised of water and ice is studied. The vaporization mass flux is directly influenced by the water temperature and the release rate. Similarly, the vaporization mass flux is directly influenced by the ice temperature when cryogenic <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released</b> on ice. The experiment for quantification of turbulence present in cryogenic pool was performed using a high-speed camera. Flow visualization for turbulence quantification revealed the presence of wavy-structures called ?thermals? which catalyzed the vaporization process of {{cryogenic liquid}} released on water. The results of key parameters study are implemented in CFD methodology to study the pool spreading and vaporization behavior. The CFD model is validated with an LNG experiment which simulates the LNG spill in space enclosed by two LNG ships during loading operations. The results of the research can be used for decision making in facility siting studies and emergency response planning for near shore/waterfront LNG facilities...|$|E

40|$|Pure ammonia (NH 3) {{is made up}} of 82. 24 percent nitro-gen (N) and 17. 76 percent hydrogen. It {{has been}} formed by the {{combination}} of N 2 gas from the air (a form not available to crops) and hydrogen. The simple compound is called anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) : anhydrous meaning "without water. " It is gas but must be stored, transported, and handled under pressure in special containers. When under pressure it is a liquid, looking and flowing like water. Its weight varies with temperature but is approxi-mately 5 pounds per gallon. If liquid NH 3 is released on the soil surface it expands rather rapidly into a gas and will evaporate. When evapo-rating, it is actually colorless although it first appears as a white vapor because of heat intake from the air. It has a sharp, pungent odor which serves as its own warning signal to the user in detecting losses during application. Reaction In The Soil Soil application of NH 3 takes advantage of the rapid expansion of liquid ammonia into the gaseous form and its tremendous affinity for water. When the <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released</b> in the soil, it quickly spreads out to a diameter of about 6 inches depending on the rate applied, soil mois-ture, and soil texture. It dissolves immediately in soil mois-ture and then is no longer a gas. The compound formed is ammonium hydroxide (NH 40 H) which breaks into two parts: the ammonium ion (NH 4) with a plus charge and the hydroxyl ion (OH-), the negative ion. The (NH 4) will cling to either the negatively charged clay particles or the soil organic matter. In this form it moves very little. At the immediate point of injection where the NH 3 becomes NH 40 H, the soil pH is temporarily high since the latter compound is strongly alkaline. When bacteria act on the NH 4 to convert it to nitrate, H+ ions are released. Thus NH 3, over the entire growing season causes a slight reduction in soil pH. Soil organisms are discussed in a later section...|$|E
40|$|Biomedical {{engineering}} is {{the application of}} engineering principles and techniques to the medical field. It combines the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical and biological sciences to improve healthcare diagnosis and treatment. As the result of improvements in robotics and micro technology science in the 20 th century, micro electromechanical system technology has joined with medical applications which results in micro robotic medical applications. Drug delivery {{is one of the}} most important and controversial topics which scientists and engineers have tried to improve in medical applications. For diseases like cancer, localized drug delivery is a highlight target involving bombarding a small area of a human’s body and this technology has not been completely achieved yet. The ultimate objective of this thesis is the development of wireless capsule robot controlled by a magnetic drive unit. A magnetic drive unit is a system that consists of electromagnets, which produce the magnetic field from outside of the patient’s body. The capsule robot, which is the slave robot in the system, moves inside a human’s gastrointestinal tract. This project is focused mainly on a human esophagus and all the experiments are done in a prototype of the human’s esophagus. Drug delivery for diseases like cancer is the objective of the capsule robot. The proposed design consists of a slave permanent magnet for the motion of capsule robot in a tube, a reservoir of drug, and a micro mechanical mechanism for drug release. The capsule robot is fabricated and developed in a 12 mm length and 5 mm diameter with the weight of 1. 78 grams without the built-in permanent magnet. The drug delivery system is a semi-magnetized system, which can be controlled by an external magnetic field. It consists of a mechanical plunger and spring, which can be open and close through an external magnetic field manipulation. The amount of drug for a desired location can be controlled by manipulating the external magnetic field. To achieve this target, analytical modeling is conducted. A numerical simulation and an experimental setup demonstrate that a capsule robot in a human esophagus in a simple and multi channel system. Horizontal control is set for the capsule robot, using a custom-designed controller and a colored <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>released</b> with the external magnetic field. The present study with its fabricated prototype is a research is this area to prove the concept of wireless control of a robot inside a human body and the potential for a drug delivery system.
