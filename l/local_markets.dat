40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{geographically}} proximate (<b>local)</b> <b>market</b> makers in providing liquidity and {{improving the quality of}} a dealer market.

The beneficial effects from <b>local</b> <b>market</b> makers are not confined to a few "top" local dealers and they cannot be attributed to their participation in the firm's IPO syndicate or industry specialization. Further, we find that days with aggressive bidding from <b>local</b> <b>market</b> makers relative to their non-local counterparts are associated with significant positive abnormal returns, consistent with <b>local</b> <b>market</b> makers possessing information advantages. In summary, our results suggest that the information advantages of <b>local</b> <b>market</b> makers may be a contributing factor to the reduction in the cost of trading.

Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy.

The foundations of around 15 burghs {{can be traced to}} the reign of David I and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from international trade they mainly acted as <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> and centres of craftsmanship. In general, burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands than nationally or internationally, relying on them for food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curÃ­) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E

Tank, through a contact in Denmark, informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tankâs new generation of fighters. Galland accepted and flew to Argentina. He settled with Gisela in El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Galland enjoyed the slow life.
