40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} (i) {{evaluate}} the immediate {{effect of a}} soft knee brace on pain, activity <b>limitations,</b> <b>self-reported</b> knee instability, and self-reported knee confidence, and (ii) to assess the difference in effect between a non-tight and a tight soft brace in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Forty-four patients with knee OA and self-reported knee instability participated in the single-session, laboratory, experimental study. A within-subject design was used, comparing a soft brace with no brace, and comparing a non-tight with a tight soft brace. The outcome measures were pain, self-reported knee instability and knee confidence during level and perturbed walking on the treadmill and activity limitations (10 -m walk test and the {{get up and go}} (GUG) test). Linear mixed-effect model analysis for continuous outcomes and logistic generalized estimating equations for categorical outcomes were used to evaluate the effect of wearing a soft brace. Results: Wearing a soft brace significantly reduced pain during level walking (B[*]−[*] 0. 60, P[*]=[*] 0. 001) and perturbed walking (B[*]−[*] 0. 80, P[*]<[*] 0. 001), reduced the time to complete the 10 -m walk (B[*]−[*] 0. 23, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and the GUG tests (B[*]−[*] 0. 23, P[*]=[*] 0. 004), reduced self-reported knee instability during level walking (OR 0. 41, P[*]=[*] 0. 002) and perturbed walking (OR 0. 36, P[*]<[*] 0. 001), and reduced lack of confidence in the knees during level walking (OR 0. 45, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and perturbed walking (OR 0. 56, P[*]<[*] 0. 001), compared with not wearing a soft brace. There was no difference in effects between a non-tight and tight brace, except for the 10 -m walk test. Wearing a tight brace significantly reduced the time to complete the 10 -m walk test in comparison with wearing a non-tight brace (B[*]−[*] 0. 11, P[*]=[*] 0. 03). Conclusion: The results {{of this study indicate that}} a soft brace is an efficacious intervention targeting pain, activity <b>limitations,</b> <b>self-reported</b> knee instability, and knee confidence in the immediate term in patients with knee OA.

40|$|Because of {{a variety}} of access <b>limitations,</b> <b>self-reported</b> {{absenteeism}} from work is often employed in research concerning health, organizational behavior, and economics, and it is ubiquitous in large scale population surveys in these domains. Several well established cognitive and social-motivational biases suggest that self-reports of absence will exhibit convergent validity with records-based measures but that people will tend to underreport the behavior. We used meta-analysis to summarize the reliability, validity, and accuracy of absence self-reports. The results suggested that self-reports of absenteeism offer adequate test–retest reliability and that they exhibit reasonably good rank order convergence with organizational records. However, people have a decided tendency to underreport their absenteeism, although such underreporting has decreased over time. Also, self-reports were more accurate when sickness absence rather than absence for any reason was probed. It is concluded that self-reported absenteeism might serve as a valid measure in some correlational research designs. However, when accurate knowledge of absolute absenteeism levels is essential, the tendency to underreport could result in flawed policy decisions...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that health {{plays a major role}} in retirement decisions. The most important problem in including health in retirement models is the lack of availability of a good measure of health at the individual level in existing data sets. This problem is exacerbated when a model spanning multiple countries is desired, because self-reports on health may not be comparable across countries. Arguably, physical measures are less influenced by cultural and linguistic differences than self-reports on general health or even on health conditions. The authors develop a cross-country measurement model for health in which the relations between functional <b>limitations,</b> <b>self-reports,</b> and physical measures like grip strength are used to construct health indexes. Comparability across countries is achieved by using the physical measurements to define the measurement scales, and allowing other parameters to vary across countries to account for cultural and linguistic differences in response patterns.

However, as discussed in the “Methods” section, the {{results of the}} study did not provide any indications of CMV. Although EO and SL have an important effect on IWB, the other individual and contextual factors affecting IWB can be identified. In the present study, the reason of collecting data from a banking industry is to minimize the cross-industry variations in work systems and job titles in selected organizations. Furthermore, the reason why the banking sector was chosen for the research is that in today’s world, technology is intensively used in banking sector with their diversified modern marketing techniques, products and processes. However, results may show difference for other sectors or industries. For future research, generalizations can be made in relation to these variables through different cultures, economies and sectors. Furthermore, future research might benefit from considering an intentional examination of gender on SL. Additionally, SL strategies and EO dimensions can be examined in future studies which can determine SL strategies and EO dimensions contributing to IWB.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Women with thermal {{discomfort}} from cold extremities (hands and feet; TDCE) often suffer from prolonged sleep onset latency (SOL). Suppressed anger {{could contribute to}} the genesis of both TDCE and prolonged SOL. The aim {{of the study was}} to test the hypothesis whether stereotypic feminine gender socialization (SFGS) is related to anger suppression (experienced anger inwards, Anger-In), which in turn could affect TDCE and SOL. Methods 148 women, a sub-sample of a larger survey carried out in the Canton Basel-Stadt (Switzerland), sent back detailed postal questionnaires about SOL, TDCE, anger expression (STAXI, state -trait -anger -expression -inventory) and SFGS using a gender power inventory, estimating the degree of gender specific power expression explicitly within women by stereotypic feminine or male attribution. Statistics was performed by path analysis. Results A significant direct path was found from stereotypic feminine attribution to Anger-In and prolonged SOL. Additionally, a further indirect path from Anger-In via TDCE to SOL was found. In contrast, stereotypic male attribution was not related to Anger-In but was significantly associated with outwardly expressed anger. <b>Limitations</b> <b>Self-reported</b> data, retrospective cross-sectional survey, prospective studies are required including physiological measurements.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the demographic factors, impairments and activity limitations {{that contribute to}} health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). Method: Two hundred and ten individuals with idiopathic PD {{who participated in the}} baseline assessment of a randomized clinical trial were included. The Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire- 39 summary index was used to quantify HRQOL. In order to provide greater clarity regarding the determinants of HRQOL, path analysis was used to explore the relationships between the various predictors in relation to the functioning and disability framework of the International Classification of Functioning model. Results: The two models of HRQOL that were examined in this study had a reasonable fit with the data. Activity limitations were found to be the strongest predictor of HRQOL. Limitations in performing self-care activities contributed the most to HRQOL in Model 1 (β = 0. 38; p < 0. 05), while limitations in functional mobility had the largest contribution in Model 2 (β = − 0. 31; p < 0. 0005). Self-reported history of falls was also found to have a significant and direct relationship with HRQOL in both models (Model 1 β = − 0. 11; p < 0. 05; Model 2 β = − 0. 21; p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Health-related quality of life in PD is associated with self-care limitations, mobility <b>limitations,</b> <b>self-reported</b> history of falls and disease duration.

The aims {{of the present study}} were: 1) to assess whether BMI {{and depressed}} mood are independently associated with knee pain and activity limitations; and 2) to compare the relative contributions of BMI and depressed mood to knee pain and activity limitations. Methods. A cross-sectional study in 294 patients with clinical knee OA. Regression analyses were performed with knee pain or activity <b>limitations</b> (<b>self-reported</b> and performance-based) as dependent variables, and BMI and depressed mood as independent variables. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, marital status, education level, radiographic OA and comorbidity. Dominance analyses were performed to examine the relative contributions of BMI and depressed mood to knee pain and activity limitations. Results: BMI and depressed mood were positively and independently associated with knee pain and activity limitations. BMI and depressed mood explained small parts (3. 0 % and 2. 3 %, respectively) of variance in knee pain. BMI explained a substantial part of variance in both self-reported (9. 8 %) and performance-based (20. 4 %) activity limitations, while depressed mood explained a small part of variance (3. 1 % in self-reported and 2. 6 % in performance-based activity limitations). Conclusions: In patients with knee OA both BMI and depressed mood seem to be independently associated with knee pain and activity limitations. The contribution of BMI to activity limitations is most substantial, thereby offering a relevant target for interventions. © 2013 Holla et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

Methods We used cross-sectional data on adults aged ≥ 60 years (N = 5396) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to examine the association between the repeated chair rise test and self-reported difficulty rising from a chair.

40|$|Background To study whether {{persistent}} leisure-time {{physical activity}} (PA) during adulthood predicts use of antidepressants later in life. Methods The Finnish Twin Cohort comprises same-sex twin pairs born before 1958, of whom 11 325 individuals answered PA questions in 1975, 1981 and 1990 at {{a mean age}} of 44 years (range 33 – 60). PA volume over 15 -years was used as the predictor of subsequent use of antidepressants. Antidepressant use (measured as number of purchases) for 1995 – 2004 were collected from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (KELA) prescription register. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the use of antidepressants in pairs discordant for PA (642, including 164 monozygotic (MZ) pairs). Results Altogether 229 persons had used at least one prescribed antidepressant during the study period. Active co-twins had a lower risk (unadjusted OR 0. 80, 95 %CI 0. 67 – 0. 95) for using any amount of antidepressants than their inactive co-twins; trends being similar for DZ (0. 80, 0. 67 – 0. 97) and MZ pairs (0. 78, 0. 51 – 1. 17). The lowest odds ratio (0. 51, 0. 26 – 0. 98) was seen among MZ pairs after adjusting for BMI, smoking and binge drinking.

40|$|Maintenance of {{physical}} function with advancing age {{is vital to}} continued independent living, which is highly valued by older people. Although commonly associated with the ageing process, loss of functional ability may well be accelerated by inactivity and subsequent decreasing physical capacities, such as muscle performance or balance abilities. The impact of increased levels of activity on physical performance and functional ability was investigated by a single blind randomised controlled study. Two intervention programs, one based on increased levels {{of physical}} activity and the second on increased levels of social activity, were provided {{to a group of}} community-living participants aged 75 years and over. Another group, receiving no intervention was also included. The exercise intervention offered twice weekly sessions of exercise over a 16 -week period. This was designed and supervised by physiotherapists. The social intervention offered a weekly, two-hour session over 13 weeks. Baseline, post-intervention and follow-up assessments measured aspects of physical performance (muscle, balance, gait and step height performance) and functional ability (tiredness of limbs, mobility tiredness and the need for assistance with mobility and activities of daily living). In addition, all participants completed a monthly health and falls report. One hundred and forty-nine subjects were admitted into the study with 108 completing the intervention phase and all four assessments. Analysis of data indicated that the exercise intervention was effective in improving muscle performance (shoulder abduction mean difference 13. 00, 95 %CI 11. 63 - 14. 37; hip abduction mean difference 5. 97, 95 %CI 4. 73 - 7. 20; knee flexion mean difference 4. 10, 95 %CI 3. 32 - 4. 88; dorsiflexion mean difference 4. 72, 95 %CI 3. 74 - 5. 71), dynamic balance ability (Functional Reach mean difference 11. 45, 95 %CI 9. 41 - 13. 48), ++maximal gait speed (mean difference 0. 62, 95 %CI 0. 50 - 0. 74) and step height performance (mean difference 0. 19, 95 %CI 0. 01 - 0. 29). Improvements in dynamic balance and maximal walk performance were maintained for a period of four months following cessation of the intervention. The social program did not affect aspects of physical performance. Functional improvements were evident for both exercise and social subjects. Immediate improvements in limb tiredness (upper mean difference 0. 37, 95 %CI - 0. 11 - 0. 84; lower mean difference 0. 63, 95 %CI 0. 37 - 0. 89) and mobility tiredness (mean difference 1. 43, 95 %CI 1. 16 - 1. 70) and activities of daily living dependence (mean difference 0. 25, 95 %CI - 0. 23 - 0. 75) were demonstrated. Four and eight months later, exercise subjects had maintained the improvement in mobility tiredness and activities of daily living dependence. Mobility dependence showed a delayed improvement in both the exercise and social intervention participants. This improvement was not evident immediately following intervention, but emerged at both the four and eight month follow-up assessments. An intention to treat analysis (involving both completing and non-completing subjects) confirmed the usefulness of the exercise intervention as a strategy to improve and maintain functional ability in older subjects, specifically with regard to tiredness of the lower limbs, tiredness during mobility tasks and activities of daily living dependence. In addition, following the cessation of the exercise intervention, participants reported less mobility tiredness and dependence in activities of daily living tasks over the following eight-month period. The relationship between physical performance and functional ability indicated that muscle performance and limb tiredness were significantly associated. Decreased muscle performance of the upper limb was associated with reports of increased ++tiredness during functional activities involving the upper limb, such as combing hair and dressing the upper body. Similarly, decreased muscle performance of the lower limb, especially proximally, was associated with increasing tiredness of the lower limb during functional activities. Further, decreased proximal muscle performance of both the upper and lower limb was significantly associated with decreasing independence in the performance of physical activities of daily living. These results indicate the significant influence of muscle performance on functional ability, especially on tiredness of the limbs and activities of daily living dependence. The ability to predict future functional limitation, based on decreasing physical performance, was examined and shown to be of limited value. Hip muscle performance and changes in usual gait speed were poorly associated with increased lower limb tiredness and dependence in physical activities of daily living respectively. The lack of a robust relationship between variables of physical performance and functional ability measures indicates that loss of physical performance is not strongly associated with the development of functional <b>limitations.</b> <b>Self-reported</b> falls were monitored throughout the study. A significant {{increase in the number of}} participants reporting falls was evident in both the social intervention group and the control group throughout the study. In contrast, there was no change in the number of exercise participants reporting falls. These results suggest that the exercise intervention was effective at minimising the usual increase in the number of older people experiencing falls over time. The results of this study suggest that the exercise intervention program was effective in improving physical performance in elderly subjects. This also resulted in improved functional ability. Positive effects continued ++following completion of the program as improvements in mobility and activities of daily living tasks were demonstrated for a further eight months. By contrast, the social intervention program appeared to influence only the need for help with mobility tasks in the longer term. Increased physical activity, in the form of an exercise intervention program, specifically designed for community-living elderly people, can improve and maintain functional ability, both immediately and for up to eight months following the completion of the program. As such, involvement in exercise, even in the short-term, should be encouraged as a means of maintaining physical independence in later life. Therapists devising exercise programs specifically for older people should ensure that the associated outcome measures incorporate assessments of functional ability and not simply measures of impairment. This study has demonstrated that a real benefit of increased physical activity in older people may well be the increased physical independence associated with participation...|$|E

This study aimed at investigating the effect of different forms of child maltreatment experienced prior to age 14 (i. e., sexual abuse, physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence), and of friend support at age 14 on the psychological distress trajectory from age 14 to 24. Methods Participants were 605 adolescents from the general population involved in a 10 -year longitudinal study. Psychological distress was evaluated at ages 14, 16, 18 and 24. Child maltreatment prior to 14 years was retrospectively assessed at 14 and 24 years while perception of support from friends was evaluated at age 14. Results Multilevel growth modeling indicated that psychological distress followed a significant decreasing curvilinear trajectory, with participants reporting fewer distressing psychological symptoms after 18 years. All three forms of child maltreatment, as well as their cumulative effect, predicted more psychological distress over 10 years above and beyond the protective effect of support from friends.

Workers with positive reports {{were much more likely}} to separate from their employer and less likely to remain employed than workers who report no employer-related age discrimination. The findings for job separations, but not employment status, are robust to numerous attempts to correct the estimates for the inherent <b>limitations</b> of <b>self-reported</b> data, particularly heterogeneity in the propensity to report discrimination, the influence of mandatory retirement, and the possibility that other negative labor market outcomes are attributed to discrimination. ...|$|R
30|$|Results from {{validity}} {{studies indicate}} that of the three questionnaires, the PARA-SCI has the strongest relationships with criterion measures. During the development and evaluation of the PARA-SCI [27], criterion (V̇O 2 reserve) values displayed a very large correlation with cumulative (LTPA plus lifestyle) activity data (r[*]=[*] 0.79). When data was coded for intensity of activity, large to very large positive correlations were seen for moderate-intensity (r[*]=[*] 0.63) and heavy-intensity (r[*]=[*] 0.88) activity. However, this relationship was weak and non-significant for low-intensity activities (r[*]=[*] 0.27) and consequently, the PARA-SCI under-reported time spent doing activities of low intensity by 10 %. Therefore, although these findings indicate some evidence of convergent validity, the results also highlight <b>limitations</b> of <b>self-report</b> measures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pain, by definition, is a {{subjective}} experience, {{and as such}} its presence has usually been based on a <b>self-report.</b> However, <b>limitations</b> of <b>self-reports</b> for pain diagnostics, particularly for legal and insurance purposes, has led some to consider a brain-imaging–based objective measure of pain. This review will {{provide an overview of}} (1) differences between pain and nociception, (2) intersubject variability in pain perception and the associated brain structures and functional circuits, and (3) capabilities and limitations of current brain-imaging technologies. I then discuss how these factors impact objective proxies of pain. Finally, the ethical, privacy, and legal implications of a brain-imaging–based objective measure of pain are considered as potential future technological developments necessary to create a so-called “painometer test. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors content {{analyzed}} <b>self-reported</b> <b>limitations</b> {{and directions}} {{for future research}} in 1, 276 articles published between 1982 and 2007 in the Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, the Journal of Applied Psychology, the Journal of Management, and the Strategic Management Journal. In order of frequency, the majority of <b>self-reported</b> <b>limitations,</b> as well as {{directions for future research}}, pertains to threats to internal, external, and construct validity issues, and there is {{a significant increase in the}} reporting of these elements over time. Longitudinal analyses revealed that some of these increases varied across management subfields (i. e., business policy and strategy, organizational behavior, organizational theory, and human resource management), indicating unique research contexts within some research domains. Based on the analyses of <b>self-reported</b> <b>limitations</b> and future research directions, the authors offer eight guidelines for authors, reviewers, and editors. These guidelines refer to the need for authors to report limitations and to use a separate section for them and the need for reviewers to list limitations in their evaluations of manuscripts; authors and reviewers should prioritize limitations, and authors should report them in a way that describes their consequences for the interpretation of results. The guidelines for directions for future research focus on positioning them as a starting point for future research endeavors and for the advancement of theoretical issues. The authors also offer recommendations on how to use limitations and future research directions for the training of researchers. It is hoped that the adoption of these proposed guidelines and recommendations will maximize their value so that they can serve as true catalysts for further scientific progress in the field of management...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} extend {{research}} exploring proactivity and its antecedents using novel experimental methods to address notable <b>limitations</b> in <b>self-report</b> designs. Fifty-three psychology students performed a simulated in-basket memo task requiring proactive problem-solving, and the proactivity of participants’ solutions {{were evaluated by}} judges following pre-determined criteria. The relationship between motivation and proactivity was also explored, {{as it has been}} speculated that only autonomous motivations should affect proactivity (Parker, Bindl, & Strauss, 2010). Manipulation of task accountability was also investigated. Interesting trends were found with respect to intrinsic motivation and proactivity in particular. Implications for workplace proactivity are discussed. Additional research is currently extending this study with a broader population group, the results of which may be available for presentation. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background. Childhood asthma {{rates are}} highest among {{minorities}} and {{among those who}} reside in low-income communities. This {{is especially true of}} children who reside in colonias, which are defined as substandard housing communities in irregular rural settlements located along the US-Mexico border. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge acquired by participants before and after an educational intervention was provided. Methods. This study used the healthy homes training approach, including integrated pest management, identification of asthma triggers, and asthma case management, to increase asthma management awareness and control. This dual training approach combined a healthy homes module with asthma education and was implemented by certified promotoras (community health workers) in South Texas colonias. Promotoras are generally trusted and respected individuals who live in or around the communities in which they work. The promotoras identified and trained 108 parents of children aged between 5 and 12 years in households in Hidalgo County with lifetime asthma diagnosed by his/ her physician and of children who may not have been diagnosed by a health professional with asthma but suffer from symptoms of asthma. Results. Asthma management and healthy homes knowledge, including attitudes and practices, significantly improved among parents after the implementation of the dual training program. Of the 108 participants, 78 % had never received asthma education, 78 % had a child with lifetime asthma diagnosed by his/her physician, and 32 % reported having medical insurance. Pretest and posttest comparison results based on 9 out of 14 questions related to asthma triggers and healthy home principles showed a significant improvement in knowledge gained among the participants. Regardless of the study <b>limitations</b> (<b>self-report</b> instrument for the pretest and the posttest), the results showed that families in colonias living with asthma benefit from an integrated training approach...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the course of}} limitations in activities in elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee over a follow-up period of 3 years, and to identify prognostic factors of the course of limitations in activities, focusing on body functions, comorbidity, and cognitive functioning. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study with 3 years of follow-up. Measurements were conducted annually. Statistical analyses included t tests, univariate regression analyses, and multivariate regression analyses. SETTING: Rehabilitation centers and hospitals (Departments of Orthopedics, Rheumatology, and Rehabilitation) in The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N= 237) with hip or knee OA. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-perceived change, <b>self-reported</b> <b>limitations</b> in activities measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and observed limitations in activities (timed walking test). Prognostic factors: demographic data, clinical data, body function (pain, muscle strength, range of motion [ROM]), comorbidity, and cognitive functioning (cognitive decline, memory, attention). RESULTS: <b>Self-reported</b> <b>limitations</b> in activities measured by the WOMAC improved slightly after 3 -year follow-up. In knee OA, reduced ROM at 1 -year follow-up (beta=. 120), increased pain at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 177), and higher morbidity count (beta=-. 180) predicted worsening of <b>self-reported</b> <b>limitations</b> in activities. In hip OA, reduced ROM at 1 -year follow-up (beta=. 201 for hip external rotation and beta=. 144 for knee extension), increased pain at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 134), higher morbidity count (beta=-. 220), or the presence of moderate to severe cardiac disease (beta=-. 214) and poorer cognitive functioning (beta=. 181) predicted worsening of <b>self-reported</b> <b>limitations</b> in activities. Performance-based limitations in activities measured by the timed walking test did not change after 3 years of follow-up. In knee OA, decreased muscle strength at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 272) and higher morbidity count (beta=. 199) predicted worsening of performance-based limitations in activities. In hip OA, better ROM (beta=. 182), higher morbidity count (beta=. 232), or the presence of moderate to severe cardiac and eye-ear-nose-throat disease (beta=. 210 and beta=. 188, respectively) and older age (beta=. 355) predicted worsening of performance-based limitations in activities. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, at the group level, limitations in activities of patients with OA of the hip or knee recruited from hospitals and rehabilitation centers seem fairly stable during the first 3 years of follow-up. However, {{at the level of}} individual patients, considerable variation occurs. Prognostic factors for worsening of limitations in activities include increased pain, reduced ROM, and decreased muscle strength at 1 -year follow-up; higher morbidity count; {{and to a lesser extent}} poor cognitive functioning.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{prevalence}} {{and consequences of}} age discrimination in the workplace by analyzing self-reports of discrimination by respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men. Age discrimination was reported in seven percent of our cases, during the period 1966 - 1980. Workers with positive reports {{were much more likely}} to separate from their employer and less likely to remain employed than workers who report no age discrimination. The estimated effect of reported discrimination remains large and significant even when controlling for the existence of mandatory retirement provisions on the current job. These findings are generally robust to numerous attempts to correct the estimates for the inherent <b>limitations</b> of <b>self-reported</b> data, particularly the potential heterogeneity bias that arises from differences in the propensity to report discrimination, and the possibility that discrimination is reported in response to other negative labor market outcomes. ...|$|R
