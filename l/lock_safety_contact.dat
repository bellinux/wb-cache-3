50|$|The typical {{design of}} a first-generation safety relay {{is based on the}} classic three-contactor combination. The {{redundant}} design ensures that wiring errors do not lead to the loss of the safety function. Two relays (K1, K2) with positive-guided contacts provide the safe switching contacts. The two input circuits CH1 and CH2 each activate one of the two internal relays. The circuit is activated via the start relay K3. There is another monitoring circuit between the connection points Y1 and Y2 (feedback loop). This connection is used to check and monitor the position of actuators, which are activated or shut down via the <b>safety</b> <b>contacts.</b> The device is designed {{in such a way that}} any faults in the input circuit are detected, e.g. contact welding on an emergency off/emergency stop pushbutton or on one of the <b>safety</b> <b>contacts</b> on the output relay. The safety device stops the device switching back on and thereby stops the activation of relays K1 and K2.|$|R
