5000|$|Sivananda Radha's {{aim was to}} {{interpret}} the ancient yogic teachings of the East {{so that they could}} be understood and applied in the West. She presented yoga as a philosophical and spiritual system in a way that accessible to anyone willing to make a commitment to their own development. She welcomed students from all cultures and spiritual traditions and helped people discover the purpose of their lives. Her teachings integrate yoga practices with personal development. They include personal exploration workshops developed by Sivananda Radha - <b>Life</b> <b>Seal,</b> Straight Walk, Ideals, Two Selves and Identification. Self-inquiry and reflection are foundations, with questions such as: 'Who am I?' 'What is life all about?' 'What makes my life worthwhile?' 'How do I prepare {{for the rest of my}} life?' [...] In 1988 in an interview with Hinduism Today Magazine, Sivananda Radha explained, ‘The main thing I try to do is have my students bring quality into their lives. To me, people are not spiritual if this quality is not there in their lives - even if they meditate six hours a day. By quality I mean that which comes from deep inside and shows up in their actions, their treatment of others and the way they do their jobs.’ ...|$|E

High speeds combined with high temperatures make turbomachinery sealing applications even more challenging.

The high temperature friction and wear characteristics of cobalt superalloys, Haynes 25, 188 and 214 sheets, rubbed against Hastelloy X pins are presented in this work.

40|$|Elastomer seals {{are widely}} used in the {{petroleum}} industry. Seal failure can be very expensive, due to losses in production and high maintenance costs. Another aspect of this problem is the difficulty in predicting the working life, of a specific elastomeric seal in a specific application, at the design stage. The objective of the present work is to develop the theoretical and computational seal life model to assist reliable prediction of seal <b>life.</b> <b>Seal</b> life computer software has been developed to model fluid ingress into elastomeric seals and the resulting long term material property changes caused by volume swell and chemical reaction between elastomer and ingressed fluid. The approach used is to model diffusion using a finite element method. This permits application {{to a wide range}} of seal geometries. The mathematical model of diffusion is coupled with chemical reaction equations of second order to model chemical ageing processes in the seal. To model the effects of swell, volume of absorbed fluid is coupled with Young's modulus. Physical, as opposed to chemical, stress relaxation is not incorporated since the short time scale of this enable direct measurements to be made. The software has been tested against experimental data for a number of elastomer / operating condition combinations. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) and nitrile rubber aged in air or high pressure water; nitrile and hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) aged in high temperature, high pressure hydrocarbon liquid. The software has also been found useful for calculating required soak time in planning rig tests for the study of explosive decompression caused by absorbed gas in elastomers. Pending further development of the software, long term prediction of retained sealing force of O-rings in high temperature, high pressure water is calculated from compression set by a semi-empirical approach. Results are compared with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical seals {{are used}} {{extensively}} to seal machinery such as pumps, mixers and agitators in the oil, petrochemical and chemical industries. The performance of such machinery is critically dependent on these devices. Seal failures {{may result in}} the escape of dangerous chemicals, possibly causing injury or loss of <b>life.</b> <b>Seal</b> performance {{is limited by the}} choice of face materials available. These range from cast iron and stellited stainless steel to cemented and silicon carbides. The main factors that affect seal performance are the wear and corrosion of seal faces. This research investigated the feasibility of applying surface coating/treatments to seal materials, in order to provide improved seal performance. Various surface coating/treatment methods were considered; these included electroless nickel plating, ion plating, plasma nitriding, thermal spraying and high temperature diffusion processes. The best wear resistance, as evaluated by the Pin-on-Disc wear test method, was conferred by the sprayed tungsten carbide/nickel/tungsten-chromium carbide deposit, produced by the high energy plasma spraying (Jet-Kote) process. In general, no correlation was found between hardness and wear resistance or surface finish and friction. This is due primarily to the complexity of the wear and frictional oxidation, plastic deformation, ploughing, fracture and delamination. Corrosion resistance was evaluated by Tafel extrapolation, linear polarisation and anodic potentiodynamic polarisation techniques. The best corrosion performance was exhibited by an electroless nickel/titanium nitride duplex coating due to the passivity of the titanium nitride layer in the acidified salt solution. The surface coating/treatments were ranked using a systematic method, which also considered other properties such as adhesion, internal stress and resistance to thermal cracking. The sealing behaviour of surface coated/treated seals was investigated on an industrial seal testing rig. The best sealing performances were exhibited by the Jet-Kote and electroless nickel silicon carbide composite coated seals. The failure of the electroless nickel and electroless nickel/titanium nitride duplex coated seals was due to inadequate adhesion of the deposits to the substrate. Abrasion of the seal faces was the principal wear mechanism. For operation in an environment similar to the experimental system employed (acidified salt solution) the Jet-Kote deposit appears to be the best compromise...|$|E

40|$|Grease {{is one of}} {{the major}} bearing {{components}} and the performance of a grease lubricated bearing is strongly determined by the performance of the grease. This paper describes how grease knowledge is linked to improved rolling bearing performance. First the various performance indicators will be described such as rolling bearing <b>life,</b> <b>sealing</b> performance, bearing friction, bearing noise and grease life. Next, the dominating grease parameters and specifications on these aspects will be given. It will also be shown how re-lubrication will enhance the bearing performance. There is synergy between grease formulation and bearing design. In the last years new generation grease lubricated bearings have been developed where grease technology was used to provide significantly lower friction and longer grease life. This was achieved by developing better greases but also by improving the internal bearing design, which could be done by using modern advancements in understanding the lubrication mechanisms. Finally, an outlook will be given on future developments in lubricating greases for rolling bearings. The various test methods are not described in this paper.
