40|$|The {{lead-acid}} battery recycling {{is a major}} industrial activity (more than four million tonnes recycled lead per year) that generates large amounts of toxic wastes such as <b>lead</b> slag, <b>mattes</b> and acidic sludge, besides airborne emissions. This is a waste-producer industry that needs a definitive solution to avoid its negative environmental impact and getting a sustainable lead production. That is the principal target of the CLEANLEAD technology, which properly combines both hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical routes aiming to get zero-waste production, reducing the use of energy and resources in all phases of battery reprocessing, and consequently, greatly decreasing the operating cost. There will be no toxic emissions to land, water or air, and obtained products are pure lead metal or pure lead oxide, and commercial gypsum instead of waste sludge. Achievements after pilot plant trials of this new process were quite satisfactory, and preliminary economic estimate gave positive results, opening the way to further developments and potential applications...|$|R
50|$|After halftime, Cleveland {{forced a}} punt {{and got the}} ball on their own 40, where they {{proceeded}} {{to drive to the}} Colts 38. But once again their drive stalled and Cockroft missed a 50-yard field goal attempt. He got another chance {{as a result of a}} penalty on the play, but missed again from 45 yards on his next attempt. After an exchange of punts, Baltimore got the ball on the Cleveland 48 and drove to a 24-0 <b>lead</b> on <b>Matte's</b> third touchdown of the day. Meanwhile, Nelsen was benched and replaced by Frank Ryan, but this did nothing to improve Cleveland's misfortunes. On his first play, he fumbled the snap, and linebacker Don Shinnick recovered the ball on the Browns 20-yard line, leading to Michaels' second field goal, giving Baltimore a 27-0 lead on the second play of the 4th quarter. Ryan completed just 2 of 6 pass attempts for the rest of the game, while Colts running back Timmy Brown scored the final points on a 4-yard touchdown run.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} found that the {{dispersion}} of phases in copper-nickel sulfide-metal alloys influences their electrochemical properties. X-ray diffraction and optical and electron microscopy have been used to study structural characteristics of the samples prepared by crystallization of sulfide melts at different rates of 10 ÷ 103 K/s. High-rate cooling of a converter <b>matte</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of nonequilibrium sulfide phases and a metallic component dissolved in these phases. The electrochemical oxidation of copper-nickel sulfide alloys has been studied by voltammetry with a linear potential sweep. The data point to a reduction of the limiting oxidation currents of the sulfide alloys prepared by high-rate cooling. The compositions of the intermediate phases and solid products of the electrochemical oxidation, which form the passivating layer, have been determined. The electrolysis of dispersed sulfide alloys allows performing the process at low densities of the current and, thus, the diffusion limitations have been removed...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} impurity contents in concentrates, {{the control}} of the minor elements is an important issue for the oxygen bottom blown copper smelting process (Shuikoushan process or SKS process). In this work, the distribution behaviors of the minor elements (such as Pb, Zn, As, Sb, and Bi) among the matte, slag, and gas phases as a function of matte grades was investigated by adjusting the ratios of oxygen/ore in the SKS process. With a matte grade around 70 %, about 82 % As and 70 % Bi enters the gas phase, and about 70 % Sb and 64 % Zn reports to the slag phase, while 55 % <b>lead</b> enters the <b>matte</b> phase. The tendency of changes in the distribution of the minor elements in the SKS process is different from that in the Isasmelt process and the Flash smelting process. It may be concluded from this study that the distributions of the minor elements could be optimized to reduce adverse effects in the SKS process by regulating the matte grade...|$|R

40|$|Two routes were {{investigated}} to selectively recover lead and minor metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) from a sulfide-rich <b>lead</b> smelter residue, <b>matte.</b> The first route comprises a two-step leaching process that combines Fe(III) -HNO 3 leaching with roasting, followed by water leaching. In the first step, {{the efficiency of}} Pb leaching was 90 % at the optimum condition (L/S ratio 8, 0. 5 mol ⋅ L− 1 HNO 3, 0. 15 mol ⋅ L− 1 Fe(III), 25 °C). In the second step, roasting at 600 °C followed by water leaching at 50 °C selectively leached Ni, Cu, and Zn while fully converting iron sulfides to oxides. One-step oxidative pressure leaching in HNO 3 was investigated {{as an alternative to}} simultaneously leach Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn. At the optimal conditions (130 °C, 60 min, 0. 3 mol ⋅ L− 1 HNO 3, 0. 07 mol ⋅ L− 1 Fe(III), L/S ratio 20), Pb, Cu, Zn and Ni leaching were 92, 60, 70 and 66 %, respectively, while Fe leaching remained low (2 %). The leachates obtained from both leaching routes were treated by ion-exchange adsorption with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) functionalized chitosan-silica hybrid materials to investigate the selective recovery of Cu, Zn and Ni. The adsorption order appeared {{to be in the same}} order as the corresponding stability constants for complexes between the respective metal ions and free DTPA: Ca(II) < Zn(II) < Pb(II) ≈ Ni(II) < Cu(II). This allows not only to selectively recover Cu, Zn and Ni from the leachates, but also to mutually separate them by using the functionalized resin as a stationary phase in column chromatography. To avoid adsorbent contamination, Fe(III) and Pb(II) may be removed from the leachates in a pre-treatment step. Based on these results, the investigated methods can be combined as process steps of two possible routes for the selective recovery of valuable metals from the studied secondary lead smelting residue. The two-step leaching process seems to be superior since a more concentrated solution of Cu, Ni, and Zn is produced in the 2 nd leaching step with low capital cost. status: publishe...|$|R

A process has been developed to significantly upgrade the BMR leach residues through pyrometallurgical processing, which include a multistep process of roasting under oxidising atmospheres, a two-step smelting process of the roasted calcine (with engineered slag chemistry and slag-refractory interactions) and subsequent atomisation of the molten alloy which can be fed as a slurry into the HCl/Cl 2 dissolution reactors in the precious metals refinery. These pyrometallurgical steps upgrade the BMR residue from a 45 – 50 % grade up to an alloy grade of ca. 90 % PGMs, whilst removing the most deleterious elements with major process impacts on the PMR. This paper will focus primarily on the roasting step and it will investigate the thermochemical and mineralogical changes occurring during roasting. These changes were evaluated through a combination of thermochemical modelling and experimental investigation. The roasting step needs to be in an oxidative environment in order to achieve the vapourisation of Se, Te, As, Os and S. The speciation of PGMs and their vapourisation behaviour are presented, as well as the sensitivity of precious metals deportment to changes in roast conditions. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. An {{understanding}} of the behaviour of chromium in mattes equilibrated with chrome-saturated slags {{is essential for the}} prediction and control of chromium deportment in these melts. The main ore reserves of South Africa’s platinum group metals (PGM) are associated with the Merensky and UG 2 reefs of the Bushveld Complex. The gradual depletion of the pyroxenitic Merensky reef over the years has necessitated the PGM industry to exploit the underlying chromiterich UG 2 reef. The problem with UG 2 reef is that it contains significant amounts of chromium, this being typically 5 % (reported as Cr 2 O 3) against < 1 % for the Merensky reef (in concentrates). Chromium has a number of deleterious effects on base-metal smelting processes. Under given conditions, it forms chromite spinels, which can accumulate and, over a period of time, form undesirable build-ups resulting in reduced furnace operational volume. The chromite spinels also tend to increase slag viscosity, thereby impacting negatively on the slag/matte separation, which <b>leads</b> to <b>matte</b> entrainment in slag. Moreover, high viscosities lead to problems with tapping of the furnace melts. Finally {{it can be said that}} chromium that deports to the matte during smelting will normally tend to precipitate as spinels during subsequent converting, and lead to the formation of very stable and unwanted slag foams in the converter. In literature, there exists very little published work on the behaviour of chromium in sulphur-saturated systems such as matte-smelting furnaces. The few publications that exist in this area do not cover the effect of controlling all the pertinent variables simultaneously on the behaviour of chromium in mattes in equilibrium with chromium-containing slags. Hence the main focus of the oxygen fugacities on the mineralogical and deportment behaviour of chromium in a matte-slag system. All the three variables (temperature, oxygen fugacity (pO 2), and sulphur fugacity (pS 2)) were investigated at three levels. Temperatures studied were 1300 °C, 1400 °C, and 1500 °C. Oxygen and sulphur fugacities were established by controlling the mix-ratios of purified carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and argon. Oxygen fugacities were maintained at 10 - 10 atm, 10 - 8 atm, and 10 - 6 atm; whereas sulphur fugacities were maintained at 10 - 6 atm, 10 - 4 atm, and 10 - 2 atm. In order to investigate the effect of each of these three variables (temperature, pS 2, and pO 2) at different levels of the other variables, a completely randomised 33 full factorial experimental design was adopted. The study revealed that chromium is generally present in matte as both dissolved CrS and as precipitated oxidic and sulphidic chromium spinel phases. It was shown that as the conditions become more oxidising (pO 2 = 10 - 6 atm), CrS (which is soluble in matte) becomes a predominant phase, and as the conditions become more reducing (pO 2 = 10 - 10 atm), the sulphospinel, daubreelite (FeCr 2 S 4), becomes a more predominant phase. Oxidic chromium spinels were found to be present in matte under the more oxidising conditions (pO 2 of 10 - 6 atm) of this investigation. The presence of the above-mentioned phases was confirmed using X-ray diffraction. Subject to the experimental conditions employed in this research, chromium was found to partition the least to matte under the conditions of; low temperature, high pO 2, and low pS 2. Conversely, chromium was found to partition the most to matte under the conditions of; high temperature, low pO 2, and high pS 2...|$|R
