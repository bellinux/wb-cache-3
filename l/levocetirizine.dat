50|$|<b>Levocetirizine</b> (as <b>levocetirizine</b> dihydrochloride) is a third-generation, non-sedating antihistamine, {{developed}} from the second-generation antihistamine cetirizine. Chemically, <b>levocetirizine</b> is the active levorotary enantiomer of cetirizine, also called the R-enantiomer of cetirizine. <b>Levocetirizine</b> is an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increase the blood supply to the area, and provides relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. It does not prevent the actual release of histamine from mast cells.|$|E

50|$|The {{studies in}} {{urticaria}} were double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group involving {{male and female}} patients over 18 year of age with symptomatic disease (idiopathic chronic urticaria) {{at the beginning of}} the study. Itching intensity as well as number and maximum size of wheals were assessed according to a 0-3 scale so that the Total Symptom Score (TSS) and other related parameters could clearly reflect the daily evolution of urticaria in each patient and treatment group. Parameters such as quality of life and discomfort were also assessed, and in the same way the type and frequency of AE, tolerability and general safety of treatment were registered. In this urticaria studies the daily oral administration during 28 days of bilastine 20 mg proves to have the same efficacy - for the reduction of TSS and the quality of life parameters- than the administration of <b>levocetirizine</b> 5 mg.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{urticaria}} is a vexing {{problem for}} patients and treating physicians alike. The EAACI/GA[2]LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines advocate an increased antihistamine dosage {{up to four}} times the standard, before adding leukotriene receptor antagonists. Patients are frequently intolerant of these higher dosages. We conducted this study {{to determine whether the}} addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists to the standard antihistamine dose was comparable to higher dosages of antihistamines alone, in terms of efficacy, safety and quality of life changes. We compared <b>levocetirizine</b> 10 mg (double dose of standard) versus a combination of <b>levocetirizine</b> 5 mg and montelukast 10 mg in cases of chronic urticaria not responding to single daily dose of 5 mg <b>levocetirizine.</b> Methods: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group phase IV trial (CTRI/ 2014 / 12 / 005261) was conducted on 120 patients of chronic urticaria of either sex not responding to 5 mg <b>levocetirizine.</b> Patients were randomized into receiving either <b>levocetirizine</b> 10 mg or <b>levocetirizine</b> 5 mg + montelukast 10 mg for 4 weeks. Primary outcome measures were Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) and Urticaria Total Severity Score (TSS). Routine hematological and biochemical tests and treatment-emergent adverse events were monitored for safety. Results: Fifty-two patients on <b>levocetirizine</b> 10 mg group and 51 patients on <b>levocetirizine</b> 5 mg + montelukast 10 mg group were analyzed. UAS and TSS reduced significantly in both treatment groups and reduction of score were comparable in between the groups (P = 0. 628, P = 0. 824, respectively). Among adverse effects, sedation was noted significantly more (P = 0. 013) in <b>levocetirizine</b> 10 mg group.

40|$|Background : Histamine is {{responsible}} for the wheal and flare reaction in various allergic conditions. Classical antihistamines are the drugs which block the H 1 receptors and are widely used in various allergic conditions, whereas H 2 blockers are mainly used for acid peptic disease. Although H 1 receptor-mediated actions of histamine are primarily responsible for vasodilatation, vasopermeability, and itching, it has been observed that combined blocking of both H 1 and H 2 receptors may provide better relief. Aim: To compare the efficacy of <b>levocetirizine</b> (H 1 blocker) versus <b>levocetirizine</b> and ranitidine (H 2 blocker) in suppressing histamine-induced wheal. Methods: Fifteen volunteers were given a single dose of <b>levocetirizine</b> 5 mg on day 1 and a single dose of <b>levocetirizine</b> 5 mg with ranitidine 150 mg twice a day on day 7. A pretest was performed by intradermal histamine prick test.

40|$|Background: Histamine is {{the major}} {{mediator}} of allergic reactions. Newer H 1 antihistaminics like <b>levocetirizine,</b> fexofenadine, and desloratadine {{are used in the}} treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and urticaria. The ability to block the cutaneous response to intradermal histamine is used to evaluate the potential of antihistamines. Aims: To compare the potency, onset, and duration of action of the commonly used antihistamines-levocetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine Methods: Thirty volunteers were given three single doses of <b>levocetirizine,</b> fexofenadine and desloratadine at weekly intervals. A pretest was performed by using the intradermal histamine prick test. After administration of the drugs, the intradermal test was repeated at &#x 00 BD;, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 h, and the sizes of the wheal were measured. The mean values were taken and were compared by using Levene&#x 2032;s t-test. Results: At 30 min, fexofenadine showed a statistically significant suppression of wheal size compared to <b>levocetirizine</b> and desloratadine. Two and three hours after administration, <b>levocetirizine</b> and fexofenadine showed statistically significant inhibition of wheal size while only <b>levocetirizine</b> had this effect after six hours when compared to desloratadine.

40|$|Background : Treatment {{of chronic}} {{idiopathic}} urticaria (CIU) is challenging {{because of its}} unpredictable course and negative influence {{on the quality of}} life. New treatments are being developed, but antihistaminics remain the cornerstone of the therapeutic approach. Newer generation antihistaminics such as loratadine and <b>levocetirizine</b> have already proved to be safe and efficacious for CIU. Objective : To choose the better drug between loratadine and <b>levocetirizine</b> for CIU, by comparing their efficacy and safety. Methods : A randomized, open, outdoor-based clinical study was conducted on 60 patients of CIU, to compare the two drugs. After initial clinical assessment and baseline investigations, loratadine was prescribed to 30 patients and <b>levocetirizine</b> to another 30 patients for four weeks. At follow-up, the patients were re-evaluated and then compared using different statistical tools. Result : The comparative study showed that the changes in differential eosinophil count (P = 0. 006) and absolute eosinophil count (P = 0. 003) in the <b>levocetirizine</b> group was statistically significant. The results of the Total Symptom Score showed better symptomatic improvement of CIU with <b>levocetirizine</b> as compared to loratadine.

40|$|Background: Allergic {{rhinitis}} is {{a significant}} public health concern in many developed countries. However, despite evidence for {{a significant impact on}} patients' quality of life (QoL) including sleep disruption and reduced daytime performance, allergic rhinitis remains under-managed and hence poorly controlled. This is largely owing to lack of knowledge about, and poor adherence to, established treatment guidelines. Scope: The panel considered available evidence and focused on four published studies on the second-generation antihistamine, <b>levocetirizine.</b> Three of these studies explored the clinical impact of <b>levocetirizine</b> in a broad range of different clinical settings. Findings: <b>Levocetirizine</b> demonstrated an increased benefit over other antihistamines in terms of a more durable antihistamine response: <b>levocetirizine</b> provided improved symptom relief at 24 hours compared to desloratadine or fexofenadine, two frequently prescribed second-generation antihistamines. <b>Levocetirizine</b> also maintained relief of the key symptoms of allergic rhinitis and improved patients' QoL over a treatment period of 6 months, in a real-life setting. The variable efficacy and durability of response of different antihistamines arise from differing modulatory effects on the H 1 -receptor. The speed of relief of symptoms with <b>levocetirizine</b> is supported by the pharmacokinetic data, which shows that steady state plasma concentrations are achieved in a shorter period of time than other second-generation histamines (additionally <b>levocetirizine</b> Tmax is reached in 0. 9 h). Conclusion: These findings support both the short-term and long-term use of <b>levocetirizine</b> in the clinical management of allergic rhinitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) ARIA Guidelines (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma), recommend using a combination of a non-sedating antihistamine with a decongestant, or glucocorticosteroids for treating allergic rhinitis – with the order and combination of treatment depending on severity and duration of symptoms...|$|E
