This debate has revolved around an "either-or" spectrum of (1) the theory of "Universality" that proposes a single court charged with implementing a single bankruptcy law to worldwide claimants, and (2) the theory of "Territoriality" that asserts each jurisdiction can only adjudicate the debtor's <b>insolvency</b> <b>on</b> a territorial basis and distribute local assets to local claimants. But, this debate yet has yielded no practical solution. This thesis suggests that these two theories are not mutually exclusive, and both may be utilized in developing a pragmatic and "better" international insolvency framework.
