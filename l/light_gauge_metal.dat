A suitably large building would normally require support columns, however, leading chief architect Joe Boehning to incorporate a roof designed by the Behlen company, a [...] "stress skin system" [...] made of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>metal</b> supported {{by a series of}} trusses. The 338 x 300 ft roof was constructed first, just above street level, and the ground beneath was then excavated to form the bowl of the arena. The playing surface lies 37 ft below grade, giving rise to the now-famous name. There are no supporting pillars in the seating area of the arena, so there are no obstructed views. Its compact area, steep grade, and the proximity of the seats to the floor contribute to its legendary noise level. The subterranean design won international recognition for Boehning. The arena originally had a seating capacity of 14,831 and cost a mere $1.4 million to build, about a fifth the cost of comparable facilities built at the time. The design allowed the foundation to rest directly on earth, eliminating the need for a steel structure to support the concrete, resulting in tremendous cost savings.|$|E

This report examines how the combustible core of expanded polystyrene insulated panel behaves when exposed to a radiant heat source at elevated temperatures. A number of fires in commercial/industrial buildings constructed from this product, mainly in Europe, have highlighted concerns about its performance and safety. A series of experiments were conducted which simulated the situation of a flue passing through a roof or ceiling in a building that was constructed from expanded polystyrene insulated panel. Specimens of the product were placed immediately adjacent to a stainless steel flue with surface temperatures ranging from 600 - 900 Â°C approximately. The behaviour of the expanded polystyrene core of the insulated panel was monitored.

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>metal</b> {{sheeting}} {{is often}} utilized {{in the building}} and bridge industries for concrete formwork. Although the in-plane stiffness and strength of the metal forms are commonly relied upon for stability bracing in buildings, the forms are generally not considered for bracing in steel bridge construction. The primary difference between the forming systems in the two industries is the method of connection between the forms and girders. In bridge construction, an eccentric support angle is incorporated into the connection details to achieve a uniform slab thickness along the girder length. While the eccentric connection is a benefit for slab construction, the flexible connection limits the amount of bracing provided by the forms. This paper presents results from {{the first phase of}} a research study investigating the bracing behavior of metal bridge deck forms. Shear diaphragm tests were conducted to determine the shear stiffness and strength of bridge deck forms, and modified connection details were developed that substantially improve the bracing behavior of the forms. The measured stiffness and strength of diaphragms with the modified connection often met or exceeded the values of diaphragms with conventional noneccentric connections. The experimental results for the diaphragms with the modified connection details dramatically improve the potential for bracing of steel bridge girders by metal deck forms...|$|E

These thin components manufactured from high strength steel, fail at points of stress concentration at fixings by crack formation and propagation in regions of large plastic deformation. Tests {{carried out by the}} CTS have shown that crack development is dependent not only on the load levels but also on the load sequence. Ginger and Henderson have shown that batten-truss connections are also subjected to fluctuating pressures with similar characteristics to cladding fasteners within the same parts of the roof and that G 550 top-hat battens are also susceptible to similar load level dependent fatigue failures. Rogers and Hancock conducted a comprehensive study on the properties of Australian G 550 material. However, there is a dearth of information on the crack initiation of this material adjacent to fasteners loaded in tension, for load cycles representative of wind loads. With the advent of sophisticated pressure loading systems that can simulate highly fluctuating wind loads in real time, the final paper will examine crack initiation of G 550 material adjacent to fastener locations...|$|E

In order to increase the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the girders in this stage, discrete or continuous bracing systems are often utilized in building and bridge constructions. <b>Light</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>metal</b> decking acts like a shear diaphragm and provides continuous lateral bracing to the beams. The building industry has long relied on metal decking to laterally support the beam top flanges. Bridge construction industry does not consider metal decking as a brace source due to the flexible connection between the girder and the diaphragm. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that metal sheeting can also be used in the bridge industry as construction bracing as long as the flexibility of the connections can be controlled by modifications. An adequate bracing system must possess sufficient strength and stiffness to control deformations and brace forces. A parametrical study was conducted to investigate the stiffness and strength of shear diaphragms used to brace stocky and slender steel I-beams. This thesis focuses on the strength requirements. The parametrical study consists of eigenvalue buckling analyses and large displacement analyses on a twin girder shear diaphragm system with various girder and metal deck configurations. A three-dimensional finite element analysis program was selected for the analyses. In the model metal deck-girder connections and the connection between adjacent decks are modeled respectively. Finite element model is verified by a full-scale twin-girder buckling test as the part of a previous study. According to the numerical study an equation is proposed for the estimation of the brace forces in the deck connections. The equation is shifted for possible deck and girder configurations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>gauge</b> {{steel frame}} wall systems are {{commonly}} used in industrial and commercial buildings, {{and there is a}} need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel frame wall studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs.
