5000|$|The Marine Insurance Act includes, as a schedule, a {{standard}} policy (known as the [...] "SG form"), which parties were {{at liberty to}} use if they wished. Because each term in the policy had been tested through at least two centuries of judicial precedent, the policy was extremely thorough. However, it was also expressed in rather archaic terms. In 1991, the London market produced a new standard policy wording known as the MAR 91 form using the Institute Clauses. The MAR form is simply a general statement of insurance; the Institute Clauses are used to set out the detail of the insurance cover. In practice, the policy document usually consists of the MAR form used as a cover, with the Clauses stapled to the inside. Typically, each clause will be stamped, with the stamp overlapping both onto the inside cover and to other clauses; this practice is used to avoid the substitution or removal of clauses.because marine insurance is typically underwritten on a subscription basis, the MAR form begins: We, the Underwriters, agree to bind ourselves each for his own part and not one for another .... In legal terms, liability under the policy is several and not joint, i.e., the underwriters are all liable together, but only for their share or proportion of the risk. If one underwriter should default, the remainder are not liable to pick {{his share of the}} claim. Typically, marine insurance is split between the vessels and the cargo. Insurance of the vessels is generally known as [...] "Hull and Machinery" [...] (H&M). A more restricted form of cover is [...] "Total Loss Only" [...] (TLO), generally used as a reinsurance, which only covers the total loss of the vessel and not any partial <b>loss.</b> <b>Cover</b> may be on either a [...] "voyage" [...] or [...] "time" [...] basis. The [...] "voyage" [...] basis covers transit between the ports set out in the policy; the [...] "time" [...] basis covers a period, typically one year, and is more common.|$|E

40|$|Faraday {{tomography}} allows {{astronomers to}} probe the distribution of magnetic field {{along the line of}} sight (LOS), but that can be achieved only after Faraday spectrum is interpreted. However, the interpretation is not straightforward, mainly because Faraday spectrum is complicated due to turbulent magnetic field; it ruins the one-to-one relation between the Faraday depth and the physical depth, and appears as many small-scale features in Faraday spectrum. In this paper, employing "simple toy models" for the magnetic field, we describe numerically as well as analytically the characteristic properties of Faraday spectrum. We show that Faraday spectrum along "multiple loss" can be used to extract the global properties of magnetic field. Specifically, considering face-on spiral galaxies and modeling turbulent magnetic field as a random field with single coherence length, we numerically calculate Faraday spectrum along a number of LOSs and its shape-characterizing parameters, that is, the moments. When multiple <b>LOSs</b> <b>cover</b> a region of ≳ (10 coherence length) ^ 2, the shape of Faraday spectrum becomes smooth and the shape-characterizing parameters are well specified. With the Faraday spectrum constructed as a sum of Gaussian functions with different means and variances, we analytically show that the parameters are expressed in terms of the regular and turbulent components of LOS magnetic field and the coherence length. We also consider the turbulent magnetic field modeled with power-law spectrum, and study how the magnetic field is revealed in Faraday spectrum. Our work suggests a way toward obtaining the information of magnetic field from Faraday tomography study. Comment: To appear in Ap...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{technical}} development of our era we are increasingly faced with claims of extremely large amounts. Whereas even in the past century large claims were mostly due to elemental or natural forces such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, there are today other causes, conditioned by human factors, that have considerably increased in importance. Another fact to be observed is that the risks that are passed on to the insurance market assume a more serious character year by year. Large building complexes, giant tankers, containers, atomic power stations, dams and jumbo jets pose for the insurers problems which are in no way easy to solve, since the risk covers required touch the limits of market capacity and their rating is subject to great uncertainties. At the same time, the readiness to underwrite such covers is a matter of utmost importance for the private insurance industry. For the coverage of such large risks, various insurance forms have been developed in the past years within the range of non-proportional methods. Besides the excess of loss and stop loss covers in their usual form, the cumulative <b>loss</b> <b>cover</b> and the largest claim cover have attracted particular attention. The cumulative risk cover has, for example, been dealt with in [11]) and has also been frequently offered in practice. The coverage of the largest claim or, more generally, of the sum of the n largest claims {{does not appear to have}} gained a proper foothold in practice in spite of various valuable contributions in this field—considering particularly [2], [3], [5], [8] and [14]. The fact that it was during 1963 / 64 that various authors analysed these problems is no coincidence, for it was then that in two ASTIN Colloquia these topics were discusse...|$|E

A large body of literature has investigated the factors influencing tree <b>cover</b> <b>loss,</b> usually at the global or regional scale and focusing on the quantity issue: how are the rate and extent of tree <b>cover</b> <b>loss</b> influenced by different factors? This paper has two objectives. The first is to pinpoint factors influencing the locations of tree <b>cover</b> <b>loss</b> and gain (the location issue) at the pixel level. The second is to evaluate the heterogeneous importance of factors in two periods of 1991 through 2002 and 2002 through 2013 and in four counties within the Li River Basin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. The random forests technique was adopted to model the responses of tree <b>cover</b> <b>loss</b> and gain probabilities of sampled pixels to initial landscape pattern factors, biophysical factors and proximity factors. A ranking of factor importance {{and a set of}} important factors were derived for each county and time period.
