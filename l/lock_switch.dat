500|$|Apple's website {{mentions}} only RAM as user-serviceable, though {{third party}} tear-downs show nearly all components {{can be removed}} and replaced. A <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> on the aluminum casing allows for {{easy access to the}} internals, as well as fitting a security lock with its own cable, and components are secured with standard screws. The flash storage and GPUs use proprietary connectors and are specially sized to fit into the enclosure. Unlike the rest of the Macintosh line the CPU is not soldered to the logic board and can be replaced with another LGA 2011 socket processor, including processor options not offered by Apple. The type of RAM modules that Apple supplies with the late-2013 Mac Pro are either ECC [...] (UDIMM) on the up to 8GB modules (shown on each module as PC3-14900E). The optional 16GB modules are ECC [...] (RDIMM) modules (shown on each module as PC3-14900R). [...] The higher-capacity 32GB modules that some third-party vendors offer are also RDIMM. [...] The UDIMM and RDIMM module types cannot be mixed. [...] Apple publishes recommended configurations to use.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{interior}} controls such as {{the steering}} wheel, cruise control, and door <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> were redesigned. Toyota included a [...] speedometer instead of the traditional 85mph (140km/h) one and the automatic climate control display was also changed. The previous year's cassette and equalizer stereo option was now made a standard feature.|$|E
2500|$|For 2006, two {{additional}} colors were added, Spice Red Metallic and Brazen Orange Metallic, while Midnight Blue Metallic and Yellow Jacket were dropped. Changes for 2006 included revised blacked-out tail lamps, illuminated steering wheel radio controls, faster moving power seat motors, and an interior power door <b>lock</b> <b>switch.</b> The climate control button for the A/C {{also had the}} word [...] "Defog" [...] added to it for the 2006 model year.

5000|$|An unusual {{interior}} change {{placed the}} power window switches {{flat against the}} door panel, whereas the window switches for the first generation and third generation extended from the door panels and were oriented in a horizontal position and were located underneath the drivers or occupants hands for easy location and use, and integrated into the door pull and armrest. The express up feature for the driver's window was also removed, leaving express down only. The power door <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> design was upgraded to a more conventional door <b>lock</b> <b>switch,</b> installed next to the power window switches, with a secondary power <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> installed for the front passenger. This approach was also used on the 1990-1993 Honda Integra ...|$|E

50|$|A larger radiator, {{heater core}} inlets and hoses were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance. Door lock cylinders and ignition <b>lock</b> <b>switches</b> were also revised for greater theft protection. The standard 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 engine got a slight detuning for better fuel economy, while the 7.5 L V8 soldiered on {{for one more}} year.|$|R
50|$|The Door Control Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like <b>locking,</b> driver door <b>switch</b> pad, child <b>lock</b> <b>switches,</b> etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|R

Similarly at the rear, the badging was [...] "GT" [...] and [...] "quattro" [...] respectively. The quattro versions also used the Ur-Quattro rear windscreen with [...] "quattro" [...] written into the heater elements (very obviously so on a cold and frosty morning), and the front grille was also adorned with the [...] "quattro" [...] badge from the Ur-Q. Inside, the cabin was identical except that the centre console received a differential <b>lock</b> <b>switch,</b> and LED bargraph displays in place of the GT's three analogue-style gauges. Some Coupé quattros were distinguished by a body-coloured rear spoiler.|$|E

5000|$|As {{part of its}} 1995 Mid-cycle refresh, the {{interior}} saw {{a greater degree of}} change than the exterior. To bring the design up to date (and in line {{with the rest of the}} Lincoln line), the dashboard and door panels featured a curved design, while influenced by the Mark VIII, the 6-passenger design of the Town Car precluded the adoption of a center console in {{the interior}}. To increase storage space, the dual center armrests of the front seats on Signature and Cartier models were redesigned to include storage compartments (to hold cassettes and the optional cellular telephone). The dashboard design continued into the new door panels, now with an illuminated power window and seat adjuster cluster, and back-lit power door <b>lock</b> <b>switch</b> placed higher on the door. Releases for the trunk and fuel door were moved from the dashboard onto the lower driver's door. Redesigned seat patterns now offered an available driver and front passenger electric heat feature. The radio antenna was integrated into the rear window. [...] Although the basic controls of the interior remained common across all Panther vehicles, the Town Car gained a model-specific instrument panel, featuring italicized readouts.|$|E

50|$|For 1991 and onwards, the M30 {{received}} only minor improvements. If the exterior driver's side door {{handle of the}} coupe was pulled while the doors were locked, the keyhole would illuminate and the interior dome light would come on. There was also an available central <b>locking</b> <b>switch</b> placed next to the Sonar Suspension II adjuster, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a standard feature or option for 1991-1992 models. Main gauge cluster text was changed to match the rest of the Infiniti lineup, and engine oil temperature and fuel gauges were switched around. The speedometer was also changed to an electric-type, as opposed to the cable-type used on the 1990 model.|$|R
