Sargant used narcosis (sleep treatment) to overcome a patient's refusal of electroconvulsive therapy, or even deliver it without their knowledge.

It presents a meta-analysis of the economic valuation literature and applies the estimated value function to assess the value of mangroves in Southeast Asia. We construct a database containing 130 value estimates, largely for mangroves in Southeast Asia. Values are standardised to US$ per hectare per year in 2007 prices. The mean and median values {{are found to be}} 4185 and 239 US$/ha/year respectively. The values of mangrove ecosystem services are highly variable across study sites due to, amongst other factors, the bio-physical characteristics of the site and the socio-economic characteristics of the beneficiaries of ecosystem services. We include explanatory variables in the meta-analysis to account for these influences on estimated mangrove values. A geographic information system (GIS) is used to quantify potentially important spatial variables, including the abundance of mangroves, the population of beneficiaries, and the density of roads in the vicinity of each study site. The meta-analytic value function is used to estimate the change in value of mangrove ecosystem services in Southeast Asia under a baseline scenario of mangrove <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 2000 – 2050.

40|$|The rumen fluid {{volume in}} sheep was {{measured}} by the method of phenol red dilution. Serial determinations made in 22 sheep deprived of food and water for up to 8 days showed that the greatest decrease in rumen fluid volume occurred during the first 2 - 3 days, the magnitude of the decrease depending on the initial volume. After the third day, the rate of loss of rumen fluid became slower as the rumen fluid volume became depleted. Sheep deprived of food only gave similar results to those deprived of both food and water. This absorption of rumen fluid during the first 2 - 3 days of food and water deprivation may account for the expansion Of plasma volume which has been recorded on the third day. In a group of eight sheep deprived of food and water for 4 days, the mean rumen volume <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> amounted to about half the body weight loss. These results support the view that in the sheep, the water balance of the body proper is kept virtually unaltered by fluid drawn from the alimentary tract during the first days of water deprivation. The animal does not become dehydrated, in the physiological sense, until this reserve is depleted. For this reason, the rumen may be regarded as a water “store” in sheep...|$|E
40|$|Over 400 million {{hectares}} of tropical forests are managed for timber production, comprising {{more than half}} of the remaining global permanent tropical forest estate. A growing proportion of tropical production forests are managed under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles. The objective of SFM is to achieve multiple benefits, including forest protection, biodiversity conservation and income enhancement. However, the outcomes resulting from the implementation of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems have seldom been examined rigorously. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to assess broad-scale impacts of SFM policy in tropical forest ecosystems. As a case study, we investigated deforestation and timber production in logging concessions in the Republic of Congo after the implementation of its SFM-based forestry law in 2000. Compliance with the forestry law was incomplete, allowing a unique opportunity to compare deforestation and legal timber production outcomes in concessions that implemented SFM-based policy compared to those that did not. Quasi-experimental matching analysis indicated that deforestation in matched parcels in compliant concessions was up to 2 -times higher than matched parcels in non-compliant concessions, equivalent to 67 km 2 of forest <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 2005 – 2010. Annual deforestation data demonstrated that deforestation was stable or increased in all six concessions following the respective date of compliance in each concession. Legal timber production increased (by 5 %, from 0. 18 to 0. 19 CBM/ha/yr) and became more stable, in compliant compared to non-compliant concessions. Our results suggest that the presence of SFM in a concession does not immediately lead to less deforestation. Rather, SFM policy may be associated with higher deforestation, because SFM is also associated with higher legal timber production, foreign capital, and international timber demand. Our findings measure short-term associations between SFM and deforestation in the Congo, and underscore the need for empirical evaluation of long-term impacts of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems worldwide...|$|E

The effect of virginiamycin on Gram positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of monensin (M) although the modes of actions differ. Very little information is available on the potential synergistic effects of V and M, especially in dairy cattle diets. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of combinations of V and M on the performance of dairy cows. Forty high producing Holstein cows were blocked according to previous milk production and randomly allocated to one of the following lucerne based total mixed diets: 1) Control, no medication (C); 2) Control plus 20 ppm virginiamycin (V); 3) Control plus 15 ppm monensin (M); 4) Control plus 20 ppm virginiamycin and 15 ppm monensin (V+M). The experimental period was from 21 days prepartum until 60 days postpartum. Data were analysed according to a randomized block design, using the model GLM procedure (SAS, 2001). Dry matter intake varied from 23. 6 kg/d to 25. 4 kg/d and did not differ between treatments (P> 0. 10). Milk production was higher (P 0. 10). Milk fat % was lower for cows receiving M (3. 42 %) and the control (3. 62 %) when compared to treatment V+M (3. 86 %) (P< 0. 10). Milk protein and MUN did not differ. Body weight <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> from calving until day 60 postpartum, tended (P< 0. 15) to be less for cows receiving V+M (- 8. 1 kg) when compared to the control (- 34. 2 kg) and M (- 31. 9 kg) treatments. Both treatments M and V respectively, decreased blood BHBA and treatment M increased blood glucose (P< 0. 10) when compared to the control diet.

40|$|Introduction: in 1994, a {{study was}} {{performed}} with 200 {{children and adolescents}} suffering from hearing toss. It concluded that the diagnostic confirmation of hearing toss within 2 years of age occurred in just 13 % of the cases, although 56 % were suspected in that phase. the loss of time of over 2 years between suspicion and confirmation of hearing loss occurred in 42 % of the cases. Objectives: the comparison of the main hearing loss etiologies-genetic cause, consanguinity, congenital rubella, meningitis, perinatal. events and unknown causes-in children and adolescents in the periods of 1990 - 1994 and 1994 - 2000; comparison of incidence, in mates and females, for each etiology and among the others; comparison of age at the first consultation, for each and among them; and the investigation {{as to whether the}} time between suspicion and diagnosis of hearing Loss was different for each etiology and among the others. Methods: During the period of 1990 - 2000, of the 519 children and adolescents with hearing toss, 442 individuals were selected, in the two moments of the study: 1990 - 1994 and 1994 - 2000. the variables used were: sex, age at first consultation, suspected etiotogy and time between suspicion and confirmation of hearing loss. Results: Congenital. rubella, genetic and perinatal. causes, meningitis, consanguinity and unknown causes were responsible for over 80 % of all etiologies, in both periods. There were no differences between the sexes in the periods studied. There was no relation among age, sex and etiology. Among the etiologies studied, there were no differences in the lengths of times between suspicion and confirmation of hearing loss, in each period separately. the comparative study showed that congenital rubella, genetic and unknown causes took longer times between suspicion and confirmation of hearing <b>loss,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of 1990 - 1994, as compared with 1994 - 2000. Conclusions: Congenital rubella remains as an important etiology, as welt post-meningitis deafness. Age at first consultation did not show relationship to the hearing loss etiology nor to sex. Independently of whether the etiology being pre-natal, perinatal or post-natal, congenital or acquired, the length of time between suspicion and confirmation of hearing loss did not differ between the periods studied, separately.
