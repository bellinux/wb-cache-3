40|$|Abstract. In {{the food}} industry, food {{preservation}} techniques {{that do not}} use chemical products are becoming more common. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research was to evaluate the antagonistic activity (antibiosis) of lactic-acid bacterial strains against pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic-acid bacterial strains were isolated from <b>layered</b> <b>cheese</b> and a commercial product (yogurt); and the same was done with pathogenic bacteria solely from <b>layered</b> <b>cheese.</b> The lactic-acid bacterial strains were identified as species from the Lactobacilli family, while the pathogenic bacteria from <b>layered</b> <b>cheese</b> were identified as Micrococcaceae family species (Staphylococcus aureus). Subsequently, in the same culture medium, bacteria of each species were sowed {{in order to determine the}} inhibitory activity ability of the Lactic Acid Bacteria (BAL) As a result, the highly antagonistic activity of the Lactobacilli (inhibition halos were larger than 0. 5 centimeters in diameter) against isolated pathogenic microorganisms was demonstrated...|$|E

50|$|Börek is {{the general}} name for salty {{pastries}} made with yufka (a thicker version of phyllo dough), which consists of thin layers of dough. Su böreği, made with boiled yufka/phyllo <b>layers,</b> <b>cheese</b> and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. Çiğ börek (also known as Tatar böreği) is fried and stuffed with minced meat. Kol böreği is another well-known type of börek that {{takes its name from}} its shape, as do fincan (coffee cup), muska (talisman), Gül böreği (rose) or Sigara böreği (cigarette). Other traditional Turkish böreks include Talaş böreği (phyllo dough filled with vegetables and diced meat), Puf böreği. Laz böreği is a sweet type of börek, widespread in the Black Sea region.|$|R
50|$|Some falsely {{believe that}} an Italian crust torta is a {{combination}} of <b>layered</b> <b>cheeses</b> and tomatoes to be spread onto bread. Italian torta is a pie similar to quiche and served as a brunch item. However, torta is different than quiche as the crust is mostly made of cheese, not egg. The crust can also be made from pizza dough. Ingredients vary as there are many variations of this torta. Traditional Italian torta usually includes ricotta cheese, parmesan, parsley, and onion. There are also variations that contain meat and some that are completely vegetarian. These vegetarian torte sometimes contain artichokes and spices for flavor. This torta is made in a springform pan instead of a traditional pie pan.|$|R

40|$|P>The aim of {{the study}} was (i) to detect changes of dry matter, NaCl and twenty-two free amino acids contents, pH and levels of {{selected}} microorganisms in four <b>layers</b> of <b>cheese</b> (from edge to core) during ripening and storage period and (ii) to describe the changes of the above-mentioned parameters caused by early relocation of cheese from optimum ripening conditions to refrigeration temperatures. The number of mesophilic aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria differed significantly (P < 0. 05) during the experiment dependent on the analysed layer and ripening/storage conditions. The free amino acid content differed significantly in individual analysed <b>layers</b> of <b>cheese</b> and also according to individual ripening/storage conditions. The highest content of free amino acids was found in samples stored at optimal ripening temperatures. Cheese hardness was also analysed and the lowest one was detected in samples ripened under optimal temperatures for the whole period.

5000|$|In Germany, the curd is {{continuously}} stirred {{to prevent}} it from getting hard, resulting in a thick, creamy texture. According to German regulations on cheese (Käseverordnung), [...] "fresh cheeses" [...] (Frischkäse) such as quark or cottage cheese must contain at least 73% water in the fat-free component. German quark is usually sold in plastic tubs with most or all of the whey. This type of quark has the firmness of sour cream but is slightly drier, resulting in a somewhat crumbly texture (like ricotta), and contains in its basic form about 0.2% fat. Quark with higher fat content is made by adding cream, and is often sold flavored with herbs, spices, or fruit. It has a very smooth and creamy texture and is slightly sweet (unlike sour cream). A firmer version called Schichtkäse (<b>layer</b> <b>cheese)</b> is often used for baking. Schichtkäse is distinguished from quark by having an added layer of cream sandwiched between two layers of quark.|$|R

His granddaughter has stated the following: [...] "My grandfather came to this country circa 1895 from Montella, Italy. Around 1910, he started his grocery store, called Dominic Conti's Grocery Store, on Mill Street in Paterson, New Jersey where he was selling the traditional Italian sandwiches. His sandwiches were made from a recipe he brought with him from Italy, which consisted of a long crust roll, filled with cold cuts, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, onions, oil, vinegar, Italian herbs and spices, salt, and pepper. The sandwich started with a <b>layer</b> of <b>cheese</b> and ended with a <b>layer</b> of <b>cheese</b> (this was so the bread wouldn't get soggy)." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{potential}} of the 400 - 640 nm emission fluorescence spectra after excitation set at 380 nm to monitor the changes in spectra and oxidation of 24 semi-hard cheeses, produced during autumn (n = 12) and summer (n = 12) periods, throughout ripening. Emission fluorescence spectra were recorded at the surface and at the inner <b>layers</b> of <b>cheeses</b> at 2, 30 and 60 days of ripening. The factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) applied on the first 5 principal components (PCs) of the principal component analysis (PCA) carried out on the 400 - 640 nm emission spectral data set recorded at the surface <b>layers</b> of <b>cheeses</b> produced during autumn or summer period showed a good discrimination of cheeses. Less good classification was obtained from cheese samples cut at the inner layers. In a second step, the 400 - 640 nm emission fluorescence spectra recorded at the surface or the inner <b>layers</b> of <b>cheeses</b> produced during autumn and summer periods were gathered into one matrix and analysed by FDA. Considering fluorescence spectra recorded at the inner layers. correct classification was observed for 67. 4 % and 62. 3 % for the calibration and cross-validation samples, respectively. Better classification was obtained for cheeses cut at the surface layers since 93. 7 % and 90. 3 % of the calibration and cross-validation samples respectively, were correctly classified. The obtained results showed that the 400 - 640 nm emission fluorescence spectra were primarily affected by light and oxygen then by the physico-chemical changes that occurred throughout ripening.
