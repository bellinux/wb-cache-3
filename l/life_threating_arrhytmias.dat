40|$|Background Posttraumatic {{growth is}} {{described}} as a process of restructuring of experience and positive changes in life attitudes. According to theoretical postulates, posttraumatic growth is a result of adaptive coping strategies that have cognitive character. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate relationships between posttraumatic growth, cognitive coping strategies and the severity of <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> experience in a group of patients who had experienced myocardial infarction. Participants and procedure Fifty-three patients who had experienced their first myocardial infarction (32 men and 21 women) participated in the study and completed questionnaires measuring posttraumatic growth and cognitive coping strategies as well as a rating scale measuring the severity of <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> experience during the infarction. Results The results indicate that posttraumatic growth in general and in the aspect of changes in self, relationships or affirmation of life was related to cognitive coping strategies. In the case of spiritual changes, severity of <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> experience was significant while coping was not. Patients’ gender, age or post-myocardial infarction time appeared to be non-significant. Conclusions Generally, theories postulating that posttraumatic growth is a result of cognitive coping strategies found some support. Moreover, it may be concluded that posttraumatic growth appears only in some percentage of persons experiencing a specific trauma of myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Utilizing a {{computer}} algorithm, information from calls to an ambulance service {{was used to}} calculate the risk of patients being in a life-threatening condition (<b>life</b> <b>threat</b> risk), {{at the time of the}} call. If the estimated <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> risk was higher than 10 %, the probability that a patient faced a risk of dying was recognized as very high and categorized as category A+. The present study aimed to review the accuracy of the algorithm. Methods Data collected for six months from the Yokohama new emergency system was used. In the system, emergency call workers interviewed ambulance callers to obtain information necessary to assess triage, which included consciousness level, breathing status, walking ability, position, and complexion. An emergency patient's <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> risk was then estimated by {{a computer}} algorithm applying logistic models. This study compared the estimated <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> risk occurring at the time of the emergency call to the patients' state or severity of condition, i. e. death confirmed at the scene by ambulance crews, resulted in death at emergency departments, life-threatening condition with occurrence of cardiac and/or pulmonary arrest (CPA), life-threatening condition without CPA, serious but not life-threatening condition, moderate condition, and mild condition. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of the algorithm for categorizing A+ were calculated. Results The number of emergency dispatches over the six months was 73, 992. Triage assessment was conducted for 68, 692 of these calls. The study targets account for 88. 8 % of patients who were involved in triage calls. There were 2, 349 cases where the patient had died or had suffered CPA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of the algorithm at predicting cases that would result in a death or CPA were 80. 2 % (95 % confidence interval: 78. 6 % - 81. 8 %), 96. 0 % (95. 8 % - 96. 1 %), 42. 6 % (41. 1 % - 44. 0 %), 99. 2 % (99. 2 % - 99. 3 %), 19. 9 (18. 8 - 21. 1), and 0. 21 (0. 19 - 0. 22), respectively. Conclusion A patient's <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> risk was quantitatively assessed at the moment of the emergency call with a moderate level of accuracy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Former {{studies suggest}} that prior {{exposure}} to adverse experiences such as violence or sexual abuse increases vulnerability to posttraumatic stress reactions in victims of subsequent trauma. However, {{little is known about}} how such a history affects responses to terror in the general adolescent population. Objective: To explore the role of prior exposure to adverse experiences as risk factors for posttraumatic stress reactions to the Oslo Terror events. Method: We used data from 10, 220 high school students in a large cross-sectional survey of adolescents in Norway that took place seven months after the Oslo Terror events. Prior exposure assessed was: direct exposure to violence, witnessing of violence, and unwanted sexual acts. We explored how these prior adversities interact with well-established risk factors such as proximity to the events, perceived <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> during the terror events, and gender. Results: All types of prior exposure {{as well as the other}} risk factors were associated with terror-related post-traumatic stress reactions. The effects of prior adversities were, although small, independent of adolescents’ proximity to the terror events. Among prior adversities, only the effect of direct exposure to violence was moderated by perceived <b>life</b> <b>threat.</b> Exposure to prior adversities increased the risk of posttraumatic stress reactions equally for both genders, but proximity to the terror events and perceived <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> increased th...|$|R
40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) affects {{a minority of}} trauma-exposed persons and is associated with significant impairment. This longitudinal study examined risk factors for PTSD. We tested whether the presence of injuries resulting from trauma exposure predicted the course of PTSD symptoms. In addition, we tested whether gender, trauma type, perceived <b>life</b> <b>threat,</b> and peritraumatic dissociation predicted the onset of PTSD symptoms. 236 trauma-exposed civilians were assessed for PTSD symptoms with a structured interview at four occasions during 6 months posttrauma. Path analysis showed that a model in which the female gender, assault, perceived <b>life</b> <b>threat,</b> and peritraumatic dissociation predicted PTSD severity at 1 week, and injury predicted PTSD severity 8 weeks after the traumatic event showed the best fit. However, a similar model without injury showed comparable fit. It is concluded that injuries have a negligible effect on the course of PTS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} information on the relation between victimization status, crime factors, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and several other psychological disorders among a community sample of women. Results indicated that victims of crime {{were more likely than}} nonvictims to suffer from PTSD, major depressive episode, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and simple phobia. Furthermore, <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> was associated with increased risk of major depression, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia. Completed rape was strongly related to almost every disorder assessed, while robbery and burglary were not related to any disorder. When demographics, victimization status, and crime factors were entered hierarchically into multivariate logistic regressions with PTSD in the final step, associations between victimization status, other crime characteristics (e. g., <b>life</b> <b>threat,</b> injury), and non-PTSD Axis I disorders were greatly reduced. This suggests that PTSD may be an important mediating factor in the victimization-psychopathology relation for many disorders...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Former cancer patients' {{quality of}} life can be {{improved}} by offering social comparison information. Whether patients, however, benefit from the information may depend on how negative they perceive their present and their future. Design: We conducted a randomised experimental field study with a pre- and post-measurement. Dutch former cancer patients - recruited through different media - were assigned to a social comparison intervention condition or a no-intervention control condition (experimental condition n = 62; control condition n = 88; M-age = 52 years). In the intervention condition, patients received a 20 min computer-tailored interview in audio format. Patients' present perceived <b>life</b> <b>threat</b> and future health expectations were measured at pretest.

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} posttraumatic growth (PTG) following {{childhood cancer}} survival and {{its association with}} demographic and disease/treatment variables, perceived treatment severity and <b>life</b> <b>threat,</b> and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Method Adolescent survivors of cancer (N = 150, ages 11 – 19), at least 1 year after treatment, and their mothers (N = 146) and fathers (N = 107) completed self-report measures of perceived treatment intensity and PTSS and a semistructured interview designed to identify posttraumatic responses and indicators of PTG including perceived positive changes for self, relationships, and life goals. Results A majority of adolescents and their mothers and fathers reported PTG. Greater perceived treatment severity and <b>life</b> <b>threat,</b> but not objective disease severity, was associated with PTG. PTG and PTSS were positively associated for the adolescent cancer survivors. Diagnosis after age 5 resulted in more perceived benefit and greater PTSS for adolescent survivors.

40|$|Background—Life stress {{contributes}} to symptom onset and exacerbation {{in the majority}} of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD); research evidence is conflicting, however, as to the strength of these effects.  Aims—To test prospectively the relation of chronic <b>life</b> stress <b>threat</b> to subsequent symptom intensity over time.  Patients—One hundred and seventeen consecutive outpatients satisfying the modified Rome criteria for IBS (66 % with one or more concurrent FD syndromes) participated.  Methods—The life stress and symptom intensity measures were determined from interview data collected independently at entry, and at six and 16 months; these measures assessed the potency of chronic <b>life</b> stress <b>threat</b> during the prior six months or more, and the severity and frequency of IBS and FD symptoms during the following two weeks.  Results—Chronic <b>life</b> stress <b>threat</b> was a powerful predictor of subsequent symptom intensity, explaining 97 % of the variance on this measure over 16 months. No patient exposed to even one chronic highly threatening stressor improved clinically (by 50 %) over the 16 months; all patients who improved did so in the absence of such a stressor.  Conclusion—The level of chronic <b>life</b> stress <b>threat</b> predicts the clinical outcome in most patients with IBS/FD. ...|$|R
