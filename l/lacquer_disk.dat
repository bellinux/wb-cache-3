A small and dashing looking man, Morrison wore a blue serge {{suit and a}} topcoat. Morrison mistakenly thought there were 106 people aboard the flight, when in reality there were 97 aboard. Thirty-five people died in addition to one fatality on the ground. The 16-inch green <b>lacquer</b> <b>disk</b> recordings were rushed back to Chicago by airplane and broadcast in full later that night. Portions were rebroadcast nationally by the NBC Radio network the next day. It {{was the first time}} that recordings of a news event were ever broadcast, and also the first coast-to-coast radio broadcast.

40|$|The {{different}} methods of protective coating {{used in a}} machine lacquering and the kind and quantity of wastes and methods of waste processing are reviewed. Based on this analysis new methods are proposed {{to reduce the amount}} of lacquer wastes improving at the same time economical and environmental process features. To reduce lacquer sludge formation the application of the electrical air-supported airless process in the liquid lacquer coating is proposed. Overspray recycling can be further improved by using one-component lacquers and by installing a <b>lacquer</b> receiver <b>disk.</b> (WEN) SIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 94 B 0584 / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|R
