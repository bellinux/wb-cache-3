5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic <b>linker</b> {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal <b>linker</b> as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the <b>linker</b> and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short <b>linker</b> peptide. The <b>linker</b> is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
25|$|A <b>linker</b> {{is a short}} {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} that tethers the fluorescent reporter protein fragment to the protein of interest, forming the fusion protein. When designing a <b>linker</b> sequence, one must ensure that the <b>linker</b> is sufficiently soluble and long to provide the fluorescent protein fragments with flexibility and freedom of movement so that the fragment and its partner fragment will collide frequently enough to reconstitute during the interaction of their respective fused proteins. Although it is not documented, {{it is possible that}} the length or the sequence of the <b>linker</b> may influence complementation of some proteins. Reported <b>linker</b> sequences RSIAT and RPACKIPNDLKQKVMNH (single amino acid code) and AAANSSIDLISVPVDSR (Sigma) have been successfully used in BiFC experiments.|$|E

In addition to the basic role of linking functional units together or releasing functional units (e.g., toxin release in drug delivery systems, affinity tag cleavage from tag-fused recombinant pharmaceutical proteins in the purification process), peptide <b>linkers</b> may offer many other advantages {{for the production of}} fusion proteins, such as improving biological activity and structural stability and achieving desirable biopharmaceutical pharmacokinetic profiles [324]. Therefore, peptide <b>linkers</b> play a variety of structural and functional roles in fusion proteins.|$|R
3000|$|If <b>linkers</b> {{occur in}} {{syntactic}} contexts higher than finite TP, one question arises. Are these high-level <b>linkers</b> canonical complementizers? If not, what syntactic properties distinguish {{them from the}} canonical ones? Low-level <b>linkers</b> may give rise to another question. Since vP- and VP-level <b>linkers</b> exist in Mayrinax Atayal, it is inappropriate to analyze all of them as canonical complementizers if they can occur in a syntactic context lower than CP. Similarly, TAM head analysis is untenable because vP-level <b>linkers</b> {{are unlikely to be}} TAM heads. If low-level <b>linkers</b> are not canonical C 0 or T 0 elements, which functional categories should they belong to? In addition to these status issues in structure, another major question remains.

30|$|Previous {{studies on}} Formosan linking constructions have focused mainly on {{complementation}} phenomena in individual languages. <b>Linkers</b> may have patterns with finite and non-finite complement clauses (Chen 2010; Tang 1999). There are mainly {{two types of}} analysis concerning the syntactic positions of <b>linkers.</b> First, <b>linkers</b> are not given specific syntactic status (Huang 1995). Second, <b>linkers</b> occupy head positions—they are either the complementizer heads (Liu 2011; Tang 1999) or the tense/aspect/modality (TAM 3) heads (Chen 2008, 2010). Although previous studies have achieved some descriptive/explanatory adequacy, the syntactic status of <b>linkers</b> remains controversial. “Non-specific status” analysis is inadequate in explaining the syntactic realization of linking constructions since canonical complementizers exist in Mayrinax Atayal according to Tang (1999) and Liu (2011). Complementizer analysis and aspectual head analysis may account for certain facets of linking constructions. These two analyses, however, encounter problems in other types of linking constructions. Mayrinax <b>linkers</b> are more extensively used than expected. Some <b>linkers</b> can occur in extremely high positions (above finite TP), as in (1 a), while some occur in extremely low positions (below vP and VP), as in (1 b–c).|$|R

The ligation products were detected by using denaturing PAGE silver stain and PCR method. About 0. 5 – 1 % of <b>linkers</b> A–B and E–F, and 0. 13 – 0. 5 % of <b>linkers</b> C–D could {{be joined by}} T 4 DNA ligases. About 0. 25 – 0. 77 % of <b>linkers</b> A–B and E–F, and 0. 06 – 0. 39 % of <b>linkers</b> C–D could be joined by E. coli DNA ligases. A 1 -base deletion (-G) and a 5 -base deletion (-GGAGC) could {{be found at the}} ligation junctions of the <b>linkers.</b> But about 80 % of the ligation products purified with a PCR product purification kit did not contain these base deletions, meaning that some <b>linkers</b> had been correctly joined by T 4 and E. coli DNA ligases. In addition, about 0. 025 – 0. 1 % of oligo 11 could be phosphorylated by commercial T 4 DNA ligase. The phosphorylation products could be increased when the phosphorylation reaction was extended from 1 hr to 2 hrs. We speculated that perhaps the <b>linkers</b> with 5 ′-OH ends could be joined by T 4 or E. coli DNA ligase in 2 different manners: (i) about 0. 025 – 0. 1 % of <b>linkers</b> could be phosphorylated by commercial T 4 DNA ligase, and then these phosphorylated <b>linkers</b> could be joined to the 3 ′-OH ends of other linkers; and (ii) the <b>linkers</b> could delete one or more nucleotide(s) at their 5 ′-ends and thereby generated some 5 ′-phosphate ends, and then these 5 ′-phosphate ends could be joined to the 3 ′-OH ends of other <b>linkers</b> at a low efficiency. Our findings may probably indicate that some DNA nicks with 5 ′-OH ends can be joined by commercial T 4 or E. coli DNA ligase {{even in the absence of}} PNK...|$|R

To answer these questions, the constituent sizes of the complements headed by low <b>linkers</b> must be tested and determined.

30|$|Chemical <b>linkers</b> {{have been}} widely used to modify or {{crosslink}} biomolecules, such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids and drugs, synthetic polymers and solid surfaces with functional molecules and materials. Chemical <b>linkers</b> can be characterized by the following properties: chemical specificity, reactive groups, spacer arm length, water solubility, cell membrane permeability, spontaneously reactive or photoreactive groups, and cleavability by such stimuli as pH, redox, and light. Particularly, spacer arm length and water solubility are important parameters for protein modifications and crosslinking using chemical <b>linkers.</b> For example, when biomolecules are functionalized with small molecules, such as fluorophores or bioorthogonal functional groups, rigid, short methylene arms are utilized as spacers. Various photocleavable, short chemical <b>linkers</b> were also developed to control the functions of crosslinked biomolecules [54, 262, 263]. In contrast, when proteins are functionalized with hydrophobic or large materials, hydrophilic, flexible, long spacer arms formed from PEG chains are often utilized to increase the water solubility of functionalized chemical <b>linkers</b> and to avoid steric hindrance between proteins and functionalized materials. We utilized PEG chains as chemical <b>linkers</b> to prepare a Fab’-green fluorescent protein (GFP) immunoconjugate for a homogeneous immunoassay [264], an enzyme-streptavidin conjugate for enzyme activity control [265, 266], and a Synechocystis sp. DnaB intein-TMP conjugate for in vitro protein ligation [267], and the results showed that the length of the PEG chemical <b>linkers</b> affected both the conjugation efficiency and the controllability of protein function. We also produced antibody-lipid and peptide-lipid conjugates for cell surface display [268 – 270] using PEG chain <b>linkers.</b> Although there are enormous bioconjugation applications for biomolecules using chemical <b>linkers,</b> the details of recent applications are reviewed elsewhere [271 – 279].|$|R

A data set of 300 unique protein chains with low pairwise sequence identity was clustered into {{only a few}} groups representing the preferred motifs. The <b>linkers</b> of two to eight residues for the nonredundant data set are designated H-Ln-H, H-Ln-E, E-Ln-H, E-Ln-E, where n is the length, H stands for alpha-helices, and E for beta-strands. Most of the clusters identified here corroborate earlier findings. However, 19 new clusters are identified in this paper, with many of them having seven and eight residue <b>linkers.</b> In our first analysis, the secondary structures flanking the <b>linkers</b> are both interacting and noninteracting {{and there is no}} precise angle of orientation between them. A second analysis was performed on a set of proteins with restricted orientations for the flanking elements, namely, mainly alpha class of proteins with orthogonal architecture.
