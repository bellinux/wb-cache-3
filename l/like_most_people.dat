Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E

Bombardment of the capital came to a halt. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process. Massoud had united political and cultural personalities, governors, commanders, clergymen and representatives to reach a lasting agreement. Massoud, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> in Afghanistan, saw this conference as a small hope for democracy and for free elections. His favourite for candidacy to the presidency was Dr. Mohammad Yusuf, the first democratic prime minister under Zahir Shah, the former king. In the first meeting representatives from 15 different Afghan provinces met, in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating. Massoud went unarmed to talk to several Taliban leaders in Maidan Shar, but the Taliban declined to join this political process. When Massoud returned safely, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life: he was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to execute Massoud while the possibility was there.|$|E

My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E

Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and [...] "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human." [...] Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not <b>like.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away.

This success led to {{a large number of}} the National Democrats party, including Simon Darby and Martin Wingfield defecting to the British National Party from 1999 to 2003. After the 2004 elections, the BBC and Searchlight created a documentary called The Secret Agent, featuring Jason Gwynne infiltrating the BNP. In it, Griffin and Mark Collett made comments critical of Islam. Following the documentary, Barclays Bank froze the party's accounts. Collett and Griffin were acquitted on charges of incitement to racial hatred in 2006. The BNP branded the BBC [...] "cockroaches". In Burnley, the BNP lost one of its councillors, Maureen Stowe, who left the party after claiming it was racist.

2500|$|Edwards {{argued that}} the {{adolescents}} of Mansfield Park are in many ways still children, and the danger of Lover's Vows is that the amateur actors cannot distinguish between acting and life, a point grasped by Mary who says [...] "What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?". In this regard, {{the danger of the}} Crawfords is that they are always acting, and for them, Lover's Vows is a way to win Edmund and Maria, as both the Betrams come to understand. Edwards argues that Mansfield Park is considered difficult today because [...] "There is little charm to these children, whose dominant emotion seems to be malice...only Fanny has full consciousness in the better sense, sympathetic understanding of what others feel." [...] For example, when Edmund agrees to act in Lover's Vows, Tom and Maria only feel [...] "glee" [...] at the thought of the would be clergyman acting in an improper play, Maria enjoys seeing the discomfort on Julia's face when she acts with Henry, and Mary tells Fanny to marry Henry to [...] "pay off the debts of one's sex" [...] and to have a [...] "triumph" [...] at the expense of her brother. Through Price is the most likeable character in the novel, even she has been made flawed by Austen as her morality is [...] "limited". Edwards called Price the [...] "most human" [...] of all the Austen heroines as she sometimes has negative emotions as when she tells Edmund that Mary wanted to marry him because she knew Tom was dying, and feels [...] "gaiety" [...] at his pain. Likewise, Edwards argued that Edmund was the [...] "most believable" [...] of Austen's heroes precisely he has [...] "limitations", and there is [...] "much here to respect" [...] about Edmund, a prodding, if honest and good hearted man. Edwards noted that even when Edmund saw Mary for the last time, it is implied he was still sad to [...] "close the door" [...] on her forever. Edwards argued that both Edmund and Fanny are flawed characters who are perfect for each other for that very reason. Edwards concluded [...] "Fanny and Edmund learn less, but that is the point; for once we are to consider people, who <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>people,</b> have no superabundance of wit and charm and wisdom are to get along in the world.
