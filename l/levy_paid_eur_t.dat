National level results show that stringent environmental policies have insignificant effect on foreign investors' location decision, and that transportation, economic growth, and regional location matters more. At the provincial level, stringent environmental policies reduce FDI in the less developed regions. foreign direct investment, environmental policy...|$|R

Famous families such as the Goulds, Vanderbilts, Sloans, and, Drexels had palatial summer residences nearby. A newspaper reporter in 1886 estimated that the net worth {{of a small group}} of Sunday morning congregants was more than $250 million. During summertime in the Gay Nineties, an $8,000 Sunday collection was not unusual. However, by 1925 the chapel was in dire financial straits, and only by generous contributions of local townspeople was it saved. A New York real estate magnate, Henry <b>Levy,</b> <b>paid</b> off its back taxes, despite not being a member of the church, or a Christian.

40|$|Private {{school fees}} are not tax {{deductible}} in Australia. Nor are fees or <b>levies</b> <b>paid</b> to public schools. However, many private schools and some public schools operate building or library funds to which parents and ex-students {{are encouraged to}} make tax-deductible donations. These donations can increase substantially the funds available to the schools and thereby permit fees to be lower than otherwise. This paper outlines contrasts the Australian Taxation office guidelines, which state that donations must be voluntary and that donors must expect nothing in return, with the statements of some private schools. Deb Wilkinson and Richard Denniss conclude that parents should be formally notified by all private schools about the voluntary nature of all tax-deductible payments and that the ATO should investigate the practice of structuring school fee payments {{in order to reduce}} tax...|$|R

40|$|Production of refuse {{derived fuel}} from {{municipal}} solid waste in future shall play a strategic role in an integrated waste management system. The amount of landfilled biodegradable materials thus will be diminished according to provisions of the 1999 Waste Landfill Directive. The aim {{of this article is}} to evaluate cost effectiveness based on cost evaluation of the different complication of the waste pre-treatment equipment complectation and based on regenerable waste quantities in Latvia. The comparison of cost estimates is done in 3 scenarios considering potential waste quantities in Latvia: Scenario I - planned annual waste quantity is 20 kT; Scenario II - 40 kT and Scenario III - 160 kT. An increase in amount of waste and processing capacity means the decrease in costs of mechanical pre-treatment of 1 ton of waste. Thus, costs of mechanical sorting line under different scenarios with capacities of 10 t h- 1, 20 t h- 1 and 80 t h- 1 are <b>EUR</b> 32 per <b>t,</b> <b>EUR</b> 24 per <b>t</b> and <b>EUR</b> 15 per <b>t,</b> respectively. Most feasible cost for a set of mechanical pre-treatment equipment for the capacity of 10 t h- 1 is <b>EUR</b> 32 per <b>t</b> by using rotating drum screener with the following manual sorting. Mechanical pre-treatment equipment of unsorted municipal waste is economically nonbeneficial, when the use of fine (biologically degradable) fraction is not possible. As the sorting of biodegradable kitchen waste is not developed under the current waste management system in Latvia, the lines for mechanical pre-treatment of household waste would be better to install in landfills...|$|R
