50|$|In general, a dealkalizer is best {{applied to}} boilers {{operating}} below 700 psi (48 bar). In order to justify {{installation of a}} dealkalizer on <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boilers,</b> the alkalinity content should be above 50 ppm {{with the amount of}} make-up water exceeding 1,000 gallons (approx. 4,000 litres) per day.|$|R
50|$|HEDP {{is used as}} {{scale and}} {{corrosion}} inhibition in circulating cool water system, oil field and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> in fields such as electric power, chemical industry, metallurgy, fertilizer, etc. In light woven industry, HEDP is used as detergent for metal and nonmetal. In dyeing industry, HEDP is used as peroxide stabilizer and dye-fixing agent; In non-cyanide electroplating, HEDP is used as chelating agent. The dosage of 1-10 mg/L is preferred as scale inhibitor, 10-50 mg/L as corrosion inhibitor, and 1000-2000 mg/L as detergent. Usually, HEDP is used together with polycarboxylic acid.|$|R
30|$|Hardness {{is defined}} as the sum of {{concentration}} of their ions expressed in mg/L of CaCO 3. Hardness increases from metallic ions dissolved in water. Hardness is used as an indicator of the rate of scale formation in hot water heaters in <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boilers.</b> USGS hardness (Handa 1964) shows four categories of hardness: soft, slightly hard, moderately hard and very hard. Scaling and deposition problems in air-conditioning plants are associated with the total hardness of water. Total hardness of more than 180  mg CaCO 3 /L can be treated as very hard water and can lead to scaling problems in air-conditioning plants (Hem 1970).|$|R
5000|$|Robert Fulton {{built the}} valley's first {{commercial}} paddle-wheel steamboat, New Orleans, at Pittsburgh and Captain Nicholas Roosevelt sailed {{it down the}} Ohio to New Orleans in 1811. But it {{was not able to}} navigate back upriver from Natcheys. It was side-wheel driven with a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> driver compared to following plants. The machine-powered river transportation industry was on its way with the steam-engine works at Pittsburgh of Oliver Evans and managed by Mark Stackhouse which began operations in May 1812. A plant from this shop went into the early local stern-wheel steamboat Comet, launched January 1813 (University of Pittsburgh's [...] 'Historic Pittsburgh' [...] ). Slowly replacing keel boats, the growing machine-powered vessel industry arrived in the state. In 1816, Captain Henry Shreve built the George Washington at Wheeling. It set the pattern for future steamboats. He named the passenger cabins, calling them staterooms, after U.S. states. This vessel was stern-wheel driven. Valley Forge is reported to be the first large iron steamboat on the upper Ohio Valley. Robinson and Minis launched it at Pittsburgh in September 1839.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{investigate}} the application of ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (UF/RO) for advanced wastewater treatment. Full-scale tests were set up for investigation in Yuntianhua Co. Ltd, Yunnan, China. The performances of turbidity, residual chlorine, conductivity and various ions were studied. The results suggested that the removal efficiency of turbidity was above 98. 20 %. Additionally, the average value of Silting Density Index (SDI) and residual chlorine of effluent of UF process were less than 1. 80 and 0. 06 mg/L, respectively. However, its removal efficiency was limited by membrane fouling. And this system needed to be backwashed periodically to maintain high removal efficiency. Hardness and scale-forming ions could be decreased effectively by RO. The RO membrane fouling could be avoided by adjusting pH (7. 0 - 7. 5) and dosing scale inhibitor (MDC 150, 4. 00 - 5. 00 mg/L). Finally, the effluent of the UF/RO system can be reused as the cooling water or supply water for <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> equipment...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Scaling {{problems}} in a heating or cooling system can be recognised {{by one or more}} of the following symptoms. Reduction in heat transfer rate, in which the formation of an insulating deposit on a heat transfer surface significantly reduces the cooling or heating efficiency of the equipment. Reduced water flow, which results from a partial or complete blockage of pipelines, condenser tubes, or other openings. Even a small build-up of scale on a heat exchange surface reduces water flow. Scale may continue to build up in boilers until heat transfer is so low that the metal overheats, permitting the tubes to rapture under the operating pressure. Scale is usually found in water-handling equipment in which water is heated, i. e. hot-water storage tanks, boilers, etc. The magnitude of this problem may be appreciated by considering that scaling can cause degradation, or complete failure in thermal and hydraulic performance which increases initial and operating costs (Chan and Ghassemi, 1991). A fairly <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boiler,</b> with only 0. 6 mm of calcium sulphate scale on the tubes results in a 180 °C temperature drop. The cost involved due to heat transfer inefficiency and the removal of scale, in Britain alone, is estimated at £ 1 billion per annum (Darvill, 1993). Poor conductivity of a 25 mm thick CaC 03 scale layer can decrease the heat transfer by 95 % (Glater eta/., 1980), whereas a Si 02 scale layer 0. 5 mm thick results in a 90 % decrease in heat transfer (Grutsch and McClintock, 1984) ...|$|E
5000|$|All boilers {{lose some}} water in steam leaks; and some is {{intentionally}} wasted as boiler blowdown to remove impurities accumulating within the boiler. [...] Steam locomotives and boilers generating steam {{for use in}} direct contact with contaminating materials may not recycle condensed steam. Replacement water is required to continue steam production. Make-up water is initially treated to remove floating and suspended materials. [...] Hard water intended for <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> may be softened by substituting sodium for divalent cations of dissolved calcium and magnesium most likely to cause carbonate and sulfate scale. [...] High-pressure boilers typically require water demineralized by reverse osmosis, distillation or ion-exchange.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine {{different}} technologies, which enhances the CO 2 partial pressure in the flue gas from the natural gas combined cycle. A base case has been created as a reference for comparison of the other cycles. The base case includes a MEA capture plant with a reboiler duty of 3, 6 MJ/kg CO 2. To simulate the process in this thesis HYSYS and GT PRO {{have been used as}} simulation tools. The thesis has also looked into ways of extracting steam from the steam cycle {{to be used in the}} reboiler. The chosen extraction point was the crossover between the intermediate-pressure turbine and the low-pressure turbine, the steam was saturated with water from the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> and have a pressure and temperature of 3, 6 bar and 140 °C into the reboiler. Four different technologies have been evaluated in this thesis; a natural gas combined cycle with the use of exhaust gas recycle and, three elevated pressure cycles; post-compression CO 2 capture, post-expansion CO 2 capture, and tail-end CO 2 capture. These processes have been compared against each other with regards to the net plant efficiency, absorber size at the capture plant, and the technological maturity. The most promising of these technologies is the natural gas combined cycle with exhaust gas recycle and the tail-end CO 2 capture processes, with respectively 52 % and 51, 7 % net plant efficiency. The smallest absorber size is achieved by the use of post-compression CO 2 capture, with a diameter of 2, 9 m and a height of 10, 5 m. The elevated pressure cycles have also been tested with the use of MDEA as solvent in the capture plant. By use of elevated pressure and MDEA the reboiler duty was reduced to 2 MJ/ kg CO 2. </p...|$|E

5000|$|A {{steam heating}} system takes {{advantage}} of the high latent heat which is given off when steam condenses to liquid water. In a steam heating system, each room is equipped with a so-called [...] "radiator" [...] which is connected to a source of <b>low-pressure</b> steam (a <b>boiler).</b> Steam entering the radiator condenses and gives up its latent heat, returning to liquid water. The radiator in turn heats the air of the room, and provides some direct radiant heat. The condensate water returns to the boiler either by gravity or with the assistance of a pump. Some systems use only a single pipe for combined steam and condensate return. Since trapped air prevents proper circulation, such systems have vent valves to allow air to be purged. In domestic and small commercial buildings, the steam is generated at relatively low pressure, less than 15 psig (200 kPa).|$|R
