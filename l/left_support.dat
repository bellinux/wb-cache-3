2500|$|On the {{contemporary}} moderate left, some authors such as Peter Singer (in his book, A Darwinian <b>Left)</b> <b>support</b> Darwinism but reach different {{political and economic}} lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene, has a chapter, [...] "Nice guys finish first," [...] that attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources {{for the survival of}} other members of the same species, its genes, present on the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name. According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of survival of the fittest.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{members of}} the evangelical left affirm the primary tenets of evangelical theology, such as the doctrines of the Incarnation, atonement, and resurrection, and also see the Bible as a primary {{authority}} for the Church. Unlike many evangelicals, however, those on the evangelical <b>left</b> <b>support</b> what are often considered progressive or left wing political policies. They are often, for example, opposed to capital punishment and supportive of gun control and welfare programs. In many cases, they are also pacifists. Theologically they also often support and utilize modern biblical criticism, whereas more conservative evangelicals reject it. Some promote the legalization of same-sex marriage or protection of access to abortion for the society at large without necessarily endorsing the practice themselves.|$|E

5000|$|By the 19th century {{scholars}} {{almost universally}} accepted that the Book of Deuteronomy dated {{not from the}} time of Moses but from the 7th century BCE, and that the Pentateuch as a whole had been compiled by unknown editors from various originally distinct source-documents. As David Levi had feared, the questioning of Mosaic authorship had led to a profound skepticism towards the very idea of revealed religion. Gradually the various Christian churches came to accept the conclusions of scholarship, and when in the 1940s the Vatican lifted a ban on Catholic scholars investigating the origins of the Pentateuch, it <b>left</b> <b>support</b> for Mosaic authorship limited largely to conservative Evangelical circles. This is tied to the way Evangelicals view the unity and authority of scripture: {{in the words of the}} Zondervan Encyclopedia of the Bible, [...] "Faith in Christ and faith in the books of the OT canon stand or fall together because Christ and the apostles ... took the Pentateuch as Mosaic and put their seal on it as Holy Scripture." [...] Nevertheless, the majority of contemporary Evangelicals, while accepting that some or much of the Pentateuch can be traced to Moses or traditions about him, pay little attention to the question of authorship.|$|E

30|$|For {{load case}} A, a simply {{supported}} beam subjected to {{a moment on the}} <b>left</b> <b>support</b> (see Fig. 6 a), Fig. 7 compares the results of the LogFE formulation with a 96 -element reference solution {{as well as with the}} results of a 3 -element and a 6 -element finite element formulation of the same beam. For the moderate load (see Fig.  7 a), the formulation results in fairly accurate solutions both for one shape function (no internal degrees of freedom) and for two shape functions (one internal degree of freedom) per nodal degree of freedom. In particular, the axial displacement, which is rather poorly approximated by the 3 -element discretization, is fairly well captured by the results of the LogFE formulation.|$|E

However, the solution employing two shape functions yields results that {{are very close to}} the reference solution (see Fig. 9 b). On the other hand, for lower load intensities, the reference solution, as well as the approximations, remain quite close to the linear theory, which would predict a normalized bending moment given as M(ξ [...])/M_ 0 = - 3 / 2 ξ + 1 (see Fig. 9 a).|$|E

Of course, the experience of such life events as taking care of older parents varies according to individuals’ situations, and these can be quite varied. The paper therefore examines some of the diversity of mid-life families by describing patterns of separation and divorce, remarriage, same-sex relationships, and childlessness. It concludes with a discussion of the relationship between mid-life families and social policy. midlife, families, and intergenerational relationships...|$|E

40|$|We reconstructed Middle Pleistocene surface {{hydrography}} in {{the western}} South Atlantic based on planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, modern analog technique and Globorotalia truncatulinoides isotopic ratios of core SP 1251 (38 degrees 29. 7 `S / 53 degrees 40. 7 `W / 3400 m water depth). Biostratigraphic analysis suggests that sediments were deposited between 0. 3 and 0. 12 Ma and therefore correlate to Marine Isotopic Stage 6 or 8. Faunal assemblage-based winter and summer SST estimates suggest that the western South Atlantic at 38 degrees S was 4 - 6 degrees C colder than at present, within the expected range for a glacial interval.

30|$|The {{estimate}} for the normal force, interpreted in isolation, shows a significant deviation of the LogFE solutions {{with regard to}} the reference solution. However, for moderate load intensities, the normal force represents a rather small share of the total normal stress of the beam. As the respective graph in Fig. 7 shows, the impact of the error of the estimation of the normal force is fairly small, while the error in the estimation of the bending moment dominates the overall error in the normal stress at the upper and lower side of the beam. For stronger loads (see Fig.  7 b), the interplay of the bending energy and the strain energy results in a general deterioration of the estimate of the normal force. In the load case presented in Fig. 7, the estimate of the normal force close to the <b>left</b> <b>support</b> of the beam becomes particularly poor, {{especially in the case of}} two shape functions per nodal degree of freedom. However, the graph of the normal stress shows that the normal force contributes only a small share of the total internal energy of the beam, as well as of the local contributions of the cross-sections along the neutral axis to the total internal energy.|$|E

We develop a perceptual model to find optimal printing directions that preserve important visual features. In comparison to alternative methods, our technique avoids placing support structures on important regions to prevent {{damage in the}} final printed model. (<b>Left)</b> <b>Support</b> structures resulting from default orientation. (Middle) Result by Autodesk MeshMixer. (Right) Our result. This paper introduces a perceptual model for determining 3 D print-ing orientations. Additive manufacturing methods involving low-cost 3 D printers often require robust branching support structures to prevent material collapse at overhangs. Although the designed shape can successfully be made by adding supports, residual ma-terial remains at the contact points after the supports have been re-moved, resulting in unsightly surface artifacts. Moreover, fine sur-face details on the fabricated model can easily be damaged while removing supports. To prevent the visual impact of these artifacts, we present a method to find printing directions that avoid placing supports in perceptually significant regions. Our model for prefer-ence in 3 D printing direction is formulated as a combination of met-rics including area of support, visual saliency, preferred viewpoint and smoothness preservation. We develop a training-and-learning methodology to obtain a closed-form solution for our perceptual model and perform a large-scale study. We demonstrate the per-formance of this perceptual model on both natural and man-made objects...|$|E
