During the <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> the hammer is pushed towards the surface in a controlled movement. The hammer mass remains locked in place by the pawl.

The impact spring contracts causing the hammer mass to strike against the plunger. This is the impact. The hammer mass then rebounds back to the body of the hammer and distance travelled is recorded on the scale. The rebound distance depends directly on the hardness of the roll under test: A softer roll will absorb more of the impact energy and the rebound distance will be less.A harder roll will reflect more of the impact energy and the rebound distance will increase.|$|E

Moreover. using microprocessors to determine firing instances {{makes it possible to}} change regulator's ON and OFF periods at will with appreciable ease.

Profiles of these angles at different values of <b>load</b> <b>phase</b> angle are presented for cases of out-put load voltage with three, five and seven pulses per haf cycle. Optimal values of switching angles are evaluated using an algorithm based on optimization technique of the direct search method. Validity of the results obtained is confirmed by comparing it with relevant values obtained by direct manipulation for the possible combinations of switching angles.

Primary endpoint was the proportion of eyes that lost more than 15 ETDRS letters after 12 months compared to baseline. Of 185 initially treated eyes 181 eyes went through the full <b>loading</b> <b>phase.</b> The mean visual acuity increased from 49 ± 16 ETDRS letters to 54 ± 18 ETDRS letters. 25 % (46 / 185 eyes) presented to our clinic during the maintenance phase due to visual deterioration. 42 eyes (23 %) received additional intravitreal injections of 0. 5 mg ranibizumab. 163 eyes of 155 patients (88 %) completed the follow up at month 12.

The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the repeatability of the OFM in healthy subjects. METHODS: Nine healthy subjects, without a history of lower extremity injury, were recruited. Markers were placed according to the OFM requirements. Motion capture was conducted using the VICON NEXUS system on two separate test days, with two tests on each day conducted by two independent examiners. The range of motion (ROM) of the following inter-segments was selected for further analysis: forefoot-hindfoot, forefoot-tibia and hindfoot-tibia in frontal, sagittal and transverse planes. Each step was divided in two parts, a <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> (from heel strike to midstance) and a push-off phase (from midstance to toe-off). The Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of the measurements with 90 % confidence bounds (SEM 90) and the Minimal Differences needed to be considered real (MD) with 95 % confidence interval were calculated for inter-observer and intra-observer and effect of trial using SPSS. RESULTS: There was a linear correlation between the number of trials and the ICC's (r 2 = 0. 49, p< 0. 001), with six trial leading to good ICC's. Inter-observer repeatability: In the <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> almost all ICC's were good or excellent (0. 53 - 0. 97) with only one parameter below 0. 60. In the push-off phase two parameters scored moderate agreement, where the other 7 parameters had well to excellent agreement. The SEM 90 values were varying from 0. 85 degrees to 2. 49 degrees in the <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> and from 0. 92 degrees to 4. 40 degrees in the push-off phase. Intra-observer repeatability: In the <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> all ICC's were good or excellent (0. 71 - 0. 97). In the push-off phase two parameters scored moderate agreement and the other 7 parameters had well to excellent agreement. The SEM 90 ranged from 1. 15 degrees to 4. 53 degrees in the <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> and in the push-off phase from 1. 71 degrees to 5. 49 degrees. The SEM 90 values were varying from 0. 85 degrees to 2. 49 degrees in the <b>loading</b> <b>phase</b> and from 0. 92 degrees to 4. 40 degrees in the push-off phase.
