5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the privileges of the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> heresy.|$|E
5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is to provide comprehensive and understandable overview of the legal regulation of both above mentioned directives, to analyze selected judicature of the Court of Justice of the European Union related to these directives, to briefly outline interpretation problems arising from the transposition of both directives to the Czech legal order, which were identified by professional literature. The content of this diploma thesis is divided into 5 main chapters. After the Introduction follows the chapter briefly defining the main notions, economic competition, competition <b>law,</b> the <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition and unfair competition. The second chapter {{deals with the}} development of the European <b>Law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition till the present day.

A survey in 1589 noted that the stonework, timber and {{brickwork}} all needed urgent maintenance, at a potential cost of £100. The Great Park was disparked and turned into fields in 1580. As religious <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> Catholics increased, the castle became used as a prison from 1580 onwards; by 1600 the castle prison contained 40 prisoners, Roman Catholic priests and recusants.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal {{experience of the}} nation. Emigration was illegal and population {{was seen as the}} wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> emigration were repealed.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's term as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} modestly progressive policies, which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line. Agnew's attempt to adopt a new state constitution {{was rejected by the}} voters in a referendum.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E

5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E

During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely.

The first chapter briefly defines the status of the <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition in the legal system, interprets the basic terms and describes the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The second chapter is dedicated to the evolution of the <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition at the level of European Union.

5|$|The {{fourth of}} eight {{children}} of a wealthy Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza, under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his Via Panisperna boys. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that {{led the way to}} the discovery of nuclear fission. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he joined the French Communist Party, as did his sisters Guiliana and Laura and brother Gillo. The Italian Fascist regime's 1938 racial <b>laws</b> <b>against</b> Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.|$|E

In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E
40|$|Resumé European <b>Law</b> <b>against</b> Unfair Competition This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{regulation}} of <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition adopted on the European Union level. The thesis is composed of two parts - the first one introduces legislative regulation of <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition, the second part analyses legal regulation of misleading and comparative advertisement as the examples of merits of unfair competition. The {{first part of the}} thesis firstly overviews the <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition on the international level; the core of the thesis, however, lies in the overview of legislation adopted by the European Union. Within the summary of the European legislation it firstly introduces the background for the legislative activity of the European Union in the field of unfair competition. Subsequently, it is followed up by the overview of directives with the primary aim to protect European businesses and consumers against unfair competition. When introducing the directives it emphasises mainly the findings whether it was adopted under minimum or maximum harmonisation, therefore to which extend the member state legislators are free to diverge from the regulation adopted by the European Union. The aim of the forth chapter {{is to look at the}} <b>law</b> <b>against</b> unfair competition as a part of private law. The second part of [...] ...|$|R
