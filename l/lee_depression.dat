50|$|The Carter {{family have}} {{appeared}} {{heavily in the}} show from 2014, in high-profile storylines including Johnny's homosexuality, the revelation that Shirley is in fact Mick's mother, Linda's rape {{at the hands of}} Dean and suffering from bulimia nervosa, Stan's terminal prostate cancer, the domestic violence Tina receives from her partner Tosh, Nancy's epilepsy, Sylvie's Alzheimer's disease, <b>Lee's</b> <b>depression,</b> the revelation that Dean has a daughter, Jade with cystic fibrosis, born after a one-night stand with Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), and baby Ollie Carter's accident and potential brain damage.|$|R
25|$|When Nancy and Lee have an argument, Nancy pushes Lee, {{which results}} Ollie being {{knocked out of}} his high chair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and Ollie seems fine so Linda {{says he does not}} need medical attention. However, she later finds him not breathing, and when she resuscitates him, he suffers a seizure. In hospital, the family are {{informed}} that Ollie could have brain damage; Mick blames Nancy and says he cannot forgive her, but Linda defends her and eventually forces them to work together to get Ollie the medical care he needs. Mick is devastated at Dean's acquittal but Linda reassures him. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a miscarriage but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. Mick struggles look after his family when Linda goes to Spain to look after her ill mother Elaine who suffers a stroke during the Christmas break. Mick is then unhappy to learn that <b>Lee's</b> <b>depression</b> has made him contemplate suicide and that he is in debt, which Mick offers to pay. When Whitney is injured in a bus crash, Mick accompanies her to the hospital and after he assures her that she is a good wife to Lee, she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish).|$|R

40|$|Dust aerosol is {{abundant}} and {{important in the}} Earth system due to its influence on the radiation balance, the hydrological cycle, human health and ecosystems. Reducing the currently large uncertainties in dust effects requires realistic simulations of the lifecycle of dust aerosol which depends on the time, location and amount of dust emission. Emission estimates from models show a large variety, the reduction of which requires a systematic evaluation of dust-emitting winds. Different processes are known, but their relative importance was previously poorly quantified. This work investigates dust-emitting winds in North Africa based on single meteorological processes which helps guiding future model development. Based on 32 years of ERA-Interim data and a dust model, the emission amounts associated with nocturnal low-level jets (NLLJs), atmospheric depressions and mobile, long-lived cyclones are estimated climatologically for the first time. The results highlight NLLJs as an important driver for dust emission, particularly in the Bodélé Depression during winter. Associated maxima in mid-morning emission underline the importance of temporally high-resolved winds for dust modelling. ERA-Interim systematically underestimates NLLJ core wind speeds, likely due to artificially increased mixing in stable boundary layers. Derived emission frequencies over the Bodélé Depression agree well with observations, but differ elsewhere. Atmospheric depressions, often {{in the form of}} heat lows and <b>lee</b> <b>depressions,</b> occur frequently and coincide with the majority of dust emission. Few depressions develop into mobile and long-lived cyclones which coincide with particularly intense events. The largest emission fractions associated with cyclones are found in northeast Africa during spring, primarily at day with a small emission reduction by soil moisture. Smaller West African areas show similar fractions, likely associated with nearsurface signatures of African Easterly Waves. Comparing results derived from ERA-Interim against the Earth system model of the UK Met Office shows considerable disagreement in NLLJ core wind speeds and dust emissions. In depth analysis underlines the urgency for model development that improves the synoptic-scale conditions and the stable boundary layer. Such model improvements hold the potential to advance the scientific understanding of dust aerosol in the Earth syste...|$|R
40|$|Problematic {{internet}} use (PIU) is {{considered as a}} relatively new area of risk taking behaviour, which deals with uncontrolled use of the Internet with negative outcomes (impact) on individuals (Caplan, 2010). This paper focuses on relationship between personality factors, depression and problematic {{internet use}} among students of secondary schools and universities in Ostrava region. The aim of the paper {{was to determine whether}} personality factors and depression predict problematic internet use among young students. Studies dealing with problematic internet use (Caplan, 2010; Young 1998; Davis, 2001 etc.) show that personality is one of the factor which may be associated with internet addiction or other forms of risk behaviour (Kolibáš, Novotný, 1996; Kopasová, 2000; Hemochová, Vaňková & Drlíková in Výrost & Slameník, 2001). Personality was measured by the questionnaire HEXACO (Ashton & <b>Lee,</b> 2009), <b>depression</b> was measured by a modified version of Beck Depression Inventory (M-BDI; Schmitt, Beckmann, Dusi, Maes, Schiller &Schonauer, 2003), the problematic internet use was measured by Generalized problematic internet use scale (GPIUS 2; Caplan, 2010). The research sample consisted of 279 students of secondary schools and universities in Ostrava region. There were 200 (71. 7...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{innovations}} were {{an almost}} casual stripping style {{compared to the}} herky-jerky styles of most burlesque strippers (she emphasized the [...] "tease" [...] in [...] "striptease"), and she brought a sharp sense of humor into her act as well. She became as famous for her onstage wit as for her stripping style, and - changing her stage name to Gypsy Rose Lee - she {{became one of the}} biggest stars of Minsky's Burlesque, where she performed for four years. She was frequently arrested in raids on the Minsky brothers' shows. During the Great <b>Depression,</b> <b>Lee</b> spoke at various union meetings in support of New York laborers. According to activist Harry Fisher, her talks were among those that attracted the largest audiences.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1936, during the Great <b>Depression,</b> <b>Lee</b> was hired for the federally {{sponsored}} Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographic documentation project of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. He joined a team assembled under Roy Stryker, along with Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein and Walker Evans. Stryker provided direction and bureaucratic protection to the group, leaving the photographers free to compile what in 1973 was described as [...] "the greatest documentary collection which has ever been assembled." [...] Lee created some of the iconic images produced by the FSA, including photographic studies of San Augustine, Texas in 1939, and Pie Town, New Mexico in 1940. Over {{the spring and summer}} of 1942, Lee was one of several government photographers to document the eviction of Japanese Americans from the West Coast, producing over 600 images of families waiting to be removed and their later life in various detention facilities.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s and the Great <b>Depression,</b> <b>Lee</b> {{accepted}} {{a call to}} become a preacher in Belzoni, Mississippi, where he led a Baptist congregation. The town was located in Humphreys County {{in the heart of}} the Mississippi Delta. Most blacks in the state lived in this region and the majority in extreme poverty as farm workers. Lee continued to work to improve himself; he joined with local black business and community leaders. Serving as pastor at four churches, he also opened a small grocery store. Lee considered both vocations as serving the African-American community. In a back room of his house, he and his wife, Rosebud, set up a small printing business. These efforts provided enough resources that Lee felt he had a base for entering the battle for civil rights in the early 1950s. As a part of the NAACP, Lee worked tirelessly in trying to register African Americans to vote.|$|R
5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. <b>Lee</b> develops <b>depression,</b> and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|R
40|$|During {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries {{photography}} grew in popularity and accessibility. Better technology in film and processing, which made the medium more economical and easier for the amateur to execute, proved photography to be both a creative and enterprising activity appealing to an ambitious middle class. African Americans were among those who took up the camera, traversing rural communities in the developing South in search of steady work. The more successful photographers set up studios in towns and cities, basing their practice on portraiture and commemorative photography. Alan Govenar 2 ̆ 7 s Portraits of Community: African American Photography in Texas is a study of some of Texas 2 ̆ 7 s better established African American photographers. At the same time, it depicts the history and development of Texas 2 ̆ 7 s African American middle class and directly addresses the dearth of scholarship on African Americans in the state. The work of Texas-based African American photographers, Govenar maintains, is little-known and under-appreciated. Moreover, the best known images of African American life in Texas come from the work of white photographers like Russell <b>Lee,</b> whose <b>Depression</b> era photographs highlighted the poverty and desperate living conditions among sharecroppers. Such imagery is absent from Portraits of Community, which should not be surprising. The ideology of the African American middle class eschewed depictions of poverty which were seen to reinforce the racist notion of inferiority. Instead, black businesses- particularly newspapers-sought photographs that displayed the African American community in a positive light, illustrating the results of Booker T. Washington 2 ̆ 7 s economic 2 ̆ 2 lifting as we climb 2 ̆ 2 program in portraits of industriousness and thrift. In an economic sphere defined by segregation, African American photographers could not and, with the notable exception of Gordon Parks, did not make a living from depictions of poverty and racial violence. Organized by urban region, Portraits of Community presents the work of over twenty African American studio photographers in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Tyler, Lubbock, and Houston. Govenar terms this work 2 ̆ 2 vernacular and community photography, 2 ̆ 2 or photography done for personal use, an approach, he argues, dominant among African American photographers in Texas. His study 2 ̆ 7 s real value, however, lies in the range and scope of the work represented and the window it opens on life in a segregated Texas. Perhaps the book 2 ̆ 7 s most intriguing photographs are by Lubbock-based Eugene Roquemore, who died in the late 1960 s and, as is too often the case, left no personal testimony about his photographic work. To fill this gap, Govenar includes observations by Roquemore 2 ̆ 7 s widow and an acquaintance which, unfortunately, do little to reveal his working mode. Roquemore 2 ̆ 7 s hand-held, snapshot aesthetic produced photographs unique in this volume for their compositional fluidity and looseness, showing an affinity with the work of Robert Frank 2 ̆ 7 s 1950 s project The Americans and Aaron Siskind 2 ̆ 7 s 1930 s and 1940 s Harlem Document project. Like Frank, Roquemore captured daily life 2 ̆ 7 s brutal incongruity; like Siskind, its studied solemnity. Roquemore 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Wedding Couple, 2 ̆ 2 for example, probably from the 1960 s and taken at night, depicts a bride and groom embracing in front of a car imbued with the glow from the camera 2 ̆ 7 s flash. There is a narrative power in this image-a stolen moment just barely visible in its grainy rendering, the car door left ajar in expectation of the honeymoon escape. The rough-hewn technique and the awkwardness of the frame prevent the photograph from becoming a studied cliché...|$|R
5000|$|Babe {{begins to}} socialise with Shirley, Dean and Buster {{as well as}} the rest of the family. She even attends an event at Dean's salon, however a brick is thrown through the window with the word [...] "rapist" [...] on it. It is later {{revealed}} that Babe paid somebody to throw the brick through the window, and is intending on sabotaging Dean's business for what he did to Linda. When Shirley and Buster discover Babe's meddling, Buster throws a trifle over her head, leading to Mick and Linda learning the truth. They exile Babe from the family, so she leaves Walford. Shortly after this, Mick confides in Linda that he feels heavily depressed over her rape, and as she tries to comfort him, he storms off in a rage. As Linda follows him, she trips on her dressing gown rope and falls down the stairs. When she awakens from unconsciousness, she realises she has fallen on her stomach and that her waters have broken. Sonia and Kat get Linda to hospital, while Carol finds Mick and tells him that Linda has gone into labour. She gives birth to a baby boy, later named Ollie. Dean tried to visit Ollie and Linda in hospital and tries to rename him [...] "Kevin", convinced that Ollie is his son after raping Linda. Mick has a blood test to see if he matches Ollie's; he does. He asks Dean and he is revealed not to be a match, meaning that Mick is Ollie's biological father. Dean is secretly heartbroken, and when confiding in Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), she reveals that she had a daughter with Dean seven years ago. Dean attempts to pursue Shabnam into telling him where their daughter is, however Shabnam - not wanting to reconnect with her child - lies that she died shortly after birth. Shirley later learns that truth and tells Dean, who ruins Shabnam's engagement party to Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) in revenge. Shirley and Shabnam's father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) decide to find the child, who is revealed to be named Jade Green (Amaya Edward), and it is revealed that she is suffering from cystic fibrosis in a foster home. When Shirley and Buster tell Dean, he breaks down as this is the disease which killed his older brother Jimbo. Shirley and Buster decide they want to adopt Jade, however Shabnam will not give her consent to allow them to do so. They later convince her to and begin building a strong custody case. Meanwhile, <b>Lee</b> has developed <b>depression</b> as he struggles to cope with Linda's rape and Ollie's birth, only confiding in Nancy and his girlfriend, Whitney.|$|R
