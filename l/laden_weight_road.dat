50|$|The Pembroke was a {{development}} of the Percival Prince civil transport. It had a longer wing to permit a higher fully <b>laden</b> <b>weight.</b> The prototype flew on 21 November 1952. Production was complete in early 1958.|$|R
50|$|The 170 in {{bare chassis}} form, as {{delivered}} to a coach builder or the body shop, weighed 750 kg. With a conventional coupé or sedan/saloon body added, the car weighed between 1050 kg and 1200 kg, with a <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> of around 1455 kg.|$|R

25|$|In 1983 {{a further}} {{analysis}} of {{the capacity of the}} bridge led to the reduction of the weight limit to 7.5 tons. By this time rail vehicles of 100 tonnes gross <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> were operating, and one of the three railway tracks was removed to reduce extreme loading on the structure.|$|R

50|$|In New Zealand, driver {{licensing}} {{is controlled}} by the NZ Transport Agency. There are six classes of motor-vehicle licence and nine licence endorsements. Class 1 governs vehicles with a GLW (gross <b>laden</b> <b>weight)</b> or GCW (gross combined weight) of less than 6,000 kg, and Class 6 governs motorcycles. Classes 2-5 govern heavy vehicles.|$|R

For other types of vehicles the classes are separately licensed as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The total {{permitted}} <b>laden</b> <b>weights</b> {{were raised}} by slightly more than 3% in 1967, after production of K-44 had already ended. For certain designated uses, for example on road construction sites, a special permit could be obtained authorizing an even higher maximum total weight of 21500 kg for a fully loaded heavy-duty Jyry K-44.|$|R
50|$|HGVs {{must not}} exceed 40 tonnes <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> or 18.75 m in length to cross {{boundaries}} in the EU, but longer and heavier vehicles (LHVs) known as Gigaliner, EuroCombi, EcoLiner,innovative commercial vehicle, mega-truck, etc., typically 25.25 m long and weighing up to 60 tonnes {{are used in}} some countries, {{and the implications of}} allowing them to cross borders was being considered.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} the metal parts of a large {{aircraft}} need be no thicker or heavier than those of a smaller aircraft. However, because these parts must cover four times the area they make the aircraft four times heavier. This again exactly matches the increase in <b>laden</b> <b>weight,</b> {{so there is no}} structural limit to how large (or small) an aeroplane can be made.|$|R
5000|$|At {{launch the}} vehicle {{appeared}} as a boxy flat sided van with an advertised load volume of 7.45 m³ which compared with 7.3 m³ for the Citroën H as it appeared in the same year. The Renault’s 2,383cc engine used petrol/gasoline, having originally been introduced in 1936 for the Renault Primaquatre, and in this application it offered [...] The dry weight of 835 kg provided a maximum <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> of 1835 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{fixed-wing}} aeroplanes {{were mostly}} single-engined. When the Russian Igor Sikorsky designed and flew his Ilya Muromets in 1913 it became {{not only the}} first four-engined aircraft but, with a wing span of 29.8 m and <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> of 4600 kg, {{by far the largest}} and heaviest to date. By comparison the LZ 18 airship, which flew the same year, was 158 m long (the envelope had a capacity of [...] ) and a empty weight of 20 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|Tare weight , {{sometimes}} called unladen weight, is {{the weight of}} an empty vehicle or container. By subtracting it from the gross <b>weight</b> (<b>laden</b> <b>weight),</b> {{the weight of the}} goods carried (the net weight) may be determined. This can be useful in computing the cost of the goods carried for purposes of taxation or for tolls related to barge, rail, road, or other traffic, especially where the toll will vary with the value of the goods carried (e.g., tolls on the Erie Canal). Tare weight is often published upon the sides of railway cars and transport vehicles to facilitate the computation of the load carried. Tare weight is also used in body composition assessment when doing underwater weighing.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed limit}} is 70 mph (112km/h) on motorways, 70 mph (112km/h) on dual carriageways, 60 mph (96km/h) on single carriageways and 30 mph (48km/h) {{in areas with}} street {{lighting}} (restricted roads). These limits may be reduced by roadside signs and apply to cars, motorcycles, car-derived vans up to 2 tonnes maximum <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> (MLW), and to motorhomes or motor caravans not more than 3.05 tonnes maximum unladen weight. Other classes of vehicles are subject to lower limits on some roads.|$|R
50|$|The fully <b>laden</b> maximum <b>weights</b> in {{the table}} below follow the {{contemporary}} Finnish legislation, and {{are not necessarily the}} same as the manufacturer's own structural values.|$|R
30|$|Similar surveys to PRFSS {{are made}} in other European countries. These surveys share a common {{methodology}} recommended by Eurostat in order to harmonize and compare EU road freight statistics [18, 19]. For instance, Great Britain, France and Germany perform the “Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport/CSRGT” [20], “Transport Routier de Marchandises/TRM” [21] and “Kraftfahr-Bundesamt/KBA” [22] respectively. All these surveys provide annual data about road freight operations carried out by goods vehicles with a loading capacity above 3.5  tonnes or maximum permissible <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> above 6.0  tonnes.|$|R
25|$|Trolleybus {{powers were}} sought for a route from the Market Place, via Arkwright Street to Trent Bridge, and thence along the two routes {{proposed}} for motorbus operation in West Bridgford. Owing to {{opposition from the}} West Bridgford Urban District Council, the latter clause was deleted, but powers for trolleybuses were granted, including the section of route between the Market Place and Trent Bridge. The vehicles were restricted to a maximum <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> of five tons, powers being given to enable provisional orders to be applied for on any route required.|$|R
50|$|For some {{military}} applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft. The hovercraft's ability to distribute its <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> evenly {{across the surface}} below it makes it well suited {{to the role of}} amphibious landing craft. The US Navy LCAC can take troops and materials (if necessary an M1 Abrams tank) from ship to shore and can access more than 70% of the world's coastline, as opposed to conventional landing craft, which are only capable of landing along 17% of that coastline.|$|R
50|$|Route {{availability}} for {{a vehicle}} (locomotive or wagon) is generally based upon its axle loading. That is, {{how much of}} the <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle is distributed on each axle. The more weight on each axle, the higher the RA number, and the more restricted the vehicle is. The uneven weight distribution of the class 28 Co-Bo forced the use of a six-wheel bogie at one end in order to stay within RA 8. For wagons it is normal to have different RAs when running empty and full.|$|R

50|$|As {{the size}} of the car {{prohibited}} meaningful wind tunnel testing, the streamlined shape of the car was refined entirely through the use of computational fluid dynamics by MIRA Ltd, which has enabled the car to obtain a very low coefficient of drag of only 0.147 and a CdA value (drag coefficient &times; frontal area) of only 0.129 m². The fuel tank, which holds only 9 litres (2.38 U.S. gallons), is located directly behind the carbon fiber cockpit. The fully <b>laden</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle, including fuel, oil, ice, water coolant and the driver, is slightly less than 2,700 kg.|$|R
