[...] Sodium peroxide may go by the commercial names of Solozone and Flocool. In chemistry preparations, sodium peroxide is used as an oxidizing agent. It is also used as an oxygen source by reacting it with carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and sodium carbonate; it is thus particularly useful in scuba gear, submarines, etc. Lithium peroxide has similar uses.|$|E
2500|$|George Starkey's alchemical {{laboratory}} {{expertise and}} formalised methodology were highly respected by {{the scientific community}} and {{became the basis for}} later practices in eighteenth-century experimental chymistry. His influence on Boyle's work and discoveries in chymistry is indisputable. It is perhaps the survival of Starkey's laboratory journals that is most important, for they provide the least opaque window through which to view the <b>laboratory</b> <b>operations</b> and methodological practices of a seventeenth-century alchemist. Also, Starkey's written works, especially under the name Philalethes, were widely circulated and enormously popular. [...] They were read by notable men of science in the seventeenth century and well into the eighteenth century, to include Boyle, Locke, Leibniz, and Newton. Indeed, his writings were influential in the emerging field of chymistry by advancing the doctrine that chemical phenomena are the result of the interaction of insensible particles accompanied by chemical forces. Although George Starkey will probably never be regarded as a canonical figure in early modern science, his achievements nevertheless are significant and contribute to a wider {{understanding of the nature of}} science during this period and its historical development.|$|E
