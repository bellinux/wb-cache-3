In the eighth inning, a home run by Reggie Jackson made the score 5–2 in favor of the Yankees. [...] The Red Sox cut New York's lead to just one run {{in the bottom of the}} eighth against closer Goose Gossage on RBI singles by Fred Lynn and Yastrzemski. [...] But the Yankees would hold off the Red Sox, thanks in part to a heads-up {{defensive}} play by right fielder Lou Piniella with one out in the bottom of the ninth. [...] With Burleson on first base, Jerry Remy hit a line drive to Piniella in right field, but Piniella was blinded by the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> and could not see the ball. However, he pretended to field the play normally, pounding his glove as though he would easily catch the ball. [...] This prevented Burleson from advancing to third base. [...] When Jim Rice followed with a deep fly to the outfield, Burleson could only move up to third base instead of scoring the tying run.|$|E

60|$|For a {{few moments}} he indulged his old joy in range and mountain, stretching, rising on his right, away into the purple distance. Something had {{heightened}} its beauty. How softly gray the rolling range land--how black the timbered slopes! The town before him sat like a hideous blotch on a fair landscape. It forced his gaze over and beyond toward the west, where the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> had begun to mellow and redden, edging the clouds with exquisite light. To the southward lay Arizona, land of painted mesas and storied canyon walls, of thundering streams and wild pine forests, of purple-saged valleys and grassy parks, set like mosaics between the stark desert mountains.|$|E

How frail he seemed--too frail of body for the magnificent spirit so flashing in his eyes, so scathing on his bitter lips. Lane bade him good-bye and turned away, with a strange intimation {{that this was the}} last time he would ever see Blair alive.|$|R
50|$|Benning has {{employed}} diverse methods, themes, structures, and aesthetics, investigating {{narrative and}} anti-narrative modes, personal history, race, collective memory, place, industry, and landscape. His philosophy of “landscape {{as a function}} of time,” and “Looking and Listening” (which is also the name of a course taught by Benning) is particularly evident in his films since 1999 in the form of fixed, stable shots. For instance, each of El Centro, Los, and Sogobi—The California Trilogy (2000-2001) is composed of 35 2½ minute shots. Nightfall (2012) consists of a single 98-minute shot made at a high elevation in the woods in the west Sierras that begins in <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> as the <b>sun</b> is going down and ends in near blackness.|$|R

Eustacia went with her head thrown back fancifully, a certain glad and voluptuous air of triumph pervading her eyes at having won by her own unaided self {{a man who was}} her perfect complement in attainment, appearance, and age. On the young man's part, the paleness of face which he had brought with him from Paris, and the incipient marks of time and thought, were less perceptible than when he returned, the healthful and energetic sturdiness which was his by nature having partially recovered its original proportions. They wandered onward till they reached the nether margin of the heath, where it became marshy and merged in moorland.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the city}} proper {{just south of}} the main plaza, is the Cathedral, which is located over the ruins of pre-Hispanic temples. The current {{structure}} dates from 1752 and has a façade of sculpted pink stone. The best time to appreciate the façade is in the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when the <b>sun</b> shines directly on it. This church is considered {{to be one of the}} best examples of Mexican Churrigueresque architecture. The first parish church was built on this site between 1567 and 1585, but it was in ruins by the beginning of the 17th century. A second church was built between 1612 and 1625 and was called the Chapel of Santo Cristo. [...] The remains of this construction can be seen in the first level of the south tower and the main façade. The current cathedral was begun in 1729 with main façade finished in 1745 but not opened to worship until 1752.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the <b>afternoon,</b> the <b>sun</b> moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon.

40|$|The site {{designated}} {{for the new}} St. Anthony’s primary school is located on a gentle slope eastward with steep incline to the west. This west hill helps form a natural barrier against the wind driven rains during southwest monsoons as well as protecting from the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> summer <b>sun</b> (Fig. 2). The school requires a total built-up space of ap-proximately 1500 m. Classroom spaces comprise 41 % of the total school programme (Fig. 3).

But in front sprawls a sort of hell, or purgatory: cranes, immense bridges spanning platforms mines with containers, refneries and factories between which are creeping swamps, everything in poor condition and rusted out, as though irreperably polluted yet somehow endowed with a strange beauty. “ Antoine Piçon: Anxious Landscapes, p. 64. „The chief function {{of the city is}} to convert power into form, energy into culture, dead matter into the living symbols of art, biological reproduction into social creativity. “ Lewis Mumford: The city in history: its origins, its transformations, and its prospects, p. 571.

He most often collaborated with the accomplished painter of figures and animals Adriaen van de Velde. The two artists had an especially successful partnership built on their complementary skills: Adriaen van de Velde contributed his lively and well-characterised figures to van der Heyden's exquisitely painted architectural settings.

5000|$|Shade screens utilize acrylic canvas or a mesh fabric, {{which allows}} some view-through while {{blocking}} the sun's rays. The roller {{at the top}} may be hand-cranked or motorized. The fabric is gravity-fed, with a weighted bottom rail pulling the fabric down between guide rails or guy wires. Exterior shades are much more effective at blocking heat than interior shades, since they block the heat before it enters the glass. This style of framed screen is typically done by professional installers, because of the specialized frames and tools required. A recent advancement is frame-less shade screens, which allows a [...] "DIY-er" [...] to install their own exterior shades.
