5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE <b>level.</b> <b>As</b> a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E

The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{hyperbaric}} oxygen combined with drug therapy on cerebral blood flow characteristics, nerve injury and nerve cytokines in the convalescence of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. Methods: A total of 215 patients who were in convalescence of hypertension cerebral hemorrhage and treated in our hospital between January 2013 and January 2017 were collected and divided into the control group (n= 109) who received conventional therapy and the observation group (n= 106) who received adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and both therapies lasted for 1 month. The differences in nerve function and neurotrophic state were compared {{between the two groups}} of patients before and after treatment. Results: Before treatment, differences in the levels of cerebral hemodynamic index <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> well as nerve injury index, amino acid neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor contents were not statistically significant between the two groups of patients. After 1 month of treatment, Vmean and Qmean <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> well as serum GABA, Gly, BDNF, NGF and NTF contents of both groups of patients were higher than those before treatment while R and Wv <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> well as serum S 100 B, GEAP, NSE, Glu and Asp contents were lower than those before treatment, and Vmean and Qmean <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> well as serum GABA, Gly, BDNF, NGF and NTF contents of observation group were higher than those of control group while R and Wv <b>levels</b> <b>as</b> well as serum S 100 B, GEAP, NSE, Glu and Asp contents were lower than those of control group.
