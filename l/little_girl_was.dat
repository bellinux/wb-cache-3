500|$|The {{appearance}} of Samantha Mulder, {{this time as}} a clone of her from {{when she was still}} a <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>was</b> due to series creator Chris Carter's desire to bring her back. Carter felt Samantha was an important element of the show, referring to her as being part of the lifeblood of the series. The decision to kill the character X was made {{at the end of the}} third season. The writers felt that they could only do so much with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger player on the show, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Fox Mulder. Ultimately they decided on the latter. This led to the introduction of Marita Covarrubias at the end of the episode, Mulder's latest informant.|$|E
500|$|... "Road Trip" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{said the}} episode {{was a good}} payoff to the romance between Leslie and Ben all season, a story arc he initially had problems with. Sepinwall also called the Ron Swanson subplot [...] "simply fantastic in both concept and execution". Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called [...] "Road Trip" [...] a very funny episode and strong pay-off to the romance between Leslie and Ben that had been building all season. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the Know Ya Boo story felt simply like an excuse to include Andy and April in the show, but that Ron's subplot with the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>was</b> [...] "classic Ron Swanson". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the plot felt [...] "admittedly, a little more sitcom-y than I like" [...] but was very funny and progressed the Leslie and Ben story arc without letting the show [...] "jump the shark".|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} the hospital, Peter {{is confronted}} by a little girl, who says she holds the answer to his problem. He talks to the little girl, who runs off. While {{pursuing}} her, Peter encounters a group of men; a woman in red informs him these are alternate versions of himself, from alternate timelines where he never became Spider-Man. The woman in red transforms into the demon Mephisto, who tells Peter he can save Aunt May. As payment, Mephisto wants not Peter's soul, but his marriage to Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane are given until midnight the following night to decide their answer and, after several hours agonizing over the choice, they agree to the deal, as long as knowledge of Peter's secret identity is erased from the world. Mary Jane also whispers to Mephisto another, unspecified offer in return for Mephisto putting Peter's life back exactly how it was and [...] " [...] him a chance at happiness." [...] Finally, Mephisto reveals to the couple that his disguise as the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>was</b> in fact their future daughter, but she will never exist because of their decision. [...] This future daughter is {{not to be confused with}} May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker (Spider-Girl). [...] May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker is the baby that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had at the end of the Clone Saga from the 1990s and would grow up to be Spider-Girl if Norman Osborn never killed her.|$|E

500|$|Shelley {{wrote to}} his wife Mary that Allegra looked pale and quiet {{when he saw her}} in 1818. When he saw her again in 1821 at the Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, when she was four, he again felt she looked pale and {{delicate}} and was infuriated by the Roman Catholic education she was receiving, though he had initially told Byron he approved of her being sent to a convent. [...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is always talking of the Bambino ... The idea of bringing up so sweet a creature in the midst of such trash till Sixteen!" [...] he wrote." [...] However, though Shelley thought the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>was</b> more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any real memory of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at Chessington Zoo and continued from 18 October 1954 into December. The budget was £42,000, low {{even by the}} standards of Hammer at the time. [...] Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled, [...] "We did Quatermass on a budget so low it wasn't a real budget. I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie". The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site {{at the beginning of the}} movie were filmed in the village of Bray, Berkshire, where Hammer's studios were located. The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at Water Oakley, near Bray. It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather put paid to this idea. Guest used a wide-angle lens for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene. Carroon's encounter with the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>was</b> filmed at the East India Docks in London. A second unit, under cameraman Len Harris, conducted additional location shooting around London for the montage scenes of the police search for Carroon. For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at Battersea Power Station to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the River Thames. Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the Windsor area. The rest of the film was shot at Hammer's Bray Studios, with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey. Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused. The rooms of Down Place, the former country house Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax's office. Art director James Elder Wills, in his final film for Hammer, made great use of the existing architecture of Down Place to enhance the effectiveness of his sets.|$|E

[...] That <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>was</b> Flavia. Bradley explains [...] "she walked onto the page of another book I was writing, and simply hijacked the story."

2500|$|Detectives Joseph, Komorous, and Sheehan {{accompanied}} Frank Paroubek in {{his search}} for the departed wagon which was initially believed to be headed for Round Lake, Illinois, a village about 50 miles northwest of Chicago, where seven wagons were camped. Farmers in the area were alerted to be on watch. When local residents started asking [...] "gypsies" [...] about Elsie and attempting to search the wagons, they broke camp again {{and moved on to}} Volo, Illinois, 43 miles from Chicago. Volo residents reported a child matching Elsie's description and said she appeared to be [...] "stupefied" [...] or [...] "drugged" [...] and partly covered with a blanket. They also attempted to search the wagons, but the [...] "gypsies" [...] immediately broke camp and departed for McHenry, Illinois, about 60 miles northwest of Chicago. When police caught up with them at McHenry, they discovered the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "gypsy" [...] and did not match Elsie's description. Meanwhile, Police Capt. Mahoney assigned men to drag the drainage canals near Elsie's home on April 12th and again on the 15th.|$|E
