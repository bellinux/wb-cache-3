2500|$|In 19th century Parisian cafés, upon {{receiving}} {{an order for}} an absinthe, a waiter would present the patron with a dose of absinthe in a suitable glass, sugar, absinthe spoon, and a carafe of iced water. It {{was up to the}} patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. [...] As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar of iced water with spigots, mounted on a <b>lamp</b> <b>base.</b> This let drinkers prepare a number of drinks at once—and with a hands-free drip, patrons could socialise while louching a glass.|$|E
2500|$|In {{manufacturing}} {{the glass}} bulb, {{a type of}} [...] "ribbon machine" [...] is used. A continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt, heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the glass bulbs are created. After the bulbs are blown, and cooled, they are cut off the ribbon machine; a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour. The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the <b>lamp</b> <b>base,</b> and the whole assembly tested.|$|E
50|$|The lamp {{was invented}} by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume Carcel (1750-1818) to {{overcome}} the disadvantages of the Argand-type lamps then in use. The vegetable - mostly colza - oils then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. The Argand lamps used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making the lamp top heavy. Carcel designed a lamp with the oil reservoir under the burner, {{in the body of}} the lamp. To keep the oil moving up to the burner, Carcel housed a clockwork mechanism in the <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank. The winding key was located at the bottom of the <b>lamp</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Bubble lights {{have been}} made in two {{different}} <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> sizes — E10 (C6) 15 volt, and E12 (C7). The original design used a miniature screw base (E10), such as those used on C6 cone-shaped Christmas lamps. For 120 V power, these early designs were nominally designed to operate with eight on one string, in series, at 15 volts each. However, they were often packaged with a nine-socket string to extend the life of the bulbs. Bubble lights could also be purchased individually for use in existing light strings. Modern incarnations either use candelabra base (E12) 120-volt bulbs, or push-in wedge base [...] "midget" [...] size miniature bulbs (most commonly ten 12-volt bulbs wired in series).|$|E

50|$|Watts {{can also}} be a direct measure of output. In a radiometric sense, an {{incandescent}} light bulb is about 80% efficient: 20% of the energy is lost (e.g. by conduction through the <b>lamp</b> <b>base).</b> The remainder is emitted as radiation, mostly in the infrared. Thus, a 60 watt light bulb emits a total radiant flux of about 45 watts. Incandescent bulbs are, in fact, sometimes used as heat sources (as in a chick incubator), but usually they are used for the purpose of providing light. As such, they are very inefficient, because most of the radiant energy they emit is invisible infrared. A compact fluorescent lamp can provide light comparable to a 60 watt incandescent while consuming as little as 15 watts of electricity.|$|E

5000|$|When completed, the {{memorial}} stood 14 feet high, with a dome supported by four worked marble columns, {{supported by a}} polished granite die. On {{two sides of the}} dome were sculptured likenesses of Dr Koch. The marble columns and sculptured work were imported from Carrara in Italy. The granite for the die and plinth came from Mount Elliot, near Townsville - that used for the die was polished to a mirror-like finish, while that of the plinth was [...] "fine-axed".The memorial was still in the Townsville workshops in late May 1903 but was in place at the intersection of Abbott and Spence Streets by 13 June 1903, when it was unveiled by Major-General Sir Herbert Chermside, the Governor of Queensland. By , {{the memorial}} also carried two street signs. By the late 1920s the single lamp and <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> {{at the top of the}} dome had been replaced with a pair of gas street lamps suspended from a tall metal column. By the late 1940s, the lamps and lamp fitting at the top of the dome had been removed entirely. Photographic evidence suggests that the memorial remained in the centre of the intersection until at least the mid-1960s, but had been removed to nearby Anzac Memorial Park (bounded by Abbott and Spence Streets and the Esplanade), by the mid-1970s. It was relocated within this park following redevelopment of the reserve in the mid-1990s.|$|E

Early whale oil railroad lanterns share some characteristics of the Mammoth Cave lanterns, but L 2 ̆ 6 N Railroad lanterns do not appear to have influenced the design. At this time, the design pathway appears to lead from simple open-flame tin candle lanterns to the same lantern with a petticoat lamp affixed in place of the candle, and then finally to the font or oil container being soldered onto the <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> as one unit. This basic Mammoth Cave lantern varied somewhat over the decades, and was probably the primary light source used by Max Kaemper and Ed Bishop in their survey and exploration work. It is possible that Max and Ed had a carbide headlight or even a gas lantern to augment the feeble light from the Mammoth Cave lamps, but there is no record of such use...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{adoption}} of a shareholder risk-reward mechanism by the California PUC for the investor owned utilities (IOUs) has left possible shareholder earnings or penalties highly dependent on inputs to the resource net benefit calculations, including savings, costs, and measure life estimates. This is especially true as the California IOU portfolios are heavily reliant on certain compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) measures. This paper focuses on how one critical cost-effectiveness input can affect the overall cost-effectiveness of a CFL program. A few years ago, the California DEER adopted a measure life estimation approach for screw-in CFL measures {{that is based on}} two parameters: manufacturer rated life and hours of operation. The lighting industry rates lamp life using a three hours “on ” and twenty minutes “off ” cycle. Consequently, the DEER rated life-based methodology is different from prior years’ retention data-based measure life estimates typically known as the effective useful life (EUL) 1. The DEER rated life-based estimate provides only a proxy EUL for CFLs, and does not account for other factors that can affect the measure life including “burn time ” (the length of on time per on/off cycle), <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> orientation, placement in an open or closed fixture, use with timers, dimmers, and motion sensors, early removal, or burnout. This paper critiques the DEER rated life-based methodologies and shows that the length of on time per on/off cycle leads to a different “observed ” life expectancy for CFLs than the manufacturers ’ rated life...|$|E
40|$|The saving {{potential}} of electrical energy for lighting in housing is very high. With {{the first phase}} of the European regulation on the production and sale of non-effective incandescent lamps having just come into effect, it appears that the use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) becomes an important topic. For that reason, this paper lists the major barriers to the spread of compact fluorescent lamps in housing and analyses four of them. 16 compact fluorescent lamps were measured in a laboratory in order to study their warm-up time, their colour shift during warm-up, the impact of their position on their luminous flux and their light output equivalent, in comparison to two incandescent lamps. Measurements show that information given on the lamp package is incomplete and inaccurate. The 1 : 5 rule, currently applied by European manufacturers in order to calculate the power of a CFL replacing an incandescent lamp, is inappropriate. A ratio of 1 : 4 would be better. While it has been observed that the position of the <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> has an impact of the lamp efficacy, it was impossible to predict which position is best. The run-up time of compact fluorescent lamp can be long and depends on the shape of the lamp. The lamp colour modification during run-up is visible and can be a barrier to the use of compact fluorescent lamps. Tube CFLs should be favored as they have a higher luminous efficacy and take less time to reach their nominal flux. Finally, the measurements did not show any correlation between the lamp price and their quality. status: publishe...|$|E

Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most <b>lamps</b> have metal <b>bases</b> that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible <b>lamp</b> <b>bases.</b> General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for <b>lamp</b> <b>bases</b> include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products.
