A 42 -year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented with fever, weight loss and abdominal pain. Both patients had lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia. Initially, the hyperlactataemia was thought to result from tissue hypoxia (sepsis) but it persisted after correction of the hypovolaemia; therefore, alternative causes were considered. Both patients {{were found to have}} T-cell lymphoma with liver infiltration. The male patient died before treatment could be initiated. The lactic acidosis resolved in the female patient following lymphoma treatment, but she died subsequently from the lymphoma. <b>Lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancies</b> should be considered for cases of lactic acidosis with sufficient oxygen supply, particularly when hypoglycaemia is also present.

40|$|Clinical and {{pathological}} {{evidence suggests}} that {{a wide spectrum of}} lymphoproliferation exists in Sjögren's syndrome (SS), from benign disease with lymphoid infiltrates confined to glandular tissue on the one end, to widespread <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancy</b> on the other. In the middle of the spectrum are patients threatened by extraglandular extension of lymphoproliferation which is not clinically or histologically malignant and which apparently has the potential to regress with appropriate therapy or to progress to frank neoplasia. Illustrative patients are described. Over thirty other case reports associating SS with pseudolymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, reticulum cell sarcoma, or other lymphomas appear in the literature. Similar lymphoproliferative processes have been observed in other autoimmune diseases, in certain immune deficiency states, with hydantoin and other anticonvulsant drugs, and in experimental animal models. In SS, as in these other conditions, it seems likely that a combination of genetic, immunologic, and viral or other unknown environmental factors plays a role in pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|In a {{retrospective}} follow-up {{we compared the}} incidence of malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with cyclophosphamide with that in another group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and also with the incidence of malignancies in the general population.

40|$|Precedent from {{preclinical}} experiments {{coupled with}} two pivotal phase 2 studies in myeloma has {{focused attention on}} a potential role for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in modulating a number of events that occur commonly in the neoplastic process involving proteins in the regulation of cells cycling, growth and differentiation. This influence is vested in the proteasomes which are large complexes of proteolytic enzymes responsible for degradation {{of many of these}} intracellular messengers. Logically interest has centred on molecules having the capacity to influence, by degradation, such molecules and although a number of agents are in development bortezomib is the only one currently in clinical use. Velcade, formerly PS- 341, is a novel dipeptide boronic acid capable of reversibly inhibiting the 26 S proteasome through a range of activities. The latter are anti-proliferative and proapoptotic with the latter blocking nuclear transcription via NF-κ B in addition to down regulating adhesion and inhibiting angiogenesis.

40|$|Numb chin {{syndrome}} (NCS) is a sensory neuropathy presenting with numbness of {{the chin}} {{in the distribution}} of the mental nerve and the branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Though it can be caused by a benign process, NCS should be regarded as being due to malignancy until proven otherwise. Among the malignancies that cause NCS the most common are breast cancer, prostate cancer, and <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancy.</b> In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus, spread to the mandible is a rare and often late event. An often overlooked clinical sign in mandibular metastases is hypoesthesia or paresthesia over the peripheral distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve/mental nerve; this sign has been referred to in the literature as NCS or numb lip syndrome or mental nerve neuropathy. Rarely, this may be the first presentation of a disseminated malignancy. Prognosis is usually poor. The discovery of this symptom should alert the clinician to the possibility of disseminated disease.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the graft vs. host disease (GVH) ~ on murine immune {{functions}} are currently under intensive study. A recent report (1) {{suggests that there is}} a heightened immune responsiveness during the 1 st wk of the GVH reaction followed subsequently by immunosuppression. These time differences in immune reactivity may explain, at least in part, earlier contradictory reports on the level of the antibody response (2, 3) and the effects on tumor growth (4 - 8) of GVH reactions. In addition, the late immunosuppression has been implicated in C-type RNA viral release and an increased incidence of <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancies</b> (9). The relationship, however, among chronic immunostimulation, immunosuppression, and the development of lymphomas remains unclear. Moreover, the mechanism of immunosuppression is unknown. Virus particles, suppressor T cells, and macrophages have all been implicated (10 - 12).

40|$|Introduction: Abdominal {{organs are}} usually {{involved}} in <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancies</b> (LRM), and the detection {{is crucial for}} Initial staging, determination of the location and extent of disease, and is the hallmark for the choice of treatment. At present, the established radiological technique for staging Hodgkin's disease is computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (USG) in our country. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the pattern of abdominal organ involvement in childhood LRM by USG and CT and to analyze the findings. Methods: The study included 121 children with newly diagnosed childhood LRM who underwent real time USG and contrast enhanced CT scan. The records of the US and CT scanning were analyzed with respect to size, shape, margins, echogenicity /density pattern of various abdominal organs and lymph nodes to evaluate the extent and pattern of abdominal organ involvement by the disease process. Results: Out of 121 cases of LRM, US detected significant portal lymphadenopathy in 9 (7. 44 %) cases where CT detected enlarged portal nodes in only 3 and missed in 6 cases. However in the retroperitoneal lynphadenopathy CT scored over US, as CT detected 16 (13. 22 %) cases as against 13 (10. 74 %) cases detected by US. Conclusion: In our study we observed abdominal organs are commonly involved at the time of initial presentation in childhood LRM, with diffuse organomegaly being commoner than focal lesions. Abdominal symptoms and GIT involvement were also found more common in NHL patients at their initial presentation. There are no characteristic patterns of involvement either on US or CT which are specific to any individual disease entity. Although organomegaly and focal lesions are not diagnostic, but in a known case of childhood LRM these are highly suggestive of involvement by the existing disease process. There is no significant difference in the detection rate of abdominal organ involvement by US and CT in our study. However US being safer and cheaper, US may be suggested as the primary imaging modality to detect abdominal organ involvement in childhood LRM at initial presentation...|$|R
40|$|The International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas {{estimates}} {{a staggering}} 590 million people affected with diabetes mellitus (DM) {{within the next}} two decades globally, of which Type 2 DM will constitute more than 90 %. The associated insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia pose a further significant risk for developing diverse malignant neoplasms. Diabetes and malignancy are multifactorial heterogeneous diseases. The immune dysfunction secondary to Type 2 diabetes also reactivates latent infections with high morbidity and mortality rates. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous human herpes virus- 4, is an oncogenic virus; its recrudescence in the immunocompromised condition activates the expression of EBV latency genes, thus immortalizing the infected cell and giving rise to lymphomas and carcinomas. Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), common in South-East Asia and Latin America; is a belligerent type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) almost invariably associated with EBV. An analysis of articles sourced from the PubMed database and Google Scholar web resource until February 2014, suggests an increasing incidence of NHL in Asia/India and of ENKTCL in India, over the last few decades. This article reviews the epidemiological evidence linking various neoplasms with Type 2 DM and prognosticates the emergence of ENKTCL as a common <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancy</b> secondary to Type 2 diabetes, in the Indian population in the next few decades...|$|E

In this study, brain MRI was performed in 10 adults with ataxia-telangiectasia having stable neurologic impair-ment. Intracerebral telangiectasia with multiple punctate hemosiderin deposits were identified in 60 % of subjects. These lesions were apparently asymptomatic. They are similar in appearance to radiation-induced telangiectasia and to cryptogenic vascular malformations. Also noted, in the 2 oldest subjects, was extensive white matter T 2 hyperintensity, and in 1 of these a space-occupying fluid collection consistent with transudative capillary leak and edema as evidenced by reduced levels of metabolites on MR spectroscopic imaging. Asymptomatic supratentorial vascular abnormalities appear to be common in adults with ataxia-telangiectasia.

40|$|Candida albicans is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen and a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality in patients with compromised immune function. The cytokine response to tissue invasion by C. albicans can influence the differentiation and function of lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells that are critical components of the host response. While the production of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has been documented in mice infected with C. albicans and is known to suppress phagocyte function, the cellular source and role of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of systemic candidiasis are not well understood. We have investigated the source of production of TGF-β by immunohistochemical studies in tissue samples from patients with an uncommon complication of <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancy,</b> chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC), and from a neutropenic-rabbit model of CDC. Liver biopsy specimens from patients with documented CDC demonstrated intense staining for extracellular matrix-associated TGF-β 1 within inflammatory granulomas, as well as staining for TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3 within adjacent hepatocytes. These results correlate with the immunolocalization of TGF-β observed in livers of infected neutropenic rabbits, using a neutralizing antibody that recognizes the mature TGF-β protein. Human peripheral blood monocytes incubated with C. albicans in vitro release large amounts of biologically active TGF-β 1. The data demonstrate that local production of active TGF-βs by hepatocytes and by infected mononuclear cells is a component of the response to C. albicans infection that most probably contributes to disease progression in the immunocompromised host...|$|E
40|$|In three {{geographically}} and genetically close Newfoundland communities, {{there was}} an aggregate of 19 cases of Hodgkins disease, embryonic tumour, lymphosarcoma, leukaemia, thymoma and immunodeficiency. In this study, 939 sera from community members and control samples from 321 blood donors and healthy children were tested for their concentrations of immunoglobulins G, A, M and D by immunodiffusion. The results were submitted to a multifactorial analysis of variance. [...] The main findings were that (i) significant differences in immunoglobulin concentrations associated with age and sex; (ii) no significant association between variations in tonsil size and the mean concentrations of the 4 immunoglobulin classes; (iii) the mean concentrations of IgG, IgA and IgM were elevated {{in the first and}} second degree relatives of the patients particularly relatives of those with embryonic tumour, lymphosarcoma, leukaemia and thymoma, and of those with immunodeficiency, {{and to a lesser extent}} in relatives of patients with Hodgkins disease; (iv) the relatives of patients with Hodgkins disease had a significantly elevated mean IgD level compared with the mean IgD levels found for other groups; (v) many relatives of the patients showed immunoglobulin deficiencies of various grades and one case each of hypogammaglobulinemia and isolated IgA deficiency. [...] Elevated immunoglobulins in relatives of patients with <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancies</b> and immunodeficiencies may result from increased antigenic stimulation of the immune system, perhaps by an infective agent. A subtle form of immunodeficiency which permits the entry of antigens into these individuals more easily than in healthy people, may be a predisposing factor. It is also possible that the closely associated immunodeficiency and malignancy could both result from the same cause. The peculiar genetic make up of this community with a high incidence of inbreeding raises the possibility of an inherited disposition to both conditions. Continued exposure of the community to an infective agent (Virus(es)) may lead to raised immunoglobulin levels in many people, and to overt disease such as malignancy or severe immunodeficiency in a few. Since the functional state of the immune system may be inherited, it is likely that the predisposition to virus carriage is genetically determined. [...] It is suggested that both genetic and environmental factors may be contributing significantly to immunopathology in these communities...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Adriamycin though {{considered}} {{as an effective}} anticancer drug, leads to irreversible cardiomyopathy (CMP) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the protective effect of carvedilol in adriamycin (ADR) -induced cardiomyopathy (CMP) in cancer patients. Methods: Patients with <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancy</b> in whom ADR therapy was planned were randomized into two groups: carvedilol and control. Twenty seven patients each were enrolled in carvedilol and control groups. In the carvedilol group, 12. 5 mg once daily oral carvedilol was given during six months. The patients were evaluated by echocardiography before and after chemotherapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and systolic and diastolic diameters were calculated. Results: At six months of follow up, six patients in the carvedilol group and five in the control group had died. The mean EF (63. 19 vs. 63. 88 %) and fraction shortening (FS) (34 vs. 34. 6) of the carvedilol group were similar at follow up, but in the control group, the mean EF (67. 27 vs. 60. 82 %, P = 0. 003) and FS (38. 48 vs. 34. 6, P< 0. 05) at control echocardiography were significantly lower. In carvedilol group, both systolic and diastolic diameters were not changed, but in control group, systolic diameters were significantly increased compared with basal measures (left ventricular end systolic diameter = 28. 26 ± 5. 50 mm vs. 31. 25 ± 6. 50 mm; P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Although Elizabethkingia meningoseptica (Chryseobacterium meningosepticum) {{infections in}} immunocompromised hosts have been recognised, {{clinical}} data detailing these infections remain limited, especially from India. Antimicrobial susceptibility data on E. meningoseptica remain very limited, with no established breakpoints by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The organism is usually multidrug resistant to antibiotics usually prescribed for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections, {{a serious challenge}} to {{the patient and the}} treating clinicians. Materials and Methods: The analysis was done in a tertiary care oncology and stem cell transplant center. Susceptibility testing and identification of E. meningoseptica was done using Vitek auto analyzer. Records of immunocompromised patients with E. meningoseptica bacteremia were analysed from January 2009 to March 2012. Results: A total of 29 E. meningoseptica bacteremia cases were documented between 2009 and 2012. Eleven patients were immunocompromised. Three were post stem cell transplant and one was post cord blood transplant. The mean age of the patients was 48. 4 years. Mean Charlson′s comorbidity index was 5. 7. Four had solid organ malignancies, five had hematological malignancies, and two had <b>lymphoreticular</b> <b>malignancy.</b> Eight patients had received chemotherapy. Mean Apache II score was 18. Mean Pitts score for bacteremia was 4. 7. Two were neutropenic (one post SCT, one MDS post chemo) with a mean white blood cell (WBC) count of 450 /mm 3. Ten had a line at the time of bacteremia. Mean duration of the line prior to bacteremia was 8 days. Eight had line-related bacteremia. Three had pneumonia with secondary bacteremia. All received combination therapy with two or more antibiotics which included cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, or cefepime-tazobactam. All the isolates showed in vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin. Five patients died, but a multivariate analysis was not done to calculate the attributable mortality. Conclusion: In our study, central line was the commonest risk factor for E. meningosepticum bacteremia, although a multivariate analysis was not done. There has not been much of a change in the susceptibility pattern of these organisms over 3 years, with good susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam and cotrimoxazole. Even though uncommon, E. meningoseptica is an important pathogen, especially in immunocompromised hosts with indwelling devices...|$|E
