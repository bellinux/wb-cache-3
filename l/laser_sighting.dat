The rail system also has two side mounts for additional devices such as flashlights or <b>laser</b> <b>sighting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The H.E.X. suit has a {{wide variety}} of weapons {{designed}} to kill superhumans. It has machine guns, mini-guns, and possibly rocket launchers, all with built-in <b>laser</b> <b>sighting</b> technology and automated targeting systems. It also enables the pilot to lift extremely heavy objects and is also equipped with razor sharp talons for close-quarter combat. It is not yet known if the suit can allow its wearer to fly, but if it can then it stands to become a major threat to any superhuman it faces.|$|E

The lasers are green, {{as opposed to the}} traditional red, because the color is closer {{to the center of the}} visible spectrum and therefore more easily visible to the human eye. Viridian products are available to military, law enforcement, and civilian users and they are compatible with a wide range of firearms.|$|R

5000|$|Gali [...] is {{armed with}} the Kanohi Kaukau, Mask of Underwater Breathing, which allows her to breathe {{underwater}} for a limited time; the Nuva version of this mask allows her to share this ability with others, as well as last longer underwater. As a Toa Mata, she was armed with hooks, which were later transformed into Aqua Axes, which doubled as fins to help her swim faster underwater. She additionally had propellers as a Nuva. As a Mistika, she is armed with a Nynrah Ghost Blaster with <b>laser</b> <b>sighting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The P99 RAD grip {{shape and}} texture has been altered when {{compared}} to the P99 variants and an extended ambidextrous slide release and extended ambidextrous magazine release levers are fitted as a standard feature. Besides that the slide shape, dimensions and serrations have been altered. The standard sights are high-contrast 3 dot sights with contrast enhancements that have been painted with afterglow paint that can aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions. As an option the P99 RAD can also be fitted with self-luminous tritium night sights. The P99 RAD pistol is available with the DAO trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately 39 N and the QA trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately 32 N. The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and <b>laser</b> <b>sighting</b> devices.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{alterations}} {{found in}} the Fabryka Broni Radom P99 RAD variant were also applied in the Walther P99Q pistol. The P99Q is a designated police pistol, which has been certified according to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police (Technische Richtlinie Pistolen im Kaliber 9mm x 19, Revision January 2008). The P99Q is exclusively manufactured for German and foreign police departments and is not available on the civilian market. The P99Q has a partially pre-loaded internal striker trigger mechanism that conforms to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. Trigger travel is approximately 13 mm with a trigger reset of 6 mm and a trigger pull of approximately 32 N. The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last. The Technical Specifications (TR 2008) of the German Police also demand an accuracy of fire for a 10-shot group with German Police certified 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition at 25 m (R100) of ≤ 16 cm. This equals an accuracy of fire of ≤ 22 minute of angle (MOA) or ≤ 6.4 mrad. The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and <b>laser</b> <b>sighting</b> devices.|$|E

40|$|A new Jacob’s staff design {{incorporating}} a 3 D positioning stage and a <b>laser</b> <b>sighting</b> stage is described. The first combines a compass and a circular spirit level on a movable bracket {{and the second}} introduces a laser able to slide vertically and rotate on a plane parallel to bedding. The new design allows greater precision in stratigraphic thickness measurement while restricting the cost and maintaining speed of measurement to levels {{similar to those of}} a traditional Jacob’s staff. Greater precision is achieved as a result of: a) improved 3 D positioning of the rod through the use of the integrated compass and spirit level holder; b) more accurate sighting of geological surfaces by tracing with height adjustable rotatable laser; c) reduced error when shifting the trace of the log laterally (i. e. away from the dip direction) within the trace of the laser plane, and d) improved measurement of bedding dip and direction necessary to orientate the Jacob’s staff, using the rotatable laser. The new laser holder design {{can also be used to}} verify parallelism of a geological surface with structural dip by creating a visual planar datum in the field and thus allowing determination of surfaces which cut the bedding at an angle (e. g., clinoforms, levees, erosion surfaces, amalgamation surfaces, etc.). Stratigraphic thickness measurements and estimates of measurement uncertainty are valuable to many applications of sedimentology and stratigraphy at different scales (e. g., bed statistics, reconstruction of palaeotopographies, depositional processes at bed scale, architectural element analysis), especially when a quantitative approach is applied to the analysis of the data; the ability to collect larger data sets with improved precision will increase the quality of such studies...|$|E
