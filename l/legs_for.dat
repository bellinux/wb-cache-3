5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy <b>legs.</b> <b>For</b> many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|Haislett was {{the first}} American woman to defeat a swimmer from East Germany in the 100-meter {{freestyle}} since the 1972 Summer Olympics; she did so at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle, Washington. At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Western Australia, Haislett won the 100-meter freestyle, and swam the anchor <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays, ending the East German women's eighteen years of overwhelming dominance in the 100-meter freestyle at the world championships. Haislett also endured the emotional agony of disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water.|$|E
5|$|The first {{winners of}} the tournament were Aston Villa. The final was contested over two <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> the first six years of the competition. During this period many First Division clubs refused to take part, {{allowing}} clubs from outside the First Division to regularly reach the final. The first club from outside the First Division to win the competition was Norwich City of the Second Division in 1962. Queen's Park Rangers and Swindon Town, both then of Division Three, matched this feat in 1967 and 1969 respectively. Sheffield Wednesday, then in the Second Division, became the last club to win the competition while competing outside the First Division, when they beat Manchester United in the 1991 final.|$|E

5|$|The non-reproductive castes of {{termites}} are wingless {{and rely}} exclusively on their six <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> locomotion. The alates fly {{only for a}} brief amount of time, so they also rely on their legs. The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an arolium, located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.|$|E
5|$|The terrier of {{this period}} was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad across the top. Used in hunting packs and kept in kennels along with English Foxhounds, they were bred {{for their ability to}} drive the fox out of its den. Gradually the pace of the hunt became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> more speed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. However the {{increased}} size meant that the Fox Terrier became too big to be used for its original purpose, and its use in fox hunting began to decline.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, Madonna {{announced}} plans of collaborating with Art Basel {{to revive the}} Tears of a Clown show, at a benefit gala on December 2, 2016 at Miami Beach's Faena Forum. The location was developed by Argentine hotelier and real estate developer, Alan Faena, and the show would coincide {{with the opening of}} the Forum. The concert was held along with an accompanying art auction and dinner, to benefit Madonna's Raising Malawi foundation to support their projects like Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi, as well as art and education initiatives for impoverished children in the country. Madonna herself auctioned some of her art collection, as well as never-before-seen pictures from her marriage to actor Sean Penn, photographed by Herb Ritts. Tickets were highly priced, at general admission of $5,000 with VIP meet-and-greet packages coming at $150,000. She also auctioned the flapper dress from Rebel Heart Tour, modelled by singer Ariana Grande during the show. Penn was present in the audience and bid on several items, and at one point handcuffed Madonna and crawled through her <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> generating a higher bid.|$|E

5|$|Many adult insects use six <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> {{walking and}} {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E
5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, {{on the end of}} the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other beetles have fossorial legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as flea beetles (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E

25|$|Lice have no wings or {{powerful}} <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> jumping, so {{they move}} using their claw-like legs to transfer from hair to hair.

Head-to-head contact {{is by far}} the most common route of lice transmission.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek {{custom of}} placing terra cotta miniatures of their {{furniture}} in children's graves {{gives us a}} good idea of its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets. The tables, high for normal meals and low for banquets, were initially rectangular in shape. By the 4th century BC, the usual table was round, often with animal-shaped <b>legs</b> (<b>for</b> example lion's paws). Loaves of flat bread could be used as plates, but terra cotta bowls were more common.|$|E
25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her <b>legs</b> <b>for</b> comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E
