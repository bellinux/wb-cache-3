40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine how classrooms are able to incorporate multiculturalism in a classroom through the use of multicultural literature. Every day, the United States’ population is increasingly become more diverse (Morrell 2 ̆ 6 Morrell, 2012) and teachers become more aware of and responsive towards this changing demographic in their classrooms. Incorporating different cultures into a curriculum helps create an atmosphere of mutual respect among students in the classroom along with allowing all students an opportunity to connect to the curriculum (Szecsi, Spillman, Vázquez-Montilla, 2 ̆ 6 Mayberry, 2010). One such {{way to do this is}} by exposing students to <b>literatures</b> <b>that</b> incorporate diverse cultures. This study analyzed two volumes of a 2 nd grade ELA textbook to discover what kinds of cultures students are currently being exposed to and what is missing, focusing on cultural content and traditions, language, and illustrations. This textbook reveals that, while students are being exposed to diverse cultures, these cultures they are exposed to are very limited and all given from a very “Americanized” perspective. Overall this study aims to identify the limitations of multicultural <b>literatures</b> <b>that</b> are currently being provided to teachers and allow for development of these <b>literatures</b> <b>that</b> need to be provided outside of a typical textbook...|$|R

Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century.

5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive.

Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist.

5|$|Armenian American {{literature}} {{constitutes a}} diverse body of <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> incorporates American writers of Armenian ancestry. Encompassing {{a cross section}} of literary genres and forms, Armenian American writers often incorporate some common themes (e.g., the Armenian Genocide) while maintaining very personal literary styles. The New York-based Ararat Quarterly, published since 1959, has been a major venue for Armenian American writing. Ararat is published in English by the AGBU and also includes works by Armenian writers around the world in translation. First-generation Armenian American writers include William Saroyan, Leon Surmelian, A. I. Bezzerides, Michael Arlen, Marjorie Housepian Dobkin and others. Second generation Armenian American writers include Peter Balakian, Nancy Kricorian, Carol Edgarian, Michael J.

5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E

It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale Vis and Rāmin and epic cycle of the Kayanian dynasty {{were part of the}} corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later.

5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent supposition in the prior <b>literature</b> <b>that</b> the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E

The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E

5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo.

Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna as something of a pilot project, a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E
