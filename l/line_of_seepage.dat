30|$|Overall, a {{long-term}} {{limitation of the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>seepage</b> water below 10  l/min during regular operation (storage level below 15  m) was accomplished through the injection measures.

Against this background and based on a re-evaluation of all data recorded since the plant’s commissioning the current status (October 2015) does not require any near-term injection measures. This recommendation also considers an increasing risk of deterioration (through injection pressures and changed hydraulic regimes) due to consecutive campaigns within {{a short period of}} time.

Test results with both suction and injection is presented and discussed to understand the extent <b>of</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>seepage</b> in the depth-wise direction. Particular attention was given on mean velocity, turbulence intensity, Reynolds shear stress, shear stress correlation, higher order moments and quadrant analysis. Two different Reynolds numbers (Re= 31000 and 47500) were used for each test condition. Reynolds numbers were chosen {{in order to keep}} flow condition as sub-critical (i. e.

The results from the analysis show that the effect <b>of</b> <b>seepage</b> on different turbulent characteristics is not restricted to the near-bed region but can be seen for most of the flow depth.

40|$|Interpreting {{observations}} <b>of</b> <b>seepage</b> into underground openings {{is often}} complicated by evaporative potentials {{created by the}} necessity to ventilate the openings. Evaporation removes liquid from the seepage face. By doing so, it reduces both the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>seepage</b> onset and the seepage flux, and thus can enhance the perceived effectiveness of the capillary barrier. We modeled liquid-release tests at the proposed high-level waste repository in Yucca Mountain, using an enhanced version of the EOS 9 module of iTOUGH 2, which incorporates evaporation as Fickian diffusion. The evaporation boundary layer thickness (BLT) over which diffusion occurs was estimated using free-water evaporation experiments conducted at Yucca Mountain under known relative humidity, temperature, and ventilation conditions. The BLT, which represents {{the thickness of the}} laminar flow regime, is inversely related to the ambient airflow velocity. At Yucca Mountain, the estimated values of BLT were 5 – 7 mm for open underground tunnels and 20 mm for closed niches. Compared to previous models that neglected the effect of evaporation, this new approach shows significant improvement in capturing seepage fluctuations into the open tunnels.
