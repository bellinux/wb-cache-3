40|$|M. A. Abstract: South Africa has a dual {{land tenure}} system {{inherited}} from colonial and apartheid land policies and practices. These past policies and practices ensured that whites had exclusive rights of ownership (i. e. freehold and leasehold) to the land, while Africans have insecure permit-based <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> in the former homelands regulated by customary based <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> systems. The <b>land</b> tenure reform programme embarked upon as part of land reform since 1994 has not yet addressed this land tenure duality, despite {{the provisions of the}} Constitution to provide “legally secure <b>land</b> tenure <b>rights</b> to those whose tenure of land is insecure and inferior as a result of past racially discriminatory laws and practices” (Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996). Thus the population residing in the communal areas of the former Transkei continues to occupy and use their land under the legally insecure <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> they were provided with under colonial and apartheid eras. This study seeks to design a framework for the formalisation of these <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> to ensure good governance in communal areas and to ensure that they are secure and equal to exclusive rights of ownership offered by the statutory land registration system in South Africa. The study begins with a historical background of the current <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> situation in communal areas, and further reviews various approaches to reform customary based land tenure models. Furthermore, the legislative and policy framework of the current government in relation to the reform of <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> in communal areas was also reviewed. This review revealed that legislative and policy initiatives to address the <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> of the residents of communal areas in the new democratic era have failed to provide legally secure <b>land</b> <b>rights.</b> The process of designing appropriate laws and policies to secure the <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> in communal areas has proven to be very complex. Part of this complexity was found to be due to unresolved questions relating to the form that <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> should take in communal areas, questions as to what level of social organisation these <b>land</b> <b>rights</b> [...] ...|$|R

The Fraser Government passed the Aboriginal <b>Land</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 1976 which established a statutory procedure that transferred almost 50 per cent of land in the Northern Territory (around 600 000 km2) to collective Indigenous ownership.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} three, Keaton began {{performing}} with his parents in The Three Keatons. He first appeared on stage in 1899 in Wilmington, Delaware. The act was mainly a comedy sketch. Myra played the saxophone to one side, while Joe and Buster performed on center stage. The young Keaton would goad his father by disobeying him, and the elder Keaton would respond by throwing him against the scenery, into the orchestra pit, or even into the audience. A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing. The act evolved as Keaton learned to take trick falls safely; he was rarely injured or bruised on stage. This knockabout style of comedy led to accusations of child abuse, and occasionally, arrest. However, Buster Keaton was always able to show the authorities {{that he had no}} bruises or broken bones. He was eventually billed as [...] "The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged," [...] with the overall act being advertised as [...] "'The Roughest Act That Was Ever in the History of the Stage." [...] Decades later, Keaton said that he was never hurt by his father and that the falls and physical comedy were a matter of proper technical execution. In 1914, Keaton told the Detroit News: [...] "The secret is in landing limp and breaking the fall with a foot or a hand. It's a knack. I started so young that <b>landing</b> <b>right</b> is second nature with me. Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat.
