50|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) is a rodent-borne viral {{infectious}} disease that presents as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Its causative agent is the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus (LCMV), {{a member of}} the family Arenaviridae. The name was coined by Charles Armstrong in 1934.|$|E

50|$|Timing is crucial, and coxsackieviruses, rotaviruses and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> {{virus that}} can be {{protective}} when given very early and can provoke autoimmunity when given late (for instance at weaning).|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} one of the biggest {{described}} endemic places of origin of house-mouse-borne <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> in the world, with IFA testing having found LCMV antibodies in 36% of the tested population.|$|E
50|$|Other {{possible}} viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus), bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (<b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus). The Powassan {{virus is}} a rare cause of encephalitis.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, Traub {{published}} a {{study for the}} Army Biological labs in Frederick, Maryland on Eastern Equine Encephalomyeltitis (EEE) immunity in white mice {{and its relationship to}} <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM), which had long been a research interest of his.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCMV) can be {{transmitted}} by mice, but is not a commonly reported infection in humans, though most infections are mild and are often never diagnosed. Some concern exists that women should not to be infected with LCMV during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Armstrong's {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} a virologist is due (a) to his discovery, in 1934, of the virus that is the agent in a clinical entity, which he named <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) and (b) to his successful work in polio research and polio prevention.|$|E
50|$|The first arenavirus, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus (LCMV), was {{isolated}} in 1933 by Charles Armstrong during {{a study of}} an epidemic in St. Louis. Although {{not the cause of}} the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of nonbacterial or aseptic meningitis.|$|E
5000|$|ADAR1 is an {{interferon}} ( [...] IFN [...] )-inducible protein (one {{released by}} a cell {{in response to}} a pathogen or virus), so it would make sense that it would assist with a cell’s immune pathway. This seems to be true for the HCV replicon, <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> LCMV, and polyomavirus ...|$|E
5000|$|Cases of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan, particularly during the 1900s. [...] However, infection may occur wherever an infected rodent host population exists. [...] LCMV occurs worldwide and its natural host, the rodent, has become established on all continents, except Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|Charles Armstrong (September 25, 1886 - June 23, 1967) was an American {{physician}} in the U.S. Public Health Service. He coined the name <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> in 1934 after isolating the hitherto completely unknown virus. He discovered in 1939 that poliovirus {{can be transmitted}} to cotton rats, and started self-tests with nasal spray vaccination.|$|E
50|$|Transplant-acquired <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> {{proves to}} have a very high {{morbidity}} and mortality rate. In the three clusters reported in the U.S. from 2005 to 2010, nine of the ten infected recipients died. One donor had been infected from a recently acquired pet hamster while the sources of the virus in the other cases were unknown.|$|E
5000|$|GSK-3 {{inhibition}} also mediates {{an increase}} in the transcription of the transcription factor Tbet (Tbx21) and an inhibition of the transcription of the inhibitory co-receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on T-cells [...] GSK-3 inhibitors increased in vivo CD8(+) OT-I CTL function and the clearance of viral infections by murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> clone 13 as well as anti-PD-1 in immunotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Pet rodents are {{not known}} to be natural {{reservoirs}} for <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus. However, pets can become vectors if {{they are exposed to}} wild house mice in a breeding facility, pet store, or home. Such infections are rare. To date, documented infections in humans have occurred only after introduction to infected mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters, with the majority of cases transmitted by mice. LCMV infection in other animals, including zoo animals, may be possible.|$|E
5000|$|The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine defines <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) as [...] "a viral {{infection}} of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and of the cerebrospinal fluid." [...] The name {{is based on the}} tendency of an individual to have abnormally high levels of lymphocytes during infection. Choriomeningitis is [...] "cerebral meningitis in which there is marked cellular infiltration of the meninges, often with a lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid plexuses." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the 1930s, {{he studied}} on a {{fellowship}} at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, New Jersey mentored by Richard Shope, performing research on vaccines and viruses, including pseudorabies virus and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus (LCM). [...] During his {{stay in the}} United States, Traub {{and his wife were}} listed as members of the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi German-American club thirty miles west of Plum Island in Yaphank, Long Island, from 1934 to 1935.|$|E
50|$|Arenaviruses can {{be divided}} into two serogroups, which differ genetically and by {{geographical}} distribution:When the virus is classified “Old World” this means it was found in the Eastern Hemisphere in places such as Europe, Asia, and Africa. When it is found in the Western Hemisphere, in places such as Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, and the United States, it is classified “New World”. <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) virus is the only Arenavirus to exist in both areas but is classified as an Old World virus.|$|E
50|$|IL-21 {{may be a}} {{critical}} factor in the control of persistent viral infections. IL-21 (or IL-21R) knock-out mice infected with chronic LCMV (<b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus) were not able to overcome chronic infection compared to normal mice. Besides, these mice with impaired IL-21 signaling had more dramatic exhaustion of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that IL-21 produced by CD4+ T cells is required for sustained CD8+ T cell effector activity and then, for maintaining immunity to resolve persistent viral infection. Thus, IL-21 may contribute to the mechanism by which CD4+ T helper cells orchestrate the immune system response to viral infections.|$|E
50|$|Arenaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, bisegmented RNA viruses with {{antisense}} genomes. Based {{on their}} antigenic properties, arenaviruses have been classified into two major groups: the Old World arena viruses, and the New World arenaviruses. Old World arena viruses include <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus, and Lassa virus. New world arena viruses are further {{broken down into}} three clades, A, B, and C. The Guanarito arena virus belongs to clade B and {{is the cause of}} VHF. On the biosafety level scale of one to four, with four causing the most risk, the viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers have been assigned a four by the CDC.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most enveloped viruses {{which use}} clathrin coated pits for {{cellular}} entry and bind to their receptors in a pH dependent fashion, Lassa and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus instead use an endocytotic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolin, dynamin and actin. Once within the cell the viruses are rapidly delivered to endosomes via vesicular trafficking albeit {{one that is}} largely independent of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7. On contact with the endosome pH-dependent membrane fusion occurs mediated by the envelope glycoprotein, which at the lower pH of the endosome binds the lysosome protein LAMP1 which results in membrane fusion and escape from the endosome.|$|E
50|$|Viruses are {{the most}} common cause of aseptic {{meningitis}}. Most cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses). However, other viruses can also cause viral meningitis. For instance, West Nile virus, mumps, measles, herpes simplex types I and II, varicella, and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) virus. Based on clinical symptoms, viral meningitis cannot be reliably differentiated from bacterial meningitis, although viral meningitis typically follows a more benign clinical course. Viral meningitis has no evidence of bacteria present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is often needed to identify the disease.|$|E
50|$|In 1934 Armstrong {{isolated}} {{a previously}} undescribed neurotropic virus found during the experimental transmission of encephalitis virus from the 1933 St. Louis epidemic {{from which it}} was differentiated and he demonstrated the virus in the central nervous system, spinal fluid, blood and urine of monkeys and {{in the brain and}} blood of mice during the experimental disease.In the majority of the monkeys there was more or less diffuse and irregular cellular infiltration of the meninges. In most animals there was a more or less pronounced swelling, edema and lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid plexus, i.e. the cellular membrane lining the intracerebral ventricles, which led him to name the disease <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|ADAR1 {{is known}} to be proviral in other circumstances. ADAR1’s A to I editing has been found in many viruses {{including}} measles virus, influenza virus, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus, polyomavirus, hepatitis delta virus, and hepatitis C virus. [...] Although ADAR1 has been seen in other viruses, it has only been studied extensively in a few; one of those is measles virus (MV). Research done on MV has shown that ADAR1 enhances viral replication. This is done through two different mechanisms: RNA editing and inhibition of dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). [...] Specifically, viruses are thought to use ADAR1 as a positive replication factor by selectively suppressing dsRNA-dependent and antiviral pathways.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> is a {{particular}} concern in obstetrics, as vertical transmission is known to occur. For immunocompetent mothers, {{there is no significant}} threat, but the virus has damaging effects upon the fetus. If infection occurs during the first trimester, LCMV results in an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Later congenital infection may lead to malformations such as intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Other findings include chorioretinal scars, and optic atrophy. Chorioretinitis, which is followed by chorioretinal scarring, is the most common ocular lesion. [...] Mortality among infants is approximately 30%. Among the survivors, two thirds have lasting neurologic abnormalities.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2005, four solid-organ {{transplant}} recipients contracted {{an illness}} {{that was later}} diagnosed as <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis.</b> All received organs from a common donor, and within a month of transplantation, {{three of the four}} recipients had {{died as a result of}} the viral infection. Epidemiologic investigation traced the source to a pet hamster that the organ donor had recently purchased from a Rhode Island pet store. Similar cases occurred in Massachusetts in 2008, and Australia in 2013. Currently, there is not a LCMV infection test that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for organ donor screening. The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report advises health-care providers to [...] "consider LCMV infection in patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis and in organ transplant recipients with unexplained fever, hepatitis, or multisystem organ failure." ...|$|E
50|$|An arenavirus is a virus {{which is}} a member of the family Arenaviridae. These viruses infect rodents and {{occasionally}} humans; arenaviruses have also been discovered which infect snakes. At least eight arenaviruses are known to cause human disease. The diseases derived from arenaviruses range in severity. Aseptic meningitis, a severe human disease that causes inflammation covering the brain and spinal cord, can arise from the <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus (LCMV) infection. Hemorrhagic fever syndromes are derived from infections such as Guanarito virus (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Lassa virus (LASV), Lujo virus (LUJV), Machupo virus (MACV), Sabia virus (SABV), or Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV). Arenaviruses are divided into two groups: the Old World and the New World viruses. The differences between these groups are distinguished geographically and genetically. Because of the epidemiological association with rodents, some arenaviruses and bunyaviruses are designated as roboviruses.|$|E
50|$|For {{infants with}} {{suspected}} congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RT-PCR of the infants serum and urine {{should be performed}} {{in the first two}} days of life. Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Other recommended tests are cranial ultrasound, hearing evaluation, and eye examination. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Some tests should be repeated up to 6 months later as there can be delayed effects, particularly with hearing.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 {{scientists}} at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich showed that LAG3 was an exhaustion marker for CD8+ T cells specific for <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus, but alone {{did not significantly}} contribute to T-cell exhaustion. Scientists the University Hospital Brno showed that LAG3 is a prognostic indicator of poor treatment outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A team at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute showed that CD8+ Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that were specific for NY-ESO-1 were negatively regulated by LAG-3 and PD-1 in ovarian cancer. The St. Jude Children's Research Hospital group reported that most LAG3 was housed intracellularly in multiple domains before rapid translocation to the cell surface potentially facilitated by the microtubule organizing center and recycling endosomes during T-cell activation. Scientists at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan, collaborating with the Triebel group, showed that LAG3 defines a potent regulatory T cell subset that shows up more frequently in cancer patients and is expanded at tumor sites. Geneticists working at the National Cancer Institute reported that SNPs in the LAG3 gene were associated with higher risk of multiple myeloma.|$|E
50|$|The Lassa virus gains {{entry into}} the host cell {{by means of the}} cell-surface {{receptor}} the alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG),a versatile receptor for proteins of the extracellular matrix. It shares this receptor with the prototypic Old World arenavirus <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus. Receptor recognition depends on a specific sugar modification of alpha-dystroglycan by a group of glycosyltransferases known as the LARGE proteins. Specific variants of the genes encoding these proteins appear to be under positive selection in West Africa where Lassa is endemic. Alpha-dystroglycan is also used as a receptor by viruses of the New World clade C arenaviruses (Oliveros and Latino viruses). In contrast, the New World arenaviruses of clades A and B, which include the important viruses Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia in addition to the non pathogenic Amapari virus, use the transferrin receptor 1. A small aliphatic amino acid at the GP1 glycoprotein amino acid position 260 is required for high-affinity binding to alpha-DG. In addition, GP1 amino acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all arenaviruses showing high-affinity alpha-DG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or phenylalanine) at this position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> {{is not a}} {{commonly}} reported infection in humans, though most infections are mild and are often never diagnosed. Serological surveys suggest that approximately 1-5% {{of the population in}} the U.S. and Europe has antibodies to LCMV. The prevalence varies with the living conditions and exposure to mice, and it has been higher in the past due to lower standards of living. The island of Vir in Croatia {{is one of the biggest}} described endemic places of origin of LCMV in the world, with IFA testing having found LCMV antibodies in 36% of the population. Individuals with the highest risk of infection are laboratory personnel who handle rodents or infected cells. Temperature and time of year is also a critical factor that contributes to the number of LCMV infections, particularly during fall and winter when mice tend to move indoors. Approximately 10-20% of the cases in immunocompetent individuals are thought to progress to neurological disease, mainly as aseptic meningitis. The overall case fatality rate is less than 1% and people with complications, including meningitis, almost always recover completely. Rare cases of meningoencephalitis have also been reported. More severe disease is likely to occur in people who are immunosuppressed.|$|E
40|$|Two {{epizootics}} of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> {{virus in}} mice occurred {{within two months}} in one research facility consisting of several widely separated rooms. These outbreaks developed despite intensive institutional monitoring policies designed to prevent introduction and spread of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus. Evidence derived from serological and virological assays and interviews with the concerned investigators suggested that a single transplantable tumor carried in mice may {{have been responsible for}} spread of the virus. However, the tumor was not contaminated with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus {{at the time of its}} introduction into the mouse facility. The origin of the virus responsible for the outbreaks was not definitively established although data supported an hypothesis that the virus was introduced into the research facility by a wild or feral mouse. Virus spread from infected mice to humans did not occur, as measured by serological tests. However, a large and valuable animal facility was depopulated for safety reasons.

40|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> {{virus is}} a rodent-borne arenavirus {{that can cause}} {{congenital}} infection affecting the developing cen-tral nervous system. When the infection occurs during pregnancy, the virus targets the fetal brain and retina, potentially causing ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It has been previously suggested that <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus {{be added to the}} list of congenital infections currently included in the TORCH acronym (tox-oplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and syphilis). We present 2 neonates with antenatally known ventriculomegaly that were diagnosed with congenital <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus infection after birth. In addition to ventriculomegaly, one had nonimmune hydrops fetalis and the other had intracranial hemorrhage. In view of the seroprevalence of lymphocytic choriome-ningitis virus (4. 7 %- 10 %), our findings suggest that screening for congenital <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus infection should be considered in fetuses and newborns with ventriculomegaly as well as other abnormal neuroimaging findings such as intracranial hemorrhage...|$|E
