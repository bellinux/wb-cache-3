Characteristically, the house was very ornately decorated {{with a variety of}} architectural details; castellated roof <b>lines,</b> <b>scrolled</b> pinnacles, narrow pointed windows and drip moulds, and various cornices, besides carved motifs and decorated chimneys. Some of the ornate pinnacles have been removed in the interest of safety, and there had been at a recent extension to the lower ground floor across a sunken passage across the house with a roof flush with ground level.|$|R

Key Words: Ruled Surfaces, elementary transformation. Introduction: Through this paper, a geometrically ruled surface, or simply a ruled surface, will be a P 1 -bundle over a smooth curve X of genus g. It will be denoted by π: S = P(E 0) −→X and we will follow the notation and terminology of R. Hartshorne’s book [3], V, Section 2.

The goal with this new device is to be able to be worn at all times, and studies have shown that these cueing glasses continue to remain effective with time. The only concern with this device is that they are high in cost and not every Parkinson's patient would be able to afford them.|$|R
50|$|Further {{enhancement}} {{of this concept}} uses the LMS modifier option on every <b>line</b> that does <b>scroll.</b> Vertical scrolling on this display requires updating one LMS modifier address for each Mode <b>line</b> in the <b>scrolling</b> region. When the display is managed at this level of detail ANTIC's 4K screen RAM boundary can be easily circumvented. Even in this worst case example the CPU effort expended is {{a tiny fraction of}} the processing needed to bulk move screen data.|$|R
25|$|Roll-up or {{scroll-up}} or paint-on or scrolling: Real-time words sent in paint-on or scrolling mode {{appear from}} left to right, up to one line at a time; when a line is filled in roll-up mode, the whole <b>line</b> <b>scrolls</b> up {{to make way for}} a new line, and the line on top is erased. The lines usually appear at the bottom of the screen, but can actually be placed on any of the 14 screen rows to avoid covering graphics or action. This method is used when captioning video in real-time such as for live events, where a sequential word-by-word captioning process is needed or a pre-made intermediary file isn't available. This method is signaled on EIA-608 by a two-byte caption command or in Teletext by replacing rows for a roll-up effect and duplicating rows for a paint-on effect. This allows for real-time caption line editing.|$|R
50|$|ISPF remembers each user's {{choices for}} such things as screen colors & layout, the {{location}} of the command <b>line</b> and <b>scrolling</b> preferences. It also remembers the last-used data set names on each panel, so the next time the panel is used the names are already filled in. This is very convenient for mainframe programmers because they frequently work with the same files repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Vertical fine {{scrolling}} {{moves the}} scrolling region {{the number of}} scan lines in a single Mode <b>line</b> of the <b>scrolling</b> region, up {{to a maximum of}} 16 scan lines. See VSCROL.|$|R
50|$|Fine {{scrolling}} requires setup {{to define}} the scrolling region. This is done by setting the Vertical Scroll (VS) modifier bit in sequential Display List instructions. The first Mode line instruction without the VS bit set becomes {{the end of the}} scrolling region and is used as a buffer line to supply the new scan <b>lines</b> to <b>scroll</b> up {{into the bottom of the}} scrolling region.|$|R
50|$|ANTIC's {{process of}} {{vertical}} fine scrolling works by simply directing ANTIC to skip {{a number of}} scan lines for the first mode <b>line</b> of the <b>scrolling</b> region. Subsequent Mode <b>lines</b> in the <b>scrolling</b> region are not affected. The last line of the region supplies the bottom border of the scrolling region displaying the number of scan lines that {{were removed from the}} first line. This number of scan lines is controlled with the VSCROL register. The value ranges from 0 to the ANTIC Mode line's scan line height - 1. The maximum value range covers fine <b>scrolling</b> 16 scan <b>lines</b> from 0 to 15.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of Firrell's works include {{some form of}} ancillary visual motif. Most common are vertical <b>lines,</b> either <b>scrolling</b> from left to right, or presented as static fields in 'agitated motion'. Vertical lines are used to back, or underscore text, or to reveal and obscure text. Customarily the lines have been presented as white light. This vertical line motif appeared in every work between 2006 and 2010 {{with the exception of}} I Want To Live in a City Where... (The National Gallery, London 2006).|$|R
50|$|Daniel Meyer of SWTPC enlisted Ed Colle, an {{engineer}} {{who had worked}} at Datapoint on terminal design, to design the new TV Typewriter. The SWTPC CT-1024 Terminal displayed 32 characters by 16 <b>lines</b> without <b>scrolling.</b> It used common TTL parts and 2102 static RAMs. The boards were laid out with very loose part spacing and wide traces {{to make it easy}} to assemble. A complete set of option boards were offered including a serial interface. The keyboard was based on Don Lancaster’s design. The rest of the terminal was done by Ed Colle.|$|R
50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} scan line ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} Mode <b>lines</b> the <b>scrolling</b> region then {{consists of three}} Mode lines—the third <b>line</b> in the <b>scrolling</b> region is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed scan lines. When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at scan line 2 showing scan lines 2 to 7 (six scan lines or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight scan lines), and the final Mode line ends at scan line 2 showing scan lines 0 to 2 (three scan lines or VSCROL + 1). The total scan lines displayed in the scrolling region is then 6 + 8 + 3 = 17 scan lines.|$|R
50|$|Teletype Corporation's Model 28 line of {{communications}} terminals was first {{delivered to the}} US Military in 1951 and commercially introduced in 1953.

Teletype machines were gradually replaced in new installations by dot-matrix printers and CRT-based terminals {{in the mid to}} late 1970s.

Early video terminals, such as the Tektronix 4010, did not become available until 1970 and cost around $10,000. However the introduction of integrated circuits and semiconductor memory later that decade allowed the price of cathode-ray-tube-based terminals to fall below {{the price of a}} Teletype.

Each item was separated by a <b>line</b> of <b>scrolling</b> letters moving right across the screen, leaving behind the name of the upcoming strand such as Business, Coming up, Sport, before the scrolling letters move across the screen again removing the small word. The strand name would be placed in the top right corner of the screen with the information centred in the screen. Gill Sans was retained as the font on the channel.|$|R
50|$|Since fine {{scrolling}} {{is based}} on scan lines not pixel height, and scrolling region movement is done simply by skipping scan lines from the first Mode line and adding scan lines to the last Mode line, {{it is possible to}} use different graphics Modes within the scrolling region.

40|$|Scroll profile plays a {{key role}} in {{determining}} the performance of a scroll compressor. In this study geometric and dynamic characteristics of the scroll profile are analyzed to investigate the influence of its geometric continuity on property of a scroll compressor. Firstly, scroll profiles are created to redesign the geometry of scroll wrap by using the equidistant-curve approach on the basis of a generation line consisting of involute of circle and circular arc. Subsequently, the geometric and dynamic models of the scroll compressor are established. These models are related to parameters of the generation <b>line</b> of <b>scroll</b> profile and rotation angle of a moving scroll. Lastly, some simulation examples of second-order continuity (SOC) scroll profile are compared with first-order continuity (FOC) scroll profiles and some important conclusions are obtained. Results show that SOC scroll profile is superior to FOC profile in terms of volume ratio, stability of gas force, and possible leakage loss in a scroll compressor...|$|R
5000|$|... is little-used. IBM {{documentation}} {{described it}} as [...] "inactive", and the key's purpose was a mystery even to keyboard manufacturers. In modern software, typing text usually causes previous text to scroll {{off the top of}} the screen or window. Some old programs could disable this and restart at the top of the window when scroll lock was pressed. The advantage is that the entire screenful of text does not shift, making it easier to read. Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its <b>line</b> and <b>scroll</b> the work area under it. In spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, it locks the cell pointer on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the view window without moving the cell pointer. On some consoles (such as the Linux console), it prevents scrolling of messages until another key combination is pressed. Many hardware KVM switches use Scroll Lock to switch between the devices they control.|$|R

50|$|The {{second half}} of this {{strategy}} requires the last byte/character of every <b>line</b> in the <b>scrolling</b> region to be updated to show the desired, new information. For a typical scrolling display this would mean updating the last byte {{of one or two}} dozen lines which takes a trivial amount of time in assembly. So, if this scrolling process involves a full screen Mode 2 or Mode 4 text display (rather worst case) and uses the entire 4K capability of ANTIC's automatic screen memory addressing, then the horizontal scrolling can continue in this manner for about 3,000 steps; equivalent to 75 full screens.|$|R
