40|$|Multilevel {{security}} is typically implemented by assigning finegrained security contexts, such as sensitivity labels to all subjects and objects. These extended security contexts require modifications to standard filesystems, and interfaces that affect system throughput and application compatibility. This trade-off between policy enforcement and performance tends to marginalize these systems to special-purpose environments. This paper describes a light-weight approach which avoids {{the requirement for}} customized filesystems or modified applications. Instead, the system is partitioned into <b>labeled</b> <b>zones.</b> Subjects and objects are associated with these zones from which they inherit their sensitivity labels. This structured approach to data separation {{makes it possible to}} implement mandatory access control on a mainstream operating system...|$|R

30|$|Post-labelling delay (PLD) should to be optimal for pCASL. This {{parameter}} {{should be}} adjusted {{on a case-by-case}} basis and correspond as closely as possible to the time needed for labelled protons to reach the region of interest. If the PLD is too short, all of the labelled bolus may not have time to fully integrate the parenchyma to be explored, particularly junctional areas. This can lead to a significant local signal loss, which could be misdiagnosed as false hypoperfusion regions. Patient-related factors can also lead to systemised false hypoperfusion areas, resulting for example from stenosis of the supra-aortic trunks, which produces a longer transit time between the <b>labelling</b> <b>zone</b> and the region of interest.

40|$|International audienceCell cycle {{dynamics}} and localization of condensins [...] multiprotein complexes involved in late stages of mitotic chromosome condensation [...] were studied in Xenopus laevis XL 2 cell line. Western blot analysis of synchronized cells {{showed that the}} ratio of levels of both pEg 7 and XCAP-E to beta-tubulin levels remains almost constant from G 1 to M phase. pEg 7 and XCAP-E were localized to the mitotic chromosomes and were detected in interphase nuclei. Immunostaining for condensins and nucleolar proteins UBF, fibrillarin and B 23 revealed that both XCAP-E and pEg 7 are localized in the granular component of the nucleolus. Nucleolar labeling of both proteins is preserved in segregated nucleoli after 6 hours of incubation with actinomycin D (5 mg/ml), but {{the size of the}} <b>labeled</b> <b>zone</b> was significantly smaller. The data suggest a novel interphase function of condensin subunits in spatial organization of the nucleolus and/or ribosome biogenesis...|$|R
5000|$|J.D. Clark's work {{incorporated}} {{both questions}} of the cultures who lived at the Kalambo Falls site {{as well as what}} their environment was like during times of occupation. [...] Using plant (floral) and pollen analyses, Clark was able to conduct the process of paleoenvironmental reconstruction. By studying pollen that settled on the earth during different environmental settings, Clark was able to form a general idea of what ecological factors affected the Kalambo Falls region at different times. In order to do this, Clark used a tool for drawing out sediment cores in order to observe and analyse the different layers {{below the surface of the}} earth today. He separated these layers into 6 different spectra, <b>labeled</b> <b>zones</b> U through Z. The law of superposition is important to note when discussing sedimentary layers; this law states that more recent layers of soil dispersal will overlie older ones.|$|R
