50|$|Chromomeres display {{different}} {{properties and}} behaviours when associated with lampbrush chromosomes. Although found {{all across the}} <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome,</b> they are not organized in a clear pattern along {{as they are in}} normal pachytene chromosomes of meiosis. The two sister chromatids of a <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome</b> separate fully, forming lateral loops that extend from chromomeres, and act as transcription complexes. The lateral loops are areas where the chromosomes are transcriptionally active. The loops define where the chromomere will be positioned. The chromomere is an organization of regions of non-transcribed chromatin. These regions of chromatin that have not been transcribed are located at the ends of the loops that were formed by the sister chromatids of a <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Each chromomere can have up to several pairs of loops from lampbrush chromosomes originating from it, as well as micro-loops that cannot be detected with a light microscope.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lampbrush</b> <b>{{chromosome}}s</b> are {{a special}} form of chromosome {{found in the}} growing oocytes (immature eggs) of most animals, except mammals. They were first described by Walther Flemming in 1882. <b>Lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of tailed and tailless amphibians, birds and insects are described best of all. Chromosomes transform into the lampbrush form during the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase I due to an active transcription of many genes. They are highly extended meiotic half-bivalents, each consisting of 2 sister chromatids. <b>Lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are clearly visible even in the light microscope, where they are seen to be organized {{into a series of}} chromomeres with large chromatin loops extended laterally. Amphibian and avian <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> can be microsurgically isolated from oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle) with either forceps or needles.|$|R

40|$|<b>Lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (LBCs) {{represent}} {{a new model}} in avian cytogenetics and are increasingly more often used in poultry <b>chromosome</b> analyses. Additionally, <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are considered as model structures {{in the study of}} transcription regulation. Changes in transcription activity are reflected as modifications of LBC morphological structure and associated with physiological processes in the organism. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare transcriptional activity of the first five lampbrush macrochromosomes and ZW sex lampbrush bivalents sampled from the oocytes of geese prior to and after the reproductive period. The respective bivalents sampled before and after reproduction have similar sizes but differ in morphological structure. Side loops of <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are sites of transcription activity. The activity varies according to the loop size. As the loops become more prominent, the activity grows and vice versa. <b>Lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> sampled after reproduction have smaller side loops. On the other hand, inactive chromomeres become prominent in the chromosomes. Marker loops are the last structures to be degraded after the end of reproduction. Consequently, they are used for identifying particular bivalents at different stages of cellular transcriptional activity...|$|R
50|$|Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is {{a protein}} that binds to {{methylated}} DNA. MeCP2 {{has been found}} to associate most strongly with transcriptionally inactive chromomere domains. MeCP2 binding patterns to chromomere domains are proportional to the density of chromomeric DNA found on a chromosome. The binding of MeCP2 to chromomeric regions represents regions of chromatin that are highly dynamic on the <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{migration}} primordial {{germ cells}} will become oogonia in the forming gonad (ovary). The oogonia proliferate extensively by mitotic divisions, up to 5-7 million cells in humans. But then {{many of these}} oogonia die and about 50,000 remain. These cells differentiate into primary oocytes. In week 11-12 post coitus the first meiotic division begins (before birth for most mammals) and remains arrested in prophase I from {{a few days to}} many years depending on the species. It is in this period or in some cases at the beginning of sexual maturity that the primary oocytes secrete proteins to form a coat called zona pellucida and they also produce cortical granules containing enzymes and proteins needed for fertilization. Meiosis stands by because of the follicular granulosa cells that send inhibitory signals through gap junctions and the zona pellucida. Sexual maturation is the beginning of periodic ovulation. Ovulation is the regular release of one oocyte from the ovary into the reproductive tract and is preceded by follicular growth. A few follicle cells are stimulated to grow but only one oocyte is ovulated. A primordial follicle consists of an epithelial layer of follicular granulosa cells enclosing an oocyte. The pituitary gland secrete follicle-stimulating hormones (FSHs) that stimulate follicular growth and oocyte maturation. The thecal cells around each follicle secrete estrogen. This hormone stimulates the production of FSH receptors on the follicular granulosa cells and has {{at the same time a}} negative feedback on FSH secretion. This results in a competition between the follicles and only the follicle with the most FSH receptors survives and is ovulated. Meiotic division I goes on in the ovulated oocyte stimulated by luteinizing hormones (LHs) produced by the pituitary gland. FSH and LH block the gap junctions between follicle cells and the oocyte therefore inhibiting communication between them. Most follicular granulosa cells stay around the oocyte and so form the cumulus layer. Large non-mammalian oocytes accumulate egg yolk, glycogen, lipids, ribosomes, and the mRNA needed for protein synthesis during early embryonic growth. These intensive RNA biosynthese are mirrored in the structure of the chromosomes, which decondense and form lateral loops giving them a lampbrush appearance (see <b>Lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome).</b> Oocyte maturation is the following phase of oocyte development. It occurs at sexual maturity when hormones stimulate the oocyte to complete meiotic division I. The meiotic division I produces 2 cells differing in size: a small polar body and a large secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte undergoes meiotic division II and that results in the formation of a second small polar body and a large mature egg, both being haploid cells. The polar bodies degenerate. Oocyte maturation stands by at metaphase II in most vertebrates. During ovulation, the arrested secondary oocyte leaves the ovary and matures rapidly into an egg ready for fertilization. Fertilization will cause the egg to complete meiosis II. In human females there is proliferation of the oogonia in the fetus, meiosis starts then before birth and stands by at meiotic division I up to 50 years, ovulation begins at puberty.|$|E

Whereas cytogenetic maps of macrochromosome GGA 1 - 10 and microchromosome GGA 11 - 16 lampbrush bivalents have been established, identification and description of smaller microchromosome bivalents are still missing. In this work, we used specific FISH probes for the identification of 12 chicken <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> formed by GGA 17 - 28.

40|$|Amphibian {{and bird}} karyotypes {{typically}} have a complex organization, {{which makes them}} difficult for standard cytogenetic analysis. That is, amphibian chromosomes are generally large, enriched with repetitive elements, and characterized {{by the absence of}} informative banding patterns. The majority of avian karyotypes comprise a small number of relatively large macrochromosomes and numerous tiny morphologically undistinguishable microchromosomes. A good progress in investigation of amphibian and avian chromosome evolution became possible with the usage of giant <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> typical for growing oocytes. Due to the giant size, peculiarities of organization and enrichment with cytological markers, <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> can serve as an opportune model for comprehensive high-resolution cytogenetic and cytological investigations.

40|$|Chiasmata in {{diplotene}} bivalents {{are located}} at the points of physical exchange (crossing-over) between homologous chromosomes. We have studied chiasma dis-tribution within chicken <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome</b> 1 to estimate the crossing-over frequency between chromosome landmarks. The position of the centromere and chromosome region 1 q 3. 3 â 1 q 3. 6 on <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome</b> 1 were determined by comparative physical mapping of the TTAGGG repeats in the chicken mitotic and lampbrush chromosomes. The comparison of the chiasma (crossing over) -based genetic distances on chicken chromosome 1 with the genetic linkage map obtained in genetic experiments showed that current genetic distances estimated by the high-resolution genetic mapping of the East Lansing, Compton, and Wageningen chicken reference populations are 1. 2 â 1. 9 times longer than those based on chi-asma counts. Conceivable reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.

40|$|Background: Hybridogenesis (hemiclonal inheritance) {{is a kind}} of clonal {{reproduction}} {{in which}} hybrids between parental species are reproduced by crossing with one of the parental species. European water frogs (Pelophylax esculentus complex) represent an appropriate model for studying interspecies hybridization, processes of hemiclonal inheritance and polyploidization. P. esculentus complex consists of two parental species, P. ridibundus (the lake frog) and P. lessonae (the pool frog), and their hybridogenetic hybrid - P. esculentus (the edible frog). Parental and hybrid frogs can reproduce syntopically and form hemiclonal population systems. For studying mechanisms underlying the maintenance of water frog population systems it is required to characterize the karyotypes transmitted in gametes of parental and different hybrid animals of both sexes. Results: In order to obtain an instrument for characterization of oocyte karyotypes in hybrid female frogs, we constructed cytological maps of <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from oocytes of both parental species originating in Eastern Ukraine.

40|$|Abstract The lampbrush {{chromosomes}} {{present in}} the nuclei of amphibian oocytes offer unique biological approaches for study of the mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure with high spatial resolution. We discuss fundamental aspects of the remarkable organi-zation and plasticity exhibited by lampbrush chromo-somes. We then utilize lampbrush chromosomes to characterize the chromosomal distribution and dynamics of cohesin, the four-protein complex (RAD 21 /MCD 1 / SCC 1, SMC 1, SMC 3, SCC 3 /SA 2) responsible for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that endogenous SMC 3 and newly expressed hRAD 21 co-localize on chromo-somal axes, sites where sister chromatids are tightly paired. We present evidence suggesting that hRAD 21 recruitment to lampbrush chromosomes is modulated by chromosomal SMC 1 and SMC 3. Notably, using a tech-nique for de novo chromosome assembly, we demon-strate that both SMC 3 and hRAD 21 are recruited to single, unreplicated lampbrush chromatids. Finally, we used our novel method of analyzing the oocyte nucleus under oil combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, to provide direct evidence that cohesin is highly dynamic at discrete, condensed chromosomal regions. Collectively, these data demonstrate that lamp-brush chromosomes provide a unique and powerful tool for combining biochemical and cytological analyses for dissection of complex chromosomal processes.

40|$|The five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) {{involved}} in splicing {{occur on the}} loops of amphibian lampbrush chromosomes and in hundreds to thousands of extrachromosomal granules called B snurposomes. To assess the role of these snRNAs during transcription and to explore possible relationships between the loops and B snurposomes, we injected single-stranded antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) against U 1 and U 2 snRNA into toad and newt oocytes. As shown before, antisense U 1 and U 2 oligos caused truncation of U 1 and complete destruction of U 2 snRNAs, respectively. However, injection of any oligo, regardless of sequence, brought on dramatic cytological changes, including shortening of the chromosomes and retraction of the lateral loops, with concomitant shutdown of polymerase II transcription, as well as disappearance of {{some or all of}} the B snurposomes. When injected oocytes were incubated for 12 h or longer in physiological saline, these changes were reversible; that is, the chromosomes lengthened, transcription (detected by 3 H-UTP incorporation) resumed on newly extended lateral loops, and B snurposomes reappeared. In situ hybridization showed that loops and B snurposomes had negligible amounts of U 2 snRNA after recovery from injection of the anti-U 2 oligo, whereas these structures had normal levels of U 2 snRNA after recovery from a control oligo. Thus, the morphological integrity of B snurposomes and <b>lampbrush</b> <b>chromosome</b> loops is not dependent on the presence of U 2 snRNA.
