25|$|Cristescu started {{questioning}} his Party's policies {{after the}} decision {{taken by the}} Balkan Communist Federation during its 1923 Vienna Conference. The Federation had adopted the official Soviet policy recommending that Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transylvania and Southern Dobruja (or all of Dobruja) be given the right to secede from Romania. Due to the ethnic composition of these regions, he could not accept that minorities be given self-determination (especially since this implied not autonomy or independence, but rather satisfaction of territorial demands that other nations had on Romania). Cristescu allegedly called for the party to revise its program in respect to these points, and thus resume <b>legal</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ritchie's actions {{did not go}} unnoticed, and he was {{nominated}} to be Attorney General of Maryland in 1915, a position he served in from December 20, 1915 to December 20, 1919.

In the general election, Ritchie defeated his Republican rival, Albert Doub, by 25,000 votes. As Attorney General, Ritchie economized the state government by having the state law department assume the <b>legal</b> <b>activities</b> of nearly every department, {{with the exception of}} the Public Service Commission, thus eliminating the need for other departments to hire outside legal counsel.|$|E

25|$|Adam {{was rewarded}} {{for his part}} in Richard II's surrender, {{imprisonment}} and fall by being granted the living of Kemsing and Seal, and later made a prebend in the church of Bangor. These nicely supplemented his professional legal income and status. However one living, his title to the prebend of Llandygwydd in Cardiganshire given under the college of Abergwili, was contested by one Walter Jakes, alias Ampney, who had obtained it by exchange in 1399. The two were in an affray, in Westminster, in November 1400, which resulted in charges being brought against Adam and his company for highway robbery. The outcome is unknown, however it did not immediately limit his <b>legal</b> <b>activities,</b> as he continued as a lawyer.|$|E

25|$|When the {{existence}} of the skin gambling situation was discovered in mid-2016, estimates for the economics of skin gambling market had dropped, but by early 2017, these analysts found the market did not drop as much as they expected, and with gambling sites still open and growing, they do not expect to see this diminish in the near future unless the legal matters are resolved. Analysis firm Naruscope estimated in early 2017 that even with increased awareness of the legal ramifications of skin gambling, there could be as much as $12.9 billion gambled this way by 2020, compared to their previous estimate of $20 billion made in mid-2016. Grove places much of the future of skin gambling on Valve and its control over the Steam API that enables the third-party websites; Valve had stated that changing the API to cut off these websites would also affect other <b>legal</b> <b>activities</b> that could be performed with it, making it difficult to enforce without more direct oversight and monitoring by Valve. It is unclear if the two lawsuits against Valve will come to a full trial, and thus attention is being placed on the Washington State Gambling Commission's pending actions to resolve the situation.|$|E
