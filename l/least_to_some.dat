5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent}} with quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

25|$|According to a European Commission working paper, {{empirical}} {{studies show that}} the UK stamp duty influences the share prices negatively. More frequently traded shares are stronger affected than low-turnover shares. Therefore, the tax revenue capitalizes at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent in lower current share prices. For firms which rely on equity as marginal source of finance this may increase capital costs since the issue price of new shares would be lower than without the tax.|$|E

25|$|This {{section is}} not meant to collect the texts of all liturgical {{versions}} of the Nicene Creed, and provides only three, the Greek, the Latin, and the Armenian, of special interest. Others are mentioned separately, but without the texts. All ancient liturgical versions, even the Greek, differ at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> small extent from the text adopted by the First Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople. The Creed was originally written in Greek, owing to the location of the two councils.|$|E
25|$|Yet under Yusuf Dey, various {{interest}} groups emerged which maneuvered to outflank his ruling strategies. Many such were Tunisian, e.g., the local military, the urban notables including the disbanded diwan, and most rural tribes; also included at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent was the distant sultan in Constantinople. During the 1620s and 1630s the local Turkish Bey managed to enlist these social forces, thus augmenting his authority {{and coming to}} rival the Dey, then overtaking him. That the political reign of the Dey and his janissaries had slowly evaporated was clearly demonstrated when {{in an attempt to}} regain power their uprising of 1673 failed.|$|E
25|$|Grüber reopened his Bureau, {{now serving}} survivors, {{returning}} from the concentration camps. F.K. Otto Dibelius, who had assumed the post-war leadership of the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province within the old-Prussian Church for the time being, appointed Grüber {{as one of the}} Nazi opposing pastors for the new leading bodies to be established. With his contacts from Dachau to communists he could– at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent– soften many of the ever-increasing anti-clerical measurements of the communist regime to be established in the East, until the communist rulers of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) finally dropped him in May 1958.|$|E

25|$|Slavery as an {{institution}} in Brazil was unrivaled {{in all of the}} Americas. The sheer number of African slaves brought to Brazil and moved around South America greatly influenced the entirety of the Americas. Indigenous groups, Portuguese colonists, and African slaves all contributed to the melting pot that has created Brazil. The mixture of African religions that survived throughout slavery and Catholicism, Candomblé, has created some of the most interesting and diverse cultural aspects. In Bahia, statues of African gods called Orishas pay homage to the unique African presence in the nation’s largest Afro-Brazilian state. Not only are these Orishas direct links to their past ancestry, but also reminders to the cultures the Brazilian people come from. Condomblé and the Orishas serve as an ever-present reminder that African slaves were brought to Brazil. Though their lives were different in Brazil, their culture has been preserved at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{based on}} Nahum Tate's play Brutus of Alba, or The Enchanted Lovers (1678), the opera is likely, at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent, to be allegorical. The prologue {{refers to the}} joy of a {{marriage}} between two monarchs, which could refer to the marriage between William and Mary. In a poem of about 1686, Tate alluded to James II as Aeneas, who is misled by the evil machinations of the Sorceress and her witches (representing Roman Catholicism, a common metaphor at the time) into abandoning Dido, who symbolises the British people. The same symbolism may apply to the opera. This explains {{the addition of the}} characters of the Sorceress and the witches, which do not appear in the original Aeneid. It would be noble, or at least acceptable, for Aeneas to follow the decree of the Gods, but not so acceptable for him to be tricked by ill-meaning spirits.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of the Amidah most likely comes from the mishnaic period, {{both before and after}} the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) as the probable time of its composition and compilation. In the time of the Mishnah, it was considered unnecessary to prescribe its text and content. This may have been simply because the language was well known to the Mishnah's authors. The Mishnah may also not have recorded a specific text because of an aversion to making prayer a matter of rigor and fixed formula, an aversion that continued at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent throughout the Talmudic period, as evidenced by the opinions of R. Eliezer (Talmud Ber. 29b) and R. Simeon ben Yohai (Ab. ii. 13). R. Jose held that one should include something new in one's prayer every day (Talmud Yerushalmi Ber. 8b), a principle said to have been carried into practice by R. Eleazar and R. Abbahu (ib.). Prayer was not to be read as one would read a letter (ib.).|$|E
25|$|Moses's {{critics charge}} that he {{preferred}} automobiles over people. They {{point out that he}} displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the South Bronx and the amusement parks of Coney Island, caused the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to disinvestment and neglect. His building of expressways hindered the proposed expansion of the New York City Subway from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 Program for Action, which was never completed, was hoped to counter this. Other {{critics charge that}} he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built, and close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in white neighborhoods by making the water too cold.|$|E
25|$|Much as {{counties}} were subdivided as {{the population}} grew to maintain a government of a size and location both convenient and of citizens with common interests (at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree), as Virginia grew, the portions that remained after the subdivision of Kentucky in 1776 became more populated. For the western areas, problems were {{the distance from the}} state seat of government in Richmond and the difference of common economic interests resultant from the tobacco and food crops farming, fishing, and coastal shipping on the Eastern Continental Divide (waters that drain to the Atlantic Ocean) along the Allegheny Mountains, and the interests of the western portion, which drained to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. The western area focused its commerce on neighbors to the west, and many citizens felt that the more populous eastern areas were too dominant in the State Legislature and insensitive to their needs. Major crises in the Virginia state government were averted during the period before the American Civil War, but the underlying problems were fundamental and never well-resolved.|$|E

500|$|Owen {{wrote of}} the {{convictions}} underlying his efforts on the war guilt issue: [...] The Germans did not will the war. [...] It was forced on them by the Russian Imperialists... The German, Russian, French, Belgian and allied peoples became alike the sorrowful victims... The happiness and future peace of the world require the reconciliation of the German and French people. [...] This said, some have seen Owen's preoccupation with the war guilt question as, at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree, symptomatic of a growing detachment on his part from current U.S. political issues following the Democrats' loss of the 1920 elections. [...] On the domestic front, the Harding administration's [...] "return to normalcy" [...] offered little scope for further advances on Owen's Progressive agenda; in international affairs, the post-1920 turn of US policy towards isolationism and protectionism also ran counter to his long-held principles.|$|E

Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say, but I appreciate the fact at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree that something like this was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|For settlers, MacGregor {{deliberately}} targeted {{his fellow}} Scots, assuming {{that as a}} Scotsman himself {{they would be more}} likely to trust him. Their emigration served to reassure potential investors in the Poyaisian bonds and land certificates firstly that the country was real, and secondly that it was being developed and would provide monetary returns. In Sinclair's assessment, this aspect of the scheme [...] "turn what would have been an inspired hoax into a cruel and deadly one". Tamar Frankel posits in her analysis that, at <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree, MacGregor [...] "probably believed his own story" [...] and genuinely hoped to forge these people into a Poyaisian society. MacGregor told his would-be colonists that he wished to see Poyais populated with Scots as they possessed the necessary hardiness and character to develop the new country. Alluding to the rivalry with England and the Darien episode—which, he stressed, had involved a direct ancestor of his—MacGregor suggested that in Poyais they might right this historic wrong and salvage Scottish pride. Skilled tradesmen and artisans were promised free passage to Poyais, supplies, and lucrative government contracts. Hundreds, mostly Scots, signed up to emigrate—enough to fill seven ships. They included a City of London banker named Mauger (who was to head the Bank of Poyais), doctors, civil servants, young men whose families had bought them commissions in the Poyaisian Army and Navy, and an Edinburgh cobbler who accepted the post of Official Shoemaker to the Princess of Poyais.|$|E
