40|$|A whole {{variety of}} {{different}} techniques for simulating global illu-mination in virtual environments have been developed over recent years. Each technique, including Radiosity, Monte-Carlo ray- or photon tracing, and directional-dependent Radiance computations, is best suited for simulating only some special case environments. None of these techniques is currently able to efficiently simulate all important lighting effects in non-trivial scenes. In this paper, we describe a new approach for efficiently com-bining different global illumination algorithms to yield a composite lighting simulation: Lighting Networks. Lighting Networks can ex-ploit the advantages of each algorithm and can combine them {{in such a way}} as to simulate lighting effects that could only be com-puted at great costs by any single algorithm. Furthermore, this ap-proach allows a user to configure the <b>Lighting</b> <b>Network</b> to compute only specific lighting effects that are important for a given task, while avoiding a costly simulation of the full global illumination in a scene. We show how the light paths computed by a <b>Lighting</b> <b>Network</b> can be described using regular expressions. This mapping allows us to analyze the composite lighting simulation and ensure complete-ness and redundant-free computations. Several examples demon-strate the advantages and unique lighting effects that can be ob-tained using this technique. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{conservation}} concerns will mandate near-future environments {{to regulate}} themselves to accommodate occupants' objectives and best tend to their comfort while minimizing energy consumption. Accordingly, smart energy management {{will be a}} needed and motivating application area of evolving Cyber-Physical Systems, as user state, behavior and context are measured, inferred, and leveraged {{across a variety of}} domains, environments, sensors, and actuators to dynamically mitigate energy usage while attaining implicit and explicit user goals. In this work, the focus in on the efficient control of a LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>network.</b> This thesis presents a first-of-its-kind pentachromatic LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>network</b> that is capable of adjusting its spectral output in response to ambient conditions and the user's preferences. The control of the intensity is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem and the mathematics governing sensed illuminance, color, and corresponding control (feedback and adjustment) are formally defined. The prototype adjustable light source is capable of maintaining an average color rendering index greater than 92 (nearly the quality of daylight) across a broad adjustable range (2800 K - 10, 000 K) and offers two modes of control, one of which is an energy efficient mode that reduces the total power consumption by 20 %. The <b>lighting</b> <b>network</b> is capable of measuring the illuminance and color temperature at a surface and adjusting its output with an overall update rate of 11 Hz (limited by the MATLAB kernel). The sensor node features an optical suite of sensors with a dynamic range of 10000 : 1 lx (rms error: 2 lx). The sensor node measures the color temperature of daylight within ± 500 K (kelvin). Device testing and validation were performed in a series of experiments in which the radiant power was collected using a radiometrically calibrated spectrometer with an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 14 % and validated against a model derived by measuring the individual spectra of the system using custom MATLAB tools. A digital multimeter measured the current in the experiments. The work concludes by estimating the energy savings based on the measured optical and electrical data. In environments with moderate ambient lighting, the networked control reduces power consumption by 44 % with an additional 5 - 10 % possible with spectral optimization. by Matthew Aldrich. Thesis (S.

40|$|Public {{lighting}} {{represents a}} large part of the energy consumption of towns and cities. Efficient management of public lighting can entail significant energy savings. This work presents a smart system for managing public lighting networks based on wireless communication and the DALI protocol. Wireless communication entails significant economic savings, as there is no need to install new wiring and visual impacts and damage to the facades of historical buildings in city centers are avoided. The DALI protocol uses bidirectional communication with the ballast, which allows its status to be controlled and monitored at all times. The novelty of this work is that it tackles all aspects related to the management of public lighting: a standard protocol, DALI, was selected to control the ballast, a wireless node based on the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard with a DALI interface was designed, a network layer that considers the topology of the <b>lighting</b> <b>network</b> has been developed, and lastly, some user-friendly applications for the control and maintenance of the system by the technical crews of the different towns and cities have been developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{introduction of}} connected lighting {{that can be}} integrated with sensors and other devices is opening up new possibilities in creating responsive and intelligent environments. The role of lighting in such systems goes beyond simply functional illumination. In {{part due to the}} large and established <b>lighting</b> <b>network,</b> and {{with the advent of the}} LED, new types of lighting output are now possible. However, the current approach for controlling such systems is to simply replace the light switch with a somewhat more sophisticated smartphone-based remote control. The focus of this workshop is to explore new ways of interacting with light where lighting can not only be switched on or off, but is an intelligent system embedded in the environment capable of creating a variety of effects. The connectivity between multiple systems and other ecosystems, for example when transitioning from your home, to your car and to your office, will also be explored during this workshop as a part of a connected lifestyle between different contexts.

Due to the possibility of appearance of significant fluctuations in the real network traffic, we proposed a procedure of statistical models update which is based on the criterion of interquartile spacing.
