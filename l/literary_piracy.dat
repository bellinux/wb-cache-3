40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} an {{examination}} of the Roman definition of banditry and piracy in the law codes. The close association between war and banditry, despite the formal importance of the iustum bellum, is revealed by the descriptions and terminology of the surviving <b>literary</b> authorities. <b>Piracy</b> {{is often referred to as}} being 'maritime banditry', since it was regarded as differing little from banditry, except that it occurred on the ocean. The position of bandits and pirates in the criminal 'ranks' was the lowest, and thus to the Roman sources, latro was a strong term of abuse associated with great dishonour. The unpredictable tactics of bandits and pirates also prompted the attitude that they were akin to a force of nature, such as a storm, and were thus an unpreventable occurrence. The second chapter discusses Hobsbawm's theories of social banditry and their applicability to the bandits and pirates of the Roman period. An examination reveals that 'social bandits' were not an ancient phenomenon, and that there was no perception of them as such, and suggests that local populations did not regard them as 'Robin Hoods'. Local support for bandits and pirates seems to have been limited mainly to a smaller group composed of their 'partners in crime', who harboured them and received stolen goods. Those who became bandits and pirates, for example deserters and shepherds, are often cited as being driven to banditry for reasons of poverty, and their motivation was to support themselves. An analysis in chapter threee of the activities of the Bagaudae in the late empire reveals them to be bandits rather than rebellious peasants. The attitude of abhorrence towards these criminals is seen in the harsh punishment of their acts and the popular reaction to their deaths, as detailed in chapter four. The fact that a man was considered a bandit was seen as a justification for his death. Retribution through capital punishment could be carried out instantly, or in a number of ways after interrogation and torture, such as beheading or crucifixion. Infamous bandits' deaths played a further role as entertainment for the crowds. The placing of such prisoners in triumphal processions also testifies to the attraction for seeing these prisoners in a humiliated position. Finally, a combination of the factors mentioned above and the value of personal gloria and triumphs in the Roman ethos strongly influenced the response to policing banditry and piracy, as seen in an analysis of a number of Roman laws, battles in the provinces and wars against bandits and pirates. The evidence from the empire suggests that attitudes had not changed though methods of policing had improved...|$|R

50|$|The International Copyright Act of 1891 {{was created}} {{because many people}} shunned the idea of <b>literary</b> <b>piracy.</b> It was the first U.S. congressional act that offered {{copyright}} protection in the United States to citizens of countries other than the United States. The act extended limited protection to foreign copyright holders from select nations. It was also important for American creators since {{they were more likely}} to have international copyright protection in countries that were offered the same protection by the United States. The Act empowered the President to extend copyright to works of foreign nationals.|$|E

5000|$|Plagiarism is {{traditionally}} defined as “the process of copying another person's idea or written work and claiming it as original” [...] This definition applies to {{many aspects of}} written work in today’s world and has serious consequences if found guilty of committing it, but this idea {{has not always been}} in place. During the 18th century, it was extremely common for British Literature to be reprinted across the Atlantic Ocean in America without any acknowledgement or payment given to the original author. This form of plagiarism, referred to as <b>literary</b> <b>piracy,</b> was not an easy action to control because of the immense distance between the two countries, and the lack of any real international law which would work to protect the original authors in England. It was not until 1988 that these international laws were truly set in place and able to be enforced with any form of consistency.|$|E

In 1816 Bent began The Hobart Town Gazette and Southern Reporter, he changed {{the title of his}} paper to Hobart Town Gazette and Van Diemen's Land Advertiser on 1 January 1821. Governor George Arthur claimed the government ownership of the Hobart Town Gazette, but Bent sent evidence against this to Governor Thomas Brisbane in Sydney, who decided in Bent's favour.

He was continually distressed by the plight of out-of-work actors and by the [...] "laissez-faire practices of the American stage." [...] Fiske determined to turn the Dramatic Mirror {{into a sort of}} artistic and professional conscience for the American theater, writing editorials on not only the aesthetic merits of theatrical productions, but also the improvement of working conditions and the regulation of health hazards in theaters. Though he disapproved of industry efforts to organize an actors' union, Fiske did help to secure the passage of the Cummings Act of 1896 and subsequent laws to protect playwrights against <b>literary</b> <b>piracy.</b> He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Actors' Fund of America. With the help of his wife, the celebrated actress Minnie Maddern, as well as the likes of David Belasco, Sarah Bernhardt and the Shubert family staged a coup on the Theatrical Syndicate, helping to break the stranglehold they had maintained on theater bookings from coast to coast. In 1901 Fiske leased the Manhattan Theatre on Thirty-Third Street as a showcase for his wife and as a venue for other artists. The theater became home to the [...] "Manhattan Company" [...] whose players included the well-known actors Tyrone Power Sr., George Arliss and John B. Mason.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} role of unauthorized publication in the posthumous construction of British Romanticism as a literary movement. It argues that Romantic ideology emerged from conflicting claims {{about the nature of}} intellectual property and the circulation of political and artistic ideas, apparent in the texts and paratexts of pirated books. I examine how these disputes play out in reprints of the works by Percy Bysshe Shelley and Robert Southey that became cornerstones of radical culture. The dissertation goes on to discuss how the underground economy of <b>literary</b> <b>piracy</b> affected Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron 2 ̆ 7 s publication strategies, the significance of foreign reprints to copyright ideology and canon formation, and the relationship between unauthorized publication and the culture of appropriation apparent in radical periodicals and graphic satire. This study thus contributes to the history of the book and print culture {{in the early nineteenth century}} while illuminating the economic and legal underpinnings of the body of literature that came to be known as Romantic. It situates British Romanticism as an important moment in the ongoing discourse around intellectual property, emphasizing the contingent and ideologically fraught nature of any such concept...|$|E
