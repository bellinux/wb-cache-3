40|$|The {{effect of}} {{multiple}} doses of <b>lomefloxacin</b> (400 mg twice a day) on the clearance of theophylline and the urinary excretion of its metabolites {{was investigated in}} 15 healthy male subjects. Concentrations of theophylline in plasma were measured by TDx (Abbott Diagnostics, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Urinary excretion of theophylline and its three major metabolites and <b>lomefloxacin</b> in plasma were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Total theophylline clearance remained unchanged before <b>lomefloxacin</b> treatment and after <b>lomefloxacin</b> single- and multiple-dose treatments (58. 02, 56. 57, 54. 07 ml/min, respectively).

40|$|Backround: <b>Lomefloxacin</b> is {{a potent}} {{bactericidal}} antibiotic. The use of this drug in treatment of various infections is accompanied by serious adverse effects on pigmented tissues. The exact mechanisms of <b>lomefloxacin</b> side effects have not been well established yet. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the interaction between <b>lomefloxacin</b> and melanin, and to examine how this interaction affects the cell viability and melanization in melanocytes. Methods: Normal human epidermal melanocytes and the model DOPA-melanin were used. The binding parameters of lomefloxacin-melanin complexes as well as the antibiotic effect on cell viability and melanization in pigmented cells were investi-gated using a spectrophotometric method. Results: Our results indicate that <b>lomefloxacin</b> forms stable complexes with melanin. The analysis of drug binding to melanin has shown that at least two classes of independent binding sites are involved in formation of these complexes. The WST- 1 assay was used to detect the antibiotic cytotoxic effect. The value of ED 50 for <b>lomefloxacin</b> was about 0. 75 mmol/l. It has been shown that <b>lomefloxacin</b> causes inhibition of tyrosinase activity, and reduces melanin content in human skin melanocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: The ability of the analyzed fluoroquinolone to form complexes with melanin, and the demonstrated inhibitory effect on a melanization process in melanocytes in vitro may explain a potential role of melanin biopolymer in the mechanisms of undesirable side effects of <b>lomefloxacin</b> in vivo resulting from its accumulation in pigmented tissues.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} or not {{concomitant}} omeprazole treatment influences the pharmacokinetics of <b>lomefloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, a randomized, double-blind four-way-crossover study was performed. Another objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of <b>lomefloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin. Twelve healthy volunteers participated. On days 1 to 4 of each study period, each of them took 20 mg of omeprazole or a placebo orally, and on day 4, each took 400 mg of <b>lomefloxacin</b> or 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally. Blood and urine samples were collected and assayed for the quinolones by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The mean peak concentrations in plasma (Cmax) and the areas under the curves (AUC), respectively, of <b>lomefloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, respectively, after prior treatment with placebo were 2. 88 +/- 0. 73 (mean +/- standard deviation) as against 2. 60 +/- 0. 76 micrograms/ml and 24. 9 +/- 3. 13 as against 11. 9 +/- 1. 89 micrograms. h/ml, and 72. 4 % +/- 5. 10 % as against 36. 1 % +/- 7. 50 % of the doses of <b>lomefloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, respectively, were recovered from the urine.

40|$|The single-dose {{pharmacokinetics}} of orally administered <b>lomefloxacin</b> (400 mg) {{were studied}} in normal subjects and {{in patients with}} various degrees of renal function. The subjects were classified by creatinine clearance (CLCR) normalized for body surface area: group 1, CLCR of greater than 80 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2; group 2, CLCR of 80 to greater than 40 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2; group 3, CLCR of 40 to greater than 10 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2; and group 4, CLCR of {{less than or equal}} to 10 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Each group consisted of eight subjects. The pharmacokinetics of <b>lomefloxacin</b> were significantly influenced by renal function. There were significant differences in the elimination rate constant, half-life, area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity, apparent total drug clearance, renal clearance, and apparent nonrenal drug clearance between the four renal function groups. Mean half-lives for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 8. 09, 9. 11, 20. 90, and 44. 25 h, respectively. There were no significant differences between the renal groups for maximum concentration of the drug in serum and apparent volume of distribution.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{development}} of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Maxaquin and other antibacterial drugs, Maxaquin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected {{to be caused by}} bacteria. DESCRIPTION Maxaquin (<b>lomefloxacin</b> HCl) is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent for oral administration. <b>Lomefloxacin</b> HCl, a difluoroquinolone, is the monohydrochloride salt of (±) - 1 -ethyl- 6, 8 -difluoro- 1, 4 -dihydro- 7 - (3 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) - 4 -oxo- 3 -quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C 17 H 19 F 2 N 3 O 3 ·HCl, and its structural formula is: <b>Lomefloxacin</b> HCl is a white to pale yellow powder with a molecular weight of 387. 8. It is slightly soluble in water and practically insoluble in alcohol. <b>Lomefloxacin</b> HCl is stable to heat and moisture but is sensitive to light in dilute aqueous solution. Maxaquin is available as a film-coated tablet formulation containing 400 mg of <b>lomefloxacin</b> base, present as the hydrochloride salt. The base content of the hydrochloride salt is 90. 6 %. The inactive ingredients are carboxymethylcellulose calcium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, lactose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyl 40 stearate, and titanium dioxide. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers: In 6 fasting healthy male volunteers, approximately 95 % to 98 % of a single oral dose of <b>lomefloxacin</b> was absorbed.

40|$|AbstractBackground:Bacterial endophthalmitis is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of ocular surgery and penetrating trauma. The primary causative organisms are strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fluoroquinolones are widely used to treat endophthalmitis. There are a few studies on the penetration of fluoroquinolones into the lens in inflamed eyes. A literature search did not identify any data regarding penetration of topical ofloxacin into the lens in normal and inflamed eyes. Objective:The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the penetration of topical ofloxacin and <b>lomefloxacin</b> into the lens in a rabbit endophthalmitis model. Methods:New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 2 groups. The left eyes were infected with an intravitreal inoculation of S aureus. The right eyes were used as a noninoculated control. Groups 1 and 2 received topical ofloxacin and <b>lomefloxacin</b> treatment, respectively, 24 hours after the inoculation. Two drops of the study drugs were instilled in the eyes every 30 minutes for 3 hours and then every 60 minutes for 3 hours. Lens samples were obtained 30 minutes after the last ofloxacin or <b>lomefloxacin</b> drops were administered. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the fluoroquinolone concentration. Results:Ten rabbits were equally divided into the 2 treatment groups. There was no significant difference in mean (SD) lens concentrations between the control and inoculated eyes in either treatment group—ofloxacin (0. 26 [0. 32] μg/mL vs 0. 11 [0. 05] μg/mL, respectively) and <b>lomefloxacin</b> (0. 50 [0. 87] μg/mL vs 0. 12 [0. 08] μg/mL, respectively). Conclusion:The results of this small experimental study found that topical ofloxacin and <b>lomefloxacin</b> can accumulate in the crystalline lens after installation. Inflammation did not affect the penetration of ofloxacin or <b>lomefloxacin</b> into the lens...|$|E
40|$|Therapy with ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and <b>lomefloxacin</b> (alone or in {{combination}} with clindamycin) and therapy with sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, and temafloxacin alone were given to mice with subcutaneous abscesses. The abscesses were caused by two Bacteroides fragilis isolates, {{one of which was}} susceptible and one of which was resistant to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and <b>lomefloxacin,</b> alone or {{in combination}} with Escherichia coli. The abscesses were examined 5 days after inoculation. Numbers of B. fragilis organisms reached log 10 10. 2 to 11. 8 per abscess, and numbers of E. coli organisms reached log 10 10. 6 to 11. 8 per abscess. All of the quinolones reduced the number of susceptible B. fragilis isolates (log 10 3. 6 to 6. 9) and E. coli isolates (log 10 5. 7 to 6. 8). However, ciprofloxacin and <b>lomefloxacin</b> failed {{to reduce the number of}} resistant B. fragilis organisms in single-organism or mixed infections. The addition of clindamycin to either ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or <b>lomefloxacin</b> reduced the numbers of both susceptible and resistant B. fragilis organisms (log 10 3. 8 to 7. 8). In contrast, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, and temafloxacin were effective as single therapy in eradicating B. fragilis resistant to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and <b>lomefloxacin.</b> These in vivo data confirm the in vitro activity of these quinolones and suggest that although ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and <b>lomefloxacin</b> are occasionally effective as single agents in eradicating mixed infection by susceptible strains of B. fragilis and E. coli, addition of an agent with activity against anaerobic organisms will ensure their efficacy. Quinolones with good efficacy against B. fragilis may be effective as single-agent therapy of mixed infections...|$|E

In the presence of 9 mM Mg 2 +, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10 (- 10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. <b>Lomefloxacin</b> had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones...|$|E
40|$|Microbiological {{efficacy}} of <b>lomefloxacin</b> {{and other drugs}} regarding microorganisms isolated from the human conjunctiva Purpose: To evaluate and compare the in vitro susceptibility of human conjunctival bacterial isolates to various antimicrobial agents, including <b>lomefloxacin,</b> other fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, and amicacin), and cephalosporin (cephalothin). Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility tests conducted {{over a period of}} 27 months with 613 bacterial isolates from the conjunctiva were retrospectively analyzed. Results: In relation to the total number of positive isolates, the fluoroquinolones showed greater in vitro effectiveness than the other analyzed antibiotics. All bacterial isolates showed significantly higher susceptibility to cipro-floxacin than to <b>lomefloxacin.</b> Conclusion: The fluoroquinolones are not only equally effective against all conjunctival bacterial isolates, but they also show superior antimicrobial activity in comparison to amino-glycosides and cephalothin.

40|$|Photosensitivity is an {{uncommon}} but characteristic {{side effect of}} quinolones, with a variable incidence for the different drugs. Several cases, considered either phototoxic or photoallergic, have been described with <b>lomefloxacin</b> use. During the last 4 years we studied 8 patients (mean age 69. 4 years) with eczematous or acute sunburn-like lesions in photo-exposed areas, after taking <b>lomefloxacin</b> {{for a period of}} one week to several months. After drug withdrawal and systemic and/or topical corticosteroids, lesions cleared within one week to two months, with dischromia in one patient. Six to eight weeks thereafter, a photobiological study was performed. Minimal erythema dose (MED) for UVA and UVB were normal and photopatch tests with <b>lomefloxacin,</b> ofloxacin, ciproflaxacin and norfloxacin, tested at 1 %, 5 % and 10 % in petrolatum and irradiated with 5 and 10 J/cm 2 UVA were negative in 7 patients and 20 controls.

40|$|Plan: An {{analytical}} method for {{the estimation of}} <b>Lomefloxacin</b> in bulk drug and pharmaceutical dosage forms by HPTLC is described. Prologue: The method is simple, fast and accurate {{and can be used}} for routine analysis of commercial <b>Lomefloxacin</b> tablets. Methodology: The developed method used precoated silica gel 60 F 254 as stationary phase. The mobile phase used was a mixture of 2 -Propanol: water: ammonia (86 : 8 : 6 %v/v/v). The RF value was 0. 14. The detection of spots was carried out at 288 nm. The calibration curve was found to be linear between 10 and 70 ng/spot with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9969. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 5 ng/spot and 10 ng/spot respectively. Outcome: The proposed method has been applied successfully for the determination of <b>Lomefloxacin</b> in pharmaceutical dosage forms. No significant interference was observed from excipients, coloring and flavoring agents commonly used in the formulation. The mean recovery of drug from tablets was in the range of 100. 8 % to 102. 7 %. Key Words: HPTLC, <b>Lomefloxacin,</b> Mobile phase, Stationary phase. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of supercoiling activity of reconstituted Escherichia coli DNA gyrase by <b>lomefloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin was determined. The concentrations of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were also measured. The kinetics of uptake of [14 C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled <b>lomefloxacin</b> into whole cells of E. coli KL- 16 and S. aureus NCTC 8532 and the induction of RecA in E. coli GC 2241 were assayed.
