Organic matter, CaCO 3, pH, Slope, texture, drainage, depth, EC and altitude were recognized as factors affecting land suitability for wheat production in the study area. Comparing results of the three parametric methods used showed that the proposed equation gave higher suitability index values than classical methods. Great correlation has been found between results of the three methods. Organic matter, topology and pH were found to be the limiting factors for wheat production in the study area.

This potential is a genetical one which is not under influence of water, soil and management limitations. If soil limitations are exerted in the radiation thermal production potential, land production potential is resulted.
