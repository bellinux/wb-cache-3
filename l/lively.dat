Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let <b>Lively</b> take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill <b>Lively</b> following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored.
