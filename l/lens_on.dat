5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Patterning {{vast numbers}} of micro <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a surface {{increases}} technical importance to improve characteristics of optical parts such as liquid crystal displays. A cutting method using a diamond tool is examined to make a molding die by which array patterns of many micro lenses are molded. Realizing the cutting procedure, the developed machining system employs a cutting unit actuated by PZT and a synchronous control system of the cutting unit with a NC controller. The present paper investigates machining of micro <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> the order of 2 kHz, using a piezo-actuated micro cutting unit. Experiments using this unit revealed {{that it is possible}} to machine a large number of micro <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a molding roll die for plastic film with high precision...|$|R
25|$|Moreover, {{the larger}} the format size, the longer a lens {{will need to be}} to capture the same framing as a smaller format. In motion pictures, for example, a frame with a 12 degree {{horizontal}} field of view will require a 50mm <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> 16mm film, a 100mm <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> 35mm film, and a 250mm <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> 65mm film. Conversely, using the same focal length lens with each of these formats will yield a progressively wider image as the film format gets larger: a 50mm lens has a horizontal field of view of 12degrees on 16mm film, 23.6degrees on 35mm film, and 55.6degrees on 65mm film. Therefore, because the larger formats require longer lenses than the smaller ones, they will accordingly have a smaller depth of field. Compensations in exposure, framing, or subject distance need to be made in order to make one format look like it was filmed in another format.|$|E

More light energy is received on the retina than can be tolerated, but less than is required for irreversible injury.

40|$|PURPOSE. To report {{differences}} {{in the incidence of}} adverse events and discontinuations found in a group of neophyte contact wearers using two different silicone hydrogel contact <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily- and continuous-wear basis during an 18 -month period. METHODS. Sixty-one subjects were initially examined, and 53 were eligible to participate in the study. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear one of two silicone hydrogel materials: lotrafilcon A or balafilcon A <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily- or continuous-wear basis. After an initial screening, subjects were monitored weekly for the first month and then after 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. The incidence of adverse events, including corneal infiltrative events, superior epithelial arcuate lesions, and contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis, and discontinuations {{in each of the four}} contact lens groups were recorded. RESULTS. Twenty-two adverse events were found. A higher incidence of adverse events was found in subjects wearing lotrafilcon A lenses than in those wearing balafilcon A lenses (χ = 4. 40, P= 0. 04). There were fewer adverse events in subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily-wear basis than in those wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a continuous-wear basis (χ = 5. 98, P= 0. 01). Eight subjects discontinued from the study as a result of recurrent corneal infiltrative events (one), vision problems (two), excessive ocular discomfort (one), relocation (one), noncompliance with the study protocol (one), and being lost to follow-up (two). No significant differences were found in the number of discontinuations between the two lens types (χ = 0. 66, P= 0. 42) and wearing regimens (χ = 0. 08, P= 0. 78). CONCLUSIONS. Lotrafilcon A lenses were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than balafilcon A lenses were, and this difference is attributed to the difference in the incidence of corneal infiltrative events. Subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily-wear basis had fewer adverse events than did subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a continuous-wear basis. Both lens types and wearing regimens showed a similar incidence of discontinuations. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an optoelectronic device {{such as a}} light-emitting diode, a laser diode, or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it {{in contact with the}} device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a laser diode or a silicon optical chip. In this case a tapered or lensed fiber is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> the end of the fiber can be formed using polishing, laser cutting or fusion splicing.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{typically}} {{inserted into the}} eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may {{be placed on the}} sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.|$|E
25|$|Before {{using the}} laser, the {{ophthalmologist}} dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye.

The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient will see flashes of light.

40|$|Purpose. To report {{differences}} {{in the incidence of}} conjunctival epithelial flaps (CEFs) found in a group of neophyte contact wearers using two different silicone hydrogel contact <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily- and continuous-wear basis during an 18 -month period. Methods. Sixty-one subjects were initially examined, and 53 were eligible to participate in the study. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear one of two silicone hydrogel materials, lotrafilcon A or balafilcon A, on a daily- or continuous-wear basis. After an initial screening, subjects were monitored weekly for the first month and then after 3, 6, 12, and IS months. The incidence of CEFs {{in each of the four}} contact lens groups was recorded. Results. Five of the 53 subjects enrolled in the study showed bilateral CEFs. A higher incidence of CEFs was found in subjects wearing lotrafilcon A lenses (n = 4) compared to balafilcon A lenses (it = 1) (chi(2) = 4. 37, P= 0. 04). Differences in the incidence of CEFs between subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily-wear basis (n = 1) versus a continuous-wear basis (it = 4) showed a weak statistical significance (chi(2) = 3. 03, P= 0. 08). Conclusions. Lotrafilcon A lenses were associated with a higher incidence of CEFs than balafilcon A lenses were, and this difference may be attributed to {{differences in}} the edge design, material, or modulus of rigidity between the two lens types. Subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a daily-wear basis showed fewer adverse events than did subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a continuous-wear basis. The longer wearing times of subjects wearing <b>lenses</b> <b>on</b> a continuous-wear basis are likely to exacerbate the incidence of CEFs...|$|R

25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> the reading light.|$|E
25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} <b>lens</b> <b>on</b> {{the far side of}} the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E
