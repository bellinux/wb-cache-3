40|$|Abstract We {{presented}} free-flying <b>locusts</b> (Locusta mi-gratoria L.) with {{sounds that}} varied in temporal struc-ture and carrier frequency as they flew toward a light source in a flight room under controlled temperature and light conditions. Previous {{studies have shown}} teth-ered <b>locusts</b> react more often to trains of 30 -kHz pulses than to pulse trains below 10 kHz. Further, this acoustic startle response has been suggested to function in bat-avoidance. We expected free-flying <b>locusts</b> to respond similarly; however, we found <b>locusts</b> responded to all sounds we presented, not just high-frequency, ‘‘bat-like’’ sounds. Response rates of turns, loops, and dives varied from 6 % to 26 % but were statistically independent of carrier frequency and/or pulse structure. Free-flying moths and tethered <b>locusts</b> were tested using a subset of our acoustic stimuli under the same temperature and light conditions as the free-flying <b>locusts.</b> Moth responses were carrier frequency dependent as were responses of tethered <b>locusts</b> positioned along the flight path observed in our free-flight trials. All responses were unaffected by a 90 % reduction in room light. We conclude that <b>locusts</b> possess an acoustic startle response evocable in free flight, however, free-flying <b>locusts</b> do not show the same discrimination observed in tethered <b>locusts</b> under similar conditions...|$|R

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the <b>locust</b> exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to <b>locust</b> control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts.

40|$|In desert <b>locusts,</b> {{increased}} population densities drive phenotypic {{transformation from}} the solitarious to the gregarious phase within a generation [1 - 4]. Here {{we show that}} when presented with odor-food associations, the two extreme phases differ in aversive but not appetitive associative learning, with solitarious <b>locusts</b> showing a conditioned aversion more quickly than gregarious <b>locusts.</b> The acquisition of new learned aversions was blocked entirely in acutely crowded solitarious (transiens) <b>locusts,</b> whereas appetitive learning and prior learned associations were unaffected. These differences in aversive learning support phase-specific feeding strategies. Associative training with hyoscyamine, a plant alkaloid found in the locusts' habitat [5, 6], elicits a phase-dependent odor preference: solitarious <b>locusts</b> avoid an odor associated with hyoscyamine, whereas gregarious <b>locusts</b> do not. Remarkably, when solitarious <b>locusts</b> are crowded and then reconditioned with the odor-hyoscyamine pairing as transiens, the specific blockade of aversive acquisition enables them to override their prior aversive memory with an appetitive one. Under fierce food competition, as occurs during crowding in the field, this provides a neuroecological mechanism enabling <b>locusts</b> to reassign an appetitive value to an odor that they learned previously to avoid.

40|$|Desert <b>locusts</b> (Schistocerca gregaria) can {{transform}} reversibly between the swarming gregarious phase and a solitarious phase, which avoids other <b>locusts.</b> This transformation entails {{dramatic changes in}} morphology, physiology, and behavior. We have used the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic target, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), which are visual interneurons that detect looming objects, to analyze how differences in the visual ecology of the two phases are served by altered neuronal function. Solitarious <b>locusts</b> had larger eyes and {{a greater degree of}} binocular overlap than those of gregarious <b>locusts.</b> The receptive field to looming stimuli had a large central region of nearly equal response spanning 120 ° × 60 ° in both phases. The DCMDs of gregarious <b>locusts</b> responded more strongly than solitarious <b>locusts</b> and had a small caudolateral focus of even further sensitivity. More peripherally, the response was reduced in both phases, particularly ventrally, with gregarious <b>locusts</b> showing greater proportional decrease. Gregarious <b>locusts</b> showed less habituation to repeated looming stimuli along the eye equator than did solitarious <b>locusts.</b> By contrast, {{in other parts of the}} receptive field the degree of habituation was similar in both phases. The receptive field organization to looming stimuli contrasts strongly with the receptive field organization of the same neurons to nonlooming local-motion stimuli, which show much more pronounced regional variation. The DCMDs of both gregarious and solitarious <b>locusts</b> are able to detect approaching objects from across a wide expanse of visual space, but phase-specific changes in the spatiotemporal receptive field are linked to lifestyle changes...|$|R
50|$|Red <b>locusts</b> are {{sedentary}} when ample shelter, perches {{and food}} is available. In dry years, when {{the amount of}} suitable habitat is reduced population densities increase. If the population density increases past a threshold, the <b>locusts</b> will transform into their gregarious phase, changing their behaviour and anatomy. When gregarious, red <b>locusts</b> keep together in large swarms and fly with the wind in daylight hours, looking for more food. The higher temperatures during daylight enable gregarious <b>locusts</b> to travel longer distances by flying longer and higher, aided by thermal lift. A swarm will rarely move more than 20-30 km in a day.In contrast, solitary <b>locusts</b> prefer to fly {{in the dark and}} do so alone.|$|R

30|$|<b>Locusts</b> also varied {{their escape}} {{behavior}} throughout the 24 -h period. During the night, tree-roosting <b>locusts</b> {{were slow to}} escape, and could be approached and caught by hand. However, escape behavior changed during the day. Between 08 : 00 and 16 : 00, ground inhabiting <b>locusts</b> quickly flew away when human observers approached to within 5  m. Such <b>locusts</b> typically flew ~ 30  m. The majority of <b>locusts</b> (99.0  %, n =  132) flushed in this manner landed on the ground, but their subsequent behavior varied with ground temperature and time of day. At 08 : 00 (100  %, n =  51) and 16 : 00 (100  %, n =  30), all flushed <b>locusts</b> remained stationary for more than 3  min after landing on the ground. In contrast, at 14 : 00 all (100  %, n =  51) flushed <b>locusts</b> quickly moved from the ground by hopping or walking to nearby plants or shade, and then became stationary after reaching this microhabitat (Fig.  1 c). At 18 : 00, three flushed males remained unmoving {{on the ground for}} more than 20  min. This suggests that <b>locusts</b> vary their defence behavior and microhabitat preference depending on ground temperature. During mid-day, when soil temperatures are high, they immediately move away from the ground. In early morning and late afternoon, when ground temperatures are cooler, they remain motionless. The solitarious adult <b>locusts</b> in our study were well camouflaged when on the ground, but less so when on vegetation (Fig.  1 a–d).|$|R

40|$|Aim.

5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult <b>locust,</b> 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for <b>locust</b> protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert <b>locust</b> provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol.

500|$|Study of {{literature}} shows how pervasive plagues of <b>locusts</b> were {{over the course}} of history.

5000|$|Many people {{believed}} that prayer and petition {{were required to}} end the plague, as they viewed the swarm of <b>locusts</b> as a punishment from God for their sins. Rav A.M.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{demands of}} group living and foraging have {{been implicated in}} both evolutionary and plastic changes in brain size. Desert <b>locusts</b> show extreme phenotypic plasticity, allowing brain morphology {{to be related to}} very different lifestyles in one species. At low population densities, <b>locusts</b> occur in a solitarious phase that avoids other <b>locusts</b> and is cryptic in appearance and behaviour. Crowding triggers the transformation into the highly active gregarious phase, which aggregates into dense migratory swarms. We found that the brains of gregarious <b>locusts</b> have very different proportions and are also 30 per cent larger overall than in solitarious <b>locusts.</b> To address whether brain proportions change with size through nonlinear scaling (allometry), we conducted the first comprehensive major axis regression analysis of scaling relations in an insect brain. This revealed that phase differences in brain proportions arise from a combination of allometric effects and deviations from the allometric expectation (grade shifts). In consequence, gregarious <b>locusts</b> had a larger midbrain∶optic lobe ratio, a larger central complex and a 50 per cent larger ratio of the olfactory primary calyx to the first olfactory neuropile. Solitarious <b>locusts</b> invest more in low-level sensory processing, having disproportionally larger primary visual and olfactory neuropiles, possibly to gain sensitivity. The larger brains of gregarious <b>locusts</b> prioritize higher integration, which may support the behavioural demands of generalist foraging and living in dense and highly mobile swarms dominated by intense intraspecific competition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDesert <b>Locusts</b> {{can change}} {{reversibly}} between solitarious and gregarious phases, which differ considerably in behaviour, morphology and physiology. The two phases show many behavioural differences including both overall levels of {{activity and the}} degree to which they are attracted or repulsed by conspecifics. Solitarious <b>locusts</b> perform infrequent bouts of locomotion characterised by a slow walking pace, groom infrequently and actively avoid other <b>locusts.</b> Gregarious <b>locusts</b> are highly active with a rapid walking pace, groom frequently and are attracted to conspecifics forming cohesive migratory bands as nymphs and/or flying swarms as adults. The sole factor driving the onset of gregarization is the presence of conspecifics. In several previous studies concerned with the mechanism underlying this transformation we have used an aggregate measure of behavioural phase state, Pgreg, derived from logistic regression analysis, which combines and weights several behavioural variables to characterise solitarious and gregarious behaviour. Using this approach we have analysed the time course of behavioural change, the stimuli that induce gregarization and the key role of serotonin in mediating the transformation. Following a recent critique that suggested that using Pgreg may confound changes in general activity with genuine gregarization we have performed a meta-analysis examining the time course of change in the individual behaviours that we use to generate Pgreg. We show that the forced crowding of solitarious <b>locusts,</b> tactile stimulation of the hind femora, and the short-term application of serotonin each induce concerted changes in not only locomotion-related variables but also grooming frequency and attraction to other <b>locusts</b> towards those characteristic of long-term gregarious <b>locusts.</b> This extensive meta-analysis supports and extends our previous conclusions that solitarious <b>locusts</b> undergo a rapid behavioural gregarization upon receiving appropriate stimulation for a few hours that is mediated by serotonin, at the end of which their behaviour is largely indistinguishable from <b>locusts</b> that have been in the gregarious phase their entire lives...|$|R
