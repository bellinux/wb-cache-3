5|$|In service, Skylon could {{potentially}} <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> launching satellites which, according to evidence {{submitted to the}} UK parliament by REL, is forecast to be around £650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods {{was estimated to be}} roughly £15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs. According to business publication Management Today, Skylon has been discussed as a possible replacement for NASA's Space Shuttle programme.|$|E

In ultra-high-throughput sequencing, as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel.|$|E

25|$|A major {{technological}} advance was {{the design of}} the Dutch merchant ship known as the fluyt. Unlike rivals, it was not built for possible conversion in wartime to a warship, so it was cheaper to build and carried twice the cargo, and could be handled by a smaller crew. Construction by specialized shipyards using new tools made it half the cost of rival ships. The factors combined to sharply <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> transportation for Dutch merchants, giving them a major competitive advantage.|$|E

25|$|Cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) {{is one of}} {{the fastest-growing}} thin film based solar cells which are collectively known as second generation devices. This new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions (Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit) as conventional Si devices but promises to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008. This technology’s highest power conversion efficiency is 21%. The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS buffer layer (50–150nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.|$|E
25|$|A stepstone was {{the kitchen}} {{designed}} in Frankfurt by Margarethe Schütte-Lihotzky. Working class women frequently worked in factories {{to ensure the}} family's survival, as the men's wages often did not suffice. Social housing projects led to the next milestone: the Frankfurt Kitchen. Developed in 1926, this kitchen measured 1.9m by 3.4m (approximately 6ft 2in by 11ft 2in, with a standard layout). It was built for two purposes: to optimize kitchen work to reduce cooking time and <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> building decently equipped kitchens. The design, created by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, {{was the result of}} detailed time-motion studies and interviews with future tenants to identify what they needed from their kitchens. Schütte-Lihotzky's fitted kitchen was built in some 10,000 apartments in the housing projects erected in Frankfurt in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|James only in late August seriously {{began to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a Dutch invasion and then overestimated the size of the naval force the Dutch would bring against him. He assumed they would equip their full battle fleet, which he himself would be unable to match for financial reasons: in October about thirty English ships-of-the-line had been assembled, all third rates or fourth rates, while heavier vessels remained laid up. Fearing a surprise attack, he declined to position this fleet at The Downs, for striking into the southern North Sea or the Channel the most convenient location, but also a very vulnerable one. When Admiral George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth decided to place his fleet at the Gunfleet near the Medway, in a rather withdrawn location, James therefore merely suggested to bring the fleet farther out, though he well understood it otherwise risked becoming locked up in the Thames estuary by the same easterly wind that would allow the Dutch to cross. This was influenced by his belief the Dutch might well attack France instead and his expectation that they would first seek a naval victory before daring to invade – and that it thus would be advantageous to refuse battle. Indeed, it had originally been the Dutch intention to defeat the English first to free the way for the transport fleet – though they too, to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the invasion, had not activated any heavier ships – but because it was now so late in the season and conditions on board deteriorated rapidly, they decided to sail in convoy and, if possible, avoid battle.|$|E
500|$|Forty new boroughs {{were formed}} in 1894 and 1895, with the bulk in Bergen County, where townships were broken up or greatly reduced in size; {{there are few}} there today. Feeling that the 1894 laws had allowed the {{formation}} of an excessive number of municipalities, the legislature scuttled the right to elect a freeholder in 1895, and ended the formation of boroughs by referendum the following year. [...] Municipalities continued to be created by the legislature into the 20th century, and although there have been efforts at consolidation in recent years to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> government, their number has been only slightly reduced.|$|E
500|$|According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2011), energy {{subsidies}} artificially {{lower the}} price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production. [...] "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits". In November 2011, an IEA report entitled Deploying Renewables 2011 said [...] "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified {{in order to give}} an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} boroughs became townships {{in the early}} 1980s, though they did not {{necessarily}} change their form of government, as until 1986, more federal aid was available to municipalities called townships than to those styled boroughs. As of 2014, New Jersey has 565 municipalities, more than eight other states combined, and {{the highest number of}} municipalities per capita of any state. Its boroughs include Teterboro in Bergen County, site of an airport, industrial buildings, and the homes of fewer than a hundred residents, and Pine Valley and Tavistock in Camden County, each consisting primarily of a country club. Governor Chris Christie has urged consolidation to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> government, and a number of municipalities have studied it, but the only significant recent merger has been that of Princeton Borough with Princeton Township (2012).|$|E
500|$|On 13 January 1975, Secretary of the Air Force John L. McLucas {{announced}} the YF-16 {{as the winner}} of the ACF competition. The chief reasons given by the Secretary were the YF-16's lower operating costs, greater range, and maneuver performance that was [...] "significantly better" [...] than that of the YF-17, especially at supersonic speeds. Another advantage of the YF-16 – unlike the YF-17 – was its use of the Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan engine, the same powerplant used by the F-15; such commonality would <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> engines for both programs. Secretary McLucas announced that the USAF planned to order at least 650, possibly up to 1,400 production F-16s. In the Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF) competition, on 2 May 1975 the Navy selected the YF-17 as the basis for what would become the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.|$|E

Another influence that Freda acknowledged was Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher", with its suggested parallel between decaying, dissipated interiors and the Canale's vampire-like character.|$|E
