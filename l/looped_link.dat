40|$|The membrane-resident {{domain of}} {{chloride}} channels and transporters of the CLC family {{is composed of}} 18 alpha-helices (designated A to R) connected sequentially by extracellular and intracellular loops, whose functional characteristics are generally unclear. To study {{the relevance of the}} intracellular <b>loops</b> <b>linking</b> helices D and E, F and G, H and I and J and K, alanine-exchange mutagenesis, split channel strategy, GST (glutathione transferase) -pull-down methods and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used. We investigated the possible roles of these loops in binding to the cytoplasmic, carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the protein, as well as their physiological roles in channel function. Although other interacting positions are conceivable, our results indicate that there is unlikely to be significant binding between the C-tail and any one of these individual cytoplasmic loops. Particular loops might, however, be essential for some channel characteristics. For example, alanine-exchange mutation of the <b>loop</b> <b>linking</b> helix D to E eliminated channel currents; of the <b>loop</b> <b>linking</b> helix H to I caused a significant shift of the open probability of fast gating (P(o) (f)), towards more positive voltages; and of the <b>loop</b> <b>linking</b> helix J to K locked the common gating of hClC- 1 open. Therefore, the gating mechanisms of hClC- 1 might not only involve the helices and the C-tail, but also involve some of the loops. Linlin Ma, Grigori Y. Rychkov and Allan H. Bretag[URL]...|$|R

30|$|To {{meet the}} ambitious {{performance}} target for international mobile telecommunication-advanced (IMT-Advanced) candidate radio interface technologies (RITs) [16], LTE is evolving into LTE-Advanced, and VoIP performance {{also needs to}} be improved. In the LTE-Advanced self-evaluation inside 3 GPP, both dynamic scheduling and semipersistent scheduling are considered. While all existing solutions and schemes, such as dynamic packet bundling [9] and semipersistent scheduling [10, 11], try to reduce consumption of control channel resources, we consider a new paradigm in this paper to overcome limitation of control channel resources and further enhance VoIP performance, that is, to allocate limited control channel resources more effectively so that we can schedule more VoIP users dynamically in each TTI. Our proposed PDCCH resource allocation approach includes bidirectional power control, inner <b>loop</b> <b>link</b> adaptation (ILLA), and outer <b>loop</b> <b>link</b> adaptation (OLLA) algorithms. They are simple yet efficient and can be easily implemented requiring no changes to the existing 3 GPP technical specifications.|$|R
30|$|We propose an {{efficient}} control channel resource allocation approach {{to enhance the}} performance of voice-over-IP (VoIP) in orthogonal frequency division multiple access- (OFDMA-) based next generation mobile communication systems. As the long-term evolution (LTE) of universal terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) is the first OFDMA-based packet radio network and thus selected in this paper as an application example. Our proposed physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) resource allocation approach for E-UTRAN is composed of bidirectional power control, inner <b>loop</b> <b>link</b> adaptation (ILLA), and outer <b>loop</b> <b>link</b> adaptation (OLLA) algorithms. Its effectiveness is validated through large-scale radio system level simulations, and simulation results confirm that VoIP capacity with dynamic scheduling can be further enhanced with this PDCCH resource allocation approach. Moreover, the VoIP performance requirements for international mobile telecommunications-advanced (IMT-Advanced) radio interface technologies can be met with dynamic scheduling together with proposed PDCCH resource allocation. Besides E-UTRAN, this approach can be introduced to other OFDMA-based mobile communication systems for VoIP performance enhancement as well.|$|R
