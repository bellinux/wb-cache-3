Carpenter also noted that the occasional presence of large petrified logs indicate the presence of [...] tall trees, which would seem to conflict with the savanna comparison. However, the trees are rare, and since tall trees require more water than the savanna environment could generally provide, they probably existed in narrow tracts or [...] "gallery forests" [...] along rivers and gulleys where water could accumulate.

2500|$|Most often {{employed}} by colubroid snakes (colubrids, elapids, and vipers) when the snake must move {{in an environment}} that lacks irregularities to push against (rendering lateral undulation impossible), such as a slick mud flat, or a sand dune, sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up, resulting in a peculiar [...] "rolling" [...] motion. This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping. The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing.

Fresh edible leaves of Heinsia crinata, Lasienthera africana and Pterocarpus mildbraedii were collected from the wild stands. Proximate analyses were carried out to evaluate their nutritional values vis-à-vis moisture, ash, fibre, protein, lipid, carbohydrate and caloric value while physicochemical analyses were done to determine their sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), phosphorus (P), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) concentrations. Results revealed that P. mildbraedii had the highest moisture content 78. 15 %; ash, 19. 72 %; fibre, 13. 14 % and protein, 29. 75 % but lowest lipid, 3. 13 %; carbohydrate, 34. 30 % and <b>lowest</b> <b>caloric</b> value, 284. 37 kcal.

40|$|AIM: To quantitatively {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between energy intake and the incidence of digestive cancers in a meta-analysis of cohort studies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Studies were included if they reported relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95 % CIs of digestive cancers with respect to total energy intake. When RRs were not available in the published article, they were computed from the exposure distributions. Data were extracted independently by two investigators and discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third investigator. We performed fixed-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions to compute the summary RR for highest versus lowest category of energy intake and for per unit energy intake and digestive cancer incidence by giving each study-specific RR a weight that was proportional to its precision. RESULTS: Nineteen studies consisting of 13 independent cohorts met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 995 &#x 2005; 577 participants and 5620 incident cases of digestive cancer with an average follow-up of 11. 1 years. A significant inverse association was observed between energy intake and the incidence of digestive cancers. The RR of digestive cancers for the highest compared to the <b>lowest</b> <b>caloric</b> intake category was 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 81 - 0. 98, P 0. 05) or pancreatic (RR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 49 - 1. 09, P > 0. 05) cancer.

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} neural activation {{and desire to}} eat in response to appetitive cues from pre- to postbariatric surgery for obesity. Background—Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) {{is the most common}} bariatric procedure. However, the mechanisms of action in RYGB are not well understood. A significant proportion of the resulting reduction in caloric intake is unaccounted for by the restrictive and malabsorptive mechanisms and is thought to be mediated by neuroendocrine function. Numerous investigations of postsurgical changes in gut peptides have resulted; however, changes in neural activation after RYGB surgery have not been previously investigated. Methods—Functional magnetic resonance imaging and verbal rating scales were used to assess brain activation and desire to eat in response to high-and low-calorie food cues in 10 female patients 1 -month pre- and post-RYGB surgery.

40|$|Administration of pellets in fed stomach {{state can}} prolong the gastric {{emptying}} of pellets {{in comparison to}} the administration under fasting conditions [1]. On the basis of literature data we aimed to investigate the influence of caloric value of food on gastric emptying of pellets. A systematic literature search on evaluation of human gastric emptying of pellets based on the technique of gamma scintigraphy was performed in the MEDLINE database. Studies estimating the gastric emptying of pellets under fedconditions were focused. In addition to the caloric value of the meal, a special attention was made on other factors such as, pellets size and density,pellets formulation (filled into capsules or compressed into tablets),a time delay for pellets administration in relation to the time of meal completion, and refreshments provision. The majority of pellets gastric emptying data was presented in terms of pellets t 50 values - a time when 50 % of the administered pellets emptied the stomach. In order to evaluate the influence of the caloric value of the meal on pellets t 50 values a linear regression model was built. In this model the caloric value was regarded as a categorical variable, which was recorded into dummy variables with the <b>lowest</b> <b>caloric</b> value set as a reference. In total 17 studies were recovered, however,only 6 of them met the selection criteria: pellets density between 1. 2 and 1. 5 g/cm 3, administration of the pellets at the time of meal completion, pellets filled into capsules, and pellets size in the range from 0. 6 to 1. 4 mm. In these studies 48 individual values of pellets t 50 were collected (6 or 8 subjects per study) and the obtained caloric values were 1200, 1500, 2300, 2800, and 3600 kJ. Mean value of t 50 of pellets administered right after the 1200 kJ meal was 136 min. In comparison to the 1200 kJ meal, the mean values of t 50 of pellets administered right after 2800 and 3600 kJ meal were significantly longer 212 min (p= 0. 031) and 263 min (p= 0. 003), respectively. No significant difference in terms of mean values of pellets t 50 could be noted between the 1200 kJ meal and 1500 or 2300 kJ meal.

40|$|A {{controlled}} {{regulation of}} mitochondrial mass through either the production (biogenesis) or the degradation (mitochondrial quality control) of the organelle represents a crucial step for proper mitochondrial and cell function. Key steps of mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control are overviewed, {{with an emphasis}} on the role of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases that keep mitochondria fully functional, provided the mitochondrial activity impairment is not excessive. In this case, the whole organelle is degraded by mitochondrial autophagy or "mitophagy". Beside the maintenance of adequate mitochondrial abundance and functions for cell homeostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis might be enhanced, through discussed signalling pathways, in response to various physiological stimuli, like contractile activity, exposure to <b>low</b> temperatures, <b>caloric</b> restriction and stem cells differentiation. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction might also initiate a retrograde response, enabling cell adaptation through increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Although the examples cited above suggest that the control of mitochondrial mass, through biogenesis or quality control, is beneficial to the cell/organism demands, the data generated from diverse pathologies suggest that modulations in mitochondrial abundance/functions may participate to the pathogenesis. Increased mitochondrial abundance is generally described to characterize mitochondrial myopathies as well as most cancers, and is generally accompanied by qualitative modifications of mitochondria, thereby affecting programmed cells death susceptibility. On the contrary, in ageing, obesity and type 2 diabetes, mitochondrial biogenesis and functions are generally down-regulated. The development of insulin resistance, favoured by an impaired mitochondrial function, tends to reduce the abundance of the organelle, through a vicious circle. J. Cell.
