5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion.

The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably <b>larger,</b> <b>and</b> is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough most {{thin walled}} {{cylinders}} under external pressure are stiffened by rings {{with the same}} dimension, {{it is believed that}} the combination of <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small stiffening rings is helpful to the lightweight design of structures. In this paper, eigenvalue buckling analysis has been done to study the buckling pattern (BP) and critical pressure Pcr of thin walled cylinders with the combination of <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small stiffening rings. It is found that there is a map of buckling patterns for different ring combinations. Three BPs appear as buckling of cylinder together with both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small stiffening rings (BP-I), buckling of cylinder together with small stiffening rings but without large stiffening rings (BP-II), and finally, buckling of cylinder without both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small stiffening rings (BP-III). In the region of BP-I and BP-II, values of Pcr increase with the size of <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small ring, but remain constant in the region of BP-III. And it indicates a remarkable optimization space for the design of stiffening rings. The <b>large</b> ring location <b>and</b> sizes of both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small rings are optimized for lightweight design of the example cylinder, which yields a reasonable result satisfying the stability requirement under external pressure...|$|R
