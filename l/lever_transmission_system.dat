40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{choosing}} the best <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> expansion plan considering a probabilistic reliability criterion LOLE. The method minimizes the invest-ment budget for constructing new transmission lines subject to probabilistic reliability criteria, which consider the uncertainties of <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> elements. Two probabilistic reliability criteria are used as constraints. One is a <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> reliability criterion LOLE constraint, {{and the other is}} a bus/nodal reliability criterion LOLE constraint. The proposed method models the <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> expansion problem as an integer programming problem. It solves for the optimal strategy using a probabilistic branch and bound method that utilizes a network flow approach and the maximum flow-min-imum cut set theorem. Test results on an existing 21 -bus system are included in the paper. They demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method for solving the <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> expansion planning problem subject to practical future uncertainties.
