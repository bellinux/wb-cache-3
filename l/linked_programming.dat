40|$|Many useful {{programming}} language extensions and system support libraries require {{knowledge of the}} locations of fields within objects at run time. Examples include orthogonal persistent object stores, precise garbage collectors, data structure picklers, and parameter marshaling schemes. For clean and efficient implementation as libraries, these systems require run-time knowledge of in-memory layouts of data objects, which is unavailable in most traditionally compiled and <b>linked</b> <b>programming</b> languages, such as C, C++, and Ada. Even the recently standardized run-time type identification (RTTI) feature in C++ is insufficient, because it describes only language-level features of the type hierarchy and not the compiler-dependent object layout decisions. We present a facility for run-time type description, or RTTD, which extracts low-level layout information from debugging information generated by conventional compilers, and makes it available to user programs. We believe {{this to be the}} simple [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} interplay between high level {{debugging}} strategies and low level tactics {{in the context of}} a multirepresentation software development environment (SDE). It investigates three questions. 1. How do programmers integrate debugging strategies and tactics when working with SDEs? 2. What is the relationship between verbal ability, level of graphical literacy and debugging (task) performance. 3. How do modality and perspective influence debugging strategy and deployment of tactics? The paper extends the work of Katz and Anderson [1988. Debugging: an analysis of bug location strategies. Human-Computer Interaction 3, 359 – 399] and others in terms of identifying high level debugging strategies, in this case when working with SDEs. It also describes how programmers of different backgrounds and degrees of experience make differential use of the multiple sources of information typically available in a software debugging environment. Individual difference measures considered among the participants were their programming experience and their knowledge of external representation formalisms. The debugging environment enabled the participants, computer science students, to view the execution of a program in steps and provided them with concurrently displayed, adjacent, multiple and <b>linked</b> <b>programming</b> representations. These representations comprised the program code, two visualisations of the program and its output. The two visualisations of the program were available, in either a largely textual format or a largely graphical format so as to track interactions between experience and low level mode-specific tactics, for example. The results suggest that (i) additionally to deploying debugging strategies similar to those reported in the literature, participants also employed a strategy specific to SDEs, following execution, (ii) verbal ability was not correlated with debugging performance...|$|E

40|$|Why {{does this}} have to be so complex? Is there no {{pleasing}} some people? Will we ever get it right? What is right? Is there only one way to do this? Why is it working in school A but not in school B? Is it preferable to try rather than not try at all? Why the detractors? Why high praise from some? Is this evidence of support? Who are the movers and shakers? The <b>Links</b> <b>Program,</b> at a regional university in NSW, Australia, involves teacher education students being attached to a school throughout their entire teaching program to enable them to be incorporated into the school culture which will, in turn, contribute to building the levels of confidence and resilience in Pre-service and New Scheme teachers. This program is aimed at providing an opportunity for pre-service teachers to build trust and understanding of one particular school environment. This paper briefly orientates the reader by describing the <b>Links</b> <b>Program,</b> its goals and activities that students may engage in as active participants of the program. It then goes on to illuminate the results of a survey conducted after the program has been running for 18 months through the lens of 'complexity theory'. Identification of such complexities within the <b>Links</b> <b>Program</b> leads to a consideration of the implications for learning to teach, with and by, NSW Professional Teaching Standards...|$|R

40|$|The GP <b>Links</b> <b>program</b> aims {{to promote}} the {{amalgamation}} of smaller general practices into larger group practices {{and is one of}} several strategies being used to modernise Australian family practice. GP Links provides financial incentives to practices willing to amalgamate.

We report our positive and negative experiences of practice amalgamation through the GP <b>Links</b> <b>program</b> in a regional setting of South Australia. From our experience we suggest that for rural practices, a staged approach of increasing collaboration that may lead to amalgamation, which focuses on rural practices developing a supportive network and alliances with others such as Divisions and University Departments of Rural Health might be a positive way ahead. 5 page(s...|$|R
