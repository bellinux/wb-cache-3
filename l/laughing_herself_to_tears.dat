60|$|Bobbie {{resigned}} herself amicably, and Lance, {{with his}} bright arch face, made his bow and half polite, half saucy addresses to Mrs. Froggatt in her magnificent head-gear, making her <b>laugh</b> <b>herself</b> almost <b>to</b> <b>tears</b> again as she declined. He held the Miss Pearsons in greater awe, and ventured on neither; so that Robina had him for Sir Roger de Coverley, where the sole contretemps arose from Angel and Bear being in such boisterous spirits that Wilmet decreed {{that they must}} not be partners again. Of the rest, some had {{a good deal of}} dancing-master experience; Mrs. Harewood's impromptu merry-makings had afforded plenty of practice to the two choristers; even Clement had had a certain school-feast training; and Felix, with a good ear, ready eye, and natural ease of movement, acquitted himself to Miss Knevett's eagerly expressed admiration.|$|R
60|$|Covering {{her face}} with her hands again, as if the passion which had {{sustained}} her through these disclosures lost itself in an overwhelming sense of shame and grief, she abandoned <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>tears.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{very slowly}} and silently, by {{the help of}} the rimpis which bound the straw, she climbed the dome of the hut, <b>laughing</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> think that this was the worst of omens for its owner, till at length she reached the {{smoke-hole}} at the top and looked down.|$|R
60|$|Deyes made no reply. Lady Peggy was <b>laughing</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1841, Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave her first public speech, {{on the subject of}} the Temperance movement, in front of 100 women in Seneca Falls. She wrote to her friend Elizabeth J. Neal that she moved both the {{audience}} and <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>tears,</b> saying [...] "I infused into my speech an Homeopathic dose of woman's rights, as I take good care to do in many private conversations." ...|$|R
60|$|Marcia {{suddenly}} withdrew her glance, <b>laughed</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> {{and sipped}} her wine.|$|R
6000|$|Ha--ha--she <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> {{so frightened}} {{that she was}} trying to laugh it off--ha--ha, how maddening it was, to be sure, to be sure! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] {{she said}} aloud, <b>laughing</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "I am not your master, and you rebel. Nevertheless, I'll conquer you, my fine brute." ...|$|R
60|$|The dinner-party {{that night}} was a great success. In {{the middle of it}} Lady Medlincourt <b>laughed</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|She half {{closed her}} eyes and <b>laughed</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> moving her head like a child, as though from sheer pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I will,' and Patty sewed away, {{wondering}} at {{this sudden}} {{interest in her}} work, and why Aunt Pen <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> as she put away the ammonia bottle.|$|R
60|$|As {{they went}} along she caught swiftly at her hat; then she stooped, {{picking up a}} hat-pin of twined silver. She <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> as if pleased by a coincidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "You very absurd persons, good night!" [...] said Marian, {{shutting}} her door, and <b>laughing</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> {{at such a}} very ludicrous idea as such {{a scheme}} {{on the part of}} her father.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face grew}} softer and more thoughtful. Suddenly she <b>laughed</b> {{outright}} <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> She went {{and sat down}} on the couch, where Wolfenden had been lying.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him fixedly for several moments. He was half afraid {{that she was going}} to get up and leave him. Instead, however, she broke into a hard little <b>laugh,</b> and helped <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> another cigarette.|$|R
60|$|He did {{so without}} embarrassment or hesitation,--it {{was more than}} ever {{apparent}} that he was entirely truthful. She {{leaned back in her}} chair, <b>laughing</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{they passed}} under the lamps {{he saw her}} face lifted, the eyes shining, the {{delicate}} nostrils dilated, as of one who scents battle and <b>laughs</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> She seemed <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> with a certain proud, sinister recklessness. His hands trembled with desire.|$|R
6000|$|She led the way, <b>laughing</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> over something. She {{gave him}} {{no time to}} blush and {{hesitate}} over the impropriety of entering a lady's room at midnight, but stalked ahead with a brief [...] "Come in." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>laughed</b> low <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> and {{the mobile}} {{features}} softened to their former tenderness {{as she looked}} up into that other face so full of an accusing significance which she would not understand.|$|R
60|$|The old hag <b>laughed</b> hoarsely <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> {{until the}} scraggy sinews of her {{withered}} neck stood out like whipcord. She was still chuckling and coughing when the merchant {{came back into}} the room.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will no one {{come and}} protect us? Oh! where is M. Darpent?' while Annora called {{to me to}} take our cloaks and {{come up to the}} roof of the house {{to see what was going}} on. She was in high spirits, no doubt <b>laughing</b> within <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> see how every danger made my mother invoke M. Darpent, and finding in a tumult a sure means of meeting him, for she could trust to him to come and offer his protection.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Hauksbee {{departed}} humming, 'I'll {{go to him}} and say to him in manner most ironical.' Mrs. Mallowe <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> Then {{she grew}} suddenly sober. 'I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement? Lucy's a clever woman, but a thought too careless.' ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they got}} to the door she plaintively said: 'Come in,' and he {{followed}} her to her room. Here she sank on to a chair, and gave <b>herself</b> up <b>to</b> her <b>tears.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Hauksbee {{departed}} humming, [...] "I'll {{go to him}} and say to him in manner most ironical." [...] Mrs. Mallowe <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> Then {{she grew}} suddenly sober. [...] "I wonder whether I've done well in advising that amusement? Lucy's a clever woman, but a thought too careless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{looks very}} well,' said William, and went {{away with a}} flushed cheek. 'Bakri Scott, indeed!' Then she <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> for she knew the country of her service. 'But it will be Bakri all the same'; and she {{repeated}} it under her breath several times slowly, whispering it into favour.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew she}} would have to break her own trance of obstinacy. So she snuggled down into the bedclothes, {{shivering}} deliciously, for her skin had become chilled. She didn't care a bit, really, about her own downfall. She snuggled deliciously in the sheets, and admitted <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> that she loved him. In truth, she loved him--and she was <b>laughing</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{looks very}} well," [...] said William, and went {{away with a}} flushed cheek. [...] "Bakri Scott, indeed!" [...] Then she <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> for she knew her country. [...] "But it will he Bakri all the same"; and she {{repeated}} it under her breath several times slowly, whispering it into favour.|$|R
60|$|Perdita's {{questions}} had ceased; {{she leaned}} on my arm, panting with emotions too acute for tears--our men pulled alongside the other boat. As a last effort, my sister mustered her strength, her firmness; she stepped from one boat to the other, {{and then with}} a shriek she sprang towards Raymond, knelt at his side, and glueing her lips to the hand she seized, her face shrouded by her long hair, gave <b>herself</b> up <b>to</b> <b>tears.</b>|$|R
50|$|After dinner, Ji-soo {{boarded a}} bus home. From the bus window, Yuichi knocked on it, and told Ji-soo to open it. He {{requested}} her {{to meet again}} {{the next day at}} the same time, same place to dine again, and reiterated that he wanted to befriend her. As the bus left, Ji-soo <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Gertrude {{was waiting}} for her walk, till nurse should have dressed Margaret, and was frisking about the lawn, {{sometimes}} looking in at the drawing-room window at her sisters, sometimes chattering to Adams at his work, or <b>laughing</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> and the flowers, in that overflow of mirth, that seemed always bubbling up within her.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} a diamond flash played around him. Then {{he lifted his}} head and turned it curiously towards the crest above him. But the next moment he clapped his hands over his dazzled but now smiling eyes, as Mrs. McGee, secure in her leafy obscurity, fell back and <b>laughed</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> like a very schoolgirl.|$|R
60|$|Eve {{sat down}} and began <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> She {{had a habit of}} {{laughing}} almost altogether with her eyes in a way that expressed more genuine enjoyment than anything I have ever realized. She rocked herself gently backward and forward. Mr. Moss looked at us both a little suspiciously.|$|R
6000|$|And so, my dear children, I {{come to the}} end of {{the history}} of a failure--a brave failure and a noble one, but a failure none the less. In three more years England was <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> the fetters from her free limbs, and to send James and his {{poisonous}} brood flying from her shores even as I was flying then. We had made the error of being before our time. Yet there came days when folk thought kindly of the lads who had fought so stoutly in the West, and when their limbs, gathered from many a hangman's pit and waste place, were borne amid the silent sorrow of a nation to the pretty country burial-grounds where they would have chosen to lie. There, within the sound of the bell which from infancy had called them to prayer, beneath the turf over which they had wandered, under the shadow of those Mendip and Quantock Hills which they loved so well, these brave hearts lie still and peaceful, like tired children in the bosom of their mother. Requiescant-requiescant in pace! ...|$|R
60|$|Within {{the chamber}} Gahan saw Tara of Helium in the {{clutches}} of a mighty body, while close to the wall upon {{the opposite side of}} the apartment crouched the hideous, spider-like Luud. Instantly the king realized the menace to himself and sought to fasten his eyes upon the eyes of Gahan, and in doing so he was forced to relax his concentration upon the rykor in whose embraces Tara struggled, so that almost immediately the girl found <b>herself</b> able <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> away from the awful, headless thing.|$|R
60|$|She could {{scarcely}} believe in her good fortune, {{especially when she}} remembered {{the description of the}} man which one of the staff had given. He was gruff, vulgar, ill-tempered; the chief ought to be kicked for letting her go near him! This was what she had been told. She <b>laughed</b> softly <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lettie {{was in her}} old {{animated}} mood. She ran, leaping over rough places, <b>laughing,</b> talking <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> in French. We came to the Mill. Gyp did not bark. I {{opened the}} outer door and we crept softly into the great dark scullery, peeping into the kitchen through {{the crack of the}} door.|$|R
