50|$|Bombing {{during the}} Blitz of World War II {{severely}} damaged the docks, {{and by the}} 1960s, newer container technology and relocation to Tilbury had made the lightermen's trade, <b>lighterage,</b> obsolete. In terminal decline most up-river docks had been abandoned by the 1980s. Some waterman encouraged by Festival of Britain 1951 set up river cruise companies in the late 1940s others in the 1980s but by careful consolidation of ownership and concentrating on passenger comfort, some offering night cruises, have successfully dominated the sector on into the new millennium. In the <b>lighterage</b> sector Cory Environmental, originally an amalgamation of eight companies, bucked the trend of this traditionally fragmented industry by capitalizing on an opportunity and used its empty coal barges, on return trips, to transport rubbish from London's streets generating enough extra revenue to buy up surplus barges from smaller <b>lighterage</b> companies as they sold up. Between 1967 and 1976 over 40 <b>lighterage</b> firms closed down.|$|R

50|$|The fading {{fortunes}} of the Croydon gold mines {{in the early twentieth}} century had significant impact on the economy of Normanton, as did the construction of a railway between Townsville and the copper mines of Cloncurry in 1908. This settlement had been previously served by Normanton, and despite the best efforts of a former Burns Philp Normanton manager, and now Member of Parliament, James Forsyth, to build the Cloncurry to Normanton railway, it did not proceed. By 1920 the Carpentaria <b>Lighterage</b> Company withdrew from the Gulf trade and two lighters, the Atlas and Hercules were sold to the Shire Councils of Normanton and Burketown. The <b>Lighterage</b> Company was liquidated in 1926.|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s Britain {{suffered}} a major energy crisis and many {{politicians in the}} UK and US were astutely looking at alternative ways to transport freight in ways that could reduce dependency on oil. The decline of the British Empire {{and the opening of}} Tilbury docks caused the closure of the upriver docks on the river Thames and started a steep decline in traditional London <b>lighterage</b> which had transported large amounts of coal. Between 1967 and 1976 over 40 <b>lighterage</b> firms closed down. At the same time the UKs domestic central heating market emerged oil quickly replacing coal. The race thus reflected a more pragmatic political ethos and was a way of keeping alive a dying industry and its river skills as the energy crisis deepened further.|$|R
