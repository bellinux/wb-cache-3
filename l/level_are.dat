5|$|An implant {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to {{determine}} if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant <b>level</b> <b>are</b> the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5mm.|$|E
50|$|Follicle-stimulating hormone and {{luteinizing hormone}} <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{considerably}} elevated (30-33 mIU/mL and 34-37 mIU/mL, respectively) and estradiol and estrone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> markedly elevated (145 pg/mL and 119-272 pg/mL, respectively), while testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> normal (445 ng/dL). Sex hormone-binding globulin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (6.0-10.0 nmol/L), while thyroxine-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> all normal. Osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> both substantially elevated (18.7-21.6 ng/mL and 33.3-35.9 ng/mL, respectively).|$|R
50|$|One of {{her famous}} aphorisms compares the occidental {{economic}} model to a cake with four levels, with {{glass on the}} top: the first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> nature, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the subsistence economy, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> {{the public and private}} economy, and the last <b>level</b> <b>is</b> finance.|$|R

Caps earned during the players whole career are included, not just those won while contracted to Plymouth Argyle.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{particular}} level has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. The keys that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fourth <b>level</b> <b>are</b> found in the second level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fifth <b>level</b> <b>are</b> found in the third level, and the keys that unlock the last <b>level</b> <b>are</b> found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.|$|E
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c <b>level)</b> <b>are</b> often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
50|$|DDSN uses a {{capability}} {{model that}} consist of four levels. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Reacting, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Anticipating, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Collaborating {{and the last}} <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Orchestrating. The first two levels focus on the internal supply chain while the last two levels concentrate on external relations throughout the Extended Enterprise.|$|R

5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest <b>level</b> <b>are</b> motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher <b>level</b> <b>are</b> areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The club's colours {{have been}} {{primarily}} {{red and white}} since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. Aberdeen attract support {{from the city and}} surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same <b>level</b> <b>are</b> in the city of Dundee.|$|E
5|$|The provinces are {{subdivided}} into 59 districts and 1,200 wards (sometimes {{referred to as}} municipalities). Each district is headed by a District Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. There is also a Rural District Council, which appoints a chief executive officer. The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors, the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs (traditional leaders appointed under customary law) in the district. Other government functions at district <b>level</b> <b>are</b> carried out by district offices of national government departments.|$|E
50|$|In video systems, nominal <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> 1 VP-P for synched systems, such as {{baseband}} composite video, and 0.7 VP-P for systems without sync. Note {{that these}} <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> measured peak-to-peak, while audio <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> time averages.|$|R
30|$|A polygon {{for each}} house was {{produced}} {{based on a}} field experiment, and the damage <b>level</b> information <b>was</b> attached to each polygon. The polygons with same damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated and were converted to raster data with 10 -m resolution, which matched the PALSAR- 2 processed data. The raster images for each damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated. There were several pixels in which different damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> assigned in the same pixel. In that case, the damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> averaged. The range, 3.5 ≤damaged level < 4.5 <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 4; 4.5 ≤damaged <b>level</b> <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} has six stories, {{three of}} which are allocated for passenger processing. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for arrivals, the sixth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for departures, and the fourth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine <b>level</b> (which <b>is</b> the uppermost <b>level).</b>|$|R
5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, the player is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each <b>level</b> <b>are</b> straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral <b>level</b> <b>are</b> associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Besides K. langenbergensis, other {{crocodilians}} {{from the}} Langenberg Quarry include the marine Machimosaurus hugii and Steneosaurus aff. brevirostris, {{which would have}} lived offshore and fed on turtles and fish; and the amphibious generalist Goniopholis simus, which subsisted on a diet of both shelly and soft prey like modern alligators. The quarry is best-known as the type locality of the brachiosaurid sauropod dinosaur Europasaurus holgeri, which was an insular dwarf. Isolated teeth show that {{there were at least}} four different types of theropods present at the locality, including the megalosaurid Torvosaurus sp. as well as an additional megalosaurid and indeterminate members of the Allosauridae and Ceratosauria; theropod tracks from two different species (not identifiable to the family <b>level)</b> <b>are</b> also known. Remains attributable to diplodocids (possibly also dwarfed) and stegosaurs have also been found, alongside an indeterminate dsungaripterid pterosaur.|$|E
30|$|Different <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} for centers and eventually one capacity <b>level</b> <b>is</b> selected for each center.|$|R
50|$|Points are tallied {{up at the}} end of each level, {{successful}} completion of which will unlock additional <b>levels.</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> rated in difficulty using a star system; one star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> relatively easy, while five star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> the most difficult.|$|R
50|$|<b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> square mazes {{that grow}} larger as the player descends, {{simulating}} {{the design of}} a pyramid. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 3x3, totalling 9 squares. Each succeeding <b>level</b> <b>is</b> one step larger in each dimension (so the next <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 4x4 steps, for a total of 16 squares, and so on). A key on each must be found to unlock the next <b>level.</b> Ascension <b>is</b> impossible, which can strand players if an important item is left behind.|$|R
5|$|Gaelic football, hurling and {{handball}} are {{the best-known}} of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games {{are governed by}} the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), {{with the exception of}} ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500 capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there. All GAA players, even at the highest <b>level,</b> <b>are</b> amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|In Mission Mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} missions, each with objectives {{that range from}} collecting coins to attacking enemies. In each mission, the player controls a pre-specified character. There are seven levels with eight missions in each. After completing each mission, the player's performance is given a grade of stars (three, two, or one) or letters (A, B, C, D, or E). After all eight missions in a <b>level</b> <b>are</b> complete, the player must complete a boss mission {{to advance to the}} next level. Once the first six levels are complete, and the rank of at least one star has been obtained on every mission, the seventh level is unlocked.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population <b>level</b> <b>are</b> fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
50|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{dramatically}} and persistently elevated (estradiol <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 2340 pg/mL, regarded as being about 10 times the normal level, and ranged from 750-3500 pg/mL), gonadotropin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 6.7-19.1 mIU/mL and 5.8-13.2 mIU/mL, respectively), and testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> slightly elevated (33-88 ng/dL). Inhibin A <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also markedly elevated. Sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin, and triglycerides, which {{are known to}} be elevated by estrogen, were all within normal ranges in spite of the extremely high levels of estrogen, and inhibin B <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also normal. Her relatively mildly elevated <b>levels</b> of gonadotropins <b>were</b> attributed to retained negative feedback by progesterone as well as by her elevated levels of testosterone and inhibin A, although it was acknowledged that possible effects of estrogen mediated by other receptors such as ERβ could not be excluded.|$|R
5000|$|Estradiol and LH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{dramatically}} elevated due to loss {{of negative}} feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. FSH <b>levels,</b> in contrast, <b>are</b> normal. Testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> also substantially elevated. Prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> decreased by 5-fold, which {{is due to}} a loss of its estradiol-induced secretion from the anterior pituitary.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 2009, the {{basement}} <b>level</b> <b>was</b> flooded when Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) battered the capital. The appliance center, supermarket, food court and other retail stores located at {{the basement}} <b>level</b> <b>were</b> heavily damaged. The basement <b>level</b> <b>was</b> temporarily closed for several days.|$|R
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} <b>level</b> <b>are</b> gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{throughout}} each <b>level</b> <b>are</b> {{various types}} of crates, most of which contain items such as Wumpa Fruit and Aku Aku masks, {{which can be broken}} by jumping on or spinning into them. Other types of crate include checkpoint crates, which lets players resume their progress after losing a life, arrow crates which Crash can bounce on, and explosive TNT crates that explode upon being broken, or following a timer that activates by jumping on them. Certain crates, including steel platform crates, are invisible, requiring the player to hit an exclamation box to make them tangible. If the player clears a level with all crates broken without dying, they will earn a gem. Additional gems can be obtained through hidden levels or alternate routes, and some gems are required to access new areas. Collecting all gems in the game allows the player to reach its true ending. If the player manages to collect enough bonus icons, they will be warped to a Bonus Stage which, upon completion, will allow the player to save their progress, either via memory card or password.|$|E
5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary <b>level</b> <b>are</b> set by the local examination bodies.|$|E
50|$|Zimbabwe's {{public health}} care is {{delivered}} at four <b>levels,</b> which <b>are</b> meant {{to function as a}} referral chain.
