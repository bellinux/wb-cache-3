50|$|His {{contribution}} to the dictionary involved an enormous sacrifice of time and energy; the work was exigent and tiresome. Pușcariu recalled how his colleague, together with Constantin Lacea, would sit daily in front of files {{for three or four}} hours, more than once ripping apart an article on which they had worked for a week and restarting in a more logical fashion. Regarding the <b>linguistic</b> atlas, his <b>assistance</b> to Sever Pop involved material on the Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians. The favorable intellectual climate in Cluj fostered his seminal works on the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, establishing him as an authority in the field.

40|$|Motivated {{primarily}} by a cognitive approach, with consideration of interactional processes from a sociocultural perspective, {{the present study}} examined the use of <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> and peer interaction to facilitate second language (L 2) writing of young ESL learners. A total of 257 Year 5 children (age 10) from twelve intact classes (from six different schools) took part in this eight-week intervention-based study. Using a quasi-experimental design, the classes {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups or the control group. Pretests, interim tests, immediate posttests and delayed posttests were administered. As the study concerned both the processes and products of L 2 development, peer interaction and children's written production were taken as the two primary sources of data for this study. For the written production, four criteria were used to rate learners’ writings: Quality of ideas, Story shape and structure, Vocabulary and spelling and Implicit grammar. Partial correlation was employed to examine if there were any statistical relationships between treatment and learners’ written performance while controlling for prior attainment. Results show that the provision of enhanced and basic <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> may have a positive influence on only certain aspects of L 2 writing, while opportunities for peer interaction does not appear to have an impact on learners’ L 2 performance. For peer interaction, a subset of 60 learners were selected from the two treatment groups which received basic and enhanced <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance,</b> to compare their dialogic performance. Based on quantitative analyses of their recorded interactions, the findings suggest that the provision of varying degrees of <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> may affect, not the content of peer discussions, but how peer assistance is given during task. The results also show that through the provision of <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance,</b> peer interaction mediates the participants’ performance on Quality of ideas, Story shape and structure and Implicit grammar in their subsequent individual writing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} situation of legal interpreting in Italy. The aim is to describe the legislative framework of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> provided in this area in Italy, point out the shortcomings {{in the provision of}} this service, including the difficulties faced by legal interpreters, and investigate whether the Italian legislation on the matter is correctly applied in the city of Arezzo by interviewing people who work with legal interpreters in police stations, courthouses and the prison. Chapter 1 aims to give an overview on the presence of non-Italian speaking people in Italy, such as foreign residents, foreign tourists and migrants. There follows a description of {{the situation of}} foreign-born arrestees. Chapter 2 focuses on the legal framework of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> provided in Italian legal settings. It contains an analysis of the articles of several Codes of Criminal Procedure in force in different historical states of Italy that refer to the position of the interpreter, and {{a detailed description of the}} current legislation. Chapter 3 analyses the most frequent difficulties acknowledged by the interpreters, as well as several problems arising due to an incomplete implementation of the EU directives in Italy’s legislation. Chapter 4 deals with the situation of legal interpreting in Arezzo. Interviews were carried out with people who work frequently with interpreters in the city’s police stations, courthouses and prison. Moreover, the person in charge of the service of cultural mediation in the city was also interviewed. The problems acknowledged by the interviewees are presented. Chapter 5 describes the training projects promoted by the European Union.

40|$|Translation and {{interpreting}} in public services {{can have an}} enormous impact on the daily lives of individuals, as they allow access to hospitals, police stations, courts and other public institutions. In these circumstances, the presence (or absence) of an interpreter can really make the difference between freedom and captivity, between life and death. However, due to recent social and economic changes in the European Union, a few Member States have embraced nationalist ideologies which have hindered the professionalisation process of public service interpreting and damaged the public perception of the profession. In some European Countries, privatisation and outsourcing of public service interpreting result in the violation of the right to <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> in public services, a phenomenon which has significant repercussions not only at social level, but also on interpreters’ self-perception of their status. Drawing on the theoretical framework suggested by Inghilleri (2004; 2007), who reflects on the influence that macro-social events have on interpreting activity, this paper illustrates the results of a survey on the professional status of 114 public service interpreters working in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, two multicultural and multilingual countries in which the provision of interpreting services has been particularly damaged by national policies. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Public service interpreters (sociaal tolken in Dutch) – {{who work}} in {{hospitals}} and legal settings (such as courts and police stations) – play {{a fundamental role in}} the communication and integration process of allochtonous people. It is therefore not surprising that the final report of the Special Interest Group of Translation and Interpreting for Public Services points out that the profession is referred to as: ‘not just a matter of communication, but a matter of natural rights, of human rights: rights to be promoted, defended and guaranteed’ (SIGTIPS Final Report 2011, p. 7). Despite its significant social function, public service interpreting still lacks professionalization, even though the situation often changes from country to country. In some European countries, privatization and outsourcing of public service interpreting result in the violation of the right to <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> in public services, a phenomenon which has had significant repercussions not only at social level, but also on interpreters’ self-perception of their status.

40|$|A novel {{design for}} an {{inexpensive}} depth of interaction capable detector for gamma-ray imaging has been developed. The design {{takes advantage of}} the strong correlation between the width of the scintillation light distribution in monolithic crystals and the interaction depth of gamma-rays. We present in this work an inexpensive modification of the commonly used charge dividing circuits which enables the instantaneous and simultaneous computation of the second order moment of light distribution. This measure provides a good estimate for the depth of interaction and does not affect the determination of the position centroids and the energy release of gamma-ray impact. The method has been tested with a detector consisting of a monolithic LSO block sized 42 x 42 x 10 mm(3) and a position-sensitive photomultiplier tube H 8500 from Hamamatsu. The mean spatial resolution of the detector was found to be 3. 4 mm for the position centroids and 4. 9 mm for the DOI. The best spatial resolutions were observed {{at the center of the}} detector and yielded 1. 4 mm for the position centroids and 1. 9 mm for the DOI. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Plant {{survival}} in alpine habitats is controlled, in several cases, by pollination and seed dispersal success. We {{have investigated the}} genetic structure and mating patterns of the endangered Borderea pyrenaica (Dioscoreaceae), {{one of the oldest}} herbaceous Pyrenean mountain plants. Simple sequence repeat-based genotyping was carried out on all the reproductive female and male individuals and in all the female-descendent progenies of a population of this plant. Although the offspring sampling (246) was twice the size of the adult sampling (122), the latter group showed higher levels of heterozygosity and approximately 20 % more alleles than the offspring. Probabilistic spatial neighbourhood modelling of parentage analysis, based on the exponential-power type model, showed immigration rates of pollen at 63. 3 %. The present study also detected a strong spatial clustering; most of the sired seeds of B. pyrenaica (68. 83 %) occurred at distances of up to 20 m, whereas kinship coefficients of adult plants reached zero at spatial distances (d) < 5 m, and 5 < d < 10 m for females and males, respectively. These results support the hypothesis of a terrestrial ant-mediated, rather than a flying insect-mediated pollination in B. pyrenaica. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

Publishing research articles in English-medium refereed journals is a challenging task for non-native English speaking (NNES) doctoral students. Limited research, however, {{has been conducted}} in the Australian context to explore publishing experiences of NNES doctoral students. Adopting a qualitative research approach with semi-structured interviews to collect data, this research investigates language-related challenges {{encountered by}} seven Vietnamese students studying doctoral programs in Australian universities and their strategies to successfully publish their research articles in English. Content analysis was adopted for data analysis and an inductive approach was used to identify themes {{that emerged from the}} data. The results show that as non-native English speakers, these Vietnamese doctoral students had difficulties in using their discipline-specific terminology, expressing ideas in English and developing ideas logically. They also had to handle paper rejection and negative comments on their language issues given by journal gatekeepers. As novice scholarly writers, they encountered additional challenges because of their insufficient knowledge of and practice in writing research articles. To get their papers published, they have developed necessary strategies such as co-authoring with supervisors, seeking <b>linguistic</b> <b>assistance</b> from native speakers, self-proofreading, and developing genre knowledge of research articles. This research project has important implications for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programs and supportive writing programs that aim to help increase the publication outputs of NNES doctoral students in Australian universities. Future research may examine the publishing experiences of NNES doctoral students on a larger scale that allows comparisons between different linguistic groups as well as generalisation of the results to a wider population.

40|$|Background] Scientific {{interest}} in Enterococcus faecalis has increased greatly over recent decades. Some strains {{are involved in}} food fermentation and offer health benefits, whereas others are vancomycin-resistant and cause infections {{that are difficult to}} treat. The limited availability of vectors able to express cloned genes efficiently in E. faecalis has hindered biotechnological studies on the bacterium’s regulatory and pathogenicity-related genes. The agmatine deiminase (AGDI) pathway of E. faecalis, involved in the conversion of agmatine into putrescine, is driven by a response inducer gene aguR. [Results] This study describes that the exposure to the induction factor (agmatine) results in the transcription of genes {{under the control of the}} aguB promoter, including the aguBDAC operon. A novel E. faecalis expression vector, named pAGEnt, combining the aguR inducer gene and the aguB promoter followed by a cloning site and a stop codon was constructed. pAGEnt was designed for the overexpression and purification of a protein fused to a 10 -amino-acid His-tag at the C-terminus. The use of GFP as a reporter of gene expression in E. faecalis revealed that under induction with 60 mM agmatine, fluorescence reached 40 arbitrary units compared to 0 in uninduced cells. [Conclusion] pAGEnt vector can be used for the overexpression of recombinant proteins under the induction of agmatine in E. faecalis, with a close correlation between agmatine concentration and fluorescence when GFP was used as reporter.

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{its high}} incidence, nerve fiber (axon and myelin) damage after {{cerebral}} infarct {{has not yet}} been extensively investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate white matter repair after adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) administration in an experimental model of subcortical stroke. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze the ADMSC secretome and whether this could be implicated in this repair function. Methods: An animal model of subcortical ischemic stroke with white matter affectation was induced in rats by injection of endothelin- 1. At 24 hours, 2 × 106 ADMSC were administered intravenously to the treatment group. Functional evaluation, lesion size, fiber tract integrity, cell death, proliferation, white matter repair markers (Olig- 2, NF, and MBP) and NogoA were all studied after sacrifice (7 days and 28 days). ADMSC migration and implantation in the brain as well as proteomics analysis and functions of the secretome were also analyzed. Results: Neither ADMSC migration nor implantation to the brain was observed after ADMSC administration. In contrast, ADMSC implantation was detected in peripheral organs. The treatment group showed a smaller functional deficit, smaller lesion area, less cell death, more oligodendrocyte proliferation, more white matter connectivity and higher amounts of myelin formation. The treated animals also showed higher levels of white matter-associated markers in the injured area than the control group. Proteomics analysis of the ADMSC secretome identified 2, 416 proteins, not all of them previously described to be involved in brain plasticity. Conclusions: White matter integrity in subcortical stroke is in part restored by ADMSC treatment; this is mediated by repair molecular factors implicated in axonal sprouting, remyelination and oligodendrogenesis. These findings are associated with improved functional recovery after strokeThis study was supported by research grants PS 12 / 01754, PI 11 / 00909 and INVICTUS (RD 12 / 0014) (Spanish Neurovascular Network), SAF 2010 - 37926, ProteoRed-PT 13 / 0001 / 0017 and a Sara Borrell postdoctoral fellowship (CD 12 / 00706, to LOO) from Research Institute Carlos III, Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain.

40|$|The Iberian {{mountain}} spiny fescues are a reticulate {{group of}} five diploid grass taxa consisting of three parental species and two putative hybrids: F. ×souliei (F. eskia×F. quadriflora) and F. ×picoeuropeana (F. eskia×F. gautieri). Phenotypic and molecular studies were conducted {{with the aim of}} determining the taxonomic boundaries and genetic relationships of the five taxa and disentangling the origins of the two hybrids. Statistical analyses of 31 selected phenotypic traits were conducted on individuals from 159 populations and on nine type specimens. Molecular analyses of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were performed on 29 populations. The phenotypic analyses detected significant differences between the five taxa and demonstrated the overall intermediacy of the F. ×picoeuropeana and F. ×souliei between their respective parents. The RAPD analysis corroborated the genetic differentiation of F. eskia, F. gautieri and F. quadriflora and the intermediate nature of the two hybrids; however, they also detected genetic variation within F. ×picoeuropeana. These results suggest distinct origins for F. ×picoeuropeana in the Cantabrian and Pyrenean mountains, with the sporadic Pyrenean populations having potentially resulted from recent hybridizations and the stabilized Cantabrian ones from older events followed by potential displacements of the parents. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} whereby somatostatin (SS) produces {{beneficial effects}} in established pancreatitis induced by pancreaticobiliary duct ligation (PBDL) {{is still not}} clear. The aim of the work was to evaluate {{the possibility of a}} direct action of SS on pancreatic acinar cells from rats with acute pancreatitis. For this purpose, we studied the SS-receptor-adenylate cyclase system in pancreatic acinar membranes from both, control rats and rats with experimentally induced acute pancreatitis. On the other hand, {{it has been reported that}} cholecystokinin (CCK) diminishes the number of SS receptors in pancreatic acinar cells. Proglumide, a CCK receptor antagonist reduces the severity of acute pancreatitis in the rat. Therefore, we have also examined the effect of proglumide on the somatostatinergic system in controls and rats with acute pancreatitis. Fourteen hours after PBDL, the SS receptors, the capacity of the SS analogue SMS 201 - 995 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and PTX-catalyzed [P- 32] ADP-ribosylation of the alpha(1) subunits of Gi proteins could not be detected in pancreatic acinar membranes. One month after reopening the closed pancreaticobiliary duct (PBD), the pancreas showed regeneration of acinar cells, and the above-mentioned parameters were significantly lower than in the control group. Two months after reopening the closed PBD, all these parameters had returned to control values. The administration of proglumide (20 mg/kg i. p.), a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, accelerated pancreatic regeneration and approached all these parameters to control values one month after reopening the closed PBD. The present study suggests that the beneficial effects of SS on established pancreatitis induced by PBDL may not be due to a direct action of the peptide on pancreatic acinar cells at least at 14 hours after PBDL. In addition, these findings suggest that in established pancreatitis the effect of proglumide on the SS receptor-adenylate cyclase system could be due to its action on pancreatic regeneration.
