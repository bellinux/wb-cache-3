5|$|Prior to the statute's {{enactment}} in 1710, copying {{restrictions were}} {{authorized by the}} <b>Licensing</b> of the Press Act 1662. These restrictions were enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and the responsibility to censor—literary works. The censorship administered under the <b>Licensing</b> Act led to public protest; as the act had to be renewed at two-year intervals, authors and others sought to prevent its reauthorisation. In 1694, Parliament refused to renew the <b>Licensing</b> Act, ending the Stationers' monopoly and press restrictions.|$|E

5000|$|<b>License</b> {{compatibility}} {{between a}} copyleft <b>license</b> and another <b>license</b> is often only a one-way compatibility, making the copyleft <b>license</b> (GPL, {{and most other}} copyleft <b>licenses)</b> incompatible with proprietary commercial <b>licenses,</b> {{as well as with}} many non-proprietary <b>licenses.</b> This [...] "one-way compatibility" [...] characteristic has been criticized by the Apache Foundation, which <b>licenses</b> under the more permissive Apache <b>license,</b> such non-copyleft <b>licenses</b> being often less complicated and making for better <b>license</b> compatibility.|$|R
5000|$|The {{group of}} [...] "popular" [...] <b>licenses</b> include nine licenses: Apache <b>License</b> 2.0, New BSD <b>license,</b> GPLv2, LGPLv2, MIT <b>license,</b> Mozilla Public <b>License</b> 1.1, Common Development and Distribution <b>License,</b> Common Public <b>License,</b> Eclipse Public <b>License.</b> Notably missing are the GPLv3, LGPLv3 and AGPLv3.|$|R

5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} {{period for the}} Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s {{to work on their}} <b>licensing</b> agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when <b>licensing</b> revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.|$|E

50|$|Free <b>licenses</b> are {{a popular}} subset of public {{copyright}} <b>licenses.</b> They include {{free and open}} source software <b>licenses</b> and free content <b>licenses.</b> To qualify as a libre <b>license,</b> a public copyright <b>license</b> must allow licensees to share and adapt the <b>licensed</b> work for any purpose, including commercial ones. <b>Licenses</b> that purport to release a work into the public domain are a type of libre <b>license.</b>|$|R

5|$|Backbreaker is a simulation-style American {{football}} game, {{which allows}} the player {{to take control of}} a team of football players and compete against the CPU or another player in a variety of game modes. The game features 56 built-in teams plus three unlockable teams, and also allows the player to create 32 additional ones for a total of 91 possible teams. It lacks any <b>licensing</b> from the National Football League, {{due to the fact that}} they were not able to negotiate a <b>licensing</b> agreement with the NFL or NFLPA Because of this, the developers emphasized the game's customization tools.|$|E

50|$|BSD <b>licenses</b> are {{a family}} of {{permissive}} free software <b>licenses,</b> imposing minimal restrictions on the use and redistribution of covered software. This {{is in contrast to}} copyleft <b>licenses,</b> which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The original BSD <b>license</b> was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD <b>licenses.</b> BSD is both a <b>license</b> and a class of <b>license</b> (generally referred to as BSD-like). The modified BSD <b>license</b> (in wide use today) is very similar to the <b>license</b> originally used for the BSD version of Unix. The BSD <b>license</b> is a simple <b>license</b> that merely requires that all code <b>licensed</b> under the BSD <b>license</b> be <b>licensed</b> under the BSD <b>license</b> if redistributed in source code format. BSD (unlike some other <b>licenses)</b> does not require that source code be distributed at all.|$|R

5|$|In 1695 Parliament {{failed to}} renew the <b>Licensing</b> Acts, and as a result, the press were free to print {{material}} attacking the government. Although there were eight attempts to force a new <b>Licensing</b> Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite {{the freedom of the}} press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material attacking the government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public Advertiser, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield. As his letters were wildly popular, the circulation of the Public Advertiser doubled in just five months.|$|E

5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate <b>licensing</b> tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate <b>licensing</b> tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E
