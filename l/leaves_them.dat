5|$|Fourteen-year-old {{inventor}} Violet Baudelaire, her twelve-year-old brother Klaus, {{and their}} baby sister Sunny are orphaned when a fire burns down {{their house and}} kills their parents. Mr. Poe, the family's banker, manages their fortune and <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> {{in the care of}} their closest relative Count Olaf, who is only interested in obtaining their fortune despite Violet not being the legal age of eighteen to obtain it. He also forces them to work through grueling house chores and belittles them.|$|E
5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Poe <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> {{with their}} Aunt Josephine, a kindly {{woman who is}} {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E

Abi and Daniel begin to help Ste with looking after Lucas, with plans of taking Lucas to replace their own son who died. Abi starts drugging Ste as Daniel turns him against Natty, who grows suspicious of Daniel and Abi's interests. Mike finds Ste asleep whilst looking after Lucas, so takes him.

5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries to the dock and <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head to the dock to investigate.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{discovers that}} the volcano {{is being used}} by the Pyroviles to convert the human race and conquer Earth. The Doctor realises the volcano will not erupt if the energy {{converter}} is running, and tells Donna that the volcanic eruption is a fixed point in time and must always happen. The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which overloads the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply with history. However, Donna tearfully begs him to go back and at least save one person, regardless of who it is. The Doctor finally relents and goes back for Caecilius and his family. He <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> on a hill overlooking the destruction, and together with Donna slips out quietly as the family mourns Pompeii. The Doctor comments to Donna that she was right - he does need someone to stop him.|$|E

25|$|Lobsters are {{invertebrates}} {{with a hard}} protective exoskeleton. Like most arthropods, lobsters must moult to grow, which <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> vulnerable. During the moulting process, {{several species}} change colour. Lobsters have 10 walking legs; the front three pairs bear claws, {{the first of which}} are larger than the others. Although lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical like most other arthropods, some genera possess unequal, specialised claws.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{had been}} a genuine pace bowler – albeit a wayward one – as a junior cricketer, but decided, {{under the watchful eye}} of mentor John Bracewell, to {{sacrifice}} a few yards of pace for accuracy. His gentle looping swing bowling makes the batsman work hard, as the ball is less likely to speed to the boundary, and the deceptiveness of the ball's speed often <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> attempting to play the ball too early.|$|E
25|$|In The Times newspaper, {{columnist}} Martin Samuel {{described the}} show as “a tragic, self-serving procession of freaks, misfits, sad sacks and hopelessly damaged human beings” and its guests as “a collection of angry, tearful and broken people, whose inexperience of talking through painful, contentious, volatile issues <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> unprepared and inadequate for a confrontation of this nature” whilst noting that they “can only appear intellectually inferior to the host, too, with his sharp suit and well-rehearsed confidence”.|$|E

The other children had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> to open to infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Follow up trials with gene therapy on another six children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome were also reported as promising.|$|E

25|$|In {{the warmer}} summer months, common box turtles {{are more likely}} to be seen near the edges of swamps or marshlands, {{possibly}} in an effort to stay cool. If common box turtles do become too hot, (when their body temperature rises to around 32°C), they smear saliva over their legs and head; as the saliva evaporates it <b>leaves</b> <b>them</b> comfortably cooler. Similarly, the turtle may urinate on its hind limbs to cool the body parts it is unable to cover with saliva.|$|E

It is a temporary resident of rock pools when the tide is out. The female rock goby lays eggs {{on the underside of}} rocks and shells and then <b>leaves</b> <b>them.</b> The male guards the eggs until they hatch. First-year rock gobies often visit rock pools in winter when the older fish have left.|$|E
