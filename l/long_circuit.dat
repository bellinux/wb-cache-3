25|$|Although ostensibly {{retired from}} racing since 1962, Moss {{did make a}} number of one-off {{appearances}} in professional motorsport events in the following two decades. He also competed in the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz, but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, {{at the wheel of}} the Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over ⅔ of the 6.172km <b>long</b> <b>circuit</b> while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The longest {{city walls}} {{were those of}} Classical Athens. Their {{extraordinary}} length {{was due to the}} construction of the famous Long Walls which {{played a key role in}} the city's maritime strategy, by providing it with a secure access to the sea and offering the population of Attica a retreat zone in case of foreign invasions. At the eve of the Peloponnesian War (431–404BC), Thucydides gave the length of the entire circuit as follows: 43stades (7.6km) for the city walls without the southwestern section covered by others walls and 60stades (10.6km) for the circumference of the Peiraeus port. A corridor between these two was established by the northern Long Wall (40 stades or 7.1km) and the Phaleric Wall (35stades or 6.2km). Assuming a value of 177.6m for one Attic stade, the overall length of the walls of Athens thus measured about 31.6km. The structure, consisting of sun-dried bricks built on a foundation of limestone blocks, was dismantled after Athens’ defeat in 404BC, but rebuilt a decade later. Syracuse, Rome (Aurelian Walls) and Constantinople (Walls of Constantinople) were also protected by very <b>long</b> <b>circuit</b> walls.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s most North American GFCI devices {{were of the}} circuit breaker type. [...] GFCIs built into the outlet {{receptacle}} became commonplace beginning in the 1980s. The circuit breaker type, installed into a distribution panel, suffered from accidental trips mainly caused by poor or inconsistent insulation on the wiring. False trips were frequent when insulation problems were compounded by <b>long</b> <b>circuit</b> lengths. So much current leaked {{along the length of}} the conductors' insulation that the breaker might trip with the slightest increase of current imbalance. The migration to outlet receptacle based protection in North American installations reduced the accidental trips and provided obvious verification that wet areas were under electrical code-required protection. European installations continue to use primarily RCDs installed at the distribution board, which provides protection in case of damage to fixed wiring; In Europe socket-based RCDs are primarily used for retro-fitting.|$|E

Here, the track was planned to have a narrow 7.6 m uphill traversal and then circle the Old City before opening up onto a 2.2 km stretch along Neftchilar Avenue back to the start line. The circuit was projected to be the fastest street circuit in the world, with a top speed close to 360 km/h and the second <b>longest</b> <b>circuit</b> on the current F1 calendar behind the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium which currently is the <b>longest</b> <b>circuit</b> on calendar.|$|R
