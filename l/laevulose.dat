40|$|I {{studied the}} {{influence}} of insulin upon the consumption of glycogen contained in the heart muscule and of glucose or <b>laevulose</b> in the perfused liquid by the heart of Japanese toad, Bufo vulgaris japonicus and obtained following results. 1) Isolated from the body and artificially perfused heart of toad with Ringer-Locke solution, does not use of glucose or <b>laevulose</b> in the solution. 2) If added insulin in the perfused liquid, glucose in it is consumed pretty well by the heart e. g. 11. 85 mg. per gr. of heart muscle in an hour. Glycogen content in the heart always diminishes. Diminished amount of glycogen is nearly proportional to the work done by the heart. There {{is reason to believe}} that glucose in the perfused liquid turns at first to glycogen and then is able to use by the heart. 3) <b>Laevulose</b> in the perfused liquid even after adding of insulin is not used by the heart at all. Work of heart in this case always diminishes...|$|E
40|$|In {{regard to}} the heterotransplantation of the mouse sarcoma, which was {{produced}} by repeated subcutaneous injection of concentrated <b>laevulose</b> solution, into the white rat, I have confirmed the results as follows: 1) The strains of the so-called Laevulose-Sarcoma continue the active growth in the rat in about thumbtipsize during from 10 to 14 days as usual, since then, however, they are absorbed rapidly as a rule. 2) The sarcoma tissue which has grown in the rat, is able to transplant again easily to the mouse, but almost never to the rat without any treatment except the blocking. However, when it is transplanted through the method of so-called alternative transplantation (by EHRLICH) between the rat and the mouse, {{it is easy to}} repeat the generation successively. 3) Laevulose-Sarcoma, heterotransplanted into the rat, shows the identical figures with the original fibroplastic mouse sarcoma; although, comparing with the sarcoma through the homotransplantation between the mouse one another, the very obvious histological differences may be seen in the heterotransplanted sarcoma, that is the remarkable regressive changes of the sarcoma cells with active reaction in surrounding connective tissue of the host. 4) In the cases, when the sarcoma is transplanted secondly into the white rat, the results are always negative with the different consequence of the previous transplantation, except the cases of retransplantation after the exceedingly short or long time. 5) At 72 hours after the second heterotransplantation of the sarcoma, more remarkable mesenchymal reaction of the host with the regressive changes of the sarcoma cells may be seen histologically, compared with the reaction of the primary hetero- or homotransplantation 6) These histological changes, beginning from the about 10 th day after the previous transplantation, may be seen the most obvious in 2 or 3 weeks, and continue during about 1 month. since then diminish gradually. The cases of retransplantation after the long intervals show slight histological changes...|$|E
