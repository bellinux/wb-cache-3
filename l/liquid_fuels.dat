40|$|Future regulations, {{such as the}} ultra low {{emissions}} vehicle (ULEV) {{specified by}} the California Air Resources Board (CARB), are placing stricter limits on the allowable hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and make {{the understanding of the}} sources of HC emissions of considerable importance. Previous researchers have identified six sources of hydrocarbon emissions: oil layers, deposits, <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel,</b> quenching, crevices, and exhaust valve leakage. The objective of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> contribution to hydrocarbon emissions. The purpose of this work was to develop a fundamentally based description of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> transport into the engine cylinder of a port fuel injected, gasoline fueled, SI engine, and to develop a method of quantifying the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> contribution to HC emissions. To simulate the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> flow from the valve seat region into the cylinder, a specially designed injector probe was constructed and used to inject controlled amounts of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> onto the port wall close to the valve seat. By fueling the engine on a gaseous fuel, either propane or pre-vaporized Indolene, and injecting <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> close to the valve seat, we can examine the effects of liqui...|$|R
40|$|This {{computational}} {{study examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> depth on flame spread across propanol pools with and without forced, opposed air flow. The initial pool temperature is below its closed- cup flash point temperature T(sub cc); so the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> must be heated sufficiently to create a combustible mixture of fuel vapor before ignition and flame spread can occur. Furthermore, {{in order for the}} flame to spread, an approximate rule is that the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> surface temperature ahead of the flame must be heated above T(sub cc) so that a flammable mixture just above the lean limit exists ahead of the flame. The depth of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool would affect the heating of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool and thus the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> surface temperature ahead of the flame. It has been observed experimentally and numerically that, at normal gravity without forced gas-phase flow and with the initial pool temperature T(sub 0) in a range well below T(sub cc), the flame periodically accelerates and decelerates (pulsates) as it propagates. The depth of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool would change this range of T(sub 0) since it would affect the heating of the pool...|$|R
5|$|Brazil {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} mechanism of the ignition of the supersonic <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> jet by the visualization.

Moreover, the heat column and the high intensity CO 2 laser were applied to initiate the ignition. The ignition over the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> jet was visualized by a high-speed digital video camera with a shadowgraph system.

40|$|The {{conventional}} ways {{of processing}} natural gas into {{more efficient and}} economical fuels usually either have low conversion rate or low energy efficiency. In this work, a new approach of methane liquefaction is proposed. Instead of direct treatment of only natural gas, plasma activated methane is reacting with <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel.</b> In this way, methane molecules are directly incorporated onto <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> to achieve liquefaction. Nanosecond-pulsed dielectric barrier discharge and atmospheric pressure glow discharge are used here to ensure no local heating in gas bubbles. Effects of both discharges on methane reaction with <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> are investigated, mass and chemical changes in liquid are observed.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Numerical {{simulations of}} four combustion processes in a dual-fuel combustor of chemically recuperated gas turbine (CRGT) {{were carried out}} in this work. The fuels in the four combustion processes were <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel,</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> + steam, <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> + reformed gas and reformed gas, respectively. The mathematical models adopted for different fuels combustion consist of realizable k−ε turbulence model and probability density function (PDF) model. The temperature distribution, species concentrations and NO emission were obtained. The {{results show that the}} fuels can burn effectively in the dual-fuel combustor for CRGT. Compared with the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> combustor, the flame temperature, average temperature of combustor wall and NO emission are reduced by 7, 8 %, 4, 8 % and 75, 3 % respectively when the steam is injected into the combustor. However, they are reduced more when the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> is replaced by reformed gas, which are 10, 3 %, 5, 6 % and 97, 2 % respectively.
