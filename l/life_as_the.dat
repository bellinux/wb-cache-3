5|$|Harold Oliver {{was born}} to Cornish {{immigrants}} James Oliver and Sarah Mill in the gold mining town of Waukaringa. It was common for Cornish people, where mining was a key industry, to move to Australia and use their knowledge to attempt a better <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> economy in Cornwall was waning. During Oliver's childhood in the 1890s the town was home to 600 people. Today it is a ghost town.|$|E
5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating {{and continues to}} mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30 to 50years); this {{is very different from}} ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for <b>life,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E

5|$|Cyrus is a singer-songwriter {{and actress}} who starred on the Disney Channel {{television}} series Hannah Montana as Miley Stewart, {{a girl with}} a secret double <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> popstar Hannah Montana. Through the television series, Cyrus developed fame as a teen idol and released music credited to Hannah Montana. Cyrus' debut studio album, titled Meet Miley Cyrus, was released as the second disc of the Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) double-disc album. In order to promote the album, Cyrus embarked on her first tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007–08), a North American tour where she performed both under character, as Hannah Montana, and as herself. With the release of Cyrus' second studio album, Breakout (2008), her first not be affiliated with the Hannah Montana franchise, and an extended play (EP) The Time of Our Lives (2009), Cyrus decided to embark on tour again with the Wonder World Tour, however, without incorporating performances as Hannah Montana, a step which the media interpreted as furthering her distance from the Hannah Montana franchise.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{influence}} {{continued to}} affect Mari's culture during the Amorite period, which {{is evident in}} the Babylonian scribal style used in the city. However, it was less influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed, which is noticeable in the seals of kings, which reflect a clear Syrian origin. The society was a tribal one, it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads (Haneans), and in contrast to Mesopotamia, the temple had a minor role in everyday <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> power was mostly invested in the palace. Women enjoyed a relative equality to men, queen Shibtu ruled in her husband's name while he was away, and had an extensive administrative role and authority over her husband's highest officials.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s saw the {{construction}} of the Employment Exchange and the planning of the new Council House, although this was not completed until 1956. As a centre of aircraft manufacturing, Bristol was a target for bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. Bristol's city centre was severely damaged, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city. The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park featuring two bombed-out churches and fragments of the castle. A third bombed church has been given a new lease of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> St Nicholas' Church Museum. Slightly to the north, the Broadmead shopping centre was built over bomb-damaged areas. Clifton Cathedral, {{to the north of the}} city centre, was built during the early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In {{the early twentieth}} century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, who led {{for the next two}} seasons (1933–1934). In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto, and played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis from 1982 to 2009. Under manager Ron Gardenhire, the team moved to Target Field beginning in the 2010 season.|$|E

The Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.|$|E
5|$|The statue was {{donated to}} Rutgers by Dr. Fenton B. Turck {{to commemorate the}} university's Dutch heritage. Turck, with the {{assistance}} of railroad executive and Rutgers alumnus Leonor F. Loree, collaborated to arrange the anonymous donation of the statue through the Holland Society of New York. It is a statue of William I, Prince of Orange (1533-1584), an early leader of the Dutch revolt against Habsburg Spain which led to the independence of the Netherlands in 1648. The statue has continued to be included in student <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, including graduation ceremonies, pep rallies, festivals, and protests. Occasionally, the statue is a target of vandalism in an ongoing historical rivalry between students of Rutgers and Princeton University. The statue was restored in 2006 in an effort funded by alumni donations.|$|E

5|$|Written by Donald Tosh. Beginning <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Rosacrutians, {{this story}} came about after Tosh {{contacted}} the production staff in early 1968 {{to see if}} they would be interested in him pitching a script. Initial discussion saw the story begin as a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, but by the time Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had already decided to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Yousafzai {{was born}} in Mingora, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Her family came to run a chain of schools in the region. Considering Jinnah and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was {{particularly}} inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work. In early 2009, when she was 11–12, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life during the Taliban occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E

In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto. Harris and Tom Kelly are the two managers to win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly). Kelly is also the franchise leader in wins and losses, the only manager to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons). Ron Gardenhire was fired of managerial duties in October 2014, as he was replaced by Paul Molitor.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to <b>life,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E
