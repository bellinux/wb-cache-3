5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and <b>lower</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents.

40|$|Background: High <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is common}} in acute stroke and has been linked with poor outcome. Hence, outcome might be {{improved}} by <b>lowering</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> This thesis investigates the potential for glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, for <b>lowering</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in acute stroke. Methods: A systematic review was employed to clarify the relationship between outcome and BP in observational studies. Next two systematic reviews of animal studies using nitric oxide therapeutics in experimental stroke were performed to assess the effects on infarct volume and cerebral perfusion. Finally, two randomised controlled clinical trials of glyceryl trinitrate were performed in acute stroke patients to measure the systemic and cerebral haemodynamic effects. Results: In observational studies high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in acute stroke was associated with subsequent death, death or dependency, and death or deterioration. In experimental stroke nitric oxide sources and selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitors significantly reduced stroke volume. Glyceryl trinitrate lowered peripheral and central <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and increased aortic compliance when given < 48 hours from stroke. Glyceryl trinitrate did not alter quantitative measures of cerebral perfusion despite significantly <b>lowering</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> < 5 days from stroke. Conclusion: High <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is a therapeutic target in acute stroke and animal data {{support the use of}} nitric oxide sources for <b>lowering</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is feasible to use glyceryl trinitrate for this purpose since it does not compromise cerebral perfusion.

5000|$|Trimetaphan has {{a strong}} effect on the {{cardiovascular}} system. The size of blood vessels is primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.
