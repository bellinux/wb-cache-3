25|$|Zimbabwe {{had better}} <b>luck</b> <b>on</b> day two, as {{the removal of}} Gautam Gambhir fifteen balls into the morning incited a return to {{accurate}} line and length bowling. The run rate was slow for today's Test cricket, as India accumulated only 2.46 runs per over {{in the first two}} sessions, including a period of 14 overs without a single boundary. India went defensive after losing Laxman for 8, and Dravid and Ganguly ground out the runs – only for Ganguly to depart for 16 shortly before lunch, giving Mwayenga his first Test wicket. Dravid and Yuvraj Singh pushed gently onwards after the break, adding 61 in 21 overs, but the new ball, delivered from the hands of Streak and Mahwire, caused them to miss the ball often. Eventually, Streak had Yuvraj Singh bowled with a fine inswinger, and Dravid followed two balls later, clean bowled by Mahwire for 98.|$|E

25|$|In Korea he {{qualified}} tenth {{despite being}} blocked by Michael Schumacher. In a wet race he suffered heavy tyre wear on the intermediates {{that he was}} running on, and in the closing stages of the race he was passed by Robert Kubica and Vitantonio Liuzzi, dropping him to seventh place at the finish. At Interlagos he qualified a strong sixth in variable conditions with teammate Hülkenberg starting from pole position. After a delayed pitstop, his traditional bad <b>luck</b> <b>on</b> home soil returned when he suffered a puncture after briefly colliding with Jaime Alguersuari, costing him any chance of scoring points. In Abu Dhabi he again qualified strongly in seventh place, and maintained that position shortly after the start. However, when the safety car was deployed following Michael Schumacher's and Vitantonio Liuzzi's crash, many drivers like Robert Kubica, Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg took advantage of this by pitting early. This had a negative effect as they {{did not need to}} pit again, and Barrichello finished outside of the points.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, {{he led the}} Colts to a 34–28 {{win over}} the then-undefeated Seattle Seahawks {{in his first game}} against fellow sophomore quarterback Russell Wilson.

The Colts travelled to San Diego for a week 6 Monday Night Football match, the first of Luck's career. Indianapolis was dominated in time of possession and lost 19–9. In week 7, Peyton Manning made his return to Lucas Oil Stadium to play <b>Luck</b> <b>on</b> Sunday night. The Colts lead at halftime 26–14, and survived a near comeback by previously undefeated Denver to win 39–33, going into a bye week. The win also snapped Denver's 17-game regular season winning streak. Luck won his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Broncos, going 21–38 for 228 yards with 3 touchdown passes, 1 rushing touchdown, and no interceptions. After a week 8 bye, Luck engineered his tenth career 4th quarter comeback, scoring 15 points in the quarter to defeat the Houston Texans 27–24. He threw 3 touchdown passes, all to fellow sophomore Colt T. Y. Hilton, and finished with 271 yards passing with no interceptions. In week 14 of the season, the Colts won their first division championship under Luck and were the first team to clinch their division that season. The next week, Luck threw for 2 touchdowns in a 25–3 victory over the division rival Texans.|$|E
25|$|Within {{one week}} {{from the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, Heydrich issued an order to his Einsatzkommandos for the on-the-spot {{execution}} of all Bolsheviks, interpreted by the SS to mean all Jews. One of the first indiscriminate massacres of men, women, and children in Reichskommissariat Ukraine took the lives of over 4,000 Polish Jews in occupied <b>Łuck</b> <b>on</b> 2–4 July 1941, murdered by Einsatzkommando 4a assisted by the Ukrainian People's Militia. Formed officially on 20 August 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ukraine – stretching from prewar east-central Poland to Crimea – had become operational theatre of the Einsatzgruppe C. Within the Soviet Union proper, between 9 July 1941 and 19 September 1941 the city of Zhytomyr was made Judenfrei in three murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26–28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000–18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an incident in Bila Tserkva in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them in their arms during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000–15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were put to death and only 260 Jews were spared. In mid-October, during the Krivoy-Rog massacre of 4,000–5,000 Soviet Jews the entire Ukrainian auxiliary police force actively participated. In the first days of January 1942 in Kharkiv, 12,000 Jews were murdered, but smaller massacres continued in this period on daily basis in countless other locations. In August 1942 in the presence of only a few German SS men over 5,000 Jews were massacred in Polish Zofjówka by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police leading to the town's complete sweep from existence.|$|E
