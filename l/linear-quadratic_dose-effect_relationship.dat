40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} whether {{inferior rectus muscle}} (IRM) thickness, the degree of adipose change in the IRM, smoking status, and the previous history of orbital radiotherapy can predict the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> regarding unilateral IRM recession in thyroid eye disease (TED). Methods. Twenty-five patients were retrospectively reviewed. We calculated the largest IRM cross-sectional area and evaluated the degree of adipose change in the IRM using magnetic resonance imaging. The degree of adipose change and smoking status were classified using grading scales (0 – 3); previous orbital radiotherapy was graded as 0 when a history was not available and 1 when it was available. The correlation between the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> and the hypothesized predictive factors was evaluated using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} data {{concerning the}} <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> of intravenously administered amphetamine and cocaine on two widely used measures of psychomotor activation: locomotor crossover activity in neurologically intact rats, and rotational behavior in rats with a unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion.

50|$|The only <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> {{available}} {{are those}} of miners cohorts (for much higher exposures), exposed to radon. Studies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors are less informative (the exposure to radon is chronic, localized, and the ionizing radiations are alpha rays).Although low-exposed miners experienced exposures comparable to long-term residence in high-radon dwellings, the mean cumulative exposure among miners is approximately 30-fold higher than that associated with long-term residency in a typical home. Moreover, the smoking is a significant confounding factor in all miners' studies. It can be concluded from miner studies that when the radon exposure in dwellings compares to that in mines (above 1000 Bq/m3), radon is a proven health hazard; but in the 1980s very little was known on the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship,</b> both theoretically and statistical.|$|R

40|$|Arecoline and {{nicotine}} are two psychoactive cholinergic alkaloids. Arecoline {{is primarily}} a muscarinic agonist while nicotine, at low doses, is a nicotinic agonist. The experiments in this dissertation investigated two major areas: (1) the role of different factors {{in the development of}} tolerance to the behavioral effects of arecoline and nicotine, and (2) the possible mechanism and site of action of the discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of arecoline and nicotine. The role of dispositional and physiological factors comﬁared to behavioral factors in the development of tolerance to the effects of arecoline and nicotine on operant behavior was assessed in Experiments I and II, respectively. In part one of Experiment I, rats were trained to respond (M 1 a variable-interval 15 second (VI- 15) schedule for milk reinforcement. <b>Dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> were assessed prior to and during chronic arecoline (1. 74 mg/kg/day) treatment. After 21 days Of arecoline administration prior to the session, the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> for total responses was not shifted. However, the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> for total reinforcements was shifted to the right. In part two of Experiment I, rats were trained to respond on a fixed-ratio 20 (FR-ZG) schedule for milk reinforcement. <b>Dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> were assessed prior to and during chronic arecoline (0. 87 mg/kg/day) administration. One group of rats received daily injections of arecoline prior to the seSsion and a second group received arecoline injections after the session. Daily administration of arecoline resulted in a greater shift {{to the right of the}} <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> in the pre-session group compared to the post-session group. These data demonstrate the importance cﬂf behavioral factors in the development of tolerance to arecoline. In Experiment II, rats were trained to respond on a VI- 15 second schedule of milk reinforcement. <b>Dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> were determined prior to and during chronic nicotine (2. 28 mg/kg/day) administration. One group of rats received daily injections Of nicotine prior to the session, another group received nicotine injections after the session. After 36 days of chronic treatment, similar degrees of tolerance were observed in both groups, however the group receiving post-session nicotine developed tolerance at a faster rate. The data suggested that 21 complex interaction of nicotine and the experimental environment affected the rate of tolerance development. Experiment III characterized the DS effect of arecoline. Using a two-lever operant paradigm, rats were trained to discriminate arecoline from saline on a VI- 12 second schedule of milk reinforcement. Rats could learn to discriminate 1. 74 mg/kg arecoline from saline, but not 0. 58 mg/kg from saline. Agonist and antagonist studies demonStrated that the DS effect of arecoline is mediated through central muscarinic receptors. In Experiment IV, the ability of physostigmine to interact ﬁith the DS effect of nicotine (1. 14 mg/kg) and arecoline (1. 74 mg/kg) was assessed. Physostigmine (0. 125 mg/kg) pretreatment shifted the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationship</b> for arecoline to the left but did not affect that of nicotine. Physostigmine (0. 25 mg/kg) almost completely generalized to the DS effect of arecoline but not to the DS effect of nicotine. These data suggest an interaction of endogenous acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors but not with nicotinic receptors. In Experiment V, the ability hf arecoline and nicotine injected directly into the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) to generalize to the DS effect of peripherally administered arecoline (1. 74 mg/kg) and nicotine (1. 14 mg/kg) was assessed; Nicotine injected into these sites generalized in a dose-related manner to nicotine. The MRF was slightly more sensitive than the DH. Arecoline injected into either site did not generalize to the DS effect of, peripherally administered arecoline.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{delineate}} the individual pelvic floor muscles {{considered to be}} involved in anorectal toxicity and to investigate <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for fecal incontinence-related complaints after prostate radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 48 patients treated for localized prostate cancer, the internal anal sphincter (IAS) muscle, the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle, the puborectalis muscle (PRM), and the levator ani muscles (LAM) in addition to the anal wall (Awall) and rectal wall (Rwall) were retrospectively delineated on planning computed tomography scans. Dose parameters were obtained and compared between patients with and without fecal urgency, incontinence, and frequency. Dose-effect curves were constructed. Finally, the effect of an endorectal balloon, which was applied in 28 patients, was investigated. RESULTS: The total volume of the pelvic floor muscles together was about three times that of the Awall. The PRM was exposed to the highest RT dose, whereas the EAS received the lowest dose. Several anal and rectal dose parameters, as well as doses to all separate pelvic floor muscles, were associated with urgency, while incontinence was associated mainly with doses to the EAS and PRM. Based on the dose-effect curves, the following constraints regarding mean doses could be deduced {{to reduce the risk of}} urgency: </= 30 Gy to the IAS; </= 10 Gy to the EAS; </= 50 Gy to the PRM; and </= 40 Gy to the LAM. No <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for frequency were observed. Patients treated with an endorectal balloon reported significantly less urgency and incontinence, while their treatment plans showed significantly lower doses to the Awall, Rwall, and all pelvic floor muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Incontinence-related complaints show specific <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> to individual pelvic floor muscles.

Individual CRT doses were converted into the equivalent dose in 2 -Gy fractions (EQD(2)). Survivors had received their diagnoses between 1966 and 1996 and survived at least 5 years after diagnosis. A complete inventory of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3. 0 AEs was available from our hospital-based late-effect follow-up program. We used multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses to examine the EQD(2) in relation to the prevalence and severity of AEs, correcting for sex, age at diagnosis, follow-up time, and the treatment-related risk factors surgery and chemotherapy. There was a high prevalence of AEs in the CRT group; over 80 % of survivors had more than 1 AE, and almost half had at least 5 AEs, both representing significant increases in number of AEs compared with survivors not treated with CRT. Additionally, the proportion of severe, life-threatening, or disabling AEs was significantly higher in the CRT group. The most frequent AEs were alopecia and cognitive, endocrine, metabolic, and neurologic events. Using the EQD(2), we found significant <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> for these and other AEs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{function}} of A 1 - and A 2 a-adenosine receptors {{in the control}} of vascular resistance and in the modulation of light-evoked neuronal activity was investigated in the isolated perfused cat eye. The A 1 agonist CCPA, the A 1 antagonist CPT, the A 2 a agonist CGS 21680 and the A 2 antagonist DMPX were used. The agents were applied intra-arterially at concentrations in the low nanomolar to micromolar range during rod-selective photic stimulation. The flow rate of perfusate, reflecting vascular resistance and the light-evoked optic nerve response (ONR) were recorded. Our results show a vasodilating effect of both A 1 and A 2 agonists and a vasoconstricting effect of the respective antagonists. The <b>dose-effect</b> <b>relationships</b> are suggestive, however, of an A 2 a receptor-mediated mechanism. The amplitude of the ONR-ON component was decreased during application of both adenosine-agonists. Analysis of the <b>dose–effect</b> <b>relationships</b> and the blockade of the CCPA-induced decrease by CPT suggests that inhibition is mediated by A 1 receptors. However, CGS 21680 -mediated inhibition cannot be explained by unspecific binding at A 1 receptors alone and suggests the involvement of inhibitory A 2 a receptors...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Telomeres {{are complex}} DNA–protein {{structures}} {{located at the}} end of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomere length shortens with age in all replicating somatic cells. It has been shown that tobacco smoking enhances telomere shortening in circulating lymphocytes. The present study investigated whether this effect was further amplified in smokers who develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Telomere length was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridisation in circulating lymphocytes harvested from 26 never-smokers, 24 smokers with normal lung function and 26 smokers with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction (forced expiratory flow in one second 48 ¡ 4 % predicted). In contrast to never-smokers, telomere length significantly decreased with age in smokers. There was also a <b>dose–effect</b> <b>relationship</b> between the cumulative long-life exposure to tobacco smoking (pack-yrs) and telomere length.
