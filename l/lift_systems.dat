5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through the roofs of the warehouses. Later improvements to loading included the use of <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> to raise the blocks of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using horse power, then steam power; the largest warehouses later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing the equipment to support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. Warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|E
25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical <b>lift</b> <b>systems,</b> this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Holding {{the work}} piece for the forging press is the main task of the forging manipulator, and it is {{recognized}} as one of industry’s most arduous tasks. To ensure the safety of the manipulator mechanism, the resistance force exerted on the clamp must be minimized [1]. This paper focuses on the vertical load analysis of <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> for the forging manipulator when it works in cooperation with the forging press. First the equivalent stiffness model of {{the work piece}} is presented and the loads of the <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> are derived. Then the hydraulic circuits of the front and the rear <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated. Finally, the whole forging process is analyzed to study the relationship between the tracking error of the <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> and the resistance force on them. Simulation of one typical forging process shows that the cause of resistance force on the <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is the displacement tracking error...|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV <b>lift</b> <b>systems,</b> {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> These projector <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the projector ceiling light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector lift system is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. Projector ceiling <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design the water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> which is of human operated. In all over the world there are various types of water <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> currently in use. Some are electrically operated and some of them are mechanically operated and some are still traditional way of system. In India there are some basic types of water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> still in use such as Hand Pump, rope well. It can be use in everywhere but it need more manual power. Now electrically water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is also in use. But drawback is electricity is costly and hence not efficient to use. Some of manual operated system is use like Traddle Pump and many other types of system using, but the design of this system is more critical and maintainance cost is high. The many water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is not portable and does not reach the maximum height and also the rate of discharge is less. Other drawback is it is not easily availability of the spare parts once get damaged.
