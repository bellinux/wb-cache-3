40|$|Throughout the 1990 s, {{the labour}} market has shown an {{unfavourable}} development, with unemployment noticeably on the increase. Until 1997, {{the main reasons}} underlying this development were a relatively low average rate of economic growth, the 1993 recession, and strong productivity increases in the private sector. In 1997 - 98, however, unemployment continued to rise despite a favourable economic development. This was due, above all, to the substantially increased labour supply (shortened period of entitlement to parental <b>leave</b> <b>allowance,</b> a more restrictive policy regarding early retirement), the emphasis on part-time employment in the service sector, as well as staff cuts (public sector) and restructuring measures (headquarters of large industrial and service enterprises) in Vienna.

30|$|Any employee, {{after being}} in service for one year, {{has the right to}} apply for parental leave without pay before any of his/her {{children}} reach the age of three years old; the period of this leave is limited to two years (GEEA, § 16). After the expiration of the parental leave, employees may apply for reinstatement, and employers may not reject such applications (GEEA, § 17). Furthermore, according to the «Employment Insurance Act (EIA)», an insured employee (per parent) on parental leave without pay shall be given an allowance for up to six months per child. The amount of this remuneration is 60 % of the insured person’s monthly earnings. If both parents are covered by employment insurance, they may apply for the parental <b>leave</b> <b>allowance</b> separately and not at the same time. In the event that there are two or more children requiring care at the same time, the allowance prescribed in the preceding paragraph shall be granted for one child only (EIA, § 19 – 25).|$|E
40|$|The {{unfavourable}} {{development of}} the Austrian labour market in the 1990 s is attributable {{to a number of}} macro-economic factors. The rise of unemployment {{is a reflection of the}} relatively low average rate of economic growth and the 1993 recession. The productivity of labour increased at an accelerated pace in the course of Austria's growing integration with the economies of Western and Eastern Europe. Unemployment failed to decline even during the period of relative boom in 1997 - 98. This development is due, above all, to the following causes: • increased supply of labour as a result of the shortened period of entitlement to parental <b>leave</b> <b>allowance,</b> and a more restrictive policy with regard to early retirement; • the rate of unemployment has not reacted noticeably to high employment growth in the service sector, because the quality of the new jobs created fails to meet the expectations of the unemployed in terms of working hours and wages. (Many part-time jobs have been created in retail trade and other service sectors, but the majority of job-seekers are looking for full-time employment.) • A persistently high rate of unemployment in Vienna, a region particularly affected by staff cuts in the public sector, restructuring measures taken by major industrial and service enterprises and subsequent relocation, and a high share of private-sector service enterprises. The rise of unemployment between 1996 and 1998 was most pronounced in three areas: higher age groups, women, and Vienna. It should not, however, be taken as an indication of a general deterioration of the labour-market situation: finding a job was certainly easier in 1998 than before, as is indicated not only by the development of employment, but also by the number of vacant jobs. The rise of unemployment was due, above all, to institutional factors. Cuts of special support measures and a more restrictive policy with regard to early retirement meant that older job-seekers remained on record as unemployed, instead of retiring from working life. At the same time, the shortened period of entitlement to parental <b>leave</b> <b>allowance</b> resulted in a strong increase in the number of women wanting to re-enter the labour market. Hence, the rise of unemployment in 1997 and 1998 is primarily attributable to the fact that beneficiaries of social services, whose availability to the labour market is very limited or non-existent, have become more highly dependent on unemployment benefits for their subsistence since the adoption of the "austerity package". The impact on unemployment figures has been largely statistical in nature and can therefore be qualified as a form of "re-labelling".

There is a need for base broadening combined with lower rates throughout the system, including VAT. The tax wedge on labour is high, except at the bottom of the wage distribution, which can reduce worker participation and job offers. Greater neutrality both across different capital asset classes but also within specific taxes, and shifting taxes from labour and capital inputs to environmental and property taxes would improve economic outcomes. Likewise, the system of social and family benefits should be simplified to enhance transparency and consistency. Eliminating schemes that let people leave the labour market early, abolishing the pension privileges of specific occupational groups and internalising the costs of survivors 2 ̆ 019 pension benefits would increase fairness while at the same time generating savings.

40|$|Abstract In 2005, Scotland {{became the}} first nation to make {{breastfeeding}} in public a legal right, but current breastfeeding targets and maternity <b>leave</b> <b>allowance</b> do not acknowledge the conflicting demands women face when juggling employment and otherhood. This paper explores how employment and maternity leave relate to breastfeeding duration among mothers in Scotland. The Growing Up in Scotland national longitudinal cohort study of 5, 217 babies born in 2004 – 2005 was used. Multivariate proportional hazards regression models were specified using one cross-sectional wave of data to predict breastfeeding duration. Mothers working as employees, full-time (Hazard Ratio 1. 6) or part-time (HR 1. 3), had {{a higher risk of}} earlier breastfeeding cessation than non-working mothers. However, self-employed mothers did not differ significantly from non-working mothers in their breastfeeding patterns. Mothers who took longer maternity leave breastfed for longer. The relationships between employment, maternity leave and breastfeeding duration were significant when controlling for known predictors of breastfeeding. Younger mothers, those with less formal education, single mothers, those of white ethnic background, and first-time mothers were more likely to stop breastfeeding sooner, as has been noted in previous research. Employment and early return to work are both factors associated with a shorter duration of breastfeeding. More flexible working conditions and more generous employment leave could help to prolong breastfeeding among working mothers. Current health and employment policy in Scotland and the UK could be better coordinated so that working mothers have the adequate support to meet the conflicting demands of employment and motherhood...|$|E

Consequently, this study investigated the effects of Incentive Package {{on the performance of}} secondary school teachers in Shinyanga Municipality. Specifically the study sought to find out whether motivation of teachers had any effects on their morale to perform. A case study research design was adapted where a total sample of 88 respondents including secondary school teachers, headmasters/mistresses and district secondary school officer. The primary data was collected using structured questionnaires for teachers, and headmasters/mistresses as well as key informant interview guide for DSSEO and headmasters/mistresses. Observation of secondary schools compound and schools infrastructures was also held. Consequently, both qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Research findings revealed that: Teacher’s salary earn per month were inadequacy to meet their basic needs; therefore salary was insufficient to motivate teachers and increase their morale to perform efficiently. In addition, fringe benefits were given rarely with favouritism to secondary schools teachers; something that demoralized teachers. On the other hand teaching and learning resources were available in most secondary schools in Shinyanga Municipality except libraries, laboratories computer and internet services. In order to improve teacher’s incentive and performance at work the study recommended; increase in the salary of secondary schools teachers to match the increased cost of living. In addition, teachers in secondary schools should be provided with fringe benefits like; teaching allowance, <b>leave</b> <b>allowance,</b> house allowance and the likes.

40|$|Background: The social {{environment}} {{is a fundamental}} determinant of early child development and, in turn, early child development is a determinant of health, well-being, and learning skills across the life course. Redistributive policies aimed at reducing social inequalities, such as a welfare state and labour market policies, have shown a positive association with selected health indicators. In this study, we investigated the influence of redistributive policies specifically on the {{social environment}} of early child development in five countries with different political traditions. The objective of this analysis was to highlight similarities and differences in social and health services between the countries and their associations with other health outcomes that can inform better global early child development policies and improve early child health and development. Methods: Four social determinants of early child development were selected to provide a cross-section of key time periods in a child's life from prenatal to kindergarten. They included: 1) prenatal care, 2) maternal leave, 3) child health care, and 4) child care and early childhood education. We searched international databases and reports (e. g. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank, and UNICEF) to obtain information about early child development policies, services and outcomes. Results: Although a comparative analysis cannot claim causation, our analysis suggests that redistributive policies aimed at reducing social inequalities {{are associated with a}} positive influence on the social determinants of early child development. Generous redistributive policies are associated with a higher maternal <b>leave</b> <b>allowance</b> and pay and more preventive child healthcare visits. A decreasing trend in infant mortality, low birth weight rate, and under five mortality rate were observed with an increase in redistributive policies. No clear influence of redistributive policies was observed on breastfeeding and immunization rates. In the analysis of child care and early education, the lack of uniform measures of early child development outcomes was apparent. Conclusions: This paper provides further support for an association between redistributive policies and early child health and development outcomes, along with the organization of early child health and development services...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how tourists might reduce their travel distances by better understanding their perception and "performance" of distances to destinations. Travel accounts for 75 % of tourism's GHG emissions, the majority from flying. Tourist travel distances are growing rapidly, as are emissions, with little evidence of the reductions required to comply with emission reduction targets. This research used discourse analysis of in-depth interviews with Danish tourists to explore how they understand distance. Respondents rarely referred to physical distance (e. g. kilometres), but instead to scales including cost, time and cultural difference to express relative distances. Some distances were seen as "zonal", (e. g. "away from home" or "sun and sea" or winter sports destinations), others "ordinal", having degrees of difference, time or costs to cross. The desire for distance also resulted from links tourists make between physical distance and reaching cultural dissimilarity. Sometimes travel itself was integral with the holiday experience. While cost and time savings were important, the total holiday price {{was more important than}} the journey price. Measures are suggested for reducing the distances travelled and changing the modes used, and so reducing environmental impacts, including changing <b>leave</b> <b>allowances,</b> better marketing of nearby destinations with cultural differences, and promoting slow travel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

The social environment is considered a fundamental determinant of early child development. In our study countries with generous redistributive policies had a better organization of early child development services such as higher maternal <b>leave</b> <b>allowances</b> and more preventive child healthcare visits. The importance of screening and surveillance for developmental problems in children is widely recognized. In our study we examined two instruments used in pediatric primary care to identify developmental and behavioural problems. First, we examined the validity the Nipissing District Developmental Screen (NDDS) to identify communication problems in infants. We demonstrated that the NDDS did not have adequate psychometric characteristics and therefore {{the use of the}} 18 -month NDDS cannot be supported in pediatric primary care. Second, we investigated {{the reliability and validity of}} the teacher’s version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-T) to identify emotional and behavioral problems by teachers. Obtaining teacher’s SDQ ratings is valuable because this can be of help in the management of these problems. Our research demonstrated that the SDQ-T is a reliable and valid instrument to identify emotional and behavioral problems in primary school children and in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). Teacher ratings indicated a higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems in children with DCD compared with their peers. In conclusion, the use of the SDQ-T can be supported in pediatric primary care...|$|R

Method: 153 individuals, sick-listed or on allowances, participated in a 4 -week inpatient occupational rehabilitation program. 132 (86 %) answered a questionnaire on assessments of work, sick <b>leave,</b> and <b>allowances</b> three months after completed rehabilitation. Self-reported data were compared with register data from NAV according to four categories: working, sick-listed, on medical/vocational rehabilitation allowance or disability pension. Agreement between self-reported and register data was evaluated in cross-tabulations and reported with kappa values. Stratified analyses were done for gender, age, education, medical diagnosis and length of sick leave/allowances at baseline. Results: Good agreement was found for medical/vocational rehabilitation allowance (kappa=. 70) and disability pension (kappa=. 65). Moderate agreement was found for working (kappa=. 49) and fair agreement for sick-listed (kappa=. 36). Stratified analyses showed significant better kappa values for individuals that had been sick-listed less than 12 months before entering the rehabilitation program. Conclusions: Agreements from good to fair were found between self-reported and official register data on sick leave. However, official register data is preferred in research because this will ensure complete data sets.

50|$|A {{number of}} factors caused the {{increased}} frequency of divorce. One was that an increasingly secularized society viewed marriage, more often than before, as an arrangement that could be ended {{if it did not}} satisfy its partners.
