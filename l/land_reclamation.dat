5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top {{of centuries}} of prehistoric {{alluvial}} deposits built by {{the waters of the}} Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E
5|$|By 1845, {{the seven}} islands {{coalesced}} {{into a single}} landmass by the Hornby Vellard project via large scale <b>land</b> <b>reclamation.</b> On 16 April 1853, India's first passenger railway line was established, connecting Bombay to the neighbouring town of Thana (now Thane). During the American Civil War (1861â€“1865), the city became the world's chief cotton-trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy that subsequently enhanced the city's stature.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent <b>land</b> <b>reclamations</b> as {{a result}} of urban {{development}} have moved the Immigration Depot's location further inland. The Caudan Waterfront, a marina being developed as an economic and tourist center, is situated beyond the site.|$|R

50|$|As ships grew larger, the Royal Fleet {{moved to}} Bremerholm and, in turn, to Nyholm {{which was created}} in the 1680s by a series of <b>land</b> <b>reclamations</b> north of Christianshavn {{on the other side of}} the main harbour.|$|R
5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and tall buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2007, {{the pier}} was closed by the {{government}} to enable <b>land</b> <b>reclamation,</b> soon after the adjacent Star Ferry pier was closed. There was fierce opposition by conservationists, who carried over their campaign to preserve the landmark. Police officers evicted some 30 protesters from the site on 1 August 2007; activists filed for a judicial review, and the High Court hearing began on 7 August. On 10 August, the court dismissed the request.|$|E
5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through <b>land</b> <b>{{reclamation}}</b> by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects {{in the middle of the}} century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E

Following the conclusion of hostilities, {{he served as}} chief engineer of the Military Division of the Pacific, making him the head engineer for every military construction project on the West Coast. In later years, he persuaded the U.S. government to acquire Pearl Harbor from the Kingdom of Hawaii and supervised numerous irrigation and <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> projects in California's central valley. He died on December 15, 1878, in San Francisco, California.|$|E
5|$|The Spratly Islands are disputed by {{many states}} in the area, and {{a large portion of}} the South China Sea is claimed by China. Unlike its {{neighbours}} of Vietnam and the Philippines, Malaysia historically avoided conflicts with China. However, after the enroachment of Chinese ships in Malaysian territorial waters, Malaysia has become active in condemning China. Brunei and Malaysia in 2009 announced an end to claims of each other's land, and committed to resolve issues related to their maritime borders. The Philippines has a dormant claim to the eastern part of Sabah. Singapore's <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> has caused tensions, and minor maritime and land border disputes exist with Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with his}} wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only {{restored}} the palace, {{but from the}} 1970s also made it the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was to lessen Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved <b>land</b> <b>reclamation,</b> {{the development of new}} beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 16th century <b>land</b> <b>reclamations</b> annexed the island to Zealand and in 1510, under the reign of Hans of Denmark, a naval shipyard was established in the area. A ropewalk at the site is first mentioned in 1555 and an anchor forge was built in 1563.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the reign}} of Frederick III, Holmen was {{established}} {{through a series of}} <b>land</b> <b>reclamations</b> to replace the naval base and shipyard at Bremerholm. The first ship to be set to sea from Nyholm was Dannebrog in 1692 and in the following years the construction of all major vessels gradually moved there. The facilities at Holmen were constantly expanded over the next centuries.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of the Sinai. This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt's Armed Forces were not ready for a <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> war before some five to ten years. Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.|$|E
5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon forgotten in the ensuing decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of public {{concerns}} following the cholera epidemic and {{the findings of the}} Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London. Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or {{were in the process of}} opening, and temporarily became London's main burial grounds. A proposal by Francis Seymour Haden to ship the bodies of London's dead to the Thames Estuary for use in <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> met with little approval, and the government sought alternative means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds.|$|E

5000|$|Both Kalvebod Brygge and {{the railway}} terrain, which {{separates}} {{the area from}} the rest of Vesterbro, are located on reclaimed land. The coast south of Copenhagen was formerly known as Kalvebod Beach. The first <b>land</b> <b>reclamations</b> took place as early as 1755 when the area just outside the West Rampart's Rysensten Bastion was used for establishment of lumberyards. TÃ¸mmergraven (The Timber Dock) was later dug out.|$|R
5|$|Since Roman times, silting and <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in the Pevensey Levels {{have pushed}} the {{coastline}} out by about , leaving the castle landlocked. The land between the castle and the sea is now a flat marshland drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated mostly {{to the east of}} the castle, {{at the end of the}} ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages. An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now marshland and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Young Macedonian {{men were}} {{typically}} expected {{to engage in}} hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their transhumance lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, <b>land</b> <b>reclamation,</b> and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle {{during the course of}} the 5thcenturyBC.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century, Homebush Bay {{became a}} centre of heavy industry, with large scale <b>land</b> <b>reclamations</b> to {{accommodate}} industrial facilities. When industrial operations scaled down, the bay became a dumping {{ground for a}} large range of unwanted material - from waste to broken up ships, even toxic industrial waste. Union Carbide had manufactured chemicals, including Agent Orange, on the site and dioxins produced as a by product were buried in landfill or left in drums.|$|R
