40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} of foreign currency borrowing by small firms, using {{information on the}} most recent loan extended to 3101 firms in 25 transition countries between 2002 and 2005. Our results suggest that foreign currency borrowing is much stronger related to firm-level foreign currency revenues {{than it is to}} country-level interest rate differentials. Supporting the conclusion that carry-trade behavior is not the key driver of foreign currency borrowing in our sample we find no evidence that firm-level indicators of distress costs or financial transparency affect <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> <b>denomination.</b> Overall, our findings suggest that retail clients which do take foreign currency loans are better equipped to bear the corresponding currency risks than is commonly thought. Policy makers should therefore {{take a closer look at}} the characteristics of borrowers before implementing regulations which are aimed at curbing foreign currency loans.

40|$|Consumer {{response}} to price is often subjective {{and prone to}} systematic perceptual biases, such as the “face value” effect, whereby consumer perceptions of willingness to pay are systematically biased by the nominal value of a new currency. That is, prices presented in higher <b>denomination</b> <b>currencies</b> {{are perceived to be}} more expensive and prices presented in lower <b>denomination</b> <b>currencies</b> are perceived to be less expensive. The results from two separate experiments suggest that for high-price products, when a substantial enough discount is invoked, the face value effect can reverse and becomes a double-edged sword. While existing research implies that the face value effect becomes stronger for high-price products, the findings from this research suggest this is the case only when the product is not being promoted. The findings also reveal that the face value effect is robust for low-price products, even when there is a discount, providing further evidence of the effect in new contexts. Consistent with earlier research, this is because in real terms the discount for a low-price product is not perceived as substantial enough. The experiments also suggest that for high-price products, discounts framed as absolute amounts in higher <b>denomination</b> <b>currencies</b> are perceived to be more substantial than discounts framed as percentage amounts. These findings extend existing theory on the face value effect and have several important managerial implications for pricing management in international markets...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of inflationary trends, {{which has been}} a macroeconomic concern in Nigeria over the last decade, is considered to be very hazardous to the aggregate economic activity of any country. In order to determine the practical effect of higher currency note introduction on the Nigerian economy, an empirical investigation on the casualty between inflation, <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> fiscal deficit and broad money supply was carried out using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model (Forecast Variance and Impulse Response) model. Time series data of 1980 to 2014 were employed and the results confirm {{that in the long run}} there is a relationship between inflation, <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> fiscal deficit and broad money supply. The Cholesky ordering (<b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> inflation, fiscal deficit and broad money supply) is used in the VAR estimates, which indicates that the shocks in <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> affect the other variables and result to inflation. It is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government should implement inflation management policies and also ensure that lower currency notes in circulation are more than higher currency notes in circulation...|$|R

25|$|Small <b>denomination</b> <b>currency</b> and {{particularly}} coins are sometimes {{difficult to come}} by in Argentina, especially in Buenos Aires. The problem has developed to a stage in which some shop owners will not sell items if the transaction involves giving the purchaser change in coins. It has also been exacerbated by ATMs, which tend to give out only 100 peso notes, and by bus companies, some of which will take only coins in payment and sell these at a 5–10% markup {{on the black market}} rather than depositing them at banks. This situation has improved in the years following the Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002). Nowadays nearly all bus lines in Buenos Aires have a SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico; Unified Electronic Ticket System) smartcard reader, allowing passengers to pay electronically without coins.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the cent should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons including that many Americans do not actually spend them, but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to return them to a bank for higher <b>denomination</b> <b>currencies,</b> or cash them in at coin counting kiosks. Most modern vending machines do not accept pennies, further diminishing their utility, and the production cost (figured in U.S. Dollars) now exceeds the face value of the coin, caused by increasing inflation. In 2001 and 2006, for example, United States Representative Jim Kolbe (R) of Arizona introduced bills which would have stopped production of pennies (in 2001, the Legal Tender Modernization Act, and in 2006, the Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation [...] Act).|$|R
50|$|Foreign {{exchange}} risk (also {{known as}} FX risk, {{exchange rate risk}} or currency risk) is a financial risk that exists when a financial transaction is denominated in a currency other {{than that of the}} base currency of the company. Foreign exchange risk also exists when the foreign subsidiary of a firm maintains financial statements in a currency other than the reporting currency of the consolidated entity. The risk is that there may be an adverse movement in the exchange rate of the <b>denomination</b> <b>currency</b> in relation to the base currency before the date when the transaction is completed. Investors and businesses exporting or importing goods and services or making foreign investments have an exchange rate risk which can have severe financial consequences; but steps can be taken to manage (i.e., reduce) the risk.|$|R
