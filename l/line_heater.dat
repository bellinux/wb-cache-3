40|$|A {{thermal shock}} test {{facility}} is {{designed and built}} to enable a copper model slag tap component to be tested under cyclic thermal loading conditions. Infra-red <b>line</b> <b>heaters</b> and pumped cooling water are used to impose temperature loading cycles on to the specimen. Accurate focussing of the <b>line</b> <b>heaters</b> using a two degree of freedom adjustment mechanism, enables a heating area of width 3 mm {{to be applied to}} the specimen. Both the heating and the cooling processes are controlled by a proportional, integral, and derivative feedback micro-processor controller. Specimen temperature fields are obtained using thermocouples, and specimen displacements and strains are measured using linear voltage displacement transducers and strain gauges. A cyclic thermal loading test is carried out for approximately 7150 cycles on a model slag tap component. The variations of specimen strains and displacements are recorded and compared with results obtained from a finite element viscoplastic damage analysis. Good agreement between the predicted and experimental results is obtained. Microstructural examination of the specimen reveals the development of persistent slip bands and micro-cracking at grain boundaries. This occurs at the regions of the specimen undergoing cyclic plasticity due to the imposed cyclic thermal loading. The experimental observations of cyclic plasticity damage formation in copper undergoing cyclic thermal loading indicates the suitability of the Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) theory to model the evolution of cyclic plasticity damage. The damage is characterized by the development of fields of micro-cracked grain boundaries due to the formation and interaction of persistent slip bands within the grains. ...|$|R

The degree of quasiballistic transport is characterized by the effective thermal conductivities of the substrate which are obtained by matching the diffusion solutions to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation results. We find that while the ballistic heat conduction effect based on the peak temperature diminishes as the two heaters become closer, it becomes stronger based on the peak-valley temperature difference. Our results also show that the collective behavior of closely spaced heaters can counteract the nonlocal effects caused by an isolated nanoscale hot spot.

There were considered five types of plants beginning from the  simplest  one  up  to  the  most  complex  in  two  variants,  when  the  heat  exchangers and machines are perfect (ideal) and when equipment has the known degree of efficiency (perfection) : 1) water-heat boiler station, working on organic fuel; 2) electrical boiler station, obtaining energy on power transmission lines from condensing power station; 3) <b>line</b> <b>heater</b> of TPP, obtaining steam from heating turbine; 4) <b>line</b> <b>heater</b> CPP, powered by steam from pressure reducing unit; 5) heat pump, producing energy on power supply lines from TPP. In this article were investigated three ideal reversible ways of transformation of   high- grade heat into low-grade heat with a help of decreasing and increasing and combined (suggested by the authors) heat transformers and their thermodynamic equivalence was shown in this article. And there were suggested universal installation for electric energy generation, cold and heat of two grades for heat-water supply and the heating process on the base of gas compressors   gas turbines. These results are so important (actual) for power engineers of the countries with  increasing consumption  of organic  fuel and  its enhancement in  value and realizing programs of energy saving. The analysis shows, that the quality of produced low-grade heat per unit of used high-grade heat for ideal plants (installations) is: electrical boiler unit – 0. 7;  water boiler unit – 1. 0; for heat pump, heating turbine, combined heat transformers   – 4. 9. Increasing of quality of high-grade heat does not break the Law of Thermodynamics, just on the contrary, thank this the constant heat efficiency is remained. Conversion ratio for real variants of these plants are: 0. 415; 0. 9; 1. 53; 2. 8; 1. 47. Thus, it is once more proved, that TPP is the most efficient source of heat for heating process and stands head above electrical boiler unit in 7 times, above plants with heat pumps in 2 times. Universal electric power plant is comparable in effi- ciency with heat pump system, but outperforms it due to its multi-functionality. </p...|$|E

The proposed evaporative cooling system utilizes the air humidity for cooling in humid areas and requires no additional water supply.

The proposed method, i. e., the pre-drilling thermal needle probe method, was verified by finite element calculations and laboratory experiments by varying various parameters, such as the pre-drilled hole diameter, probe diameter, and thermal conductivity of thermal grease. It was observed that increases in the pre-drilled hole diameter and probe diameter and a decrease in the thermal conductivity of the thermal grease caused delays in temperature increase owing to the slowed heat transfer.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center is {{sponsoring}} {{efforts to develop}} advanced monopropellant technology. The {{focus has been on}} monopropellant formulations composed of an aqueous solution of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) and a fuel component. HAN-based monopropellants do not have a toxic vapor and do not need the extraordinary procedures for storage, handling, and disposal required of hydrazine (N 2 H 4). Generically, HAN-based monopropellants are denser and have lower freezing points than N 2 H 4. The performance of HAN-based monopropellants depends on the selection of fuel, the HAN-to-fuel ratio, and the amount of water in the formulation. HAN-based monopropellants are not seen as a replacement for N 2 H 4 per se, but rather as a propulsion option in their own right. For example, HAN-based monopropellants would prove beneficial to the orbit insertion of small, power-limited satellites because of this propellant's high performance (reduced system mass), high density (reduced system volume), and low freezing point (elimination of tank and <b>line</b> <b>heaters).</b> Under a Glenn-contracted effort, Aerojet Redmond Rocket Center conducted testing to provide the foundation for the development of monopropellant thrusters with an I(sub sp) goal of 250 sec.

30|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} of the freestanding {{thin film}} specimen {{is measured by}} a direct steady state technique that involves the temperature gradient {{along the length of}} the specimen and the heat flux while the specimen when it is heated by a microheater. The thin film metal <b>heater</b> <b>line</b> is also freestanding and is perpendicular to the specimen as shown in Figure[*] 1. Thermal conductivity measurement process starts with the passage of direct current, typically 4 - 10 [*]mA, through the aluminum metal line. It produces a parabolic temperature profile in the freestanding part of the <b>heater</b> <b>line</b> due to the Joule heating and develops the maximum temperature region in the intersection of aluminum heater and silicon nitride specimen. The temperature profiles along the length of heater and specimen are mapped by using an infrared microscope (Quantum Focus Instruments, MWIR- 512 InSb IR FPA camera) with 0.1 [*]K temperature and 2 [*]μm spatial resolution. The measured temperature profile of the specimen is used to calibrate a finite element model of the device. After such calibration, the heat flux from the aluminum heater to the nitride specimen and the thermal conductivity of the specimen can be calculated by finite element analysis. We used COMSOL Multiphysics™ to carry out the finite element simulations. First, <b>heater</b> <b>line</b> is modeled by using known input parameters, such as heat transfer coefficient through that air; electrical resistivity, temperature coefficient of resistance and thermal conductivity of heater material. The temperature profile of heater thus obtained from the simulation is found in very good agreement with the measured temperature profile by IR microscope. Then heat flux values from heater to specimen for different input currents are obtained from the simulation results. These heat flux values are then used with the temperature gradient in the specimen to obtain thermal conductivity using the Fourier’s law. Further details of the procedure is given in reference [16].|$|R
