5|$|In 168 BC, the <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> {{rate was}} reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming household's crop yield to one-thirtieth, {{and later to}} a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty. The {{consequent}} loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes.|$|E
50|$|By 1982 only 5% {{of total}} <b>land</b> value was <b>taxed,</b> and <b>land</b> <b>taxes</b> were also {{thought to be}} duplicative due to their {{similarity}} to local authority property rate levies, with property taxes making up 57% of local government income by 2001.|$|R
40|$|New Zealand {{is unusual}} in that nearly 60 % of local {{services}} are funded from property taxes. These are a mixture of <b>land</b> <b>taxes,</b> capital value taxes, annual rental value taxes and uniform general charges. We explore the efficiency and equity of this system at both national and local levels. We find that the national property tax base is large relative to spending needs but that the variance in per capita tax bases across territorial local authorities is probably greater than is efficient or equitable. We find that <b>land</b> <b>taxes</b> are more progressive than capital value taxes. Our research also addresses local authorities' ability to provide services as their property tax base changes {{as a result of}} external economic shocks. We consider the occurrence of and responses to "fiscal stress" in a system of local government that is heavily dependent on property taxation. We provide some examples of the wide range of actual responses by local councils faced with similar population changes. Finally, we offer some tentative conclusions and implications both for New Zealand local public finance and for the use of property <b>taxes,</b> and particularly <b>land</b> <b>taxes,</b> more broadly.

5|$|The king {{determined}} the tax levels based on need and circumstances {{in the kingdom}} while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. The <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Under Henry's son, King Richard I, a new <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> was collected, {{the first}} since 1162. It was {{organised}} by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England {{who was in charge}} of governing England while the king was gone. Like the geld, the carucage was based on the amount of land owned, thus targeting free men rather than serfs, who owned no land and were therefore exempt. First collected in 1194, and the first <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> collected in England since the geld, carucage was based on the size of the estate as measured in either hides or carucates (a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight-ox plough-team in a year, which was normally considered equivalent to a hide). The original property assessment of the carucage was based on the Domesday Survey, a survey of land holdings in England that was completed by 1087.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> paid in {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E

5|$|Because small landowning {{families}} {{represented the}} mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. Tax remissions and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants {{to return to their}} land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate, {{it appears}} that most recruits, both legionary and auxiliary, were volunteers (voluntarii). Compulsory {{conscription}} (dilectus) was never wholly abandoned, but was generally only used in emergencies or before major campaigns when large numbers of additional troops were required. In marked contrast, the late army relied mainly on compulsion for its recruitment of Roman citizens. Firstly, the sons of serving soldiers or veterans were {{required by law to}} enlist. Secondly, a regular annual levy was held based on the indictio (<b>land</b> <b>tax</b> assessment). Depending on the amount of <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> due on his estates, a landowner (or group of landowners) would be required to provide a commensurate number of recruits to the army. Naturally, landowners had a strong incentive to keep their best young men to work on their estates, sending the less fit or reliable for military service. There is also evidence that they tried to cheat the draft by offering the sons of soldiers (who were liable to serve anyway) and vagrants (vagi) to fulfil their quota.|$|E

Carucage was levied just six times: by Richard in 1194 and 1198; John, his brother and successor, in 1200; and John's son, Henry III, in 1217, 1220, and 1224, after which it was replaced by taxes on income and personal property.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, Hàm Nghi's Muong {{bodyguard}} Truong Quang Ngoc betrayed him, {{leading to}} the emperor's capture and deportation to Algeria. Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> in silver and rice. Local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to Vu Quang. Phan's men foraged and sold cinnamon bark to raise funds, while lowland peasants donated spare metals {{for the production of}} weapons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a {{semi-autonomous}} king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants {{away from their}} farms and denied the government {{a significant portion of}} its <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> revenue. To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.|$|E
5|$|Taxes were levied on {{mining and}} forest products, and {{additional}} income was raised through tolls {{for the use}} of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). <b>Land</b> <b>tax</b> assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|E

To achieve this objective, the hypothesis is empirically tested that a <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> encourages more development closer to preexisting development than farther from preexisting development. Specifically, the marginal effects of a <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> on the probability of land development is hypothesized to be greater in areas around preexisting development than in areas more distant from preexisting development. The findings show that the marginal effects of a <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> on the probability of developing parcels that neighbored previously developed parcels was greater than the probability of developing parcels that did not neighbor previously developed parcels. This finding suggests that land value taxation could be used to design compact development strategies that address sprawling development. <b>Land</b> value <b>tax,</b> <b>Land</b> development model, Urban sprawl, Land Economics/Use, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R

This {{minister}} was the central government's treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces. While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. He {{was in charge of}} storing the poll taxes, which were gathered in coin cash, and <b>land</b> <b>tax,</b> which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields. He was also responsible for setting the standards for units of measurement. In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies for price control exacted on certain commercial commodities.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, the <b>land</b> <b>tax</b> {{rate was}} reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century, the central {{government}} became increasingly involved in local affairs. The feud was limited and regulated, local taxation became much more intrusive and from 1607 regular, local commissions of Justices of the Peace on the English model were established to deal with petty crimes and infractions. Greater control was exerted over the lawless Borders through a joint commission with the English, set up in 1587. James VI was much more hostile to the culture and particularism of the Highlands than his predecessors. He sent colonists from Fife to parts {{of the region and}} forced the Highland chiefs to accept Lowland language and culture through the Statues of Iona of 1609.

5000|$|Standard {{economic}} {{theory suggests that}} a <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> would be extremely efficient - unlike other taxes, it does not reduce economic productivity. Milton Friedman described Henry George's tax on unimproved value of land as the [...] "least bad tax", since unlike other taxes, it would not impose an excess burden on economic activity (leading to zero or even negative [...] "deadweight loss"); hence, a replacement of other more distortionary <b>taxes</b> with a <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> would improve economic welfare. As <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> can improve the use of land and redirect investment toward productive, non-rentseeking activities, it could even have a negative deadweight loss that boosts productivity. Because <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> would apply to foreign land speculators, the Australian Treasury estimated that <b>land</b> value <b>tax</b> was unique in having a negative marginal excess burden, meaning that it would increase long-run living standards.|$|R
