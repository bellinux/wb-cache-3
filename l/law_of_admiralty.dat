The result was the Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Alexander Hamilton and John Adams were both admiralty lawyers and Adams represented John Hancock in an admiralty case in colonial Boston involving seizure of one of Hancock's ships for violations of Customs regulations. In the more modern era, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was an admiralty lawyer before ascending to the bench.|$|E

He {{often told}} {{students}} {{that when he}} and Gilmore were young professors, {{he decided that he}} needed to write a [...] "black letter law" [...] book as an alternative to relying solely on constitutional law to make his reputation. Although he was mainly known as a constitutional legal scholar, his work with Gilmore on Admiralty became canonical, and [...] "The Law of Admiralty" [...] {{is one of the most}} influential law books ever written in a practical area of law. Admiralty is the law of the sea, of shipping and shipping contracts, and is a functional, practical area of international law, in which uniformity of the application of law in ports throughout the world is important, and as a result it has evolved somewhat differently from other areas of federal law. [...] "Gilmore and Black," [...] as it was often called, became so influential that it is one of the few treatises that federal admiralty and international courts cite almost as though it were a primary source of law. It is the most cited work of maritime law in history.|$|E

In Australia, such law is grounded in legislation, in particular the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). A consequence of grounding admiralty law in legislation, according to some commentators, ‘has been the creation of an entirely novel form of action known as the statutory action in rem.

40|$|In 1890, the Supreme Court {{shocked and}} thrilled {{the civilized world}} with the {{announcement}} that dry states could not prohibit the sale of liquor shipped in from outside the state. So long as the out-of-state goods remained in their 2 ̆ 2 original packages, 2 ̆ 2 the Court held they retained their character as interstate commerce subject only to federal regulation. The consequences {{for the cause of}} local sobriety were, predictably, catastrophic. The proliferation in temperance territory of 2 ̆ 2 original package saloons, 2 ̆ 2 at which one could purchase liquor free from the superintendence of local liquor authorities, was appalling to dry eyes. Members of Congress immediately proposed bill to authorize the states again to regulate such sales. It was enacted only over strenuous objections that such legislation unconstitutionally delegated congressional authority to regulate interstate transactions and thereby authorized unconstitutional disuniformity in the regulation of interstate commerce. While the Court would consistently approve this and other similar congressional legislation, the debate over constitutional constraints on such congressional authorizations would persist {{over the course of the}} next half-century. It is only fairly recently that such measures became 2 ̆ 2 unexceptionable. 2 ̆ 2 A parallel debate unfolded in the more recondite domain of admiralty, with strikingly different results. In 1917, in the controversial case of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, the Supreme Court held that New York’s workmen’s compensation statute could not constitutionally apply to workplace injury sustained over navigable waters. The Court relied upon its dormant Commerce Clause decisions in the liquor context in holding that such an application of the state statute would interfere with the uniformity of maritime law contemplated by Article III 2 ̆ 7 s grant of admiralty jurisdiction to the federal courts. Yet when Congress enacted legislation authorizing the application of state workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation statutes to maritime workplace injuries, the Court invalidated the statute on the ground that it delegated congressional authority to regulate maritime matters and thereby authorized unconstitutional disuniformity in the substantive <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>admiralty.</b> The contention that had failed in the Commerce Clause context prevailed in admiralty. This curious asymmetry in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism jurisprudence has never been satisfactorily explored. Admiralty scholars, content for the most part to explain Jensen and its progeny as manifestations of judicial hostility to worker-friendly Progressive legislation, have paid scant attention to cognate developments in Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Similarly, historians of constitutional federalism, perhaps viewing admiralty jurisprudence as an occult science, have largely neglected the field. Yet an excursion into interdoctrinal comparative law promises to shed new light on both subjects. This article challenges the traditional interpretation of the Jensen line of cases, while at the same time integrating these developments in admiralty law into the larger story of cooperative federalism and legal and social reform in the Progressive Era. In addition to offering a reinterpretation of these leading admiralty decisions, the article aims to identify the salient features of the political and constitutional landscape within which distinctive forms of cooperative federalism emerged in the Progressive Era, and to illuminate the manner in which those features helped to shape the asymmetric constitutional law of federal-state cooperation...|$|E
40|$|Fishermen {{going out}} to the Northeast 2 ̆ 7 s famed fishing grounds {{over the last several years}} have been pulling in large catches of once-ailing {{groundfish}} after more than a decade of decline. Many fishermen, and even scientists and fishery managers, say that there are more fish in the ocean now than at any other point in recent memory. However, despite the plentiful landings, total landings are down in some ports from years past due to stiff regulations that strictly curtail the areas that can be fished and the total number of days that a fisherman can be at sea. This regulatory framework was put in place in an effort to limit the number of fish caught to a more sustainable level. Indeed, the increased landings that individual fishing boats are realizing indicate that the framework appears to be working, at least to a degree. The fisheries of the Northeast, however, still find themselves in a precarious position. Though the stocks of the principal groundfish appear to be rebounding, they remain quite low and in need of more time to rebuild. To sustain their current growth, the fisheries must stay closely monitored, and perhaps more importantly, minimally fished. Towards this goal, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the federal agency that oversees all commercial fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), issued a proposed set of rules in March 2002 that would curtail commercial fishing more drastically than it has been in the past. While the fisheries remain tenuously balanced between collapse and recovery, the fishermen who try to make their livings from those fisheries find themselves in an even more precarious position. New rules limiting days at sea may well be necessary for the preservation of ailing fish stocks, but they put yet another strain on the livelihoods of fishermen. Fishermen hoping to stay in business face considerable challenges from regulatory bodies like NMFS, depleted fish stocks, and competition from within an extremely tight industry. Because fishing is often a 2 ̆ 2 boom or bust 2 ̆ 2 industry, leaving fishermen without cash for long periods of time, fishermen are often highly leveraged and rely on credit for the extension of services and supplies. Fishermen need boats; and boats need adequate supplies, wharfage, and repair from shipyards and other facilities. Many of the fishermen who have been strapped for cash in these last years of heavy restrictions on days at sea and total allowable catch have had to pay for these goods and services on credit. The credit supplied by shipyards and other creditors gives rise to a maritime lien, the ungainly sea creature that will be the subject of this Comment. A maritime lien gives a creditor, in the event of a default or other defined trigger such as tort, the right to arrest and sell a vessel so that the creditor can collect on her debts. What 2 ̆ 7 s more, it is not only the vessel that is sold when a maritime lien is enforced; it is the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s appurtenances as well. Appurtenances include a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s sails, equipment, and anything that makes the vessel a 2 ̆ 2 going concern. 2 ̆ 2 Recently, the First Circuit ruled that fishing permits were so integral to a vessel that the permits should be considered appurtenances and thus be sold with the vessel when a creditor enforces a maritime lien. This decision may prove to have far reaching implications for the commercial fishing industry. This Comment will address the issue of maritime liens and the recent designation of fishing permits as appurtenances to those liens. The First Circuit case of Gowen, Inc. v. F/V Quality One will be analyzed as a current example of the issues and problems associated with that designation. This Comment maintains that the inclusion of fishing permits as appurtenances to maritime liens may endanger fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s livelihoods more than it benefits the creditors who extend goods and services to fishermen on credit. It will also argue that the inclusion of fishing permits is not required by case law or by any existing statute. To the contrary, it would be more equitable and less restrictive to treat fishing permits not as appurtenances, but as a distinct piece of property, to be treated as collateral in a separate maritime lien, enforced only if the value of the vessel itself is not equal to or greater than the value of the goods and/or services extended. Finally, it is important to mention what this Comment will not cover. The universe of maritime liens is intricately tied to both the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>admiralty</b> and the law of secured transactions. It is my intention to provide a brief overview of maritime liens, fishing permits, and the separate regulatory regimes that control them for the purpose of elucidating and taking issue with the Gowen court 2 ̆ 7 s connection between fishing permits and maritime liens...|$|E
