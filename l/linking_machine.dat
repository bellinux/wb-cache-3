Although, MT knowledge is more and more required for professional translators, most of them are still skeptical, not to say hostile to MT. Our objective here is then twofold: showing translation trainees why and how MT can be used for professional purposes, from the text to be translated to the final result. 1...|$|E

40|$|Slotless surface permanent-magnet (SPM) {{machines}} are attractive for many applications {{where it is}} important to minimize the cogging torque and or the eddy-current losses due to slotting effects. The design of these machines is often approached through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations interfaced to design optimization programs, leading to a significant computational burden. In this paper, a compact but accurate sizing equation is established <b>linking</b> <b>machine</b> maximum torque to the main design data. The sizing equation can be used for a fast first-attempt sizing of the machine with no need for FEA simulations and no need for complicated magnetic field solutions. The proposed sizing approach is based on an explicit fully-analytical expression of machine torque, which is validated by FEA simulations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{lifecycle}} of a building, {{much more}} information is used and produced than can be contained inside a Building Information Model (BIM). The information outside the BIM is seldom connected to the BIM or connected across domains. Furthermore, information in BIM is only accessible to people with sufficient CAD or architectural background, and often expensive software is needed to edit and add data. This inefficient information management causes significant costs in practice. Our research contributes {{to the development of}} IFC based web applications in practice and demonstrates a way of <b>linking</b> <b>machine</b> to human readable data thus making the data accessible to non CAD users or architectural experts. In this paper we describe such a platform for the integration of model-based data and non-model based data. We tried to construct a mapping process from IFC properties to a national building element classification system, as a way of structuring the objects and information for use in our web platform. Since both the structure of IFC and most building element classification systems are based on semantic relations of building elements (i. e. holonym, meronym, hypernym), translations by means of a basic reasoning system should be feasible. We elaborate on several uses of this platform in applications for maintenance and reuse of building materials, buildings and built structures...|$|E

The {{realization}} of the Semantic Web as a <b>linked</b> <b>machine</b> readable Web of data depends {{on the availability of}} authoring tools that enable ordinary Web users (i. e. non-experts w. r. t.

In this paper, we introduce the “One Click Annotator ” for enriching texts with RDFa annotations and linking resources through an intuitive user interface, thereby hiding the complexity of creating semantic data. With this easy to use approach we aim at contributing to the change of the Web into a Semantic Web consisting of semantic information objects and linked data. We discuss requirements, challenges, and solutions for the implementation of the annotator. ...|$|R

The Internet likewise enables collaboration between computers - the Distributed. net activity [18] harnesses spare computing power on the Internet to tackle mathematical tasks that otherwise could hardly be contemplated.
