40|$|This {{paper offers}} a bidding {{strategy}} model {{for use by}} contractors {{as part of a}} more informed approach in selecting which contracts to bid for, and as a basis for determining the most appropriate mark-up level for various types and sizes <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client types. Regression analysis is used in measuring a contractor’s competitiveness between bids (by using the lowest bid / own bid ratio) and within bids (by using the lowest bid / cost estimate ratio) according to type and size <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and client type. The model was tested on a large and reputable Hong Kong contractor. This particular contractor's bidding behaviour was found to be largely unaffected by type <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> but significantly affected by client type and size <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work.</b> Three quadratic models (regressing lowest bid / cost estimate on size <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work)</b> are also successfully developed for projects from the private sector, the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Housing Authority respectively...|$|R

40|$|There are myriads of ICT {{tools in}} the {{construction}} industry but many construction procurement organizations are yet to harness the benefits. Tertiary institutions that are at the forefront of accountability, transparency and openness, engage in a lot <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> but majority <b>of</b> them do not have eprocurement sites. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop a web-based tendering protocol for procurement <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> in a tertiary institution. The development of a web app and a survey research design was carried out for the study. For the latter, a questionnaire instrument distributed to the client representatives and contracting firms operating within a renowned tertiary institution through a convenience sampling method was utilized. A total of 58 questionnaires were returned between the two groups. The study tested hypotheses using Mann Whitney-U and T-test. The result revealed that there are no significant differences between client representatives and contractors on e-readiness and importance of implementing e-tendering in the procurement <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> The study developed a web-based tendering system for procurement <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> in a tertiary institution using PHP, MYSQL, CSS and HTML. The study recommended the increase in awareness of e-tendering platforms through trainings and implementation and stakeholders should take hold of the benefits of ICT {{in the construction industry}}.
