30|$|Economic capital plays a {{significant}} role for accompanying partners’ labour market strategies as it can be converted into cultural capital (e.g. further qualifications). Sufficient household income allows partners to engage in lengthy job search or to travel internationally between work and family locations. In contrast, limited household financial resources are a major reason for working in a low-skilled and <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> <b>job.</b> Moreover, childcare responsibilities were a challenge mainly for interviewees with low household income, since, in the UK, childcare services are widely available, but costly. Many, though not all, households of highly-skilled migrants have high economic capital. That means that accompanying partners of highly-skilled migrants often have more options for coping strategies than other migrants.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{pictures of}} low pay adult employees in Australia in 2004 drawing {{on data from}} the HILDA survey. The low paid are disaggregated into full-time and part-time employees. Estimates from multivariate probit models reveal that low wage employees {{are more likely to}} have casual status, single marital status, a low educational attainment, aged 21 to 30 or 60 plus, be employed in small firms, non-unionised, and have a lower occupational tenure. The magnitude of effect of these distinguishing characteristics is much larger for part-time versus full-time employees. Low paid employees, and more so in the case of full-time employees, are spread fairly evenly across households with different incomes.

40|$|Incontinence is a discrediting and stigmatising {{condition}} {{for those who}} experience it, as it signifies {{a person who is}} lacking in self-control. For their carers, the very nature of undertaking 'dirty work' signifies a low status and <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> <b>job.</b> Those health care professionals higher in status and financial reward put distance between themselves and bodywork, especially bodywork that deals with bodily decay. However, little is known or has been highlighted about the social consequences that living with and dealing with incontinence can have on informal carers. In this paper we examine the notion of dirty work and 'unbounded' bodies in the role of informal carers. Through qualitative interviews with carers of stroke survivors the negative social consequences of dealing with incontinence for both the survivor and the carer are explored. We also examine the strategies employed by carers and stroke survivors in order to manage the symptom in an attempt to prove the adult status of the survivor and to protect both the identity of the survivor and the carer. The embarrassment of leakage and the moral danger of odour can lead some carers and survivors to make decisions that can isolate both within the confines of their home. In this sense the very meaning of home is transformed into an isolated and marginalised space. UK Carers Incontinence Dirty work Stroke...|$|E
40|$|Turner's (1965, 1967, 1968) {{study of}} Lima's {{squatter}} settlements {{led to the}} view that uncontrolled settlements of the Third World cities are mainly a manifestation of the desires for housing ownership by people who are well integrated in the city and have experienced some amount of social mobility. In his work, Turner (1968) advanced a theoretical model of intraurban mobility in which rural-urban migration; upward social mobility, intra-urban mobility and the growth of spontaneous settlements are inter-related. Within this model, migrants are classified into three successive groups which corresponds with their level of involvement in gainful employment namely, 'Bridgeheader' i. e. the newly arrived migrants who are in search of employment or involved in low paid jobs, 'Consolidators' i. e. those who have had some urban experience and are"in relatively better paid jobs; and 'Status Seekers' i. e. the upper class of low income group. Three housing priorities: - Location, security of tenure and quality of housing and environment were assigned to those class of migrants. Upward economic and social mobility from a <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> <b>job</b> to a better paid jobs, is argued within this model, to be reflected in a housing priority and expectation about living conditions. Those who move from lower position in the social hierarchy to a higher position also move from inner city slums to the suburbs. In other words, social mobility necessarily entails spatial mobility within the urban. environment. Security of tenure and improvement of the quality of housing are thus functionally related. Consequently, it is recommended that stimulating those spontaneous activities as opposed to their eradication would benefit enormously from the resourcefulness of the squatters. Legalisation of land tenure, provision of infrastructural services and support-for local neighbourhoodorganisation are some of the essential elements for a more healthy urban policy. In this study attempt is made to test Turner's model of intraurban mobility in a regional context of West Africa. The study specifically examines the validity of the model in relation to a secondary city of (Jos) Nigeria, and asks whether Turner's model which is based almost entirely on the migratory characteristics and experience of Latin America has gone far enough in acknowledging the various dimensions of Third -World rural-urban migration in which some migrate permanently while others intend only a temporary migration as well as the varying types of uncontrollecl subareas that have emerged {{as a result of these}} differences. In most of West Africa, Including Nigeria, rural-urban migration tends not only to be temporary in character but is also structured by kinship relationships. Within this migratory context, migrants do not strive to consolidate their stay in the city. They prefer cheap rental accommodation, with a view to consolidating their position in the rural home towns. Security of tenure does not therefore rank. high in their order of priorities, their social mobility does not lead to a spatial mobility. Within this migratory context, the distinction between permanent and temporary migrants has more validity and practical application than Turner's bridgeheader - consolidator dichotomy, since bridgeheaders are likely to remain bridgeheaders while in the city. Adopting the proposed distinction between permanent and temporary migrants provides a lot of insight into the ways in which migrant groups perceive the city environment and how their perception of the city in turn affects the development process of their settlement areas. Indeed, varying migratory characteristics leads to varying housing demands and housing ambitions in the city of migration. This also leads to variation in migrants reception areas in the city and thus affords the capacity of uncontrolled subareas to improve via self help housing. Thus, the distinction between permanent and temporary migrants provides a lot of insight into the understanding of why some uncontrolled settlements might improve through self help housing and why others might not. Most Importantly, it provides more insights into the policy dimension of the problem...|$|E

30|$|What might {{account for}} migrant workers’ {{estimated}} callback advantage in our data? Since the advantage is confined to less skilled positions, we argue that employers’ payroll tax savings on NLH workers (which are either skill neutral or favor skilled NLH workers) cannot be the only explanation, suggesting that temporary migrant workers may have a productivity advantage over natives in less skilled and <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> <b>jobs.</b> Possible sources of such an advantage include differential selection of LH and NLH workers into active search for low-skilled private sector urban jobs, and different effort and labor supply decisions while in the destination city. For example, preferred access to secure, well paid SOE and public sector jobs and greater coverage by the urban social safety net could reduce less-skilled LH workers’ work incentives {{in a way that}} makes them less attractive to private sector employers. At the same time, intertemporal labor substitution effects {{might account for}} high observed levels of hours and effort among temporary migrants, making them more attractive to employers. These and other sources of a migrant productivity advantage will be muted in jobs with higher skill requirements if, as seems plausible, skill is complementary with LH workers’ local labor market experience, connections and knowledge. We stress that the above are only possible sources of a migrant productivity advantage in <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> <b>jobs</b> and that much additional work is needed to understand the source and robustness of such an advantage.|$|R

40|$|Increasingly in the European Union <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> {{employment}} and <b>job</b> quality have become important policy issues. Recently job satisfaction {{has been used}} as a proxy for job quality. This paper uses the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) from 1991 to 1997 to explore further these issues. First we define low pay using the two thirds of the median classification and examine the levels of overall job and pay satisfaction for the lower and higher paid groups by gender. Given the importance of comparative income measures in the literature this paper focuses both on the actual level of pay and comparison pay, which is derived from a nationally representative sample in the New Earnings Survey. Second, we use a randomeffects estimator to deal with problems of individual heterogeneity in the sample. Third we explain changes in job satisfaction by changes in pay and other individual and industrial characteristics. The paper has particular relevance to current policy issues. For instance, if <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> workers generally have high levels of job satisfaction this casts doubt on the suggestion that <b>low</b> <b>paid</b> <b>jobs</b> are invariably of low quality. The results suggest surprisingly that there is no clear evidence that higher paid workers have higher job satisfaction than lower paid workers. This is particularly the case for women, which may be in accord with the compensating differentials theory as opposed to good jobs versus bad jobs view of the labour market. But it also emphasises that pay is not everything. This implication is reinforced when we consider mobility from <b>low</b> to higher <b>paid</b> <b>jobs</b> and vice versa. It is by no means always the case that moving from a lower paid to a higher <b>paid</b> <b>job</b> leads to increases in job satisfaction...|$|R

In addition to this, the government removed all subsidies and price support measures to agriculture in 2002.

The existence of these two discrete groups within the female workforce explains the paradox of women's high satisfaction with poor jobs, and helps explain the persistence of job segregation.
