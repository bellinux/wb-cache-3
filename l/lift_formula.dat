40|$|Summary. -The {{theories}} of supersonic flow past slender, smooth, pointed bodies of arbitrary cross-sectional shape, due to Ward", {{and of the}} flow past slender bodies of revolution with discontinuities in profile slope, due to Lighthill-, are applied and extended to calculate first approximations for the aerodynamic forces on bodies of elliptic cross-section with discontinuities in profile slope. Open-nose bodies are included in this class, but only the external forces are considered. The investigation is restricted to bodies the major axes of whose cross-sections are co-planar and whose cross-sections have constant eccentricity. General expressions are deduced for the wave drag, lift, induced drag, and pitching moments of such bodies. The drag formula bears a marked resemblance to that for the equivalent body of revolution (i. e., the body of revolution with the same axial distribution of cross-sectional area), but the discontinuities introduce a slight difference in one term. The <b>lift</b> <b>formula</b> is identical with that already deduced by Ward for a particular case of the present problem.

Reliability of these coefficient values are studied by examining the relative deviation of the predicted wave forces based on these coef-ficient values from the measured ones. The analysis finds that relative deviations of the in-line and lift forces exceed in many cases 15 % and 100 %, respectively, when the time-independent coefficients are used for the prediction of wave forces, but that they are reduced to 5 % and 15 %, respectively, when the time-dependent coefficients are used for it...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} from the {{literature}} [5, 14] that any continuous, basic Hochschild 2 n-cocycle ψ 2 n of the algebra Diffn of formal holomorphic differential operators can be “integrated ” over a compact complex n-dimensional manifold X. This “integration ” is done by a Gelfand-Fuks procedure [8]. The result gives a Hochschild 0 -cocycle Θ E 2 n (ψr 2 n) of an algebra Diff 0 (E) of differential operators that one can associate with any rank r holomorphic vector bundle E on X. We show that when this cocycle is applied to a holomorphic differential operator D on X, {{the result is the}} Lefschetz number of D upto a constant depending only on ψ 2 n. When ψ 2 n is the cocycle τ 2 n from [6], we get a different proof of the Lefschetz number formula from [5]. In addition, our method naturally yields a generalization of this result for differential operators on vector bundles having “bounded geometry ” on arbitrary complex manifolds. In a related construction, B. Shoikhet integrates the <b>lifting</b> <b>formula</b> Ψ 2 n+ 1 over a parallelizable compact complex manifold X in [14]. As a result, one gets a Lie 1 -cocycle (with trivial coefficients) ∫ X ΘE 2 n of the Lie algebra gl fin ∞(Diff 0 (E)) for any trivial holomorphic vector bundle E on X. Our approach in the earlier part of this paper goes through to show that ∫ X ΘE 2 n(E 11 (D)) is the Lefschetz number of D upto a constant independent of X and E. This generalizes a part of Conjecture 3. 3 of [14] in a different direction. Once again, we get a generalization of the latter result to trivial vector bundles on arbitrary parallelizable manifolds with bounded geometry. 1 Introduction. 1. 1 Let X be a connected compact complex manifold such that dimCX = n.
