500|$|The film marked Robin Williams' first {{animation}} role, {{with the}} character Batty Koda being created specifically for him. Williams provided 14 hours worth of improvised lines for the part which was originally only {{supposed to be an}} 8-minute role. Director Bill Kroyer was so impressed with the voice work he ended up tripling the screen time given to the character. Williams went on to provide the critically applauded voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin later the same year. Williams accepted the role in FernGully because he agreed with the film's message, as did the rest of the voice cast, who all worked for scale wages. The film marked the first time that both members of Cheech & Chong had worked together in six years, with the two voicing beetle brothers Stump and Root. Cheech Marin said [...] "It was just <b>like</b> <b>old</b> <b>times,</b> but we only worked for two or three hours, had a pizza and split." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle and E! Online Jenna Mullins were pleased by how [...] "Comeback" [...] reminded them of early episodes of Glee—Mullins hailed {{the return of}} familiar characterization, and Hankinson commented: [...] "It felt <b>like</b> <b>old</b> <b>times,</b> and it felt good." [...] Though he observed that the episode was light on plot, Hankinson praised the writing and comedy. CNN's Lisa Respers France found the episode's title apt, as Glee was [...] "firing on all cylinders" [...] with little room for improvement. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone was [...] "pleasantly surprised", as she had anticipated a decline in quality from the previous episode, and Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic commented that apart from the Bieber jokes, [...] "the rest of the episode was sharply written and loaded with self-referential jokes". Other critics found [...] "Comeback" [...] mediocre. Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez wrote that it was [...] "a bit off", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that [...] "something was missing, making the whole thing stultifying, lifeless, and boring", and Robert Canning of IGN deemed it [...] "fine and inoffensive", but ultimately forgettable. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times was [...] "a little disappointed" [...] in the episode {{for a lack of}} substance, creativity and emotional maturity. James Poniewozik of Time deemed it amongst his least favorite episodes, for [...] "not even [...] bad in a memorable way". He noted that [...] "Comeback" [...] was [...] "essentially a collection of subplots", and questioned its purpose.|$|E

50|$|The {{subjects}} of COOPER's projects are often related to investigating {{the world at}} dusk, attempting to describe visually the moment when it is precisely not day, or night. The work always involves some element of darkness, and intentional obscurity- such as a wall mounted fountain that recycles a miniature black river, or models of caves where light disappears before the viewer into a simulated tunnel. These themes continue into works that involve timed mechanical devices, operating <b>like</b> <b>old</b> <b>time</b> Houses of Horror, illusion, trickery or a spook-ride from a traveling carnival, and other works such as translucent layered drawings depicting human turmoil surrounded by floating objects and depiction.|$|R

The role of Eric 'Otter' Stratton in National Lampoon's Animal House was originally written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on Foul Play. The role went to Tim Matheson instead. Chase {{said in an interview}} that he chose to do Foul Play so he could do [...] "real acting" [...] for the first time in his career instead of just doing [...] "schtick". Chase followed Foul Play with the successful Harold Ramis comedy Caddyshack, in 1980. That same year, he also reunited with Foul Play co-star Goldie Hawn for Neil Simon's Seems <b>Like</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Times</b> and released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by Randy Newman, Barry White, Bob Marley, the Beatles, Donna Summer, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Troggs, and The Sugarhill Gang.|$|E
2500|$|Kane and Undertaker met at Night of Champions, which Undertaker lost. With Kane {{seeming to}} have grown {{stronger}} than his older [...] "brother", The Undertaker was boosted by the return of his former manager, and Kane's father, Paul Bearer (who hadn't been seen for many years, since June 2004 when The Undertaker betrayed him by drowning him in a crypt of cement (seemingly paying Bearer back for his recent unforgettable betrayal at SummerSlam '96 and siding with Undertaker's arch enemy Mankind, Vader and his brother Kane). With Bearer by The Undertaker's side <b>like</b> <b>old</b> <b>times,</b> the two squared off again at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view in a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Paul Bearer, however, betrayed The Undertaker by blinding him with the urn, allowing Kane to chokeslam him for the victory (repaying Undertaker for the Concrete Crypt burial at The Great American Bash (2004)). The feud culminated with a Buried Alive match at Bragging Rights, in which The Undertaker lost again due to interference by The Nexus, allowing Kane to bury the Undertaker alive, possibly evening a longtime score for The Undertaker's initial ablaze of his brother as children. After the event, The Undertaker went just to appear on WWE, but only sporadically. Kane continued to be World Heavyweight Champion, until he lost his title to Edge at [...] During this feud, he was seemingly making failed attempts at defending his father from Edge; though in April 2012, Bearer returned for a brief stint {{as a part of}} Kane's ongoing feud with Randy Orton. Bearer was kidnapped by Orton and then stuck in a storage freezer while strapped to a wheelchair. Kane later came for Bearer, only to betray him by rolling him back into the freezer while stating, [...] "I'm saving you... from me".|$|E
2500|$|JR and Babe (now {{portrayed by}} Baker) become closer and reunite romantically. JR teams {{up with his}} father, Adam, just <b>like</b> <b>old</b> <b>times.</b> Their goal is to take down Fusion Cosmetics. JR tries to enlist Babe into their scheme. What JR does not know, though, is that Adam is {{secretly}} planning to ruin him in the process. JR and Babe bond, as Adam plans the ultimate takeover. Fusion Cosmetics is at a height of excellence and things are working wonderfully. Babe and JR decide to use [...] "Bella" [...] (a new perfume designed by Babe) to launch her career. They begin to plan their next wedding and decide {{to have a second}} child. Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt (Daniel Kennedy), who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby (Brianne Moncrief), JR's sister, gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She has an ulterior motive, as her and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, they have to come back when Adam has them subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss, declare that they made each other better people and that they love each other from the deepest part of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what. After a light hug, Babe dies in JR's arms.|$|E
