5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
25|$|One {{strategy}} {{to control the}} disease in areas where it is common is the treatment of entire groups of people regardless of symptoms via mass drug administration. This is often done among school-age children and is known as deworming. While testing and treating children who are infected <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is effective, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that routine deworming, {{in the absence of}} a positive test, improves nutrition, haemoglobin, school attendance or school performance.|$|E

25|$|By the 1920s, Casas {{had fallen}} {{far away from}} the avant-gardiste tendencies of his youth. If anything, his work from this period <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> came from an {{academic}} painter of an earlier time than his work of the 1890s. He continued painting landscapes and portraits, as well as anti-tuberculosis posters and the like, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1932, shortly after the emergence of the Second Spanish Republic, he was already more a figure of the past than the present.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> <b>it</b> appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipal}} palace {{was built}} during the railroad {{boom in the}} early 20th century. Covering an entire side of the main plaza, it today towers over the other buildings in the center. It is built in provincial Neoclassical style with massive columns and arches. However, {{the back of the}} structure is very different, as it is an irregular pattern of brickwork, which <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> has half collapsed. In reality, the structure was never completed. Since 1906, the city has promised to finish the building, but never has. Even the federal government in 1975 announced plans to not only finish the building but restore many of the churches and plazas, but they never came to fruition.|$|E

GameSpot's Ben Stahl previewed Iridion 3D on March 21, 2001, shortly before the release of the game in the United States.

500|$|Other {{reactions}} were unfavorable. Artist Kenyon Cox, {{one of the}} invited artists to the 1891 competition, stated, [...] "I think it disgraceful that this great country should have such a coin as this." [...] Harper's Weekly proclaimed, [...] "The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse." [...] Saint-Gaudens was also interviewed, and as author Moran put it, [...] "injudiciously ranted": [...] "This is inept; this <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had been designed by a young lady of sixteen, a miss who had taken only a few lessons in modeling. It is beneath criticism... There are hundreds of artists in this country, any of whom, {{with the aid of}} a designer, could have made a very respectable coin, which this is not." ...|$|E
500|$|Batman conveys {{trademarks}} {{found in}} 1930s pulp magazines, notably {{the design of}} Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as Metropolis (1927) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). [...] "Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot", he continued, [...] "is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, {{staring down at the}} citizens." [...] Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that [...] "The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> takes place in 1939"; but later said: [...] "Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir."

500|$|The group's {{members were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the release of}} [...] "Soul Sound" [...] as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason and it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> has all worked out". [...] "Soul Sound" [...] was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch, which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jessica Biel.|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has {{everything you want}} from a hospital drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd current issue (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits {{where you have to}} look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is on the right track." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who {{has shot}} {{all of the}} director's films since 1993's Schindler's List, {{reviewed}} the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe's style. [...] "I didn’t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century", Spielberg explained. [...] "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, and I had to approximate this younger director's look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades." [...] Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for Superman Returns. Spielberg {{did not want to}} fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted. Lucas felt [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was shot three years after Last Crusade. The people, the look of it, everything. You’d never know there was 20 years between shooting." [...] Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.|$|E
500|$|A case of {{the latter}} {{situation}} is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged {{by the presence of}} the mimic.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the DVD in 2008, Record Collector stated that [...] "25 years on, [...] lost none of its power". Rocky Mountain News {{recalled}} that the video is [...] "still a thrilling performance, raw but polished, passionate and sincere". Andrew Gilstrap of PopMatters gave the remastered version of the film a rating of 8 out of 10, stating, [...] "It's rare that a band can totally transform a scene—especially one with a stage show that boasts charisma as its only special effect—but it's not hyperbole to say that U2 put on a dominating, flawless-despite-mistakes performance.

[...] In its review of the remastered version of Under a Blood Red Sky, online magazine Pitchfork Media said, [...] "when the group performed at Red Rocks on a rainy June night, with lit torches above a panoramic skyline, the venue provided an ideal backdrop for U2's literally flag-waving music, with everything—earth, wind, fire—in place to maximise and heighten the drama of the moment and the songs." [...] James Wigney of The Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Herald Sun gave the DVD a score of 5 out of 5, praising the film's concert, but stated that the [...] "footage is still on the fuzzy side".

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Rap-Up called the video [...] "electrifying" [...] and complimented the [...] "slickly-choreographed routines" [...] performed by Brown. Andrew Martin of Prefix magazine praised Brown's [...] "killer dance moves". Katie Hasty of HitFix gave the video a positive review, writing [...] "there {{is a serious}} series of sweeping dance shots that may impress the hating-est of haters". Jacob Moore of Complex magazine noted that the dance party scenes is what [...] "you'd expect from a Breezy video". Meena Rupani of DesiHits felt that the video took her [...] "into a whole different world" [...] that {{reminded her of the}} films Eyes Wide Shut (1999) and Men in Black (1997). Rupani also described it as [...] "extremely futuristic and <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> belongs in the year 2030". Jocelyn Vena of MTV News called it an [...] "eye-popping video" [...] and noted that there were several outfits Brown wore that paid homage to Michael Jackson. A reviewer for Capital FM praised Brown's [...] "impressive dance routines" [...] and noted that it was [...] "similar to that of a Michael Jackson show". This was echoed by Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush who wrote that Brown's dance routines were [...] "quite reminiscent of Michael Jackson and his classic, dance-driven videos". Joey of WXRK found the video to [...] "be a hybrid between Michael Jackson's 'Smooth Criminal', a party that Ke$ha would be at, and that scene from Fame when everyone is dancing in the streets on top of cabs and cars". The video earned Brown and Taberez a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards. It won Best Male Video and Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. On September 19, 2012, the video received a nomination at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards for Best Dance Performance.|$|E

Journalist Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, and noted that it [...] "sounds like a modern day 'Rock with You', a feat that few could get away with pulling off so authentically". Katie Hasty, while reviewing the songs of the summer of 2013, said [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was culled straight out of Soul Train". Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine gave the song a positive review, and described [...] "Treasure" [...] as a [...] "stripper-theme funk-pop with gooey synth pads and enormous slap-bass fills that punch through like air-humps". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commented that [...] "Treasure" [...] is [...] "creamy Michael Jackson/Prince-schooled disco soul", while Matt Cibula from Pop Matters also compared the [...] "funky" [...] song to the work of those two musicians when he said that [...] "Treasure" [...] "knows that a flirt beats a bleat any day". Matthew Horton from BBC Music wrote that the track has a [...] "sugary early 80s funk", and that it [...] "is lathered in so much slap bass it starts to sting". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club wrote that for this [...] "disco-spiked" [...] song, Mars [...] "capably sells himself as a one-man Maroon 5". Tim Sendra of AllMusic found that the song had a [...] "easy-going charm" [...] of the previous album, and described it as [...] "MJ-inspired disco jam".
