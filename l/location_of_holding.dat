40|$|Summary   The growing {{congestion}} problems {{in big cities}} result in growing need for public transport services. In order to attract new users, public transport operators are looking for methods to improve  their performance  and level of service.    Service reliability  is {{one of the main}}   objectives   of  public  transport   operators.    Various   sources   of  service   uncertainty   can   causebus  bunching:  buses  from  the same  line tend  to bunch  together  due to a positive feedback  loop,  unless  control  measures   are  implemented.    The  most  commonly   used strategy for preventing service irregularity is  to define holding points along the bus route. The design of the holding strategy involves the determination  of the optimal number and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> points, as well as the holding criteria. These strategies are classified to schedule-  or  headway-based.    Previous  studies  showed  that  headway-based   strategies have the potential  to improve  transit  performance  from both passengers  and operators perspectives.   This thesis analyzes the performance of optimization algorithms when solving the holding problem. The optimization process involves the determination  of time point location for a given  headway-based   strategy.    The  evaluation   of  candidate   solutions   is  based  on  a mesoscopic  transit simulation.  The input data for the simulation  corresponds  to the bus line number 1 in Stockholm city.   The  objective  function  is  made  up  of  the  weighted  sum  of  all  time  components  that passengers  experience:  in-vehicle  riding  time,  dwell  time,  waiting  time  at stop  and  on- board holding time. The optimization was carried out by greedy and genetic algorithms.  In addition, a multi-objective  function that incorporated  the performance  from the operator perspective was solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm.   The results demonstrate  the potential benefits from optimizing the location of time point stops.  The  best  solution  results  in  an  improvement   of  around   11 %  in  the  objective function value. Interestingly, the results indicate that wrongly chosen time point stops can yield transit performance that is worse off than having no holding control. ...|$|E
40|$|An Intermediary Holding Company (“IHC”) is {{a company}} that is {{interposed}} between an ultimate holding company and the operating subsidiaries of a group of companies. The IHC operates at an international level such that either its holding company or its subsidiaries or both are located in a country foreign to the IHC. Its main functions are to acquire, manage and dispose of the assets of the group of companies and to facilitate structural flexibility of a group of companies. Investors have tax and non-tax reasons for conducting business using an IHC, and, depending on the reasons, they determine the location of the IHC based on the characteristics of potential host countries. This thesis analyses the suitability of the South African corporate tax regime for the use of South African-resident Intermediary Holding Companies. The South African government has the objective of promoting South Africa as a gateway for investment in Africa and for this reason the present research is important. Such an objective could be adversely affected by a corporate tax regime that is not suitable for the operations of an IHC. Furthermore, the Katz Commission recommended in 1997 that South Africa should consider introducing a regime that is suitable for the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> companies. In discharging its functions the IHC attracts liability for corporate income tax, capital gains tax, controlled foreign company tax and dividends tax. It also exposes itself to anti-avoidance measures such as thin capitalisation and transfer pricing provisions. The existence of such taxes and anti-avoidance measures in the tax system of a country may deter investors from locating an IHC in such country. Exchange control regulations could also adversely affect the ability of the IHC to perform its functions effectively, as their purpose is to restrict the movement of capital out of the country. The South African legal system contains all these taxes and anti-avoidance measures as well as exchange control provisions. However, it also contains tax instruments that alleviate the tax burden on an investor using an IHC such as the participation exemption, advance tax rulings and a network of tax treaties. Against this background this thesis analyses the South African corporate tax system to determine whether it is suitable for locating an IHC. In the analysis, a comparative study is done of the tax systems of two of the most effective IHC host countries, namely the Netherlands and Mauritius. In addition, a brief discussion of the special features contained in the tax systems of Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom outlines why these jurisdictions are not necessarily successful in attracting IHCs. The thesis also discusses harmful tax practices and the attitude of the international community towards countries that engage in harmful tax competition {{in order to determine the}} limits to which a country should use the tax system to attract investment. Finally, the thesis makes recommendations as to what adjustments could be made in order to enhance the suitability of South Africa to host an IHC. The thesis recommends a special dispensation as regards corporate income tax and exchange control that would apply to wholly-owned South African companies that own foreign subsidiary shares and loans that consist of 80 % of the gross asset total of these companies.

Internalizing {{a representation of the}} surrounding environment by creating a visuospatial map is possible means of circumventing temporal lags associated with using online visual feedback when performing compensatory reactions. Hand hold targets are often located in the peripheral visual field. This suggests an importance of mapping from the peripheral visual field and further suggests mapping of peripherally located targets may require the allocation of attentional resources in order to correctly encode their <b>location.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis was to examine the contribution of peripheral vision and associated attentional requirements of visuospatial mapping for rapid upper limb movements. Study 1 was designed to examine the influence of mapping with peripheral vision for compensatory reach–to–grasp reactions, specifically the influence <b>of</b> timing and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> visual information. Study 2 was designed to examine the potential effect a secondary visual attention task would have on mapping peripheral located targets prior to movement initiation. Overall the results from these studies show support for the ability to map peripherally located targets with peripheral visual feedback, and suggest that this mapping may be an automatic process. Findings from this thesis provide a basic insight into the incorporation of peripheral visual information into intrinsic visuospatial maps that provides a framework for future experiments into the understanding of how visuospatial maps are incorporated into compensatory balance reactions...|$|R

So a full name could be Johan Karlsson Kvist, for his daughter Elvira Johansdotter Kvist, and when she married a man with the Ahlskog farm, Elvira kept the first surname Johansdotter but changed the second surname to her husbands (e.g. Elvira Johansdotter Ahlskog).

The data is replicated in a data grid to increase the data availability, reliability and improve the response time of the applications by reducing the network traffic. The efficiency and fast access to such replicated data {{are influenced by the}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the resource <b>holding</b> the replica and the access cost. The replica locations may be some times unreliable and there is a risk that the resources may fail and hence fail to provide the guaranteed QoS. The notion of trust is to manage such risk and improve the QoS provided by the resource locations. In this paper we apply the concept of experience based trust to the problem of data replication in a data grid environment. We proposed different trust-based replica location selection algorithms and evaluated their effectiveness for a simulated grid. The aim of this work is to identify and to acquire the most available, least loaded and the fastest resource as a replica location. ...|$|R

The geographical <b>location</b> <b>of</b> LNA <b>holds</b> significant advantage to its future economic growth. Lanzhou is the biggest city among two megacities (Ürümqi and Xi'an) in this vast region, and is adjacent to two other capital cities, (Xining of Qinghai Province and Yinchuan of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region). These three capital cities are close enough to form a regional economic conglomeration, and LNA {{is the center of}} this amalgamation. The development of LNA will boost the development of its adjacent areas. Lanzhou's main area is constrained by its geographical topography, since it is a typical valley which can be described as sandwiched by two mountains, with the Yellow River crossing by. The topography of Lanzhou hampers this city to become a megacity like Beijing or Xi’an. The General Office of the State Council issued the Several Advice about Supporting the Development of Economy and Society of Gansu Province in May 2010, especially stating that Lanzhou has to be the impetus of the development of Gansu Province, even the whole northwestern region; not long after, on August 3, 2010, Lanzhou Municipal Government, by the 7th Session of the 11th convention of Lanzhou Municipal Council, announced the strategy of building a new city in Qinwang Flat Plain which now called Lanzhou New Area, then, Gansu Provincial Government issued the Consulting Advice about Promoting Constructions in Lanzhou New Area in order to support the development of LNA.|$|R

Method: <b>Locations</b> <b>of</b> all establishments <b>holding</b> VLT licences in Montréal and Laval (n= 834) were geocoded by their street address. Boroughs (n= 49) were characterized by socio-economic indicators (unemployment, educational attainment, lone parenthood), a neighbourhood distress index, and measures of VLT prevalence, VLT adoption and VLT density. Results: VLT prevalence, adoption and density were strongly correlated (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) with lower borough socio-economic conditions. Although liquor establishments {{were also more likely to}} be located in poorer neighbourhoods, the adoption rate of VLT licences by bars in poorer neighbourhoods was systematically higher than in more affluent ones. Conclusions: The spatial distribution of VLTs in Montréal and Laval closely reflects local geographies of socio-economic disadvantage.

We tested whether {{it is possible to}} classify the behavior of a Przewalski’s horse in the Mongolian Gobi into Resting, Grazing and Moving based on GPS locations collected at 15 minute intervals by comparing GPS data with direct observations. Although behavioral categories lasting for 15 minutes could by fairly reliably separated based on the distances covered between successive fixes, almost half the dataset consisted of mixed intervals. Thus, fifteen minute intervals are too long to catch one behavioral category which makes classification based on GPS fixes alone problematic. Although our present approach was not particularly successful, we believe that using GPS data in combination with activity sensor and additionally including the geometry <b>of</b> <b>locations</b> <b>holds</b> great potential for inferring main behavioral categories in free ranging equids...|$|R
