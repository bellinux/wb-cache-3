40|$|We {{discuss the}} diurnal {{variation}} of <b>the</b> air-pressure system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urban Tokyo. <b>In</b> summer, <b>the</b> pressure drop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban Tokyo, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downtown Tokyo. After sunset, firstly the pressure rise is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downtown Tokyo, thereafter is <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban Tokyo. <b>In</b> winter, <b>the</b> diurnal variation is almost opposite. Commonly, while the area-averaged air-pressure drops, the pressure drop is firstly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downtown; while rises, the pressure rise is firstly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburban. The development of local cyclones/anticyclones and semi-diurnal atmospheric tides {{also contribute to}} these diurnal variations...|$|R

40|$|Four {{hundred and}} twenty-one subjects, who were either farmers, {{fishermen}} or stonecutters, participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nutrient survey. They were 236 males and 185 females, aged from 40 to 59. Nutrient intakes and food consumption structures analysed {{by means of}} the questionnaire were compared among the 3 different occupations. <b>In</b> men, <b>the</b> intakes of the rice and soy bean products were statistically significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farmers, <b>the</b> fishes <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fishermen and <b>the</b> cakes <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stonecutters than <b>in</b> any other occupation groups, respectively. <b>In</b> women, <b>the</b> intake of the rice was significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farmers and the fats and <b>the</b> oils <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fishermen than <b>in</b> any other groups, respectively. The deficiency of the intakes of the fats, calcium, iron and vitamines (A, B 1, B 2 and C) was observed in all 3 groups, and particularly the fat-energic ratio was as small as 16. 6 %. The average amount of daily salt intake was 16. 0 g for men and 15. 7 g for women, which were approximately 4 g above the average amount of the daily salt intake in Japanese. Percentage of recommend dietary allowance was identical among <b>the</b> 3 groups <b>in</b> men, while it was significantly lower in female stone-cutters than in other 2 groups. <b>In</b> men, <b>the</b> protein-energic, the fat-energic and animal protein ratios were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fishermen than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farmers but not different from those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stone-cutters.
