5|$|The English law <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> {{developed}} over the centuries, {{is the basis of}} common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.|$|E

It has, however, changed during the Meiji Restoration, {{and is now}} largely based on the European civil law; notably, the civil code based on the German model still remains in effect. A quasi-jury system has recently came into use, and the <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> also includes {{a bill of rights}} since May 3, 1947.

5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} legal changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy. By {{the middle of}} the 12th century, England had many different ecclesiastical and civil law courts, with overlapping jurisdictions resulting from the interaction of diverse legal traditions. Henry greatly expanded the role of royal justice in England, producing a more coherent <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> summarised {{at the end of his}} reign in the treatise of Glanvill, an early legal handbook. Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and the reforms seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he was probably not personally responsible for creating the new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good administrators to conduct the reforms.|$|E

In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E
40|$|Indigenous {{societies}} have received increasing attention in recent years. Notably, scholars {{and the international}} law community have gradually, but increasingly, recognized indigenous groups 2 ̆ 7 autonomy in past decades. Against this backdrop, indigenous groups have largely continued to maintain their own distinct customs and practices, including their own <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> These groups, though, are also necessarily members of states with their own official <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> And while the systems often coexist without issue, there are numerous instances of indigenous <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> directly conflicting with their official state counterparts 2 ̆ 7. This Comment addresses these discrepancies. After noting the history of indigenous treatment in international law and the <b>system</b> of <b>legal</b> pluralism, this Comment proposes a solution to inconsistent indigenous and state <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> It argues that barring instances of widely recognized international human rights violations, indigenous groups {{should be free to}} develop and implement their own individual <b>legal</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|We build {{a stylized}} model of {{endogenous}} technological change {{and analyze the}} relationship between legal institutions, innovation and growth. Two <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> are analyzed: a rigid system, where an uncontingent law is written ex ante (before knowing the current technology) and a flexible system where law-makers select the law ex post (after observing the current technology). We show that flexible <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> dominate in terms of welfare, amount of innovation and output growth in economies at intermediate stages of technological development [...] which are periods when legal change is more needed [...] while rigid <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> are preferable at early stages of technological development, when commitment problems are more severe.
