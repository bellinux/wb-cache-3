40|$|Part 2 : Parallel and Multi-Core TechnologiesInternational audienceAs {{a widely}} used {{programming}} model and implementation for processing large data sets, MapReduce does not scale well on many-core clusters, which, unfortunately, {{are common in}} current data centers. To deal with the problem, this paper: 1) analyzes the causes of poor scalability of MapReduce on many-core clusters and identifies the key one as the underlying <b>low-speed</b> <b>storage</b> (hard disk) can not {{meet the requirements of}} frequent IO operations, and 2) proposes mpCache, a SSD based hybrid storage system that caches both Input Data and Localized Data, and dynamically tunes the cache space allocation between them to make full use of the space. mpCache has been incorporated into Hadoop and evaluated on a 7 -node cluster by 13 benchmarks. The experimental results show that mpCache gains an average speedup of 2. 09 when compared with the original Hadoop, and achieves an average speedup of 1. 79 when compared with PACMan, the latest in-memory optimization of MapReduce...|$|E

The design is characterized by multiple accumulators, expandable <b>storage,</b> <b>low-speed</b> and high-speed data channels, storage protection, and program interruption. Processing operations include byte manipulation, word comparison, and integer and Â°oating-point arithmetic. Typical operation times are from 2. 5 to 5. 5 microseconds...|$|R
