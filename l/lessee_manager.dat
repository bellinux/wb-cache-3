50|$|Samuel Lazar (1838 - 14 November 1883) was <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of Theatre Royal, Sydney, 1876-1878? 1875 - 1 February 1882? {{and died}} in a lunatic asylum.|$|R
50|$|He died at 44 Huntingdon Street, Haggerston, London, on 31 May 1875, aged 52, leaving two children, a son, Henry Colin Hazlewood (<b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Star Theatre, Wolverhampton) and a daughter.|$|R
25|$|From 1900 to 1903, with {{financial}} support from Edgar Israel Cohen, Langtry became the <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of London's Imperial Theatre, opening on April 21, 1901, following an extensive refurbishment. On {{the site of the}} theatre is now the Westminster Central Hall.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Lazar was <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> from 1870, {{for a time}} in {{partnership}} with one Reuben Mills, suspended while his liquidity was being sorted out, then sole lessee from 1871. James Allison joined him as partner in 1873, became sole lessee around 1876.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his career}} in the theatre he became the <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Theatre Royal, Liverpool and {{proprietor}} of the Royal Amphitheatre, Liverpool(1843). He also managed the Strand Theatre, London, which he called [...] "Punch's Playhouse", from May 1851 to May 1852.|$|R
50|$|Parry {{was soon}} {{involved}} in building further theatres in London. By September 1866, William Sydney (who also managed theatres in Richmond, Norwich & Stockton) {{had become the}} <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager,</b> and Herbert Masson his Musical Director. W. J. Hurlstone, who had been Acting Manager for Parry, was re-engaged in the same role.|$|R
6000|$|DEAR SIR:--The {{comic opera}} by your friends Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan, {{which you have}} {{submitted}} to me, as sole <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Savoy Theatre, is now returned to you unread. The little piece, judged from its title-page, is bright and pleasing, but I have arranged with two other gentlemen to write my operas for the next twenty-one years. Faithfully yours, ...|$|R
50|$|On {{at least}} two {{subsequent}} occasions, the Greenwich Theatre celebrated its Richardson heritage. In April 1868 at Eleanor Bufton's first night as manager, she recited a poem written for the occasion, weaving the Richardson saga around her own. Five years later, at Easter 1873, <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> Mr J. A. Cave reproduced Richardson's performances {{as closely as possible}} and even brought back Paul Herring, veteran clown of the 1820s Fair.|$|R
5000|$|After Cave's {{time the}} theatre {{gradually}} sank {{to a lower}} and lower level and [...] "a once prosperous place was reduced to utter ruin by the incompetence and mismanagement of the speculators". Those speculating managers included Mr Robertson, Mr H C Sidney, Mrs W Lovegrove & Mr George Villiers, and Mr D M'Intosh. In the autumn of 1879 J Aubrey, then Sole <b>Lessee</b> and <b>Manager,</b> soon after presenting his Christmas pantomime was made bankrupt.|$|R
50|$|It was in 1837 that he, in {{conjunction}} with a few others, established the Polytechnic, which was intended for a place of popular instruction, and, indeed, while it was under Bachhoffner's control, sufficiently fulfilled that intention. Here he held the position of principal of the department of natural and experimental philosophy till 1855. Afterwards he became <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Coliseum in the Regent's Park, and there gave lectures similar to the courses he had established at the Polytechnic.|$|R
5000|$|Walter Eugene Tebbetts {{is listed}} as [...] "the {{promoter}} who persuaded Weatherly to build a theatre," [...] {{and was the first}} <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the theater. Tebbetts previously managed the Italian Opera House in Chicago before arriving in Portland around 1909, after which he ran the Empire Theatre and a series of movie theaters, including the Hollywood Theatre. Tebbetts presumably visited the East Indies while travelling abroad in the late 1920s, and wanted a theatre designed to look like an East Indian temple.|$|R
5000|$|In 1871 Craven became {{principal}} scene-painter at the Lyceum Theatre, a role he {{held for}} the next thirty years, first as an employee and later as a freelance artist. At first he worked under the management of H. L. Bateman, and then Bateman's widow. Despite early success with his scenery for the melodrama The Bells, in which Henry Irving made his name, Craven's opportunities were restricted until Irving became <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Lyceum in 1878. Craven, with Irving's support, carried scenic realism and stage illusion to new levels.|$|R
5000|$|Rignold {{made his}} London debut in 1869 in Marie Antoinette at the Princess's Theatre, {{receiving}} a good review from the leading theatrical paper, The Era. [...] He followed this with successful appearances in Dion Boucicault's Presumptive Evidence, which {{played in a}} double bill with Handel's opera Acis and Galatea starring Blanche Cole. Rignold played Sir George Wilson in Robert Buchanan's Joseph's Sweetheart in 1888. In 1890, he appeared at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney, in The Merry Wives of Windsor. The <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> was his brother George, who played Ford to William's Falstaff.|$|R
50|$|The theatre's {{first big}} hit was The Belle of New York {{produced}} by the prominent Broadway producer, George W. Lederer, which opened on 12 April 1898 and ran for an extremely successful 697 performances. In 1908-09 H. B. Irving became the <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the theatre and presented a successful season of plays. Robert Courtneidge was lessee {{for most of the}} early years of the 20th century and produced mostly comic operas and Edwardian musical comedies, including Tom Jones (1907), the record-setting hit The Arcadians (1909), Oh! Oh! Delphine! (1913), The Pearl Girl and many others. In 1914 Basil Rathbone appeared at the Shaftesbury as the Dauphin in Shakespeare's Henry V.|$|R
50|$|Born in Baltimore, it {{was there}} that he made his first real {{appearance}} on the stage as the title character in a play called Brutus, or the Fall of Tarquin (1855), on a stage managed by Joseph Jefferson. Of his many subsequent impersonations, perhaps the best-known is that of Louis XI, at what later became Daly's Theatre in New York. After 1868 he was manager of theatres in St. Louis, New Orleans, and Albany. He was the sole <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Albany Grand Opera House (1884-1894) in Washington, where he also built the Lafayette Square Opera House. He owned the new Lyceum Theatre in Baltimore, where he made his last appearance in 1899 before retiring from the stage.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by {{the famous}} Ravel Brothers to {{undertake}} pantomime, {{he created a}} distinct place {{for that kind of}} entertainment in New York City, first at the National Theatre and later at the New Bowery Theatre, of which he was for a time both <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> in partnership with James R. Lingard. Fox continued to surrounded himself with increasingly competent group of comedians and acrobats that included his brother, Charles Kemble Fox, who had become popular as an actor and a clown performer. Though often overlooked by the theater critics of the day, Fox’s popularity in burlesque houses could at the time be compared to that of Edwin Booth’s playing Hamlet, a role Fox also played except in a much lighter vein.|$|R
5000|$|He {{may have}} {{worked as a}} {{travelling}} salesman for F. E. Hiscocks and Co. of Melbourne, publishers of Australian atlases from 1874. but was associated with Fred Hiscocks and Samuel Lazar from at least 1875 when they were operating the Queen's Theatre, Sydney, and managed Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Williamson's first Sydney appearance. When Lazar took the Williamsons to Melbourne and Adelaide in July 1875 Allison [...] "held the fort" [...] in Sydney as treasurer.Lazar had been <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Theatre Royal, Adelaide since 1870; Allison joined in that management in 1873 and became sole lessee around 1876. It was in that year {{he made his first}} visit to America, arranging for George Rignold to visit the colonies with his grand production of [...] "Henry V.," [...] and introduced to Australia the popular comedian, Fred Thorne.|$|R
6000|$|In any {{portraiture}} of Booth, those years, the Bowery Theatre, {{with its}} leading lights, and the <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager,</b> Thomas Hamblin, cannot be left out. It {{was at the}} Bowery I first saw Edwin Forrest (the play was John Howard Payne's [...] "Brutus, or the Fall of Tarquin," [...] and it affected me for weeks; or rather I might say permanently filter'd into my whole nature,) then in the zenith of his fame and ability. Sometimes (perhaps a veteran's benefit night,) the Bowery would group together five or six of the first-class actors of those days--Booth, Forrest, Cooper, Hamblin, and John R. Scott, for instance. At that time and here George Jones ("Count Joannes") was a young, handsome actor, and quite a favorite. I remember seeing him {{in the title role}} in [...] "Julius Caesar," [...] and a capital performance it was.|$|R
5000|$|An {{entry in}} the Washington Evening Star dated September 29, 1864 {{reported}} that [...] "H. Sargent Jones, of New York, has been appointed to a first class clerkship in the General Post Office Department, at a salary of $1200 per annum". On October 18, 1864, Jones married Ellen (Nellie) Amanda Hovey (1844-1889) in Lexington, Massachusetts. During this period {{and over the next}} few years he performed as a magician and in 1869, became a <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Lyceum Theatre, Boston. In 1870, now known as Harry Sargent, he was involved with the management of theatrical productions in Indianapolis. From there he moved to the National Theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio and after this managed the Athenaeum in Columbus, Ohio, for three seasons. In August, 1873, Harry and Ellen's five year old daughter, Alice Bell, died. In October of the same year Harry Sargent remarried to actress Hannah E. Bailey (1847-1900) ...|$|R
40|$|I {{measured}} T {{and relative}} humidity (RH) regulating properties of randomly-selected soil cracks {{in comparison to}} matched away points, over two summers and two winters. Fat-tailed (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) and stripe-faced (S. macroura) dunnarts were radio-tracked to examine their use of cracks. Cracks consistently moderated T and RH in all seasons, providing more stable conditions than those of away and ambient points. Both dunnart species used cracks almost exclusively. Surveys of 51 SPR <b>lessees</b> and/or <b>managers</b> showed that respondents were generally unaware of the small native vertebrates on their properties. Overall, they agreed with land management strategies, but did not necessarily implement them. Pastoralists’ evaluations of plant palatability and indicators largely matched published reports. Diverse indicators of land condition (all perennial plants) were listed by respondents, suggesting that indicators are highly location specific. Cracking-clay habitats of the SPR are dynamic systems, supporting high biodiversity during La Niña years. Maintaining the integrity of cracks and vegetation is fundamental for ecosystem function in these systems. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{association}} with Mr. and Mrs. William Hunter Kendal at the St. James's Theatre from 1879 to 1888, Hare established his popularity in London in important character and {{men of the}} world parts. The joint management of Hare and Kendal made this theatre {{one of the chief}} centers of the dramatic world for a decade. In 1889 he became <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager</b> of the Garrick Theatre, built by his friend W. S. Gilbert, where (though he was often out of the cast) he produced several important plays, such as Pinero's The Profligate and The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith, and had a remarkable personal success in the chief part in Sydney Grundy's A Pair of Spectacles. In 1897 he took the Globe Theatre, where his acting in Pinero's The Gay Lord Quex was another personal triumph. He became almost as well known in the United States as in England, his last tour in America being in 1900 and 1901.|$|R
5000|$|Col. Alvah Mann, a {{well-known}} circus proprietor, then commenced the erection of it. After spending $14,000, he {{was obliged to}} call in the aid of James R. Raymond, a wealthy touring-menagerie owner, in order to complete the building. George Barrett was the initial acting and stage manager, and assembled the stock company of actors. On January 24, 1848, {{a few months after}} the theatre opened, Mann took a partner, E. A. Marshall, manager of the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, with [...] "the sole management of the Theatre, so far as its dramatic and theatrical arrangements are concerned,…in the hands of Mr. Marshall…." [...] Barrett left and was replaced by William Rufus Blake on February 21. The partnership was dissolved on October 25, 1848, Mann relinquished the building to Raymond, who held a mortgage on it, and Marshall became sole <b>lessee</b> and <b>manager.</b> He remained with the theatre nearly ten more years.|$|R

5000|$|A fire {{broke out}} about 8:40 o'clock on Saturday morning beneath {{the stage of the}} Winter Garden Theatre, {{resulting}} in the entire destruction of that establishment, and doing considerable damage to the Southern Hotel, formerly known as the Lafarge House. Although the Fire Department was promptly on hand, in an incredibly short space of time the flames had wrapped the entire interior of the Winter Garden in a sheet of fire, and the firemen were unable to work therein owing to the intense heat...By 9 o'clock the flames had reached their limit and the spectacle was one of peculiar grandeur and effect...At 9:15 the roof of theatre fell...The aggregate loss is roughly estimated at $250,000.

These gentlemen were the joint <b>lessees</b> and <b>managers</b> of the Winter Garden, and their extensive and valuable wardrobes, used in the recent Shakespearean revivals, as well as a large amount of new scenery and properties, were all destroyed by the flames. These articles were valued at $60,000 and uninsured...Mr. BOOTH is a heavy loser by the total destruction of his private wardrobe and many valuable presents. This wardrobe was considered to be the most extensive and valuable one in the possession of any single actor on this continent.|$|R
3000|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} land {{managers}} are necessarily poor land stewards but rather that the differential governing system of State Trust Lands may offer both opportunities and constraints to land managers. For instance, in Union County, NM, land managers’ long-term security due to the leasing process enables them to make longer-term management decisions. In Cimarron County, OK, on the other hand, controversial leasing policies lead to insecurity and may make it more difficult for land managers to consider long-term sustainability. Given the insecurity generated by leasing policies regarding State Trust Lands in Cimarron County, there is little incentive for land managers to think long term, even though many state that they would like to, or claim to have done so before the open-bidding system was adopted. As Vadjunec and Sheehan (2010, p. 170), who have studied State Trust Land policies in Cimarron County, explain, “with their future now uncertain (in five-year increments with no preferential treatment given to the <b>lessee),</b> many land <b>managers</b> express difficulty caring for leased land like it was their own, as they have done in the past.” [...]...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{research}} on the production and distribution of terra sigillata are frequently used as weighty arguments in the discussion of the character of the Roman economy as a whole. Still, many substantial problems remain under discussion, among them the important question of how the mass production of this ware was organized. By re-examining and combining evidence from various production centres, the present thesis aims to develop a comprehensive model for the organization of terra sigillata production. It employs comparative and complementary approaches to interpret the archaeological and epigraphical material, and also analyzes the underlying social and legal structures. Theoretical conceptions of the organization of pottery production are dealt with, and the role of terra sigillata production in models of ancient economy is discussed. The principal focus of the study is on {{some of the most important}} centres of terra sigillata production in Italy, Gaul, Germany, Spain, and Africa. Although each production centre has its own individual features, common ones prevail. The application of producers' signatures can be explained by the joint use of production facilities, especially drying sheds, and the exchange of moulds. Similarities in the use of signatures are interpreted as indicating similarities in the organization of production, whereas irregularities in their application are looked upon as the result of varying production conditions. The interpretation of the potters' graffiti enables us to postulate the existence of a leasehold system in which the lessor entered into contracts with <b>lessee</b> workshop <b>managers</b> to deliver set numbers of vessels. Firing masters, who were potters themselves and responsible for the operation of the kilns, acted as middlemen or directly on behalf of the lessor, approving and controlling the potters' work. The mode of production in all centres appears to have been a nucleated workshop industry rather than a manufactory, based on a leasehold system and regulated by large-scale traders, with the producers' social status being of little relevance. Thus all arguments founded upon the distinction of Italian slave manufactories and cooperative production of free men in the western provinces are no longer plausible. </p...|$|R
