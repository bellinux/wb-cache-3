5000|$|The {{quartz fiber}} {{dosimeter}} is a rugged {{form of a}} device called a <b>Lauritsen</b> <b>electroscope.</b> [...] It consists of a sealed air-filled cylinder called an ionization chamber. Inside it is a metal electrode strip that {{is attached to a}} terminal {{on the end of the}} pen for recharging. The other end of the electrode has a delicate gold-plated quartz fiber attached to it, which at rest lies parallel to the electrode. The ends of the chamber are transparent and the microscope is focused on the fiber.|$|E
