5|$|M. inclemens {{is one of}} the 11 {{species in}} genus Maevia. The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other names have been used. The two male forms <b>look</b> <b>and</b> behave so {{differently}} that they were originally considered two distinct species. In 1955 Robert Barnes chose M. inclemens, and this has become the standard name.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{disagreed}} {{about how}} the European map should <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> how borders would be drawn, following the war. Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security. The western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations.|$|E
5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E

5|$|DNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle {{to manage}} the shoot; {{it was the first}} time Mantle had worked with 3D. The filmmakers wanted Dredd to have a realistic, visceral <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> drew {{inspiration}} from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E
5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on {{trying to create a}} real-life <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 a new {{master plan}} called 2020 Vision: A Community Concept for the MSU Campus was {{developed}} to guide future campus development. Amongst the recommendations it called for the removing of central campus parking to parking garages replacing it with green space, the removal of head-in parking around West and East Circle Drives, adding more bike lanes and planting more trees on south campus {{in order to give}} it the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel of north campus.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. Airbus says it offers better luggage storage and a quieter cabin, packaged with a more modern <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food hygiene, and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war, veterans, the {{bereaved}} {{and the rest of}} society focused, to the point of obsession, with the problem of death. There was tremendous interest in creating war memorials that celebrated the themes of glory, heroism and loss. In part, there was a rupture or dislocation with the pre-war norms of how memorials should <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel; communities sought to find new, radical ways to mourn the millions of dead, killed in an essentially modern conflict. In other ways, the building of memorials drew on traditional forms and ideas, drawing on existing religious and architectural themes to explore loss and grief.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>looking</b> {{dynamics}} <b>and</b> discrimination form {{the backbone of}} developmental science and are central processes in theories of infant cognition. Looking dynamics and discrimination change dramatically across the 1 st year of life. Surprisingly, developmental changes in <b>looking</b> <b>and</b> discrimination have not been studied together. Recent simulations of a dynamic neural field (DNF) model of infant <b>looking</b> <b>and</b> memory suggest that <b>looking</b> <b>and</b> discrimination do change together over development and arise from a single neurodevelopmental mechanism. We probed this claim by measuring <b>looking</b> dynamics <b>and</b> discrimination along continuous, metrically organized dimensions in 5 -, 7 -, and 10 -month-old infants (N = 119). The results showed that <b>looking</b> dynamics <b>and</b> discrimination changed together over development and are linked within individuals. Quantitative simulations of a DNF model provide insights into the processes that underlie developmental change in <b>looking</b> dynamics <b>and</b> discrimination. Simulation results {{support the view that}} these changes might arise from a single neurodevelopmental mechanis...|$|R

5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} he would find great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in <b>look</b> <b>and</b> performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|Mabel Tolkien {{taught her}} two {{children}} at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.|$|E
60|$|Four days later, a figure, shrunk, shaky, <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> prematurely old, {{with the}} glaze of {{intoxication}} scarcely faded from his eye, walked into Mr. Borley's office. That respectable gentleman <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> again.|$|R

5|$|Madonna's <b>look</b> <b>and</b> {{style of}} dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of}} the female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Many of the textures were {{accumulated}} {{during a}} three-day trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer-generated environments {{of the time}} ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would <b>look</b> <b>and</b> function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.|$|E
5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> {{texture of the}} original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E
