40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the predictivity of restaurant managers 2 ̆ 7 central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores to performance and tenure and how restaurant managers were measured as job-oriented in their central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores. The predictivity of a combination of central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores and subjects 2 ̆ 7 demographic variables to performance and tenure were also explored. The central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores were not found to be a good predictor of performance or tenure. In general, the subjects in this sample were not job-oriented in their central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores. However, they tended to be job-oriented in the aspects of membership of formal organization and technological environment but non-job-oriented in informal personal relations and general everyday experience. Marital status did affect subjects 2 ̆ 7 central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores. Married managers without children seemed to be more job-oriented than managers in any other marital status. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} and analyses how <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> writing {{has grown to}} embrace {{a wider range of}} subjects, sources, and methods – from eminent white male judges to women, minorities, displaced persons, and outsiders – and explains and justifies it as an intellectual project. It considers some of life writing's challenges, shortcomings, and dilemmas, suggesting ways forward. The aim is to advance an important, inter-disciplinary perspective in the making: namely, a more pluralistic, democratic conception of <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> writing, which offers new ways of advancing legal history and socio-legal scholarship, encouraging inter-disciplinary dialogue. It is argued that <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> writing demonstrates the value of historical thinking in comprehending law, politics, and culture; it can also supplement the study of law, helping legal historians and socio-legal scholars to develop new skills and embrace a wider range of participants and audiences, thereby enhancing their ability to engage with public issues and public history...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the extent to}} which selected Indiana superintendents of schools tie work as central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> and to compare leadership behaviors of superintendents identified as having high interest in work and superintendents with low work interest, as perceived by subordinate administrators. Ninety-five of the 116 superintendents invited to participate in the study completed the Central <b>Life</b> <b>Interest</b> Inventory developed by Dubin. Analyses of responses resulted in identification of the intensity to which superintendents viewed work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> Subordinate administrators identified by the twenty-five superintendents identified as having high commitment to work and subordinate administrators identified by the twenty-five superintendents identified as having low interest in work were invited to evaluate respective superintendents by means of the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire- - Form XII. Twelve null hypotheses were developed to facilitate determination of statistically significant differences between subordinate administrator evaluative response of superintendents having high interest in work and superintendents having low interest in work. Statistical treatment of the twelve hypotheses was accomplished by means of the chi-square test of significance. The. 05 level of confidence was established as the critical probability level for the non-acceptance of hypotheses. Findings relative to the first study purpose, which was to measure the extent to which selected Indiana superintendents view work as central <b>life</b> <b>interest,</b> were: 1. Thirty-two, or 33. 6 percent, of the ninety-five participating superintendents had a high interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> 2. Eighteen earlier studies had measured the extent to which persons in various occupations viewed work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> When superintendents were compared and contrasted, nine occupational groups reflected higher interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> and nine groups reflected lower interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> Superintendents had a higher interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> than lumber workers, truck drivers, American factory workers, secondary teachers, elementary teachers, principals, industrial arts teachers, clerical workers, and British factory workers. Superintendents had a lower interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> than management personnel in Japanese industry, cooperative extension agents, nurses, Amana Colony workers, management personnel in American industry, middle managers in Oregon, middle managers in seven states, industrial supervisors, and German industrial workers. Findings relative to the second study purpose, a comparison of the leadership behaviors of the high and low superintendent groups as measured by perceptions of subordinate administrators using the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire [...] Form XII instrument, were no statistically significant differences were found to exist for the three specific leadership behaviors factors of Representation, Demand Reconciliation, and Initiation of Structures. Statistically significant differences were found to exist for each of the nine specific leadership factors of Tolerance of Uncertainty, Persuasiveness, Tolerance of Freedom, Role Assumption, Consideration, Production Emphasis, Predictive Accuracy, Integration, and Superior Orientation. The major conclusion relative to the first study purpose was that even though relatively small percentages of superintendents might score as having high commitment to work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest,</b> superintendents as a group do have high professional standards and are committed to performing job responsibilities effectively and efficiently. The major conclusion relative to the second study purpose as that superintendents with a high commitment to work as a central lire interest, are perceived by subordinates as being more effective leaders.

50|$|In {{the example}} of a <b>life</b> <b>{{interest}}</b> trust, the interest in possession ends when the income beneficiary, also called the life tenant, dies. The capital of the trust will then pass to another beneficiary (or more than one). Where a charity has the right to income under a trust, it will also have an interest in possession, but this will clearly not be a <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> trust - an example would be a trust under which an art gallery has the right to display works owned by the trustees for a certain period.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was fourfold. The first purpose was to {{determine}} the degree to which Indiana high school athletic directors consider work to be a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> The second {{purpose of the}} study was to determine if there is a significant difference between the proportions of athletic directors of small and large high schools determined to be work oriented as measured by the Central <b>Life</b> <b>Interest</b> Inventory. The third {{purpose of the study}} was to determine if there is a significant difference in the leadership effectiveness of athletic directors who are highly interested in their work as compared to athletic directors who are least interested in their work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> The fourth {{purpose of the study was}} to determine if there is a significant difference between the leadership effectiveness of athletic directors who are intensely interested in being athletic director in either small or large high schools. The Central <b>Life</b> <b>Interest</b> Inventory and the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire – Form XII were utilized to gather data. Three null hypotheses were tested using the Multivariate Analysis of Variance. The. 05 level of significance was established as the critical probability level for the non-acceptance of hypotheses. Conclusions 1. Thirty-one, or 24 %, of the one-hundred and thirty-one athletic directors participating in the study consider their work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> 2. A statistical analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> between the proportions of work oriented athletic directors from the small and large high schools. 3. A statistical analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference between the average ratings of Group I (highly interested in work) and Group II (least interested in work) when rated by subordinate head coaches relative to the twelve factors of leadership. 4. A statistical analysis showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the average ratings of small and large high school athletic directors by subordinate head coaches relative to the twelve factors of leadership. However, the difference was not interpretable using the Univariate Analysis of Variance statistics. Department of Secondary, Higher, and Foundations of EducationThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
