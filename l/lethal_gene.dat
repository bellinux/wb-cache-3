50|$|Release of Insects {{carrying}} Dominant Lethals (RIDL) is {{a control}} strategy using genetically engineered insects that have (carry) a <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> in their genome (an organism's DNA). Lethal genes cause death in an organism, and RIDl genes only kill young insects, usually larvae or pupae. Similar to how inheritance of brown eyes is dominant to blue eyes, this <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> is dominant {{so that all}} offspring of the RIDL insect will also inherit the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene.</b> This <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> has a molecular on and off switch, allowing these RIDL insects to be reared. The <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> is turned off when the RIDL insects are mass reared in an insectory, and turned on when they are released into the environment. RIDL males and females are released to mate with wild males and their offspring die when they reach the larval or pupal stage because of the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene.</b> This causes the population of insects to crash. This technique is being developed for some insects and for other insects has been tested in the field. It {{has been used in}} the Grand Cayman Islands, Panama, and Brazil to control the mosquito vector of dengue, Ae. aegypti. It is being developed for use in diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), medfly and olive fly.|$|E

40|$|Background: Identification {{of genes}} that are {{synthetic}} lethal to p 53 {{is an important}} strategy for anticancer therapy as p 53 mutations {{have been reported to}} occur in {{more than half of all}} human cancer cases. Although genomewide RNAi screening is an effective approach to finding synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>genes,</b> it is costly and labor-intensive. Methods: To illustrate this approach, we identified potentially druggable <b>genes</b> synthetically <b>lethal</b> for p 53 using three microarray datasets for gene expression profiles of the NCI- 60 cancer cell lines, one next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and one gene expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. We selected the genes which encoded kinases and had significantly higher expression in the tumors with functional p 53 mutations (somatic mutations) than in the tumors without functional p 53 mutations as the candidates of druggable synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> for p 53. We identified important regulatory networks and functional categories pertinent to these genes, and performed an extensive survey of literature to find experimental evidence that support the synthetic lethality relationships between the genes identified and p 53. We also examined the drug sensitivity difference between NCI- 60 cell lines with functional p 53 mutations and NCI- 60 cell lines without functional p 53 mutations for the compounds that target the kinases encoded by the genes identified. Results: Our results indicated that some of the candidate genes we identified had been experimentally verified to be synthetic lethal for p 53 and promising targets for anticancer therapy while some other genes were putative targets for development of cancer therapeutic agents. Conclusions: Our study indicated that pre-screening of potential synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> using gene expression profiles is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of synthetic lethal RNAi screening...|$|R

50|$|Lethal alleles (also {{referred}} to as <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> or <b>lethals)</b> are alleles that cause {{the death of the}} organism that carries them. They are usually a result of mutations in genes that are essential to growth or development.

40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristics}} of human disease genes were investigated through a comparative analysis with mouse mutant phenotype data. Mouse orthologs with mutations {{that resulted in}} discernible phenotypes were separated from mutations with no phenotypic defect, listing ‘phenotype’ and ‘no phenotype’ genes. First, we showed that phenotype genes {{are more likely to}} be disease genes compared to no phenotype genes. Phenotype genes were further divided into ‘embryonic lethal’, ‘postnatal lethal’, and ‘non-lethal phenotype’ groups. Interestingly, embryonic <b>lethal</b> <b>genes,</b> the most essential genes in mouse, were less likely to be disease <b>genes</b> than postnatal <b>lethal</b> <b>genes.</b> These findings indicate that some extremely essential genes are less likely to be disease genes, although human disease genes tend to display {{characteristics of}} essential genes. We also showed that, in <b>lethal</b> groups, non-disease <b>genes</b> tend to evolve slower than disease genes indicating a strong purifying selection on non-disease genes in this group. In addition, phenotype and no phenotype groups showed differing types of disease mutations. Disease genes in the no phenotype group displayed a higher frequency of regulatory mutations while those in the phenotype group had more frequent coding mutations, indicating that the types of disease mutations vary depending on gene essentiality. Furthermore, missense disease mutations in no phenotype genes were found to be more radical amino acid substitutions than those in phenotype genes...|$|R

50|$|In 1949 Allison {{participated in}} a {{vocational}} Oxford University Expedition to Mount Kenya. He took up the task of collecting blood samples from Kenyans for analyses of blood groups and genetic markers such as for sickle-cell disease. At {{the time it was}} a scientific puzzle that the disease was prevalent even though it killed people before they reached puberty, before they can have children to pass on the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene.</b> He found that the prevalence of sickle-cell trait (heterozygous condition) among people inhabiting coastal areas was higher than 20%. (At the time the highest record was 8% among African-Americans.) He was posed with the question as to why such a deadly disease (in homozygous condition) would be more prevalent in a localised area {{in the form of a}} less lethal heterozygous form. He formulated a hypothesis that it was because it had selective advantage towards malaria. Because the region was malaria endemic, acquiring a genetic mutation, but not the lethal form, could confer resistance to Plasmodium falciparum. To test his hypothesis he had to wait four years until he completed his medical course. He returned to Nairobi in 1953 to start his experiments. He selected volunteers of the Luo people, who came from malaria hyperendemic area around Lake Victoria. Under experimental infection, volunteers indicated partial resistance to malaria. Then he found children naturally infected with malaria in Buganda. He discovered that children with heterozygous trait had significantly low number of parasites in their blood. This implies further that heterozygosity in children acquired better survival rate against malaria. His final results reported in 1954 from nearly 5,000 East Africans indicated the overall picture: sickle-cell trait confers resistance to malaria.|$|E
40|$|Background: Embryonic {{lethality}} is {{a recognized}} phenotypic expression of individual gene mutations in model organisms. However, identifying embryonic <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> in humans is challenging, {{especially when the}} phenotype is manifested at the preimplantation stage. Results: In an ongoing effort to exploit the highly consanguineous nature of the Saudi population to catalog recessively acting embryonic <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> in humans, we have identified two families with a female-limited infertility phenotype. Using autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing, we map this phenotype to a single mutation in TLE 6, a maternal effect gene that encodes {{a member of the}} subcortical maternal complex in mammalian oocytes. Consistent with the published phenotype of mouse Tle 6 mutants, embryos from female patients who are homozygous for the TLE 6 mutation fail to undergo early cleavage, with resulting sterility. The human mutation abrogates TLE 6 phosphorylation, a step that is reported to be critical for the PKA-mediated progression of oocyte meiosis II. Furthermore, the TLE 6 mutation impairs its binding to components of the subcortical maternal complex. Conclusion: In this first report of a human defect in a member of the subcortical maternal subcritical maternal complex, we show that the TLE 6 mutation is gender-specific and leads to the earliest known human embryonic lethality phenotype...|$|R

40|$|Published onlineJournal ArticleBACKGROUND: Identification of {{synthetic}} lethal interactions in cancer cells could offer promising new therapeutic targets. Large-scale functional genomic screening presents {{an opportunity to}} test large numbers of cancer synthetic lethal hypotheses. Methods enriching for candidate synthetic lethal targets in molecularly defined cancer cell lines can steer effective design of screening efforts. Loss of one partner of a synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pair creates a dependency on the other, thus synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairs should never show simultaneous loss-of-function. We have developed a computational approach to mine large multi-omic cancer data sets and identify gene pairs with mutually exclusive loss-of-function. Since loss-of-function {{may not always be}} genetic, we look for deleterious mutations, gene deletion and/or loss of mRNA expression by bimodality defined with a novel algorithm BiSEp. RESULTS: Applying this toolkit to both tumour cell line and patient data, we achieve statistically significant enrichment for experimentally validated tumour suppressor genes and synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairings. Notably non-reliance on genetic loss reveals a number of known synthetic lethal relationships otherwise missed, resulting in marked improvement over genetic-only predictions. We go on to establish biological rationale surrounding a number of novel candidate synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairs with demonstrated dependencies in published cancer cell line shRNA screens. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a multi-omic approach to define gene loss-of-function, and enrich for candidate synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairs in cell lines testable through functional screens.

40|$|The {{interest}} for cultivation -independent molecular approaches that extract DNA {{directly from the}} environment is related to their capacity to overcome biases in isolation and in vitro cultivation of bacteria, thus providing new possibilities {{in the search for}} knowledge within the "black box" of soil microbiology. However, "classical" metagenomic methods are time-and money-intensive requiring construction and screening of million-clone DNA libraries to cover the huge bacterial diversity. Our objective is to develop a complementary method to the traditional metagenomic approaches, based on the use of a specifically engineered recipient E. coli strain to capture genes from soil bacteria after transformation with metagenome DNA. The so-called "Genefish" method is based on the use of specific sequences cloned into the recipient strain to serve as template for homeologous recombination with corresponding DNA present in the metagenome.
