The college built a science building in 1886, lending more <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created.

Jadwiga's death undermined Władysław's right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of Lesser Poland, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Celje, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimised his reign.|$|E

Aldona had two daughters: Cunigunde (d. 1357) married Louis VI the Roman, the son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Elisabeth (d. 1361) married Duke Bogislaw V of Pomerania, an area in modern-day Germany and Poland.

5|$|These desertions alarmed Gaddafi, as the GUNT {{provided}} {{a cover of}} <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> Libya's presence in Chad.

5000|$|Moral {{legitimacy}} {{is dependent}} upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral. In other words, if the constituency believe the organization is breaking {{the rules of the}} political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy. Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections: consequential legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, structural legitimacy, and personal legitimacy. Consequential <b>legitimacy</b> relates <b>to</b> what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). [...] In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.

5000|$|Additionally, it is {{important}} to note that the logic of legitimation strongly depends on the system of domination deployed. In fact, it's the logic of legitimation that informs the concrete ways citizens and subjects comply to authority and/or contend with authority. In other words, the basis for any claim <b>to</b> <b>legitimacy</b> is often the basis for resistance against that same claim <b>to</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> For example, in some societies the economic achievements under a particular regime or government form the basis for its legitimation claims; in those societies, counterclaims <b>to</b> <b>legitimacy</b> will often highlight economic failures in order to strategically undermine the regime or government's authority. Max Weber, who first advanced this point, summarizes it below: ...|$|R
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E
5|$|By summer 821, Thomas had {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He {{set his sights on}} the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built siege machines. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the Cibyrrhaeot and Aegean Sea naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of Hellas. Thomas recalled Gregory Pterotos, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of Skyros, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to Thomas had finished assembling at Lesbos, and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards Abydos, where he intended to cross over into Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> rule was {{ultimately}} decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.|$|E

France agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces.

The Jaffna society is separated by castes. Historically, the Vellalar, who form approximately fifty percent of the population, were involved in agriculture, using the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil for group of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar. Others such as the Karaiyar, existed outside the agriculture-based caste system. The caste of temple priests known as Iyers were also held in high esteem.|$|E
5|$|Mercia {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of venerating royal saints and this was enthusiastically supported by Æthelred and Æthelflæd.

She may also have translated the relics of the martyred Northumbrian prince Ealhmund from Derby to Shrewsbury. In 910 the Danes retaliated against the English attack of the previous year by invading Mercia, raiding as far as Bridgnorth in Shropshire. On their way back they were caught by an English army in Staffordshire and their army was destroyed at the Battle of Tettenhall, opening the way for the recovery of the Danish Midlands and East Anglia over the next decade.|$|E

Suffolk then fled disguised as a groom, reaching London by way of St Albans. He soon returned to Bury with a force of 500 lances, and met little resistance.

In the rebellion Suffolk suffered financially: the peasants plundered property worth £1,000 from his castle at Mettingham.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état (Lithuanian: 1926-ųjų perversmas) was a {{military}} coup d'état in Lithuania {{that resulted in the}} replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona. The coup took place on 17 December 1926 and was largely organized by the military; Smetona's role remains the subject of debate. The coup brought the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the most conservative party at the time, to power. Before 1926, it had been a fairly new and insignificant nationalistic party: in 1926, its membership numbered about 2,000 and it had won only three seats in the parliamentary elections. The Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, the largest party in the Seimas at the time, collaborated with the military and provided constitutional <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> the coup, but did not accept any major posts in the new government and withdrew in May 1927. After the military handed power over to the civilian government, it ceased playing a direct role in political life.|$|E

Further negotiations attempted to deliver a general peace agreement but Queen Matilda was unwilling to offer any compromise to the Empress, and Robert refused to accept any offer to encourage him to change sides to Stephen. Instead, in November the two sides simply exchanged Robert and the King, and Stephen began re-establishing his authority.

Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship; rituals performed by the brahmins gave <b>legitimacy</b> <b>to</b> kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society {{to the level of}} wealthy landowners. Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause. Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the Narayanaswami temples at Nanjangud, Sattur and Hangala in modern Mysore district.
