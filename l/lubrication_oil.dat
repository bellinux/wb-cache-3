5|$|World War II was a {{demanding}} {{time for the}} railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, {{and much of the}} equipment and maintenance was lacking. On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the effect of oil-air {{lubrication}} on traditional sliding bearing, the experiments oil-air <b>lubrication</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>lubrication</b> have been done by using friction-abrasion testing machine. By means of measuring friction moment, the temperature rise of two different lubrication systems in the same conditions and studying the friction moment and the temperature rise of oil-air <b>lubrication</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>lubrication</b> with different load at the same rotating speed level, the results obtained show that when rotating speed and oil supply is at 210 rpm and 1. 4 L/h level, the friction moment of traditional sliding bearing with <b>oil</b> <b>lubrication</b> increases significantly after the load 900 N, and when rotating speed, oil supply and air pressure is at 210 rpm, 30 ml/h and 0. 25 MPa level, the friction moment of traditional sliding bearing with oil-air lubrication increases significantly after the load 1500 N. The friction moment of oil-air <b>lubrication</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>lubrication</b> is almost the same before the load 900 N, and after the load 900 N, the friction moment of oil-air lubrication is {{much lower than the}} <b>oil</b> <b>lubrication.</b> The oil-air lubrication temperature rise is much lower than the <b>oil</b> <b>lubrication</b> in traditional sliding bearing with the same experimental conditions...|$|R

2500|$|Due to delays {{during the}} {{refitting}} and later {{problems with the}} steam heating system, the first voyage of SuomenJoutsen was delayed until late December. Captain Arvo Lieto proposed postponing the departure until the next autumn as Christmas was drawing near and the sea was already freezing, but on 21 December 1931 President P. E. Svinhufvud ordered the ship to begin her first international school sailing under the Finnish flag. SuomenJoutsen was towed to the sea on the following day, {{but she had to}} wait for favourable winds outside Porkkala until 28 December, at which point she had already been grounded once. The streak of bad luck continued when the ship was anchored in Trongisvágsfjørður in Suðuroy, Faroe Islands, after stopping to purchase more <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> at Trongisvágur. SuomenJoutsen dragged her anchors in a storm measuring 11–12 on the Beaufort scale, drifting stern first towards the shore. After two trawlers and a tugboat managed to get the full rigged ship safely to the harbour, it was found out that the rudder had been damaged and the ship was towed to England for drydocking. After repairs, SuomenJoutsen continued to the Canary Islands, where she remained for three weeks while Captain Lieto was relieved of command and replaced by John Konkola, who served as the captain of the school ship for six full and two partial voyages. From the Canary Islands, SuomenJoutsen headed south, but the refrigeration system failed [...] before the Equator and she had to turn back before a line-crossing ceremony could be held. However, the crew got some consolation when news about the end of prohibition in Finland reached the ship while she was sailing towards Finland in the Baltic Sea. SuomenJoutsen arrived in Finland on 22 May 1932 and was drydocked at Suomenlinna shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{preliminary}} study {{for the development of}} a co-pyrolysis process of plastic wastes excavated from a landfill and used <b>lubrication</b> <b>oils,</b> with the aim to produce an alternative liquid fuel for industrial use. First, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out with pure plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) and oils (a motor oil and a mixture of used <b>lubrication</b> <b>oils)</b> in order to highlight the interactions occurring between a plastic and an oil during their co-pyrolysis. It appears that the main decomposition event of each component takes place at higher temperatures when the components are mixed than when they are alone, possibly because the two components stabilize each other during their co-pyrolysis. These interactions depend on the nature of the plastic and the oil. In addition, co-pyrolysis experiments were led in a lab-scale reactor using a mixture of excavated plastic wastes and used <b>lubrication</b> <b>oils.</b> On the one hand, the influence of some key operating parameters on the outcome of the process was analyzed. It was possible to produce an alternative fuel for industrial use whose viscosity is lower than 1 Pa s at 90 °C, from a plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction between 40 % and 60 %, by proceeding at a maximum temperature included in the range 350 – 400 °C. On the other hand, the amount of energy required to successfully co-pyrolyze, in lab conditions, 1 kg of plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction of 60 % was estimated at about 8 MJ. That amount of energy is largely used for the thermal cracking of the molecules. It is also shown that, per kg of mixture introduced in the lab reactor, 29 MJ can be recovered from the combustion of the liquid resulting from the co-pyrolysis. Hence, this co-pyrolysis process could be economically viable, provided heat losses are addressed carefully when designing an industrial reactor. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R
