5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E

50|$|The term 'arousal value' {{is used to}} {{describe}} the consequences of deviations from expectations. When individuals' expectations are violated, their interests or attentions are aroused. When arousal occurs, one's interest or <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the deviation increases, resulting in <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> paid <b>to</b> the message and more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the source of the arousal.|$|R
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million to produce, it earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E
5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> social stimuli, smile {{and look at}} others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
40|$|Business-to-business pricing {{research}} has often focused on developing rational and normative frameworks and models for pricing issues, strategies and tactics. However, {{there has been}} <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> given <b>to</b> behavioral models that {{help us understand the}} realities of pricing and how managers actually set prices. Specifically, there has been <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> given <b>to</b> the various individual and group influences on the price setting process. We apply insights from a steadily increasing body of literature on behavioral decision making to identify some relevant behavioral issues that may affect managerial price setting processes in business-to-business contexts. We conclude with some implications for theory building and practice and an agenda for future research...|$|R

25|$|A study {{published}} in the conference PPIG evaluated the effects of syntax highlighting on the comprehension of short programs, finding that the presence of syntax highlighting significantly reduces the time taken for a programmer to internalise the semantics of a program. Additionally, data gathered from an eye-tracker during the study suggested that syntax highlighting enables programmers to pay <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> standard syntactic components such as keywords.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} classifications of Nanai dialects. Early classifications {{tended to be}} areal and paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{criteria}} for the differentiation of dialects. Lipskoy-Val'rond's classification, which distinguishes seven dialects, {{is one example of}} this; he distinguished the Sungari, Upper Amur, Ussuri, Urmi, Kur, Central Amur, and Lower Amur dialects. In the 1920s, the period of initial studies of the Nanai language, the area of settlement of the Nanai people was more extensive than at present; many dialects, which had not yet been classified by researchers, later disappeared, and remain unnamed.|$|E

25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{quarantine}} checkpoints instituted by Peter I {{and expanded}} by Catherine II were sufficient to prevent plague from reaching {{inside the country}} in peacetime, but they proved to be inadequate in time of war. The system regarded all epidemics as external threats, focusing on border control, and paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> domestic measures. The epidemic blocked the logistics of Rumyantsev's army, and as the state tried to push more reserves and supplies to the theatre, peacetime quarantine controls had to be lifted. Plague swept into Poland and Ukraine; by August 1770 it reached Bryansk. Catherine refused to admit the plague in public, although she was clearly aware {{of the nature and}} proportions of the threat, as evidenced by her letters to Governor of Moscow Pyotr Saltykov.|$|E
25|$|Visually, the carpets {{serve to}} draw {{attention}} either to an important person, or to highlight a location where significant action is going on. In parallel {{with the development of}} Renaissance painting, initially mainly Christian saints and religious scenes are set out on the carpets. Later on, the carpets were integrated into secular contexts, but always served to represent the idea of opulence, exoticism, luxury, wealth, or status. First, their use was reserved for the most powerful and most wealthy, for royalty and nobility. Later on, as more people gained sufficient wealth to afford goods of luxury, Oriental carpets appeared on the portraits of merchants and wealthy burghers. During the late 17th and 18th century, the interest in depicting carpets declined. In parallel, the paintings pay <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail.|$|E

25|$|Holbein painted {{most of his}} portraits {{during his}} two periods in England. In the first, between 1526 and 1528, he used the {{technique}} of Jean Clouet for his preliminary studies, combining black and coloured chalks on unprimed paper. In the second, from 1532 to his death, he drew on smaller sheets of pink-primed paper, adding pen and brushwork in ink to the chalk. Judging by the three-hour sitting {{given to him by}} Christina of Denmark, Holbein could produce such portrait studies quickly. Some scholars believe that he used a mechanical device to help him trace the contours of his subjects' faces. Holbein paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> facial tones in his later drawings, making fewer and more emphatic strokes, but they are never formulaic. His grasp of spatial relationships ensures that each portrait, however sparely drawn, conveys the sitter's presence.|$|E
25|$|When the Allies {{contemplated}} turning Klaipėda into a free {{city like}} Danzig, Polish Foreign Minister Konstanty Skirmunt believed {{that such a}} free city would hurt the Polish interest by allowing Germany to maintain its influence in the region. Skirmunt instead supported {{the transfer of the}} region to Lithuania if Poland would secure unrestricted trade via the Neman River and the port. At the same time Poland was preoccupied by other issues (assassination of President Gabriel Narutowicz, economic crisis, territorial disputes in Silesia, tense relations with Soviet Russia) and paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Klaipėda. Lithuania understood that a military action against Polish interest in the region could resume the Polish–Lithuanian War. To counter the expected backlash from Poland and France, the Lithuanians looked for an ally in Soviet Russia, which opposed a strong Polish state. On November 29, Soviet Foreign Minister Georgy Chicherin stopped briefly in Kaunas on his way to Berlin. In a conversation with Galvanauskas, Chicherin expressed support for Lithuanian plans in Klaipėda and declared that Soviet Russia would not remain passive if Poland moved against Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|Hitler {{had issued}} orders that the Siegfried Line {{was to be}} held at all costs. The rapid Allied {{penetration}} of the border fortifications had disrupted German communications, command structure, and their entire defense of {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. It would have been logical to fall back to the east side of the Rhine and regroup, but Hitler absolutely refused to allow a retreat and irrationally demanded that his Army recapture the territory it had lost. Units that were threatened with the possibility of being overrun or surrounded could not fall back to a more defensible position. To protect themselves from Hitler's wrath, a court-martial and a firing squad, commanders falsified reports to cover actual losses. To shift the blame to someone else, they issued orders that could not be realistically fulfilled. The German troops, thoroughly routed by the beating they had been receiving, could not hold on to the area they controlled, much less retake ground. As a result, the Americans advanced even more rapidly towards the Rhine. An unintended consequence was that German forces paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the bridges across the Rhine.|$|E

40|$|Two {{challenges}} in computer vision are to accommodate noisy data and missing data. Many problems in computer vision, such as segmentation, filtering, stereo, reconstruction, inpainting and optical flow seek solutions that match the data while satisfying an additional regularization, such as total variation or boundary length. A regularization which has received <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> is <b>to</b> minimize the {{curvature of the}} solution. One reason why this regularization has received <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> is due <b>to</b> the difficulty in finding an optimal solution to this image model, since many existing methods are complicated, slow and/or provide a suboptimal solution. Following the recent progress of Schoenemann et al. [28], we provide a simple formulation of curvature regularization which admits a fast optimization which gives globally optimal solutions in practice. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} method by applying this curvature regularization to image segmentation. 1...|$|R

25|$|Some slaveholders made {{a profit}} by selling surplus slaves to traders for {{transport}} {{to the markets}} of the Deep South, where the demand was still high for field hands on cotton plantations. In contrast to the near-unanimity of voters in the seven cotton states in the lower South, which held {{the highest number of}} slaves, the border slave states were bitterly divided about secession and were not eager to leave the Union. Border Unionists hoped that a compromise would be reached, and they assumed that Lincoln would not send troops to attack the South. Border secessionists paid <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the slavery issue in 1861, since their states' economies were based more on trade with the North than on cotton. Their main concern in 1861 was federal coercion; some residents viewed Lincoln's call to arms as a repudiation of the American traditions of states' rights, democracy, liberty, and a republican form of government. Secessionists insisted that Washington had usurped illegitimate powers in defiance of the Constitution, and thereby had lost its legitimacy. After Lincoln issued a call for troops, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina promptly seceded and joined the Confederacy. A secession movement began in western Virginia, where most farmers were yeomen and not slaveholders, to break away and remain in the Union.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay <b>less</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E
