5000|$|R-values stated on {{packaging}} {{are based}} on laboratory conditions; air infiltration can significantly reduce effectiveness, particularly for fiberglass <b>loose</b> <b>fill.</b> Cellulose inhibits convection more effectively. In general, <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> is seen as being better at reducing the presence of gaps in insulation than batts, as the cavity is sealed more carefully. Air infiltration through the insulating material itself is not studied well, but would be lower for wet-spray insulations such as wet-spray cellulose.|$|E

40|$|Rainfall is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of slope failure. Surface erosion, surface infiltration and movement of ground water are possible triggering mechanisms of failure in <b>loose</b> <b>filled</b> slope. The variation in stress state of soil due to the rise of ground water level and seepage of ground water is critical to the deformation and failure of slope during and after heavy rainfall. The deformation of slope caused by change of ground water level was investigated by adopting a fully coupled procedure and the state-dependent dilatant sand model. The effect of the rise of ground water level was simulated by increasing the mass density of pore water in the soil elements between the initial and targeted ground water levels. The interaction between pore water and soil skeleton including both buoyancy and seepage effects could be precisely taken into account in a fully coupled effective stress approach. A <b>loose</b> <b>filled</b> slope, a compacted filled slope and a rock filled slope were analyzed. It was indicated that the density of the filled soil and the drainage condition of the slope were the major factors controlling the deformation and failure of slope caused by the rise of ground water level...|$|R

50|$|The thermal {{performance}} of <b>loose</b> <b>filled</b> cellulose compares favorably to {{other types of}} low cost insulation, but is {{lower than that of}} polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams. The thermal conductivity of loose-fill cellulose is approximately 40 mW/m·K (R-value: metric R2.6 per 100 mm; imperial R3.8 per inch) which is about the same as or slightly better than glass wool or rock wool. This doesn’t represent the whole picture of {{thermal performance}}. Other important aspects are how well the building envelope is sealed from air infiltration, convective airflows, and thermal bridging.|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{design of}} {{landfills}} {{requires an understanding}} of the dynamic properties of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the dynamic site response of landfill waste during seismic events. The dynamic response of the Mavallipura landfill situated in Bangalore, India, is investigated using field measurements, laboratory studies and recorded ground motions from the intraplate region. The dynamic shear modulus values for the MSW were established on the basis of field measurements of shear wave velocities. Cyclic triaxial testing was performed on reconstituted MSW samples and the shear modulus reduction and damping characteristics of MSW were studied. Ten ground motions were selected based on regional seismicity and site response parameters have been obtained considering one-dimensional non-linear analysis in the DEEPSOIL program. The surface spectral response varied from 0. 6 to 2 g and persisted only for a period of 1 s for most of the ground motions. The maximum peak ground acceleration (PGA) obtained was 0. 5 g and the minimum and maximum amplifications are 1. 35 and 4. 05. Amplification of the base acceleration was observed at the top surface of the landfill underlined by a composite soil layer and bedrock for all ground motions. Dynamic seismic properties with amplification and site response parameters for MSW landfill in Bangalore, India, are presented in this paper. This study shows that MSW has less shear stiffness and more amplification due to <b>loose</b> <b>filling</b> and damping, which need to be accounted for seismic design of MSW landfills in India...|$|R
5000|$|Glass wool is {{a thermal}} {{insulation}} {{that consists of}} intertwined and flexible glass fibers, which causes it to [...] "package" [...] air, resulting in a low density that can be varied through compression and binder content (as noted above, these air cells are the actual insulator). Glass wool can be a <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> material, blown into attics, or, together with an active binder sprayed {{on the underside of}} structures, sheets and panels {{that can be used to}} insulate flat surfaces such as cavity wall insulation, ceiling tiles, curtain walls as well as ducting.

50|$|The primary waste liquids {{cleaning}} and purification {{action in a}} drain field is performed by a biofilm in the <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high, or is exposed to fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates {{down to the water}} table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the aquifer. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.|$|E
50|$|R-values of {{products}} may deteriorate over time. For instance the compaction of <b>loose</b> <b>fill</b> cellulose creates voids that reduce overall performance; {{this may be}} avoided by densely packing the initial installation. Some types of foam insulation, such as polyurethane and polyisocyanurate are blown with heavy gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs). However, over time {{a small amount of}} these gases diffuse out of the foam and are replaced by air, thus reducing the effective R-value of the product. There are other foams which do not change significantly with aging because they are blown with water or are open-cell and contain no trapped CFCs or HFCs (e.g., half-pound low density foams). On certain brands, twenty-year tests have shown no shrinkage or reduction in insulating value.|$|E

Later the mine widens gradually and becomes more contorted, with blackish or brownish frass coiled or in <b>loose</b> pellets <b>filling</b> about two thirds of mine width. The exit hole is located on the leaf upperside. Mines in the thinner leaves of Pistacia terebinthus consist of a narrow gallery throughout. The gallery gradually widens with the frass leaving clear margins, occasionally the frass line becomes wider.|$|R
5000|$|A. hydrophila {{is not as}} {{pathogenic}} {{to humans}} {{as it is to}} fish and amphibians. One of the diseases it can cause in humans, gastroenteritis, occurs mostly in young children and people who have compromised immune systems or growth problems. This bacterium is linked to two types of gastroenteritis. The first type is a disease similar to cholera, which causes rice-water diarrhea. The other type is dysenteric gastroenteritis, which causes <b>loose</b> stools <b>filled</b> with blood and mucus. Dysenteric gastroenteritis is the most severe out of the two types, and can last for several weeks. A. hydrophila is also associated with cellulitis. It also causes diseases such as myonecrosis and eczema in people with compromised or suppressed (by medication) immune systems. [...] In very rare cases, A. hydrophila can cause necrotizing fasciitis.|$|R
500|$|Ida is a {{distinctly}} elongated asteroid, with an irregular surface. Ida is 2.35 {{times as long}} as it is wide, and a [...] "waist" [...] separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves. This constricted shape is consistent with Ida being made of two large, solid components, with <b>loose</b> debris <b>filling</b> the gap between them. However, no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by Galileo. Although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50° on Ida, the slope generally does not exceed 35°. Ida's irregular shape is responsible for the asteroid's very uneven gravitational field. The surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed. It is also low near the [...] "waist" [...] because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves, away from this location.|$|R
