5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year <b>later</b> <b>it</b> was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months <b>later.</b> <b>It</b> continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ignacio formed {{first as}} a {{depression}} {{in an area of}} disturbed weather on August 17. Twelvehours <b>later,</b> <b>it</b> organized into a tropical storm. Its location of tropical cyclone formation was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones develop. Steering currents pulled Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio never intensified beyond 40mph (65km/h) and then was downgraded into a depression on August 18. It last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 24 hours <b>later.</b> <b>It</b> was then absorbed by a cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|E

5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception.

Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|A later popular Polish legend {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years <b>later.</b> <b>It</b> is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E

5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades <b>later,</b> <b>it</b> {{has been suggested}} that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E

On October 30, Tropical Storm Maysak moved into the Central Pacific basin while it was weakening until dissipated few hours later. The CPHC never issued advisories on the system.|$|E

Increased wind shear caused the system to weaken as it turned back to the west, dissipating over Madagascar on January24. On Réunion, the system dropped about 100mm (4in) of rainfall, including a total of 50mm (2in) falling in a 90minute period in Cape Bernard.|$|E

The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which {{is compounded by the}} effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
