5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine {{does not}} have an {{official}} name, and it will not receive one unless its existence is confirmed, typically through optical imaging. Once confirmed, the IAU will certify a name, with priority typically given to a name proposed by its discoverers.

5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> massive hit.|$|E

5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Unionâ€“United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, {{in as much}} as one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by the vastness of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, provincial governorships in the Umayyad era were almost always staffed {{exclusively}} by Arabs, and this trend {{was reflected in}} the appointees to Sind during this period. Tribal politics also played a strong role in the selection and dismissal of governors; if the governor of Iraq was a Qaysi, then his governor to Sind would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Qaysi, and if he was a Yamani, his selection would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Yamani as well. There were, however, some exceptions to this; al-Junayd ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Murri, for example, was initially appointed to Sind by a fellow Qaysi, but was allowed to retain his position for two years after the governor of Iraq was replaced with a Yamani.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{surveillance}} equipment and whether covert recording {{amounts to a}} search {{has been a significant}} issue for New Zealand courts. In Tararo v R (2010) the Supreme Court held that an undercover police officer video recording a drug transaction was not a search due to the low expectation of privacy. Covert surveillance of public areas will generally not be search due to the low expectation of privacy. In contrast, surveillance of private property will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> search due to the high privacy interests. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 now provides clear statutory guidance for when covert police surveillance can lawfully occur.|$|E
25|$|Dyppel went to Denmark, and had {{audiences with}} Frederick III of Denmark {{in the hopes}} of {{recovering}} the lost goods, which amounted to a value of 3000 rdl. He drafted a letter to Charles II of England, but never sent it due to the rising tension between Denmark and England. While in Denmark, Dyppel published the 1670 book Fire Sparetimers Fructer, a motivational treatise concerning piety and introspection. Krarup mentions that he cannot have been entirely destitute, as the publishing of such a book would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> substantial expense with little monetary reward. The same year, Dyppel married Birgitte Pedersdatter. The marriage took place in Dyppel's home, which at the time was only considered for the higher classes.|$|E

25|$|Still another {{possibility}} is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value {{may or may not be}} copied to I on each iteration. Again, modifications of I would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of I might be to the (possibly altered) current value of I or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element I of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if I is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a print-statement to reveal its value), it would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reference to the proper variable I instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.|$|E
25|$|Usually new colonies {{are formed}} by older {{individuals}} who swarm {{and create a}} new nest. The young P. fraternus queens stay behind to keep the older nest alive. The colony cycle begins with a pre-emergence period, which occurs before {{the emergence of the}} first offspring. Pre-emergence colonies have mostly older individuals. After this, the post-emergence period occurs which is the whole duration of the colony cycle following the appearance of offspring wasps. Next, is the pre-matrifilial phase. This is {{the first part of the}} post-emergence period and occurs when subordinate foundresses are still present in nests, interacting with worker wasps. Following this period is the matrifilial phase, which comes after the disappearance of all subordinates. Colonies now consist of only the queen and her workers. Lastly, there is a reproductive phase, where reproductive offspring (gynes and males) are born. Gynes start emerging from nests around early February; thus any female collected from colonies up to the end of January of each season will most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> worker. The colony cycle is usually annual, with foundress females beginning new nests in the spring after having overwintered for about 4.5 months.|$|E
500|$|The song {{also had}} dance mixes created by Vasquez. There are two {{versions}} of [...] "Junior's Luscious Mix", those being a single edit and a longer version, which has a piano introduction and turns [...] "Secret" [...] into a dancefloor track. According to Larry Flick from Billboard these versions have [...] "vibrant keyboards and an elastic bassline". Like the house mixes, here also Madonna's vocals were re-edited {{to fit in with}} the faster beats. According to Jose F. Promis of AllMusic, the sped-up vocals made Madonna's voice have a [...] "robotic, detached feel that the original doesn't have." [...] Promis also noted that Vasquez's [...] "Sound Factory Mix" [...] had [...] "swirling instrumentals recalling flashing lights in a nightclub". This remix also incorporated tribal percussion sounds and synth looping. Similarly he noted that the [...] "Some Bizarre Mix" [...] gave the song a [...] "groovier, funkier spin", while the [...] "Allstar Mix", gave it [...] "a cold, hip-hop feel". Flick was positive towards all the remixes, noting that [...] "this single is a promising preamble to what will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cool, new chapter in the career of dance music's most successful graduate." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to her {{contract}} with Ray Stark, Streisand {{was required to}} reprise her role as Fanny Brice in the sequel to Funny Girl (1968), which became Funny Lady. Accompanying the 1975 film was the official soundtrack {{and one of the}} first records to be released by Arista Records, a new label created by record producer Clive Davis. Davis later revealed in his autobiographical book, The Soundtrack of My Life, that Streisand was the perfect singer for the soundtrack as she was [...] "the top female singer-actress in the world" [...] and would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good first effort to be released by a newly-founded record company. The soundtrack to Funny Lady was released on March 15, 1975 by Arista Records, despite Streisand being signed to Columbia Records. It features fifteen songs, with a majority of them being brand new tracks written by the songwriting duo of Fred Ebb and John Kander. Bay Cities Records, a subsidiary of Arista, had announced interest in reissuing the soundtrack collection for Funny Lady in 1990. The plans stalled for several years and it was not until May 19, 1998 that it would be released in a compact disc format. The reissued version features a rearranged track listing, plus a second version of [...] "How Lucky Can You Get", being the [...] "Finale" [...] single release. It would be reissued once more by SBME Special Markets on February 3, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on the definition, life {{started when}} RNA chains began to self-replicate, {{initiating}} the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: heritability, variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, {{and the availability}} of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities may have been: (1) replication with moderate fidelity, giving rise to both heritability while allowing variation of type, (2) resistance to decay, and (3) acquisition of process resources. These capacities would have functioned by means of the folded configurations of the RNA replicators resulting from their nucleotide sequences.|$|E
