25|$|However, {{because of}} a poor form {{in the first two}} Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012, some people have started to {{question}} his place in the Indian team. A report by The Hindustan Times said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs. This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.|$|E

25|$|Hutchinson and Cederbaum (2011) studied father-daughter {{communication}} {{and found that}} increased father-daughter communication delayed sexual debut and decreased the frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse. They also found that responsible sexual behavior among adolescent females was associated with positive father-daughter communication regarding men, dating, sex, and marriage. On the other hand, fathers who were absent had been linked to higher rates of sexual activity and teen pregnancy among female adolescents. Fathers have {{a greater impact on}} daughters than they think, but fail to recognize it because they don’t believe they should be discussing sex with their daughters or simply <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mothers.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} the {{civilian}} authority to maintain control, it needed to {{have a way to}} direct the military without unduly infringing on the prerogatives of the military world and thus provoking a backlash. Civilian leadership would decide the objective of any military action but then <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military world to decide upon the best way of achieving the objective. The problem facing civilian authority, then, is in deciding on the ideal amount of control. Too much control over the military could result in a force too weak to defend the nation, resulting in failure on the battlefield. Too little control would create the possibility of a coup, i.e., failure of the government.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1939, Hitler invited Monsignor Jozef Tiso, (the Slovak ex-prime {{minister}} {{who had been}} deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier), to Berlin and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would {{have no interest in}} Slovakia's fate and would <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, Joachim von Ribbentrop passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament ("Diet of the Slovak Land") which would approve Slovakia's independence.|$|E
25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E

It also stated Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that cannot easily be described. Lisa Minot, from The Sun, stated [...] "after a sneak peek, I can say it is the most faithful recreation of JK Rowling's books and movies ever seen. Fans will be in heaven." [...] Leigh Caldwell from Traveling Mamas noted that although The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is ideal for the whole family, it's not designed for anyone under 3 years old." [...] She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: [...] "there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are going to enjoy the heck out of a visit to the Wizarding World". Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, criticized the fact that the park was chosen to be in Orlando, rather than in London, stating that it was [...] "utterly mad" [...] to <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americans [...] "to make money from a great British invention." ...|$|E

Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E

500|$|Late in the decade, {{there was}} a brief {{exploration}} into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a potential source of programming talent. In fact, Bamberger Broadcasting's WOR-TV & WOIC (the latter a Washington, D.C. video outlet) maintained letterhead with [...] "Mutual Television" [...] decorating their identifications. Beyond this, there is no confirmation, however, that a cooperative video service was ever seriously considered. The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became {{the only one of the}} [...] "Big Four" [...] U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. Several Mutual radio affiliates launched their own television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of ABC, [...] NBC, CBS or DuMont. The cooperative also held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and [...] "reality" [...] programming: the crabby gabfest <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a [...] "misery show," [...] Queen for a Day [...] "awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled him—and who, by the way, also needed heart surgery." [...] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings. In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.|$|E
