25|$|The {{success of}} insulin enabled {{the company to}} attract well-respected {{scientists}} and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items. In 1928 Lilly introduced <b>Liver</b> <b>Extract</b> 343 {{for the treatment of}} pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced <b>Liver</b> <b>Extract</b> No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.

25|$|During {{the course}} of her work, Bernheim {{utilized}} rabbit <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> and obtained the enzyme by adding kaolin to the <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> at pH 6.5. Following this, crude tyramine was procured by heating tyrosine {{in the presence of the}} catalyst diphenylamine. The extracted enzyme was added to tyramine, in the presence of water and buffer, and the Barcroft technique was utilized to observe the amount of oxygen consumed by tyramine. She discovered that the oxidation of tyramine did take place, with the observation that one atom of oxygen was absorbed per molecule of tyramine present. This observation indicated the presence of an enzyme system within the studied <b>liver</b> <b>extracts,</b> which Bernheim named tyramine oxidase, since it was involved in the oxidation of tyramine.|$|R
25|$|In 1928, the chemist Edwin Cohn {{prepared}} a <b>liver</b> <b>extract</b> that was 50 to 100 times more potent than the natural liver products.

500|$|Rhoads was {{to assist}} Castle, and they {{established}} {{a base in}} San Juan at the Presbyterian Hospital. Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests. In Puerto Rico, the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that, while referred to as patients, they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research. Because {{of the effects of}} anemia and the suspicion that tropical sprue was related to diet, Rhoads experimentally controlled patients' diets. Lederer notes that in letters from this time, Rhoads referred to his patients as [...] "experimental 'animals'." [...] He wrote: [...] "If they don’t develop something they certainly have the constitutions of oxen." [...] Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them. If they did develop tropical sprue, he could treat it with <b>liver</b> <b>extract.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There are {{alternatives}} to ethidium bromide which are advertised as being less dangerous and having better performance. For example, several SYBR-based dyes {{are used by}} some researchers {{and there are other}} emerging stains such as Novel Juice. [...] SYBR dyes are less mutagenic than EtBr by the Ames test with <b>liver</b> <b>extract.</b> However, SYBR Green I was actually found to be more mutagenic than EtBr to the bacterial cells exposed to UV (which is used to visualize either dye). This may be the case for other [...] "safer" [...] dyes, but whilst mutagenic and toxicity details are available [...] these have not been published in peer reviewed journals. [...] MSDS for SYBR Safe reports a LD50 for rats of >5g/kg, which is higher than that of EtBr (1.5g/kg), but both are many orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations used in molecular biology. [...] Also, many alternative dyes are suspended in DMSO, which has health implications of its own including increased skin absorption of organic compounds. Despite the performance advantage of using SYBR dyes instead of EtBr for staining purposes, many researchers still prefer EtBr since it is considerably less expensive.|$|E
40|$|Rat and hamster <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> {{were found}} to contain DNA glycosylases capable of {{removing}} 3 -methyladenine and 7 -methylguanine from methylated DNA. The activity of 7 -methylguanine-DNA glycosylase was greater tin hamster than in rat <b>liver</b> <b>extracts.</b> This {{finding is consistent with}} previous reports that the half-life of 7 -methylguanine in DNA after treatment with the carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine is longer in rats than in hamsters. These enzymes may, therefore, {{play an important role in}} the removal of abnormal alkylation products from mammalian cell DNA. Rodent <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> also contained a DNA glycosylase able to remove from alkylated DNA the imidazole-ring-opened form of 7 -methylguanine which is produced by treatment with alkali. Although this product may occur in vivo after treatment with alkylating agents to only a very small extent, the enzyme may be needed to minimize its potentially harmful biological effects...|$|R

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is a common}} cause of hepatic dysfunction. The disease {{spectrum}} ranges from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The {{aim of this study}} was to identify metabolic differences in murine models of simple hepatic steatosis and NASH for the distinction of these NAFLD stages. For 12 weeks, male BALB/c mice were fed either a control or two different high-fat diets leading to hepatic steatosis and NASH, respectively. Metabolic differences were determined by independent component analysis (ICA) of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of lipophilic and hydrophilic <b>liver</b> <b>extracts,</b> and urine specimens. The results from ICA clearly discriminated the three investigated groups. Discriminatory biomarkers in the lipophilic <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> were free cholesterol, cholesterol ester and lipid methylene. Discrimination of the hydrophilic <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> was mainly mediated by betaine, glucose, and lactate, whereas in urine taurine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and trimethylamine were the most discriminatory biomarkers. In conclusion, NMR metabolite fingerprinting of spot urine specimens may allow the noninvasive distinction of steatosis and NASH...|$|R

50|$|This anaemia {{was then}} known as ‘pernicious anaemia of pregnancy’. However, Lucy Wills was able to {{demonstrate}} that the anaemia she observed differed from true pernicious anaemia, as the patients did not have achlorhydria, an inability to produce gastric acid. Furthermore, while patients responded to crude <b>liver</b> <b>extracts,</b> they did not respond to the ‘pure’ <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> (vitamin B12) which had been shown to treat true pernicious anaemia. She postulated that there must have been another nutritional factor responsible for this macrocytic anaemia other than vitamin B12 deficiency. For some years this nutritional factor was known as the ‘Wills Factor’, and it was later shown, in the 1940s, to be folate, of which the synthetic form is folic acid.|$|R

40|$|The {{decrease}} {{in the level of}} liver glutathione (GSH) in endotoxin-treated mice was in part due to formation of glutathione disulfide (GSSG).

5000|$|Mary {{knew that}} the same <b>liver</b> <b>extract</b> {{required}} to culture LLD was also the only effective treatment for pernicious anemia. That disease earned the designation [...] "pernicious" [...] because it was almost invariably fatal, prior {{to the discovery of}} the raw liver treatment method in 1926.

In fact, Mary's father-in-law had died from the disease.As with the yogurt culture media, no one knew what component of <b>liver</b> <b>extract</b> was the active ingredient.

40|$|A {{macromolecular}} {{factor that}} inhibits {{the activity of}} the antizyme to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was found in rat <b>liver</b> <b>extracts.</b> The factor, 'antizyme inhibitor', was heat-labile, non diffusable and of similar molecular size to ODC. The antizyme inhibitor re-activated ODC that had been inactivated by antizyme, apparently by replacing ODC in a complex with antizyme. Therefore the antizyme inhibitor can be used to assay the amount of inactive ODC-antizyme complex formed in vitro. When assayed by this method, the complex was shown to be eluted before ODC from a Sephadex G- 100 column. Significant increase in ODC activity was observed when the antizyme inhibitor was added to crude <b>liver</b> <b>extracts</b> from rats that had been injected with 1, 3 -diaminopropane to cause decay of ODC activity, suggesting the presence of inactive ODC-antizyme complex in the extracts...|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody has been generated to human liver monoamine oxidase (MAO) B by fusion of mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from a mouse immunized {{with a mixture}} of semi-purified MAO A and MAO B.
