5000|$|A {{boarding}} {{house is a}} house (frequently a family home) in which lodgers rent one or more rooms for one or more nights, and sometimes for extended periods of weeks, months, and years.

Studies have found hydrotopes to be very slightly volatile, with vapour pressures <2.0x10-5 Pa. They are aerobically biodegradable. Removal via the secondary wastewater treatment process of activated sludge is >94%. [...] Acute toxicity studies on fish show an LC50 >400 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L.

The aquatic Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was found to be 0.23 mg a.i./L.

50|$|Greywater is {{wastewater}} {{from the}} sinks, showers, galleys, <b>laundry,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cleaning</b> activities aboard a ship. It can contain {{a variety of}} pollutant substances, including fecal coliforms, detergents, oil and grease, metals, organic compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, nutrients, food waste, medical and dental waste. Sampling done by the EPA {{and the state of}} Alaska found that untreated greywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths and that it can contain levels of fecal coliform bacteria several times greater than is typically found in untreated domestic wastewater. Greywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other oxygen-demanding materials, in particular. Greywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships (90 to 95 percent of the total). Estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person, or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship.|$|E
