Two days of metyrapone pretreatment resulted in a 46 ± 19 % decrease in plasma cortisol levels compared with control, which was paralleled by a 60 ± 13 % decrease in distal air <b>space</b> <b>liquid</b> clearance. The Na+ channel inhibitor amiloride inhibited 40 ± 22 % of distal air <b>space</b> <b>liquid</b> clearance in control animals but did not inhibit distal air <b>space</b> <b>liquid</b> clearance in the metyrapone-pretreated group. Co-injection of dexamethasone prevented the inhibition by metyrapone and the amiloride sensitivity of distal air <b>space</b> <b>liquid</b> clearance was greater than in control animals. After 7 days of metyrapone pretreatment, plasma cortisol levels and distal air <b>space</b> <b>liquid</b> clearance were not significantly different from normal, but amiloride sensitivity was greater than in control animals (91 ± 37 %).

Vertical rollers attached {{at each end of}} the keel roll within a submerged guide channel. The original diesel engines were replaced by electric battery-powered propulsion units which are charged at the loading dock by contact-less inductive coils, increasing efficiency and eliminating fuel spills. Guests board through a hatch at either end by crossing hinged loading ramps and descending spiral stairs. Twenty aft-boarding guests are seated facing the starboard side and fore-boarding guests are seated facing port. Each submarine originally seated 38 guests, but removal of the diesel engines increased seating to 40 spring-loaded fiberglass seats. Lap sitting of small children is permitted. 46 on-board flotation devices limit maximum capacity to 45 guests and one helmsman. When the boarding ramps are raised the hatches are sealed watertight (but not airtight) and mooring lines released. Although their viewports are below water level, the [...] "submarines" [...] do not actually submerge when [...] "diving". Descent and submersion is simulated with bubbles that rise across the viewports when the vehicles pass through compressed air released under the hull and waterfalls. Each viewport blows fresh dehumidified air across its glass to prevent fogging. Each cabin interior has 40 viewports framed with dark blue mesh, and a wavy blue stripe painted across the ceiling. The original subs's exteriors were painted navy gray; the new livery colors are bright yellow above water, a light blue 'boot stripe' at the waterline, and a reflection-reducing matte blue-black below the waterline.|$|E

The operating parameters which affected the quality of the hydrofinished oils were studied separately at different values that including reactor temperature, reactor pressure, <b>liquid</b> hourly <b>space</b> velocity and hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio.
