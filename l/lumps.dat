30|$|One of the kinetic-lumped {{models for}} the {{production}} of propylene based on catalytic pyrolysis of heavy oils is the eight-lumped model [26] which include ethylene as a <b>lump</b> and a separate propylene <b>lumped</b> with butylene. Where propylene is required as a separate <b>lump,</b> this eight-lumped model may not be useful. Some kinetic {{models for the}} propylene production are based on catalytic cracking, such as the four-lumped model which includes propylene as a component of a gas <b>lump</b> [29]; the ten-lumped model with propylene as a distinct <b>lump</b> [30] and six-lumped model with distinct propylene <b>lump</b> [15]. To maximize the yield of propylene in a <b>lumped</b> kinetic model, propylene has to be a separate <b>lump.</b> The gas <b>lump</b> in Hussain et al. [29] is a mixture of propylene, butylene and some dry gas; hence, it is unsuitable for use to maximize propylene because maximizing gas <b>lump</b> would mean maximizing other gases along.|$|R
40|$|A <b>lumping</b> of a Markov {{chain is}} a coordinate-wise {{projection}} of the chain. We characterise the entropy rate preservation of a <b>lumping</b> of an aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space by the random growth rate of the cardinality of the realisable preimage of a finite-length trajectory of the <b>lumped</b> chain and by the information needed to reconstruct original trajectories from their <b>lumped</b> images. Both are purely combinatorial criteria, depending only on the transition graph of the Markov chain and the <b>lumping</b> function. A <b>lumping</b> is strongly k-lumpable, iff the <b>lumped</b> process is a k-th order Markov chain for each starting distribution of the original Markov chain. We characterise strong k-lumpability via tightness of stationary entropic bounds. In the sparse setting, we give sufficient conditions on the <b>lumping</b> to both preserve th...|$|R

Furthermore, we extend this method to a new combination of positive quadratic function and hyperbolic functions.

Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced <b>lumps</b> of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E
30|$|To {{simplify the}} dynamic model, an {{efficient}} dynamic modelling method—lumped stiffness method is proposed {{based on the}} <b>lumped</b> mass method. The basic thought of <b>lumped</b> stiffness method is as follows: first, the total meshing component force along axis direction will be obtained through mechanical analysis; second, the maximum deformation of meshing point is considered as global deformation, and the component of global deformation along axis direction can be presented; finally, the ratio of total meshing component force to global component deformation along axis direction will be obtained. Obviously, the ratio is <b>lumped</b> stiffness. Compared with the traditional modelling method, the advantages of <b>lumped</b> stiffness method are as follows: nonlinear stiffness, time-varying curvature, and time-varying load have been integrated into the <b>lumped</b> stiffness model and not directly reflected in the dynamic model; the dynamic model will be established and solved easily. The <b>lumped</b> stiffness model of cycloid ball meshing pair and cross-ball meshing pair is, respectively, solved using <b>lumped</b> stiffness method.|$|R

To investigate catchment scale dependency of the new <b>lumped</b> sediment runoff model, sediment runoff simulations are conducted using different sizes of the catchment area and spatially averaged hourly rainfall.

Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E

Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests.
