50|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} one-story structure built of rectangular hand-hewn <b>logs</b> <b>stained</b> a dark brown with mortar in between. At the joints the logs interlock. Above the logs the gable fields are sided in vertical flushboard. It is topped with a gabled shingled roof pierced in the center by a small brick chimney. A wooden screen door in the east corner of the south facade provides entrance. The north side is faced in board-and-batten.|$|R
50|$|The 1937 log bathhouse is a {{significant}} feature of the park. It was designed by Abraham Anderson of Ironwood, Michigan. The bathhouse is constructed from horizontally placed <b>logs</b> <b>stained</b> dark brown atop a three foot tall fieldstone foundation, with a low pitched, side gable roof of wood shingles. The building consists of a central body with two wings. The entrance is through a central door, protected by a shed roof overhang. The wings have entry doors in the gable ends, and windows flanked by wooden shutters on the side. These wings were originally built as dressing rooms and canoe storage, but were converted in 1970 to restrooms.|$|R

It sits on a concrete foundation and is topped with a front-gabled roof pierced in the centre by a small modern chimney. The <b>logs</b> are <b>stained</b> brown and form saddle joints at the corners.|$|R
5000|$|Middle Mountain Cabins are a set {{of three}} {{historic}} cabins located in the Monongahela National Forest near Wymer, Randolph County, West Virginia. They were built in 1931, and consist of the Main Cabin and Cabins 1 and 2. The Main Cabin is a one-story, rectangular, <b>stained</b> <b>log</b> building measuring approximately 22 feet by 20 feet. It has a gable roof and full-length porch. Cabins 1 and 2 are mirror-images of each other. They are one-story, frame buildings with gable roofs measuring approximately 25 feet by 14 feet. They were built to provide quarters for fire lookouts and {{to serve as a}} base for conducting other Forest Service operations. [...] They have since been converted for recreational use, and are available for rental as a group.|$|R
40|$|Trees {{monitored}} for bark stripping {{over the}} previous 20 years were examined for timber defects by felling, then observing stain and rot in the split butt logs and strength testing wood samples. Logs (52 bark stripped, 28 controls) came from eight sites that had tree crops 28 – 39 years old; the logs were stratified for wound size (180 cm 2), large wounds being rare. Many wounded <b>logs</b> had no <b>stain</b> or rot, but six of the 33 better-quality sawlogs were judged to be usable only for pulp. Modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture were affected only at wounds and only in the sapwood there; at this position, mean stiffness and strength were both significantly reduced compared with control logs, with lowest means for logs with large wounds. Large wounds suffered a much greater incidence of stain and rot than small wounds, but their rarity meant that the calculated financial loss caused by the bark stripping estimated to be incurred over the whole rotation up to felling was only 3 per cent of the crop value. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} gradient protein- 2 (AGR 2) is inducible by oestrogen and itself can induce metastasis in a rat model for breast cancer. Here, a rabbit antibody to recombinant human AGR 2 {{was used to}} assess its prognostic significance in a retrospective cohort of 351 breast cancer patients treated by adjuvant hormonal therapy. The antibody stains 66 % of breast carcinomas to varying degrees. The percentage of positive carcinoma cells in tumours directly correlates with the level of AGR 2 mRNA (Spearman's rank correlation, P= 0. 0007) and protein (linear regression analysis r 2 = 0. 95, P= 0. 0002). There is a significant association of staining of carcinomas for AGR 2 with oestrogen receptor α (ERα) staining and with low histological grade (both Fisher's Exact test P< 0. 0001). In the ERα-positive cases, but not the ERα-negative cases, when subdivided into the separate staining classes for AGR 2, there is a significantly progressive decrease in patient survival with increased <b>staining</b> (<b>log</b> rank test, P= 0. 006). The significant association of staining for AGR 2 with patient death over a 10 -year period (log rank test P= 0. 007, hazard ratio= 3) only becomes significant at 6 years of follow-up. This {{may be due to the}} cessation of adjuvant hormonal therapy at an earlier time, resulting in adverse re-expression of the metastasis-inducing protein AGR 2...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and PurposeSquamous cell carcinomas of the anal canal are {{associated}} with infection with Human Papilloma Viruses (HPVs). Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) gives 70 % 3 -year relapse-free survival. Improved predictive markers and therapeutic options are required. MethodsTumours from 153 patients treated with radical chemo-radiotherapy (50. 4 Gy in 28 # with concurrent Mitomycin and 5 -Fluorouracil between 2004 and 2009) were retrieved and immunohistochemistry performed for p 16 INK 4 A, p 53 and EGFR and correlated with outcome. Primary and relapsed samples were analysed for mutations in KRAS. Results 137 / 153 (89. 5 %) stained moderately or strongly for p 16 INK 4 A. p 16 INK 4 A correlated strongly with outcome. 37 / 137 patients demonstrating moderate/strong p 16 INK 4 A expression relapsed (27. 0 %), as opposed to 10 / 16 (62. 5 %) with absent/weak <b>staining</b> (<b>log</b> rank test p< 0. 001). p 16 and p 53 expression were inversely correlated. p 16 INK 4 A negative tumours were more frequent in men. p 16 INK 4 A negative patients had significantly worse overall survival (p< 0. 001). No mutations in KRAS were identified in primary tumours or relapses following treatment. Conclusionsp 16 INK 4 A is strongly associated with relapse in SCC of the anus and identifies patients with very poor rates of relapse-free and overall survival. Primary and recurrent anal cancer expresses wild type KRAS, unaffected by treatment, supporting trials targeting EGFR in poor risk/recurrent anal cancer...|$|R
5000|$|The Wilford H. Fawcett House is a {{house in}} Breezy Point, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wilford H. Fawcett, also known as [...] "Captain Billy", started the book [...] "Captain Billy's Whiz Bang" [...] as a joke book for {{soldiers}} during World War I. He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge. [...] The lodge has since burnt down. He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property. Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style. The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.The house is located on a point on Breezy Point Bay on Big Pelican Lake. It has a [...] "Y" [...] shape. The center of the [...] "Y" [...] has a circular staircase leading to a [...] "reading balcony" [...] in the main hall. The building is constructed of peeled and trimmed Norway pine <b>logs,</b> with brown <b>stain</b> on the exterior and varnished on the interior. The center hall contains the [...] "reading balcony", a large stone masonry fireplace, exposed logs for the rafter beams, and wrought iron fixtures. The remainder of the house has room for about 30 guests. In 1979, a fire damaged several rooms in the northwest wing, but the exterior was unharmed. While the interior has been modernized somewhat, it remains sympathetic to the original.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the value of}} loss of expression of E-cadherin and cadherin associated molecules as prognostic markers for prostate cancer patients in a long-term follow-up study. METHODS: Sixty-five prostate cancer specimens, obtained from patients with different stages of prostate cancer who underwent a radical prostatectomy or TUR-P between 1987 and 1991, were used for immunohistochemical analysis of the expression pattern of E-cadherin, alpha-, beta-, gamma-catenin and p 120 (ctn). Clinical records of these patients were studied for follow-up data and the prognostic value of expression of these adhesion molecules was determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and multivariable proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: Normal staining patterns were found in 36 cases (55. 4 %) for E-cadherin, 37 cases (56. 9 %) for alpha-catenin, 40 cases (61. 5 %) for beta-catenin, 25 cases (38. 5 %) for gamma-catenin, and 40 cases (61. 5 %) for p 120 (ctn). Overall, a strong correlation {{was found between the}} expression of E-cadherin and other cadherin-associated molecules. The 5 -year survival rates for each staining were as follows: E-cadherin (normal 79. 2 %, aberrant 26. 8 %), alpha-catenin (normal 79. 2 %, aberrant 26. 8 %), beta-catenin (normal 73. 1 %, aberrant 27. 3 %), gamma-catenin (normal 86. 4 %, aberrant 37. 1 %), and p 120 (ctn) (normal 72. 8 %, aberrant 30. 0 %). There was a significant difference in survival between normal and aberrant expression in each <b>staining</b> (<b>log</b> rank P < 0. 0001). The proportional hazard regression model including tumor stage and Gleason score revealed alpha-catenin expression as the best prognostic marker for patients with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed a strong correlation between E-cadherin expression and other cadherin-associated molecules. Among these markers, alpha-catenin seems the best prognostic marker for prostate cancer specific survival. Larger studies are needed to confirm this result...|$|R
