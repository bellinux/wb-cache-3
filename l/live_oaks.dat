5|$|San Marco has {{a number}} of parks of various sizes and purposes; the San Marco Preservation Society lists {{fourteen}} within its boundaries. There are two more in the Southbank: Treaty Oak Park, home of one of Jacksonville's oldest <b>live</b> <b>oaks,</b> and Friendship Fountain Park. Other amenities on the Southbank include the Museum of Science and History (MOSH) and the Southbank Riverwalk. San Marco is served by an elementary school, a middle school, and the Southside Branch Public Library. Two major projects of the San Marco Preservation Society have been the restoration of the former South Jacksonville City Hall as the society's headquarters and the conversion of the former St. Paul's Episcopal Church building into Preservation Hall, a reservable banquet hall.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic <b>live</b> <b>oaks,</b> sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E

25|$|This species {{typically}} inhabits wooded areas near permanent {{water sources}} or coastal habitats with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) or palm trees. In the southeastern United States, L. intermedius distribution almost always coincides with Spanish moss, which they use for both roost and maternity sites. Bats roost within the Spanish moss itself or beneath the dead hanging fronds of fan palm trees. A single palm tree or live oak tree draped in Spanish moss may {{be home to}} several individuals year-round, and multiple pregnant and lactating females may form a maternity colony, despite the solitary nature of most Lasiurine bats. One study found bats favored Sand <b>live</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus geminata) with an average roost height of 2.23 m above the ground and 1.57 m above the nearest vegetation. The average length of a roost was 0.98 m and average width was 0.44 m. Clumps of Spanish moss used for roosting sites were 2-3 times larger than clumps of un-used Spanish moss in the area. All roosts were within 1 m of the sandy road and less than 11 m from a lake. These bats frequently changed their roost site. In August 2003, a male northern yellow bat was found roosting {{on the underside of}} a partially dead frond of cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto) along the edge of Lake August in a residential lawn in Florida. The cryptic coloration of this species makes it difficult to spot on the brown frond of a palm.|$|E
500|$|The first European land {{exploration}} of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, passed this way {{on its way}} north, camping at San Juan Creek on July 23, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary: [...] "...we came to a very pleasant green valley, full of willows, alders, <b>live</b> <b>oaks,</b> and other trees not known to us. It has a large arroyo, which {{at the point where}} we crossed it carried a good stream of fresh and good water, which, after running a little way, formed in pools in some large patches of tules." [...] On the return journey to San Diego, the party used the campsite again, on January 20.|$|E
500|$|Hammocks {{are often}} the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river, and are {{dominated}} by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern <b>live</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form {{the shape of a}} teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher than [...] due to wind, cold weather, and lightning strikes.|$|E
