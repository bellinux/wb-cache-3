40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of small cryptic reef fishes were quantified among microhabitats and <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> at both exposed and sheltered sites at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. A total of 1042 individuals from 44 species in 8 families were sampled. Marked variation in abundance, species numbers, size-class {{distribution and}} species composition were displayed among <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> at exposed sites; in contrast, comparatively little variation {{was found in}} sheltered sites. The exposed, wave-swept front flat <b>reef</b> <b>zone</b> was clearly the most depauperate and species-poor zone with calmer back reef, lagoonal and <b>reef</b> base <b>zones</b> containing the highest numbers of individuals and species. Larger, heavier individuals predominated in exposed wave-swept <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> whereas smaller, lighter individuals were commonly found in calmer waters. Sheltered sites exhibited little variation among zones. In these sites, microhabitat appeared to play a much greater role in shaping community composition. Overall, 68. 5 % of all individuals (70. 1 % at exposed and 65. 4 % at sheltered sites) were collected from sand/rubble microhabitats as opposed to 31. 5 % from open reef microhabitats. Assemblages at exposed and sheltered sites exhibited little taxonomic overlap, even of highly abundant species. These results indicate that wave energy {{plays a significant role}} in structuring small cryptic coral reef fish communities, with microhabitat type playing {{a key role in the}} absence of wave energy...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{exploration}} has delineated significant {{gold mineralization}} in the River <b>Reef</b> <b>Zone</b> {{and the presence}} of a siliceous body at Watuputih Hill, which is a Poboya gold prospect in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The mineralization is hosted within the Palu Metamorphic Complex. The host rocks consist of granite, biotite gneiss, and biotite schist, which is intercalated by feldspar porphyroblastic biotite schist and amphibolitic schist. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of the granite and biotite gneiss suggests that the granitic rocks can be characterized as magnesian arc calc-alkaline rocks, with a weakly peraluminous composition. Alteration minerals were analyzed by a combination of petrographic and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the River <b>Reef</b> <b>Zone,</b> the hydrothermal alteration zones can be sorted by their proximity to the primary fluid conduit and divided into inner, high-T, and low-T propylitic zones. In Watuputih Hill, the hydrothermal alteration can be divided into advanced argillic and argillic zones. The hydrothermal alteration assemblages indicated that the fluid was at a near-neutral pH in the River <b>Reef</b> <b>Zone,</b> whereas the fluid was acidic within Watuputih Hill. Because the hill is relatively distant from the River <b>Reef</b> <b>Zone,</b> the presence of these zones at Watuputih Hill may be indicative of another mineralization system beneath the hill...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoral reefs are {{characterized}} by intense herbivory. Spatial patterns in herbivory [...] particularly along the depth gradient [...] influence the distribution and abundance of algae. Depth gradients in herbivorous reef fishes are generally assumed to be temporally stable, but this assumption has rarely been questioned. Here, we use underwater visual census and herbivore exclusion experiments to study the community composition and temporal patterns in habitat use by roving herbivorous fishes in an environment characterized by profound seasonal changes in algal biomass and distribution and extreme summer temperatures. Among the 18 species of roving herbivores recorded, parrotfishes were dominant in species richness and biomass, while regional endemic species represented 77 % of the total biomass. During most of the year, roving herbivores aggregate in the shallow <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> and their biomass declines with depth. The herbivore community on the reef flat is distinct from that in deeper zones. The former is characterized by Siganus rivulatus, Acanthurus gahhm and Hipposcarus harid, while the deeper <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> {{are characterized}} by S. ferrugineus, Chlorurus sordidus and Ctenochaetus striatus. In summer, the distinct community structures among <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> are lost as reef flat herbivores tend to exploit deeper <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> and some <b>reef</b> crest species venture on to the reef flat. This summer change in herbivore distribution is also reflected in reduced turf biomass and increased yield to herbivores in the deeper <b>reef</b> <b>zones.</b> Habitat use {{is related to the}} feeding mode such that browsers dominate the reef flat and scrapers the reef crest, while the seasonal changes correspond to changes in availability of targeted algal resources. These seasonal changes appear to be driven by the extreme temperatures in summer, reaching 36 °C on the shallow reef flat...|$|R

In this field-based study, we used a visual census technique (belt transects 50 m x 2 m) to investigate the interactions between fishes and microhabitats at the Mamanguape Mangrove-Reef system, NE Brazil. Overall, 144 belt transects were performed from October 2007 to September 2008 to assess {{the structure of the}} fish assemblage. Fish trophic groups and life stage (juveniles and adults) were recorded according to literature, the percent cover of the substrate was estimated using the point contact method. Our results revealed that fish composition gradually changed from the Estuarine to the <b>Reef</b> <b>zone,</b> and that fish assemblage was strongly related to the microhabitat availability, as suggested by the predominance of carnivores at the Estuarine zone and presence of herbivores at the <b>Reef</b> <b>zone.</b> Fish abundance and diversity were higher in the <b>Reef</b> <b>zone</b> and estuary margins, highlighting the importance of structural complexity.

40|$|Coral-dwelling fishes {{from the}} genus Gobiodon {{are some of}} the most habitat {{specialised}} fishes on coral reefs. Consequently, we might expect that their population dynamics will be closely associated with the abundance of host corals. I used a combination of log-linear modelling and resource selection ratios to examine patterns of habitat use among eight species of Gobiodon in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. I then used multiple regression analysis to investigate relationships between the abundance of each species of Gobiodon and the abundance of the corals they inhabited. Each species of Gobiodon used one or more species of coral more frequently than expected by chance. The pattern of habitat use exhibited by each species of Gobiodon did not vary among <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> or among <b>reefs</b> with different exposures to prevailing winds, despite changes in the relative abundances of corals among <b>reef</b> <b>zones.</b> This consistency in habitat use might be expected if the coral species inhabited confer considerable fitness advantages and, therefore, are strongly preferred. For most species of Gobiodon, abundances among <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> and exposure regimes were correlated with the abundance of the coral species usually inhabited. Therefore, it appears that habitat availability helps determine abundances of most species of Gobiodon in Kimbe Bay. In addition to correlations with habitat availability, the abundances of G. histrio, G. quinquestrigatus, G. rivulatus (dark form) and the group lsquoothersrsquo were also associated with particular <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> and exposure regimes. Therefore, in these species, reef type appears to influence patterns of abundance independently of coral availability. In contrast to other species of Gobiodon, the abundance of the most specialised species, Gobiodon sp. A, was not closely associated with the abundance of the only coral species it inhabited. This study demonstrates that even for habitat specialised species, the relationship between habitat availability and abundance varies widely and is multiscale...|$|R

Results of quarterly trawl sampling conducted from spring 2004 through spring 2005 revealed that inshore lizardfish are most abundant on sand habitat, but larger fish are more common on shell rubble habitat. There {{was no significant difference in}} fish density between habitats exposed to shrimp trawling on the open shelf versus those habitats within a permitted artificial <b>reef</b> <b>zone</b> that served as a de facto no-trawl area; this finding indicates that either inshore lizardfish experienced minimal effects from trawling or, more likely, that fish moved between trawled and nontrawled habitats. Exploitation ratio (bycatch mortality/total morality) estimates derived from catch curve analysis ranged from 0. 43 inside the artificial <b>reef</b> <b>zone</b> to 0. 55 outside the <b>reef</b> <b>zone,</b> thus indicating that inshore lizardfish are subject to significant fishing mortality in the north central Gulf of Mexico despite the lack of a directed fishery for the species.

The Moorea lagoon was divided into 12 habitat zones (i. e., coral <b>reef</b> <b>zones),</b> which were distinct in terms of depth, wave exposure, and substratum composition. Nocturnal visual censuses among the 12 habitats found that the recently settled juveniles of 25 species recorded were dispatched among three communities spatially distributed according to {{the distance from the}} reef crest (reef crest, barrier reef, and fringing reef communities). This spatial communities structure of nocturnal juveniles was consistent in both winter and summer and would be explained primarily by a current gradient in Moorea lagoon (current speed was high near the reef crest and decreased towards the beach) and by the topographic characteristics of <b>reef</b> <b>zones.</b> Among the 25 species, 13 were recorded in both winter and summer.

The primary aims {{of this study were}} to examine environmental correlates of growth, development, parental investment, and mortality rates for one species of coral reef damselfish (Pomacentridae: Acanthochromis polyacanthus) whose unique life history permits such site-specific demographic correlations. From literature references and measurements obtained from developmental series, these characteristics are compared with several other species of coral reef damselfishes. Field studies were conducted on the exposed and lagoonal <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> surrounding Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Developmental series were obtained from captive-reared animals kept under controlled temperature conditions in the lab. Acanthochromis polyacanthus is highly unusual because it lacks a pelagic larval stage and exhibits extended biparental care of eggs and juveniles, in many ways {{similar to that of the}} substrate-brooding cichlid fishes. Hatching occurred during midday, in contrast to all other damselfishes which hatch at sunset. Acanthochromis have large, relatively well-developed hatchlings (5 mm SL).

In both <b>reef</b> <b>zones,</b> both corals and T. ornata were significantly more abundant in concealed microhabitats than in semi-concealed or open microhabitats (GLMM: P < 0. 001). The prevalence of juvenile corals and T. ornata within concealed environments suggests that they might be effective refuges from grazing by herbivorous fishes. The density of juvenile corals was positively related, and density of T. ornata negatively related to the abundance of two groups of herbivorous fishes, pairing rabbitfishes, and surgeonfishes in the genus Zebrasoma (BEST ENV-BIO: r (s) = 0. 72, P < 0. 01), which feed in concealed microhabitats.

This study is a distributional analysis {{of the state of the}} extant coral community to determine whether or not recovery is taking place. The study region is located at Tanguisson Point, Guam, where prior to the starfish predation a well developed fringing reef occurred. This region was heavily infested by an Acanthaster planci population from June, 1968 to September, 1968. The infestation resulted in the death of more than 95 percent of the reef building (hermatypic) corals. Distributional analysis of the reef corals was undertaken in 1970 with the establishment of three permanent transects in the study area. The distributional analysis includes: 1) species diversity and the relative abundance of each species; 2) percentage of substratum surface occupied by living corals for each reef zone; 3) distribution of corallum size by reef zone; and 4) distribution of coral growth forms by <b>reef</b> <b>zones.</b> In 1971, one year later, a second distributional analysis of reef corals was conducted on the same transects. A comparison of data from the two periods indicates that some reef recovery is taking place, and changes have occurred in all the above parameters studied. Species diversity has increased in all <b>reef</b> <b>zones.</b> A total of 33 genera and 96 species were recorded in 1970. One year later 38 genera and 111 species were found.

This study {{presents}} a depth transect along an Upper Triassic (lower Rhaetian) Dachstein reef from the Gosausee margin of the Dachsteingebirge (Gosau, Austria). The Gosausee microbial-sponge-coral reef is a complete barrier reef with an almost continuous fore reef to lagoon transect preserved (a very rare occurrence for the Triassic), and thus provides a window into depth zonation of Dachstein-type reef facies and biotic succession. The Gosausee reef facies exhibit strong depth control and five classic <b>reef</b> facies or <b>zones</b> are identified: the fore reef, reef front, reef crest, back reef, and lagoon facies. Thin, rare microbial fabrics and a high abundance of fine-grained, mud-rich skeletal wackestones (transported reef debris) characterize the deepest fore reef. As the reef shallows, muddy sediments decrease in abundance and are replaced by microbial fabrics, corals, and cements. Abundant sponges, microbial crusts, and thick, marine cements typify the reef crest, whereas microbialite-coated phaceloid corals are dominant in the back reef facies. Heavily cemented oncoids or microbial-sponge bindstones are characteristic of the lagoon. Based on their compositional and biotic similarities, the Gosausee reef was likely part of the same barrier reef systems as the source reef for the Gosaukamm reef breccia (one of the classic Norian–Rhaetian Dachstein <b>reefs).</b> The <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> of the Gosausee margin can be used to interpret the depth or <b>reef</b> <b>zone</b> of less well preserved reef fragments, can inform models of community ecology and niche utilization in the Late Triassic, and highlight the need for additional research into the environmental factors that controlled biotic distribution in Upper Triassic reefs...|$|R
50|$|The {{boundaries}} of the Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge surrounding the island start at the high-water mark {{on the island and}} go to twenty-five feet beyond the outer edges of the reefs, including sand and seawall shoreline, where coral and sand calcium carbonate reef flats are exposed at low tides. High coral and macro-algae flourish at shallow-depth zones while the deep habitats are characterized by sediment with low coral cover and colonized by slumping from upper <b>reef</b> <b>zones.</b> Within Kaneohe Bay are sheltered areas. Man-made impacts in the area include dredging, sewage release and freshwater flooding. The shores of the bay are characterized by coastal development.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Productive reefs in {{the former}} USSR are known from the Lower Cambrian to the Upper Jurassic. They contain more than 31 % of the oil and about 29 % of the gas {{resources}} of the FSU occurring in carbonate reservoirs. Giant and supergiant fields such as Karachaganak, Tengiz, Zhanazhol, Shurtan etc. are associated with reefs. Reservoir architecture and variation of reservoir properties depends upon the shape and origin of the <b>reefs.</b> <b>Zones</b> of improved reservoir properties {{are located in the}} central parts of dome-like reefs or in circumferential or ring-shaped zones in the atoll-like reefs. In asymmetric reef systems the best reservoir intervals are shifted towards the bioherm zone and forereef slope...|$|R
40|$|During {{a series}} of {{zooplankton}} surveys carried out from 2001 through 2005 {{off the coast of}} the state of Bahia, Brazil, 98 individuals of monstrilloid copepods were collected. These belong to five species (Monstrilla grandis, Cymbasoma cf. longispinosum, Cymbasoma cf. rigidum, Cymbasoma gracilis, and Cymbasoma quadridens). The first three are recorded {{for the first time in}} the Bahia coastal region. The geographical range of C. quadridens is expanded to the Brazilian northeastern coast. The results presented herein increase to nine the number of nominal species of Monstrilloida known from off Bahia; the environmental diversity of Caravelas Channel with highly productive areas and coral <b>reef</b> <b>zones</b> harbor an abundant and diverse monstrilloid fauna that should be surveyed in more detail...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} during 1999 to 2002 and addresses the community structure and some ecological aspects of the benthic reef flat assemblages of Atol das Rocas, located offshore the NE brazilian coast. It corresponds to the sole atoll of the SW Atlantic, which characterized by a shallow topography and is almost completely built by coralline algae. The turf forming red macroalgae Digenea simplex and the crustose coralline Hydrolithon pachydermum were the dominant species of the reef flat. The crustose green macroalgae Dictyosphaeria ocellata and the turf forming red macroalgae Gelidiella acerosa were the subdominant species. Biomass values of D. simplex were about twice higher than the other species, pointing out to its relevance in the community structure of this <b>reef</b> <b>zone.</b> Biodiversity indices indicated a high equitability within the few species observed and a relative temporal stability of the community structure. Some local spatial variations {{were found in the}} community structure of the <b>reef</b> flat <b>zone,</b> enabling the definition of three subhabitats. The patterns of distribution and abundance of the benthic organisms seem {{to be related to the}} environmental conditions of the reef flat, such as low water turbulence, lengthy periods of aerial exposure, and low herbivore pressure...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef fishes often {{exhibit a}} high degree of {{structure}} in their distribution and abundance, but the factors that influence their spatial arrangement are poorly understood. This study sought to explain the spatial structure of coral reef fish communities in the Ryukyu Archipelago, southern Japan. Visual surveys of coral reef fishes were conducted at multiple stations across the fringing reef (from the inner reef flat to the outer slope) at each of three different islands; Aka, Ishigaki and Sesoko. Spatial variation in fish communities (within and among reefs) was then compared to changes in environmental variables (water depth, distance from the shoreline, <b>reef</b> <b>zone,</b> coral abundance and coral richness). Despite being small islands, the total species richness of coral reef fishes in the Ryukyu Islands was very high (> 87 species per reef). Mean abundance of reef fishes was also very high (x = 2. 26 ± 0. 20 S. E. fishes per m 2), but more than 80 % of all fishes were from the family Pomacentridae. The structure of fish communities was very consistent among reefs, but varied greatly among <b>zones</b> within each <b>reef.</b> On the reef flat, the fish community was dominated by the pomacentrid Chrysiptera cyanea and the acanthurid Acanthurus nigrofuscus. In contrast, the reef slope community was characterised by high densities of the pomacentrids Pomacentrus lepidogenys and P. richardsoni, as well as high densities of the acanthurid Ctenochaetus striatus. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the structure of the coral reef fish communities varied in relation to <b>reef</b> <b>zone,</b> water depth, and distance from the shoreline, but these changes were not related to spatial variation in either coral abundance or coral richness...|$|R
