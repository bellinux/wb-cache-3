50|$|There is {{currently}} an abandoned military site there. It was first {{operated by the}} US Coast Guard {{beginning in the early}} 1960s as a LORAN (<b>Long</b> <b>Range</b> Aid to <b>Navigation)</b> Station. The station at Estaca de Bares operated jointly with stations operated by the British Government in East Blockhouse, Wales and, until 1973, the French Government in Pospoder, France. In 1978, after the Coast Guard ended the LORAN operations, the US Air Force assumed control of the base. The US Air Force 2186 Communications Squadron, headquartered at Torrejon Air Base near Madrid, operated the site as a remote Radio Relay Link (RRL) communications site until 1991, and it now sits in ruins. While the site was open, many Americans met and married local citizens.|$|R

40|$|Maryland is {{designing}} and de:reloping a vision system for autonomous ground navigation. Our approach to visual navigation segments the task into three levels called <b>long</b> <b>range,</b> intermediate range and short <b>range</b> <b>navigation.</b> At the <b>long</b> <b>range,</b> one would first generate {{a plan for}} the day's outing, identifying the starting location, the goal, and a low resolution path for moving from the start to the goal. From time to time, {{during the course of the}} outing, one may want to establish his position with respect to the <b>long</b> <b>range</b> plan. This could be accomplished by visually identifying landmarks of known location, and then triangulating to determine current position. We describe a vision system for position determination that we have developed as part of this project. At the intermediate range, one would look ahead to determine generally safe directions of travel called corridors of /tee space. Short <b>range</b> <b>navigation</b> is the process that, based on a detailed topographic analysis sf one's immediate environment, enables us to safely navigate around obstacles in the current corridor of free space along a track o / safe passage.

50|$|Transit-time {{measurement}} underlies most {{radio navigation}} systems for boats and aircraft, for example, radar and the nearly obsolete <b>Long</b> <b>Range</b> Aid to <b>Navigation</b> LORAN-C. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent {{out by the}} vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a responder beacon. The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the global positioning system a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with {{the time they were}} sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the transit time can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to vehicles that are guided automatically along roads of preselected types, a project is described that guides a road vehicle {{to execute a}} complete driving mission. To increase the robustness of the current implementation a-priori knowledge about the vehicle's environment is extensively used. A digital road map can provide <b>long</b> <b>range</b> knowledge. The <b>navigation</b> system Travelpilot, commercially offered by Robert Bosch GmbH, includes a digital map that {{is used as a}} base to locate the vehicle and for route planning. Short range information about the vehicle's current state is derived from a sequence of images taken by three cameras behind the windscreen. This arrangement offers the necessary field of view for manoeuvres like turning at sharp corners. Initiated by machine vision surveillance, road junctions are tracked using a dynamic model of the vehicle-road-status. Using the knowledge about the route and the next intersection type, as contained in the road map, the most suited camera among the three available onces can be selected. This leads to a robust performance of manoeuvres even on more complex road networks...|$|R
