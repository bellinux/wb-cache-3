2500|$|Three months later, Shuvalov was {{appointed}} a kammer-junker, and his liaison with the Empress began. Although the cousins {{planned to use}} him as a pawn in their court intrigues, Shuvalov refused to get enmeshed in their machinations. As his biographers <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> Shuvalov was [...] "mild and generous to all" [...] and [...] "had no enemies whatsoever".|$|E
2500|$|Considered one of {{the most}} gifted comic writers of her time, Nancy Mitford said she wrote the article about her peers [...] "In order to {{demonstrate}} the upper middle class does not merge imperceptibly into the middle class". She said differences of speech distinguish the members of one social class in England from another. The daughter of a Baron, she was therefore an [...] "Hon" [...] − honourable. Deborah Mitford Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire, the youngest of the famously (and sometimes infamously) unconventional Mitford sisters, wrote a letter to Encounter about the article saying: [...] "... as the co-founder, with my sister Jessica, of the Hons Club, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that ... the word Hon meant Hen in Honnish... We were very fond of chickens and on the whole preferred their company to that of human beings ...".|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't grumble," [...] said Ingleby, who {{had almost}} {{expected}} this. [...] "Still I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that only one}} of us is responsible." ...|$|E

50|$|Loebner also <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that, {{unlike the}} solid gold medal for the Loebner prize, the gold medals of the Olympic Games are not solid gold, but {{are made of}} silver covered with {{a thin layer of}} gold.|$|R
5000|$|Célimène : A {{young woman}} who is courted by Alceste, Oronte, Acaste, and Clitandre. She is playful and flirtatious, and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the flaws of {{everyone}} she meets behind their backs. Célimène pays much attention to social appearances.|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth {{turned to}} Laura. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that this is}} the man who urged me to go," [...] he said. [...] "One can't count on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] laughed Mrs. Farquhar, [...] "I {{certainly}} {{wanted a}} little talk with you. To begin with, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that we have}} had a good deal of your company lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lister {{gazed at}} him almost incredulously. [...] "Of course, I'll have to go if you really mean it. Still, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that in some respects you're not exactly a model yourself." ...|$|E
50|$|An historian, {{as well as}} a linguist, Geraint Morgan <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> when he knew {{he would}} be the last MP for Denbigh, that the first MP for Denbigh had {{occupied}} the adjacent (literal) seat in Parliament in Westminster to the very last MP in Westminster for Calais.|$|R
5000|$|Caen {{was born}} April 3, 1916, in Sacramento, California, {{although}} he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that his parentspool hall operator Lucien Caen and Augusta (Gross) Caenhad {{spent the summer}} nine months previous at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. After high school (where he wrote a column, [...] "Corridor Gossip") he covered sports for The Sacramento Union.|$|R
5000|$|On Celtic broadcasts, Heinsohn <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{players who}} display extra hustle {{to help the}} team by giving them [...] "Tommy Points." [...] One player in each game has {{exceptional}} play and hustle highlighted for the [...] "Tommy Award". During broadcasts he {{is known for his}} sense of humor and indignantly questioning game officials when calls against the Celtics appear to be made in error.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} step inside for a moment, Mr. Pratt," [...] she went on, [...] "there are {{one or two}} little things I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to you. The {{cupboard}} in Sybil's room--" ...|$|E

60|$|And the {{essential}} thing I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to these authorities upon African questions {{is that not}} one of them even hints at any other formula which covers the broad essentials of the African riddle.|$|E
50|$|George V. Higgins {{was proud}} of his skill in {{rendering}} dialogue with great accuracy; he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that accurate dialogue was not a verbatim transcription of things said but an imaginativerecreation in compressed form. Higgins was also an expert in lending atmosphere to a series of harsh or barren facts, and in inducing his readers to figure out certain things artfully implied in the text but never stated.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Hollywood (voiced by Brian Cummings) is a {{large man}} who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> others' mistakes. Whenever the dogs bump into him, he has a {{completely}} new appearance. He has also had many occupations such as a teacher, farmer, casino manager, Noah and pet shop owner. When <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> others' mistakes he will say, [...] "Aww, isn't that cute? BUT IT'S WRONG!!!" [...] or, {{in the event that}} others (usually the dogs) repeat their mistakes, [...] "Aww, isn't that cute? BUT IT'S STILL WRONG!!!" ...|$|R
50|$|In all three, Horvat {{explores the}} miracles of {{everyday}} life, unlike the widespread tendency of photographing whatever seems exceptional or extreme. But what he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{is that these}} photographs, that look like candid shots and are done with a camera that any amateur could own, represent something like the sum of his life’s visual and emotional experiences, reduced to their core by a merciless elimination - whether {{at the moment of}} shooting, at the time of editing or in the process of postproduction - of what he considers superfluous or distracting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> sir," [...] Crawshay begged, [...] "that that foolish {{journey to}} Halifax was {{undertaken}} entirely against my convictions. I protested at the time! Neither had I any {{confidence in the}} summons to Chicago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{discussed}} those estimates at length already," [...] he said. [...] "I should, however, <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that I consider them absurdly high. In fact, I'd undertake {{to do the}} work at not {{more than two-thirds of the}} cost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is merely}} Gregory's deputy," [...] she said, with a sub-conscious {{feeling that the}} epithet was not a remarkably {{fortunate}} one. [...] "In that connection, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that you can estimate a man's character by that of his friends." ...|$|E
50|$|Charles {{was born}} in Évreux. Since his father was first cousin to King Philip VI of France, and his mother, Joan II of Navarre, was {{the only child of}} King Louis X, Charles of Navarre was 'born of the fleur de lys on both sides', as he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> but he succeeded to a {{shrunken}} inheritance as far as his French lands were concerned. Charles was raised in France during childhood and up to the moment he was declared king at 17, so he probably had no command of the Romance language of Navarre at the moment of his coronation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, {{the final}} {{memorandum}} of the [...] "Democratic Alternative" [...] argued that Yugoslavia could only {{survive as a}} democratic community of sovereign nations, and that any other scenario would almost inevitably lead to a civil war. Ivanović {{lived long enough to}} witness the awful fulfillment of this prophecy with the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars. In 1990 Ivanović became a citizen of the Republic of Croatia. He died in London on 4 April 1999. His father <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Ivanović was the first Yugoslav in the family. Born on the eve of unification, he died as its last remnants collapsed.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that {{it would}} be very slow work beating back up this inlet, and if we did so there isn't a stage across the island for several days. No doubt you {{remember}} you have to see that contractor on Thursday, and there's the directors' meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that'll be all right!" [...] said a new voice, with a transatlantic intonation, [...] "though I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> {{here and}} now, {{that things are}} getting a mite difficult. There's not the sympathy there was, and a growing {{disposition}} to let the Irish settle their own affairs without interference from America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{get over}} it," [...] Carroll {{informed}} him. [...] "It isn't {{the first time}} I've suffered from the same complaint. But I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that your chivalrous impulses may be the ruin of you some day. Why didn't you let Drayton settle with the man? You gave him a check, I suppose?" ...|$|E
50|$|They {{returned}} to Chicago in 1967 to rejoin Sills, Sheldon Patinkin, Bernie Sahlins and Joyce Sloane in forming Second City Repertory and then Story Theatre. Piven, charismatic, balding and bearded, with a beautifully resonant voice, {{spent some time}} as an acting teacher at Northwestern University, offering his expertise in improvisation {{as well as his}} peculiarly sage view of life, combining a respect for zen and the torah. In 1972, he and his wife started the Piven Theatre Workshop, partly to supplement their incomes, and partly to have something for their children to do after school. As Piven <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> many of those children went on to fame and fortune.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{raised in}} Nebraska, which leans {{extremely}} right, {{many of his}} cartoons are made of people who repeat Republican or right-Wing jargon thoughtlessly. His favorite Journal-Star and Omaha Reader cartoon targets are local politicians. He also <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the hypocrisy of people of all leanings, sometimes using [...] "Sneaky Donkey" [...] to show the hypocrisy of the Republicans or [...] "Stupid Donkey" [...] to show the flaws of the Democrats. Many of his Journal-Star and Omaha Reader cartoons deal with local issues, such as the flawed thinking of some officials {{as they try to}} build business in Omaha, Lincoln, and State of Nebraska.|$|R
40|$|Bearing in {{mind the}} fact that many {{scientific}} researches, the mental retardation are treated as a complex and specific human phenomenon, the author of this paper <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> three basic questions. Those are the definition of mental retardation, classification of the some of the characteristics of the mentally retarded persons. In connection with this questions practically all of the former awareness is presented and also for this aim is used a huge list of literature. Here is made a synthesis of many opinions of the eminent authors. With this presentation, concerned specialists, parents and students could be acquaintance with most important facts about the mentioned problems, which are elaborated in this paper...|$|R

"We {{will let}} it go at that," [...] Francis commented, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{to you that the}} {{antagonism}} between us is in no way personal.

6000|$|... "The totals are enormous, sir," [...] he admitted, [...] "and you {{may take}} it that they are {{absolutely}} correct. They represent our holdings as revised after the receipt of this morning's mail. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> too, sir, that they have increased out of all proportion to outside shipments, during the last four days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is a fact}} {{which we}} should not presume to dispute," [...] the lawyer admitted, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that, on the next {{occasion}} {{when we had a}} little money in hand, your household steward, Mr. Harrison, was here in urgent need of a thousand pounds for the payment of domestic bills connected with the establishment in Grosvenor Square." ...|$|E
5000|$|Souta Inaba is in Yuuki's class. He enjoys {{studying}} {{and is very}} smart (which he often <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> especially <b>to</b> Nachi). He tends to argue quite often with Nachi. In Takamagahara, Souta is a long-haired priest who predicts the future by dropping his stone into water. They use his fortune-telling skills {{to make money in}} Takamagahara, seeing as all of the others tend to get fired from their jobs because of their constant arguing. He has been researching [...] "the end of the legend," [...] and tells Yuuki that he never thought that he'd be part of that legend. Souta has a fear of ghosts. The symbol on his stone is [...] "sariyasu" [...] (cloth).|$|R
25|$|Caruso's father, Marcellino, was a {{mechanic}} and foundry worker. Initially, Marcellino thought his son should adopt the same trade, {{and at the}} age of 11, the boy was apprenticed to {{a mechanic}}al engineer who constructed public water fountains. (Whenever visiting Naples in future years, Caruso <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> a fountain that he had helped to install.) Caruso later worked alongside his father at the Meuricoffre factory in Naples. At his mother's insistence, he also attended school for a time, receiving a basic education under the tutelage of a local priest. He learned to write in a handsome script and studied technical draftsmanship. During this period he sang in his church choir, and his voice showed enough promise for him to contemplate a possible career in music.|$|R
6000|$|He {{appeared}} to be reflecting, but Winston was on his guard. [...] "More frequently, I fancy, but you had nothing definite against me, and the times have changed. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> that <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you civilly. Your chiefs are also on good terms with us at Silverdale, you see." ...|$|R
