50|$|Considering these principles, the {{audiovisual}} montage may {{refer to}} two aspects: the intrinsic one, which {{alludes to the}} aesthetic connection of a shot with the next one, thus obtaining different forms, such as the analogy, the contrast and others. The other aspect is the extrinsic montage, which is the method of association point between a shot {{and the next one}} and that may be, for example, by a cut or by the so-called dissolve effect or <b>lap</b> <b>dissolve</b> between a still image and the one after it.|$|E

He created, shot, and edited these kinesthetic montages for features at Universal Studios (then known as Universal Pictures), MGM, RKO, and Paramount. He directed a short documentary film for RKO, Private Smith of the U.S.A., that {{was nominated for}} an Academy Award.|$|R
5000|$|By 1952, {{when the}} Telop II was introduced, CBS and NBC were using Telop {{machines}} {{in combination with}} TV cameras to permit instant fading from one object to another by superimposition. The Telop II was a smaller version of the original model for new TV stations on a budget, and featured two openings rather than the original four. At the same time, Gray also developed a Telojector, a gun-turret style slide projector for 2" [...] x 2" [...] slides which had two projectors, facilitating easier <b>lap</b> <b>dissolves</b> between the two.|$|R

The curtains painted with overlapped landscapes offered the audience successive and changing images inside a darkroom camera, with a sound effect of nature. Due to its principle of action, development and ending, and the dissolve effect of one image over the other, it constituted the same principle than the current audiovisual art: photos shown with <b>lap</b> <b>dissolve</b> together with the sound in an articulated montage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of this new period is actually marked by a substantial change in the aspects connected with the aesthetic grounds of his Audiovisual Theory, which {{are related to the}} extrinsic montage, in which the author leaves aside what he calls [...] "extrinsic association point due the <b>lap</b> <b>dissolve</b> understood as free will", going to a new formalist accuracy, which is a hypothesis developed in his simultaneous writings. This period starts with [...] "El jardín secreto. Lo imperceptible en invierno" [...] (The Secret Garden. Invisible in winter), [...] "The great down", and [...] "Spring Music" [...] edited in 2015, as from the documentary material from the previous year. On the other hand, he concludes the third part of his trilogy called [...] "Una voz sobre La Tierra" [...] (A Voice over the Earth), In July 2015, he publishes his literary work 'El audiovisual y las artes' (The Audiovisual Theme and the Arts), which establishes the relationship of the audiovisual art with the other arts, proposing their hierarchy according to an aesthetic psychology which lays the foundations for the finishing limits a person can access, through a deepening scale, and combining his comparison in relation to that hierarchy. The work ends with an appendix and other main aspects to be considered in an artistic work analysis, and it is concluded in 2016 with Los niveles de la experiencia estética. Sinopsis y antología de los principios de la teoría (The levels of the Aesthetic Experience. Synopsis and anthology of the theories principles.) ...|$|E
50|$|Chaney {{claimed he}} was forced to sit {{motionless}} for hours as the scenes were shot frame by frame. At times he {{claimed he was}} to remain sitting even while the crew broke for lunch and was not even allowed to use the bathroom. Chaney even went as far as saying special effects men drove tiny finishing nails into the skin on the sides of his hands so they would remain motionless during close ups. However, there may be some exaggeration involved - studio logs indicate during the filming of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) the entire crew, including Chaney took a two-hour break during the filming of a transformation and filmed the rest of the scene later that day (though the makeup for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein had been greatly redesigned and streamlined by Bud Westmore over the original Jack Pierce makeup). What really happened was a plaster mold was made to hold his head absolutely still as his image was photographed and his outline drawn on panes of glass in front of the camera. Chaney then went to makeup man Jack Pierce's department, where Pierce, using grease paint, a rubber snout appliance and a series of wigs, glued layers of yak hair to Chaney's face. Then Chaney would return to the set, line himself up using the panes of glass as reference and several feet of film were shot. Then Chaney would return to the make-up department, a new layer was applied, showing the transformation further along, then returned to the sound stage. This was done about a half-dozen times. Talbot’s <b>lap</b> <b>dissolve</b> transformation on screen only took seconds, while Chaney’s took almost ten hours.|$|E
5000|$|According to MGM's {{dialogue}} cutting {{continuity and}} Leonard Maltin's audio {{commentary on the}} current DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) {{with the image of}} a [...] "boat on canal". A superimposed title read, [...] "ITALY - WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT", and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo's Pagliacci performed by [...] "everyday" [...] Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue ("Un nido di memorie...") as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with [...] "la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano" [...] (from [...] "Stridono lassù"); a [...] "captain" [...] comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into [...] "Vesti la giubba"; then, a <b>lap</b> <b>dissolve</b> into a hotel lobby, where a [...] "baggage man" [...] is rolling a trunk and crooning about [...] "nettare divino" [...] ("divine nectar"); a waiter joins the baggage man in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies. Maltin stated the scene was cut during World War II to remove references to Italy, and unfortunately, the main negative was cut as well, so the scene is now lost.This notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints.|$|E
40|$|A study {{investigated}} how children between ages 5 and 11 perceive {{three types of}} film transition. A second purpose {{was to determine if}} there was an emergent recognition pattern among these three types of film transition devices; image magnification on a cut (a camera transition), <b>lap</b> <b>dissolve</b> (an optical transition), and clean exit (a subject transition). The research was conducted with 15 subjects from each of four age groups [...] 5, 7, 9, and 11. Each child viewed three examples of each type of transition. Then he was asked to describe what he perceived as having happened relevant to that transition. Judges evaluated whether the child had perceived the intended meaning in each trEisition. Analysis of the data indicated that children perceive these transitions with increasing accuracy as they grow older. Also, they most frequently can identify examples of clean exit. They identify examples of the other types of transition far less f-requently. (JK) vas UN...|$|E
