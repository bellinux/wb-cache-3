40|$|DNA {{measurement}} and RNA extraction are two frequently used methods for cell characterization. In the conventional protocols, they require similar, but separate samples {{and in most}} cases, different pretreatments. The few combined protocols that exist still include time-consuming steps. Hence, to establish an efficient combined RNA extraction and DNA measurement protocol for two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) cell cultures, a PicoGreen-based DNA measurement was integrated in an existing RNA extraction protocol. It was validated by analysis {{of the influence of}} different <b>lysis</b> <b>buffers,</b> RLT, RA 1, or Trizol, used for RNA extraction on the measured DNA concentration. The DNA cell yield was evaluated both in cell suspensions (2 D) and on 3 D cell-seeded scaffolds. Results showed that the different RNA <b>lysis</b> <b>buffers</b> caused a concentration-dependent perturbation of the PicoGreen signal. The measured DNA concentrations in 2 D and 3 D using RLT and RA 1 buffer were comparable, also to the positive control. We, therefore, concluded that RNA extraction protocols using RA 1 or RLT buffer allow the integration of a DNA quantification step without the buffer influencing the results. Hence, the combined DNA {{measurement and}} RNA extraction offer an alternative for DNA measurement techniques that is time and sample saving, for both 2 D cell cultures and specific 3 D constructs. status: publishe...|$|R

A sequential protein extraction method was developed for large-scale proteome analysis of bone tissue.

More than 40 bone-specific proteins and 15 potential protein biomarkers previously reported were observed in this study.

[...] This primer also contains a common sequence upstream of the identifier, so that after it is extended by reverse transcription, subsequent rounds of PCR will incorporate the tag, which permits each isolated cDNA that is sequenced to be tracked back to a specific originating bead.

50|$|Cells of {{interest}} are cultured either in vivo or in vitro. During S-phase cells {{are treated with}} bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) which is then incorporated into their nascent DNA, acting {{as a substitute for}} thymidine. After at least one replication event has occurred, the daughter cells are synchronized at the G2 phase and individually separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells are directly sorted into <b>lysis</b> <b>buffer</b> and their DNA is extracted. Having been arrested at a specified number of generations (usually one), the inheritance patterns of sister chromatids can be assessed. The following methods concentrate on the DNA sequencing of a single daughter cell’s DNA. At this point the chromosomes are composed of nascent strands with BrdU in place of thymidine and the original template strands are primed for DNA sequencing library preparation. Since this protocol was published in 2012, the canonical methodology is only well described for Illumina sequencing platforms; the protocol could very easily be adapted for other sequencing platforms, depending on the application. Next, the DNA is incubated with a special dye such that when the BrdU-dye complex is excited by UV light, nascent strands are nicked by photolysis. This process inhibits polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the nascent strand, allowing only the parental template strands to be amplified. Library construction proceeds as normal for Illumina paired-end sequencing. Multiplexing PCR primers are then ligated to the PCR amplicons with hexamer barcodes identifying which cell each fragment they are derived from. Unlike single cell sequencing protocols, Strand-seq does not utilize multiple displacement amplification or MALBAC for DNA amplification. Rather, it is solely dependent on PCR.|$|E
