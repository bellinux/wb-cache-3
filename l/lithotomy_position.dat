40|$|Operative {{positions}} {{commonly used}} in urogenital surgeries when perineal exposure is required include the lithotomy and the exaggerated <b>lithotomy</b> <b>positions</b> (LPs), which expose patients {{to the risk of}} rhabdomyolysis. We report a patient with bladder outflow obstruction, benign prostatic hypertrophy and a very large bladder stone, which was removed with cystoscopy and cystolitholapaxy in the LP. The procedure was complicated by posterior bladder perforation and abdominal distention leading to prolonged surgery duration (5. 5 h). The patient developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure (ARF) without compartmental syndrome. On the other hand, there was a potential role of glycine solution, used for bladder irrigation, in the appearance of ARF. Overall, our case shows that rhabdomyolysis and ARF can develop in operative positions, and duration of surgery is the most important risk factor for such complications...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists Grades I and II, who were candidates for lower abdominal surgery in supine or <b>lithotomy</b> <b>positions.</b> Patients were randomly divided into early ambulation group (Group A) who were asked to start walking {{as soon as the}} anesthesia was diminished or to the late ambulation group (Group B) who walked after at least 12 h bedridden. Participants were contacted 2 days after spinal anesthesia to assess any type of pain at surgical or anesthesia injection site, muscle weakness, fatigue, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, headache, and difficult urination or defecation. Results: Four subjects (13. 3 %) in Group A and two patients (6. 7 %) in Group B had pain at anesthesia injection site (P = 0. 019). Fourteen patients in Group A (46. 7 %) and six patients in Group B (20 %) had post-dural puncture headache (P = 0. 014). Participants in Group B reported difficult urination more than Group A (P = 0. 002). there were not statistically significant differences between two groups regarding frequency of fatigue, muscle weakness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, difficult defecation, paresthesia, and the mean of visual analogue scale at the surgical site.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The early {{management}} of shoulder dystocia involves {{the administration of}} various manoeuvres which aim to relieve the dystocia by manipulating the fetal shoulders and increasing the functional size of the maternal pelvis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of prophylactic manoeuvres in preventing shoulder dystocia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 June 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing the prophylactic implementation of manoeuvres and maternal positioning with routine or standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied exclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included; one comparing the McRobert's manoeuvre and suprapubic pressure with no prophylactic manoeuvres in 185 women likely {{to give birth to}} a large baby and one trial comparing the use of the McRobert's manoeuvre versus <b>lithotomy</b> <b>positioning</b> in 40 women. We decided not to pool the results of the two trials. One study reported fifteen cases of shoulder dystocia in the therapeutic (control) group compared to five in the prophylactic group (relative risk (RR) 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 17 to 1. 14) and the other study reported one episode of shoulder dystocia in both prophylactic and lithotomy groups. In the first study, there were significantly more caesarean sections in the prophylactic group and when these were included in the results, significantly fewer instances of shoulder dystocia were seen in the prophylactic group (RR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 86). In this study, thirteen women in the control group required therapeutic manoeuvres after delivery of the fetal head compared to three in the treatment group (RR 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 09 to 1. 02). One study reported no birth injuries or low Apgar scores recorded. In the other study, one infant in the control group had a brachial plexus injury (RR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 10. 61), and one infant had a five-minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 10. 61). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no clear findings to support or refute the use of prophylactic manoeuvres to prevent shoulder dystocia, although one study showed an increased rate of caesareans in the prophylactic group. Both included studies failed to address important maternal outcomes such as maternal injury, psychological outcomes and satisfaction with birth. Due to the low incidence of shoulder dystocia, trials with larger sample sizes investigating the use of such manoeuvres are required...|$|R

50|$|The <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position</b> is {{a medical}} term {{referring}} to a common position for surgical procedures and medical examinations involving the pelvis and lower abdomen, {{as well as a}} common position for childbirth in Western nations. The <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position</b> involves the positioning of an individual's feet above or at the same level as the hips (often in stirrups), with the perineum positioned at the edge of an examination table. References to the position have been found in some of the oldest known medical documents including versions of the Hippocratic oath (see lithotomy); the position is named after the ancient surgical procedure for removing kidney stones and bladder stones via the perineum. The position is perhaps most recognizable as the 'often used' position for childbirth: the patient is laid on the back with knees bent, positioned above the hips, and spread apart through the use of stirrups.|$|E
30|$|At {{the time}} of {{induction}} of anaesthesia, cefuroxime (1500  mg) and metronidazole (500  mg) were administered intravenously. With the patient in the <b>lithotomy</b> Trendelenburg <b>position,</b> the abdomen was opened with a midline or transverse (Maylard) incision. The anterior rectal wall was mobilized from the promontory downwards by opening the peritoneum {{right out of the}} meso-rectum. The rectovaginal septum was dissected minimally until a correct suspension of the rectum could be provided for. This was checked by rectovaginal examination during the procedure. The lateral ligaments were preserved as much as possible and the right hypogastric nerve was identified and preserved as well. Fixation of the anterior rectal wall to the sacrum, just below the promontory, was performed using a polypropylene mesh of 9 [*]×[*] 3  cm, because of its low infection rate and high adhesive potential (Marlex® or Gynemesh®). Nine non-absorbable sutures, three rows of three, were placed to secure the mesh to the anterior rectal wall, 10 – 12  cm from the distal margin of the rectum, and three were used to secure it to the sacrum. A polytetrafluoroethylene inverted Y-shaped mesh (Gore-tex®) was used to fix the apex of the vagina (or the vaginal posterior side, {{at the level of the}} fornix posterior in patients with a previous hysterectomy) to the sacrum, to anatomically restore the vaginal axis. Four non-absorbable sutures, placed above the level of the uterine arteries, were used to secure the mesh to the vaginal apex and three were placed to secure this mesh to the sacrum or to a Marlex mesh in case of minimal space. The peritoneum was reefed by a continuously running resorbable suture, to seal the area of reconstruction and to further prevent the formation of an enterocele. All procedures were performed by the same team of surgeons (MEW and JBD).|$|R
5000|$|Because the fascia layer {{that defines}} the {{compartment}} does not stretch, {{a small amount of}} bleeding into the compartment, or swelling of the muscles within the compartment, can cause the pressure to rise greatly. Common causes of compartment syndrome include tibial or forearm fractures, ischemic reperfusion following injury, hemorrhage, vascular puncture, intravenous drug injection, casts, prolonged limb compression, crush injuries and eschars from burns. [...] Less common causes include labor and delivery following uncomplicated births and C-sections.Compartment syndrome can also occur following surgery in the Lloyd-Davies <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position,</b> where the patient's legs are elevated for prolonged periods. As of February 2001, any surgery that is expected to take longer than six hours to complete must include compartment syndrome on its list of post-operative complications.

50|$|In the <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position,</b> {{the mother}} is lying on her back with her legs up in {{stirrups}} and her buttocks {{close to the edge}} of the table. This position is convenient for the caregiver because it permits him or her more access to the perineum.

The patient is placed in a special position in a lithotomy operating table, called the <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position</b> (which, curiously, retains this name until the present day, when the same position is used for other unrelated medical procedures).|$|E
50|$|Side lying {{may help}} slow the baby's descent down the birth canal, thereby giving the {{perineum}} {{more time to}} naturally stretch. To assume this position, the mother lies on her side with her knees bent. To push, a slight rolling movement is used such that the mother is propped up on one elbow is needed, while one leg is held up. This position does not use gravity but still holds an advantage over the <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position,</b> as it does not position the vena cava under the uterus, which decreases blood flow to mother and child.|$|E

A fundoplication is the suturing of the fundus located in the stomach and around the esophagus. The procedure itself is performed with the patient in a low <b>lithotomy</b> <b>position</b> at approximately 25 degrees. After the esophagus is mobilized, the crura is moved posteriorly using sutures {{to make room for}} a French bougie. When in place, a wrap is created and sutured to the esophagus and to the right crus at the hiatus as well. After this is performed, the bougie is removed and the wrap is further anchored with additional sutures. The trocar sites are then closed.|$|E

[...] Girls [...] "may be pinned down so firmly that bones may fracture". In Somalia the clitoral glans is removed and shown to the senior female relatives, who decide whether enough has been amputated. After this the labia are removed.
