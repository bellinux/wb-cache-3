2500|$|More than a {{half century}} ago, Mario Bauzá {{developed}} arranging in-clave to a high art. Another name for clave is guide-pattern, and that is certainly how Bauzá related to it. Bauzá taught Tito Puente, and Puente's arrangers in turn, learned from him. The techniques were passed down {{from one generation to}} the next. It's worth noting that many of the highly educated, new generation of Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Both the clave genius Dafnis Prieto, and Alain Pérez, an important innovator in timba and Cuban jazz, reject the concept. Many of the younger musicians even reject the fundamental concept of [...] "clave rules." [...] Pérez states: [...] "I just don't treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn't learn it in that way" [...] (2002: web). New York-based Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba: [...] "The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in how to work with it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement" [...] (2010: 251). Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best when he said: [...] "We Cubans <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have clave license [...] [...] [...] and we don't feel obsessed about the clave as many others do" [...] (1999: 16). There is currently a [...] "clave schism" [...] between these two schools of thought.|$|E

We can all write home and arrange for any contingencies which may arise on account of the delay in our return. In fact, it will not be difficult for most of us to consider this excursion as a part, or even the whole, of our annual vacation. Those of us who can go with you are all able-bodied fellows, and if you say so, Captain, we will turn in and go to work this moment.

40|$|Background: Awareness {{of plastic}} surgery is lacking. Be it {{reconstructive}} surgery, or aesthetic surgery, {{public education and}} awareness regarding the spectrum is the need of the hour. Materials and Methods: We undertook a string of activities for patient awareness and education for burn prevention, occupational hand injuries prevention, skin banking awareness and various other conditions relevant to us as plastic surgeons. Use of social media helped us for increasing the reach of our projects. Observation and Results: Some of the projects we started, we are still pursuing with sincerity, and some never really picked up. A wide range and spectrum of activities were undertaken, and <b>we</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> have made some impact towards advocacy of plastic surgery; however, the measurable impact of these initiatives is questionable.

40|$|Earth, Moon and Sun unite {{when they}} star {{together}} in the three-body problem, whose intricate plot still baffles us today. For some reason, the factorization of the two-body problem into two one-body problems does not, in general, cross the N= 2 border. Is computational irreducibility responsible for this emergence of complexity, as Stephen Wolfram <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>think?</b> <b>We</b> don't know. The introduction to this thesis in Chapter 1, however, {{makes it clear that}} the history of science is marked by intermittent encounters of sudden complexities when the number 2 is left behind. In Chapter 2, I present an experiment that is quite similar in spirit, for my colleagues and I observe three-photon interference without two-photon and single-photon interference. We had to overcome significant experimental challenges that are typical for most quantum interference experiments involving more than two photons. Next in line is the three-slit interference experiment. Again a deceptively simple extension of the famous double-slit experiment, we are faced with questions that are difficult to access experimentally: the existence of genuine three-slit interference was first denied and then affirmed, though no experiment has decided yet. My contribution to the study of this problem is outlined in Chapter 3, where I use symmetry of measurement settings in such interference experiments to theoretically derive higher-order interference terms. In Chapter 4, I take a step back in one sense, for we study a two-photon phenomenon, but we also leap forward and discover entirely new interference landscapes. Theoretically and experimentally, I demonstrate how to use a polarization-modulated lasers to go beyond the standard Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip, and generate both triangular and square wave HOM interference patterns. Two-photon interference is also subject of Chapter 5, but with an interesting twist. While laser HOM interference relies on two independent photons, here we endow the pair with the strongest known correlations, namely entanglement. More specifically, we entangle a polarization and a time-bin qubit and use this hybrid to assess the viability of a rather special interferometer for quantum communication purposes...|$|R
