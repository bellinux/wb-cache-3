Here, epitaxial BaTiO 3 thin films are grown on NdScO 3 substrates under ≈ 0. 1 % strain. A monoclinic ca 1 /ca 2 phase, with 90 ° periodic in-plane domain configuration and small additional out-of-plane component of polarization, is stabilized at room temperature and investigated using piezoelectric force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Above 50 °C, this phase is transformed into an a/c phase with alternating in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations and forming zigzag domain walls between up-polarized and down-polarized superdomains. Both types of domain patterns are highly anisotropic, giving rise to very long domain walls. Above 130 °C, the paraelectric phase is observed. The occurrence of a phase transition close to room temperature, a low symmetry ca 1 /ca 2 phase, and the formation of periodic domains make of this material a promising candidate for high piezoelectric response.

Microcrystalline NaNbO 3, which stabilizes in an orthorhombic Pbcm structure at ambient pressure, showed bulk-like successive transitions at around 2, 6, and 9 GPa. The transitions were essentially reversible but some specific bands became sharper after pressure release, {{indicating that the}} positions of the ions in the perovskite lattice were rearranged. Submicrocrystalline NaNbO 3 (orthorhombic Pmc 2 (1) at ambient pressure) also showed phase transitions at around 2, 6, and 10 GPa on pressing. The pressure characteristic above 6 GPa was similar to that for microcrystalline NaNbO 3. The transition was almost reversible on pressing up to 2 GPa. Pressing above 2 GPa and subsequent pressure release resulted in a bulk-like spectral profile for specific sites of the powder. Nanocrystalline NaNbO 3 (orthorhombic Pmma at ambient pressure) showed a diffused and completely reversible transition behavior. Above 6 GPa, all powders with different crystallite sizes showed a similar pressure-evolution of the spectra. The lattice distortion induced by further pressing after touching of Na+ and NbO 6 - ions is comparable for all powders. On the other hand, a major difference of the pressure characteristics among the three types of powders was revealed for pressures below 6 GPa. Tilted NbO 6 octahedra start to reorient at around 2 GPa with alteration of Na+-NbO 6 - interactions. Remarkable spectral changes at ca. 2 GPa were observed for submicrocrystalline powders, which have the <b>lowest</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>symmetry</b> among possible polymorphs.

40|$|AbstractDislocations in {{geological}} minerals {{are fundamental}} to the creep processes that control large-scale geodynamic phenomena. However, techniques to quantify their densities, distributions, and types over critical subgrain to polycrystal length scales are limited. The recent advent of high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD), based on diffraction pattern cross-correlation, offers a powerful new approach that has been utilised to analyse dislocation densities in the materials sciences. In particular, HR-EBSD yields significantly better angular resolution (< 0. 01 °) than conventional EBSD (~ 0. 5 °), allowing very low dislocation densities to be analysed. We develop the application of HR-EBSD to olivine, the dominant mineral in Earth's upper mantle by testing (1) different inversion methods for estimating geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) densities, (2) {{the sensitivity of the}} method under a range of data acquisition settings, and (3) the ability of the technique to resolve a variety of olivine dislocation structures. The relatively <b>low</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>symmetry</b> (orthorhombic) and few slip systems in olivine result in well constrained GND density estimates. The GND density noise floor is inversely proportional to map step size, such that datasets can be optimised for analysing either short wavelength, high density structures (e. g. subgrain boundaries) or long wavelength, low amplitude orientation gradients. Comparison to conventional images of decorated dislocations demonstrates that HR-EBSD can characterise the dislocation distribution and reveal additional structure not captured by the decoration technique. HR-EBSD therefore provides a highly effective method for analysing dislocations in olivine and determining their role in accommodating macroscopic deformation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the compositional limits, phase stability and electrical properties of several oxide ion conducting phases in the Bi 2 O 3 -V 2 O 5 binary and Bi 2 O 3 -V 2 O 5 -Na 2 O ternary phase diagrams.   Samples were prepared {{either by the}} mixed oxide route frm Bi 2 O 3, V 2 O 5, and Na 2 CO 3 reagents or by hydrothermal processing of Bi 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 using (2 - 3 M) NaOH.   Sample were analysed {{using a combination of}} techniques including x-ray (XRD) and electron diffraction (ED), thermal analysis (DTA/TGA), electron probe micro-probe analysis (EPMA), and impedance spectroscopy (IS). The well-known oxide ion conductor, based on the ideal composition Bi 4 :V = 2 : 1) was shown to exist as a solid solution phase between 2. 15 : 1 = 2. 5 : 1 at 800 - 850 °C.   XRD, ED, and EPMA data provide evidence for a new polymorph (d) for Bi-rich compositions based on a defect fluorite d-Bi 2 O 3 cell, in addition to the well-known a, b, and g polymorphs.   This solid solution exhibits the highest level of oxide ion conductivity (at 800 °C) of all the phases studied, with values of ~ 0. 1 Scm - 1 at 800 °C.   Post-annealing samples at 650 °C for extended periods show that the Bi-rich solid limit is strongly temperature-dependent and hat compositions 2. 4 - 2. 5 : 1 are metastable and decompose into phase mixtures which include a low temperature triclinic phase based on a face-centred cubic cell with composition Bi 2. 9 VO 6. 85. The next solid solution phase occurs at 3. 5 - 3. 75 : 1 and not at 4 : 1 as has been previously believed.   Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) revealed complex crystal chemistry with the existence of three different types of patterns all based on a 3 -fold multiple of a d-Bi 2 O 3 fluorite-type subcell.   Most crystals had incommensurate modulation and also streaking indicative of structural disorder, attributed to variations in the stacking order of V 4 O 10 units within the cell. Samples were stable after post-annealing at lower temperatures, suggesting they are thermodynamically stable, albeit with complex, <b>low</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>symmetry.</b>   They are modest oxygen ion conductors with s- 5 mScm - 1 at 800 °C.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study low {{dimensional}} hole systems fabricated on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures without any modulation dopants. The electrical transports of holes in two dimensions (2 D), one dimension (1 D) and zero dimension (0 D) are studied. Two types of {{field effect transistor}}s are fabricated and studied. The first type is a semiconductor insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (SISFET) in which 1 D hole wires and a hole quantum dot are studied. The second type is a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET) in which devices {{with the ability to}} switch the type of charge carriers in the conduction channel between electrons and holes are fabricated (ambipolar devices). The 1 D hole wires are fabricated on the crystal plane of (100). The 1 D hole wires show strong Zeeman splitting when the in-plane magnetic field is applied parallel to the 1 D wires, and very small Zeeman splitting when the in-plane magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 1 D wires, regardless of the crystallographic orientation ([011] or [011 &# 773;]). This effect is different compared to 1 D hole wires fabricated on the crystal plane of (311) A, where there is an interplay between anisotropies due to the <b>low</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>symmetry</b> and 1 D confinement resulting in different Zeeman splitting measured in wires oriented in different crystallographic orientations. We then move onto the fabrication and study of a single hole transistor in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The Coulomb blockade oscillations resulting from single hole charges tunnelling on/off the quantum dot are observed and we also measure the charging energy of the quantum dot with source-drain bias spectroscopy. The quantum dot is found to be more stable and has less electrical noise compared to a single electron transistor fabricated on silicon, and compares favourably with an electron quantum dot fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with modulation dopants. We also fabricated the first ambipolar devices on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with the MISFET design and characterised these devices at low temperatures. Firstly the charge transport of electrons and holes are compared directly in a 2 D ambipolar device by measuring the density dependence of the carrier mobility. It is observed that the electron mobility can be modelled with charge scattering theories taking into account background impurity scattering, interface roughness scattering and screening. However, when the same fitting parameters are used to model the hole mobility by switching the effective mass of electrons to holes, the theory cannot fit the experimental hole mobility. Several possibilities for the deviation of the calculations are discussed but further experimental and theoretical works need to be conducted {{in order to determine the}} exact cause for this deviation. Finally we characterised ambipolar 1 D wires where both electrons and holes can be measured. Ballistic transport of both types of charge carriers is observed and we compare the 1 D subband spacings of electrons to holes...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in quantum confined holes in GaAs semiconductors {{as they have}} potential applications in electrical spin manipulation via the spin-orbit interaction, {{for the development of}} spintronic devices. As this is a developing area of research, further theoretical and experimental investigation is needed to form a complete understanding of hole spin behaviour in low-dimensional structures. In this thesis we conduct experimental studies in two different types of low-dimensional hole systems, fabricated on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures: two-dimensional Hall bars and zero-dimensional quantum dots. We begin by investigating an unusual, non-collinear spin response of a 2 D hole system, grown on a <b>low</b> <b>symmetry</b> (311) A <b>crystal</b> plane, where applying an in-plane magnetic field generates a spin polarization perpendicular to the applied field. We probe this effect by performing tilted field transport measurements and demonstrate that this phenomenon only occurs along a <b>low</b> <b>symmetry</b> <b>crystal</b> axis, and is caused by the presence of an off-diagonal g* xz contribution to the g tensor. Next we turn our attention from the static properties of 2 D hole systems, and explore the dynamic, non-adiabatic spin evolution of 2 D holes in tilted fields. We show that the phase evolution of the Shubnikovde Haas oscillations is very different between a high <b>symmetry</b> <b>crystal</b> axis and a <b>low</b> <b>symmetry</b> <b>crystal</b> axis. We model the experimental data using two paradigms (the abelian Berry and the non-abelian gauge field) and demonstrate that our dataset can only be explained by the presence of a non-abelian gauge field. Finally we fabricate and characterize induced, lateral, gated quantum dots to isolate single spin states, including one electron quantum dot and one hole quantum dot. We perform 3 D simulations to visualize the effect of the depletion region down at the 2 D gas layer and optimized the quantum dot design to achieve a few-hole quantum dot. We tune the quantum dot down to the last hole and verify this independently with an integrated, quantum point contact charge detector...|$|R
40|$|Titanium {{dioxide in}} the TiO 2 amp; 8722;B phase, which can be {{stabilized}} in nanoparticle form, is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries. Here the structural and electronic changes between nanoribbons in TiO 2 amp; 8722;B and the thermodynamic stable anatase phase are studied using nanoscale X ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. The oxygen K edge spectra of the two phases display marked differences which are very well reproduced in the calculations. Strong linear dichroism is observed in single nanoribbons, reflecting preferential O 2 p to Ti 3 d bond orientation in the <b>low</b> <b>symmetry</b> <b>crystal</b> structures. A simple bond counting model is developed which semiquantitatively accounts for the major dichroic effect.
