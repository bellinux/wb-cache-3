5|$|After the {{succession}} of King George I in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury {{as opposed to a}} single <b>Lord</b> High Treasurer became permanent. For the next three years, the government was headed by <b>Lord</b> Townshend, who was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Subsequently, <b>Lord</b> Stanhope and <b>Lord</b> Sunderland ran the government jointly, with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland managing domestic affairs. Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later; Townshend and Robert Walpole were then invited to form the next government. From that point, the holder of the office of First <b>Lord</b> also unofficially held the status of Prime Minister. It was not until the Edwardian era that the title Prime Minister was constitutionally recognised. With only few exceptions, the Prime Minister still holds the office of First <b>Lord</b> by constitutional convention.|$|E

5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new <b>Lord</b> High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of <b>Lord</b> Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First <b>Lord</b> of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory <b>Lord</b> Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of <b>Lord</b> President of the Council and <b>Lord</b> Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First <b>Lord</b> in November 1709.|$|E

5|$|Before the Georgian era, the Treasury of England {{was led by}} the <b>Lord</b> High Treasurer. By {{the late}} Tudor period, the <b>Lord</b> High Treasurer was {{regarded}} as one of the Great Officers of State and tended to be the dominant figure in government: the Duke of Somerset, <b>Lord</b> High Treasurer (1547–1549), served as <b>Lord</b> Protector to his nephew King Edward VI; <b>Lord</b> Burghley, <b>Lord</b> High Treasurer (1572–1598), was the dominant minister among Queen Elizabeth I's ministers; Burghley's son <b>Lord</b> Salisbury succeeded his father as chief minister to Elizabeth I (1598–1603) and later served King James I as <b>Lord</b> High Treasurer (1608–1612).|$|E

5|$|In 1715 {{when the}} Whigs came to power, George's chief ministers {{included}} Sir Robert Walpole, <b>Lord</b> Townshend (Walpole's brother-in-law), <b>Lord</b> Stanhope and <b>Lord</b> Sunderland.

5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the <b>Lord</b> Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current <b>Lord</b> Chancellor <b>Lord</b> Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a <b>Lord</b> Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a <b>Lord</b> Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became <b>Lord</b> Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E

For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge.|$|E
