In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, {{two ships}} of the South Australia Land Company left to {{establish}} the first settlement on Kangaroo Island. The foundation of South Australia is now generally commemorated as Governor John Hindmarsh's Proclamation of the new Province at Glenelg, on the mainland, on 28 December 1836. From 1843 to 1851, the Governor ruled {{with the assistance of}} an appointed Executive Council of paid officials. Land development and settlement was the basis of the Wakefield vision, so land <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> governing it were fundamental to the foundation of the Province and allowed for land to be bought at a uniform price per acre (regardless of quality), with auctions for land desired by more than one buyer, and leases made available on unused land. Proceeds from land were to fund the Emigration Fund to assist poor settlers to come as tradesmen and labourers. Agitation for representative government quickly emerged. Most other colonies had been founded by Governors with near total authority, but in South Australia, power was initially divided between the Governor and the Resident Commissioner, so that government could not interfere with the business affairs or freedom of religion of the settlers. By 1851 the colony was experimenting with a partially elected council.|$|E

25|$|During the Franco years, marriages {{had to be}} {{canonical}} (that is, performed under Roman Catholic <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations)</b> if {{even one}} of the partners was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy. These restrictions were probably one of the major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict. In the summer of 1981, the Congress of Deputies (lower chamber of the Cortes Generales, or Spanish Parliament) finally approved a divorce law with the votes of about thirty Union of the Democratic Center (Union de Centro Democratico or UCD) deputies who defied the instructions of party conservatives. As a consequence, Spain had a divorce law that permitted the termination of a marriage in as little as two years following the legal separation of the partners. Still, it would be an exaggeration to say that the new divorce law opened a floodgate for the termination of marriages. Between the time the law went into effect at the beginning of September 1981, and the end of 1984, only slightly more than 69,000 couples had availed themselves of the option of ending their marriages, and the number declined in both 1983 and 1984. There were already more divorced people than this in Spain in 1981 before the law took effect.|$|E

40|$|The Federal Government, in the {{exercise}} of its exclusive constitutional jurisdiction over aeronautics, has adopted <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that address the various aspects of the aviation system. These <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> have evolved significantly from the first piece of Federal legislation passed in 1919. Some of those <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> have as their objective achieving and maintaining an adequate level of aviation safety, while others are intended to ensure that Canadians have access to an efficient and reliable national air transportation system. On the safety side, there are <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that establish standards of quality for the aircraft, standards of competence for air carriers and standards of competence and medical fitness of the personnel. There are also regulations that specify the conditions that must be met in order to register an aircraft in Canada. On the economic side, there are <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that set the terms and conditions for the operation of domestic and international air services. In the domestic context, such <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> have gone from strict and almost complete government intervention, to giving effect to recent policies of less <b>regulation</b> <b>and</b> more competition. These same <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations,</b> while providing the regulatory authority with the necessary enforcement tools, also recognize the need to ensure that it does not act improperly or abusively.
