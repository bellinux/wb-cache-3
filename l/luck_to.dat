5|$|In Japan, {{strong belief}} in astrology {{has led to}} {{dramatic}} changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of Fire Horse. Adherents believe that women born in hinoeuma years are unmarriageable and bring bad <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices. In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> look {{in the face of}} an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E

60|$|The precise {{connection}} between these observations {{and the glass}} of rum, did not appear; for Mrs Gamp proposing as a toast 'The best of <b>lucks</b> <b>to</b> all!' took off the dram in quite a scientific manner, without any further remarks.|$|R
5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises as simple <b>luck,</b> <b>to</b> him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|Every {{second week}} of January, Romblon town celebrates {{the feast of the}} Santo Niño de Cebú, also known as the Biniray Festival. In that week, a fluvial parade {{featuring}} the image of the Santo Niño goes around Romblon Bay in order to bring good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> the villages. A mardi gras is also held in the town with various street dancing, food, drinks and music. A similar Biniray Festival also occurs in Banton every 10 September in commemoration of the island's patron, San Nicolas de Tolentino. Other festivals include the Saginyogan Festival in Alcantara, the Sanrokan Festival in Banton, and the Talabukon Festival in Looc.|$|E
5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take. However, {{in the remainder of}} the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.|$|E

5|$|The Mounties arrive {{the next}} morning, in hot pursuit. Kripik {{prevents}} {{his eldest son}} from killing the Mounties, and says he will leave and never come back. Kripik departs on foot, but Iva professes her love and goes with him. The Mounties pursue them on foot across the ice, which is breaking up. Sergeant Hunt takes aim at Kripik with his rifle, but cannot shoot him because Kripik has saved their lives and exhibited more honor and decency than white men have. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe, Hunt calling out goodbye and good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> them. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and that the adults {{will be able to}} return to Orsodikok and the other children next spring.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's third {{drive of}} the quarter started from its 23-yard line. The first two plays of the drive were stopped for {{negative}} gain, then Taylor completed a 17-yard throw to Jarret Boykin for a first down. Tech couldn't gain another first down, however, and punted to Stanford, which started from its 13-yard line. As in Virginia Tech's previous drive, the Stanford offense began with a play that lost yardage, but it made up the failure with a running play that gained sixyards and a passing play from <b>Luck</b> <b>to</b> Fleener for a first down at the Stanford 32-yard line. On the quarter's final play, running back Tyler Gaffney gained sevenyards. With one quarter remaining, Stanford led 26–12.|$|E
5|$|John Verbruggen {{was one of}} the {{original}} rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife Susanna, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke of <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when The Relapse had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about his availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void {{and at the same time}} order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of The Relapse. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.|$|E
