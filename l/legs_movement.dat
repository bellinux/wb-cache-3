40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> by myotomes caudal to the meningomyelocele (MMC) are transiently observed. It {{is unclear whether}} these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> relate to functional neural conduction through the MMC. For optimal therapeutical intervention, pathophysiological insight in these transient <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> seems relevant. If <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> by myotomes caudal to the MMC concur with the execution of general movements (GMs), functional neural conduction through the MMC is implicated. OBJECTIVE: In neonates with SBA, we aimed {{to determine whether the}} transiently present <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC indicate functional neural conduction through the MMC. METHODS: During the perinatal period, fetuses and neonates with SBA (n = 7 and n = 13, respectively) were longitudinally analysed for concurrency between <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC and GMs. To address the integrity of the reflex arc in spinal segments (at, or) caudal to the MMC, tendon leg reflexes were assessed during the first postnatal week. RESULTS: At postnatal day 1, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC concurred with GMs in 12 of 13 infants. Isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were observed in only 3 of these 12 infants (isolated vs. concurrent; p < 0. 005). <b>Leg</b> <b>movements</b> concurring with GMs lasted longer than isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (median duration = 11 s vs. 2 s; p < 0. 05). Between days 1 and 7, tendon leg reflexes (at, or) caudal to the MMC had disappeared in all but 1 neonate. However, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC remained concurrently present with GMs in all five neonates available for follow-up after day 7. Comparing these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> between days 1 and 7 indicated a decreased duration (- 44 %, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In neonates with SBA, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> caudal to the MMC concur with GMs, indicative of functional neural conduction through the MMC. The disappearance of these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> is caused by lower motor neuron dysfunction at the reflex arc, whereas neural conduction through the MMC is still functional...|$|R
40|$|Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> is {{associated}} with a ∼ 3 -fold increase in blood flow to the leg but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the role of nitric oxide (NO) for the hyperaemia observed during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement.</b> <b>Leg</b> haemodynamics and metabolites of NO production (nitrite and nitrate; NOx) were measured in plasma and muscle interstitial fluid at rest and during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> with and without inhibition of NO formation in healthy young males. The hyperaemic response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> and to ACh was also assessed in elderly subjects and patients with peripheral artery disease. Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (60 r. p. m.) increased leg blood flow from 0. 3 ± 0. 1 to 0. 9 ± 0. 1 litre min− 1 at 20 s and 0. 5 ± 0. 1 litre min− 1 at 3 min (P < 0. 05). Mean arterial pressure remained unchanged during the trial. When passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> was performed during inhibition of NO formation (NG-mono-methyl-l-arginine; 29 – 52 mg min− 1), leg blood flow and vascular conductance were increased after 20 s (P < 0. 05) and then returned to baseline levels, despite an increase in arterial pressure (P < 0. 05). Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> increased the femoral venous NOx levels from 35 ± 5 at baseline to 62 ± 11 μmol l− 1 during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (P < 0. 05), whereas muscle interstitial NOx levels remained unchanged. The hyperaemic response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> were correlated with the vasodilatation induced by ACh (r 2 = 0. 704, P < 0. 001) and with age (r 2 = 0. 612, P < 0. 001). Leg blood flow did not increase during passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in individuals with peripheral arterial disease. These results suggest that the hypaeremia induced by passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> is NO dependent and that the source of NO is likely to be the endothelium. Passive <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> could therefore be used as a non-invasive tool to evaluate NO dependent endothelial function of the lower limb...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> innervated by spinal segments located caudal to the meningomyelocele are transiently present. This study in neonates with SBA aimed {{to determine whether}} the presence of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> indicates functional integrity of neuronal innervation and whether these <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> disappear as a result of dysfunction of upper motor neurons (axons originating cranial to the meningomyelocele) and/or of lower motor neurons (located caudal to the meningomyelocele). METHODS: <b>Leg</b> <b>movements</b> were investigated in neonates with SBA at postnatal day 1 (n = 18) and day 7 (n = 10). Upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction was assessed by neurologic examination (n = 18; disinhibition or inhibition of reflexes, respectively) and by electromyography (n = 12; absence or presence of denervation potentials, respectively). RESULTS: Movements, related to spinal segments caudal to the meningomyelocele, were present in all neonates at postnatal day 1. At day 1, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were associated with signs of both upper (10 of 18) and lower (17 of 18) motor neuron dysfunction caudal to the meningomyelocele. In 7 of 10 neonates restudied after the first postnatal week, <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> had disappeared. The absence of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> coincided with loss of relevant reflexes, which had been present at day 1, indicating progression of lower motor neuron dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presence of neonatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> does not indicate integrity of functional lower motor neuron innervation by spinal segments caudal to the meningomyelocele. Present observations could explain why fetal surgery {{at the level of the}} meningomyelocele does not prevent loss of <b>leg</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

Eighteen elite male players of Turkish professional water polo first league aged between fifteen and thirty-three took part in the study voluntarily. The physical characteristics of the players were taken and throwing velocities of overhead, back hand and sweep throw were measured from position 2, 3, 4 and 6. Isokinetic strength measurements were made within different joint moves (trunk, shoulder, knee, hip). In two separate shooting protocols (with and without <b>leg</b> <b>movements)</b> the shooting velocity were measured in different positions. A significant difference was found between with and without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in different throwing velocity shoots were recorded in different shooting positions (p< 0. 01). It was seen that the average of the velocity of with <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> shoot was higher than the without <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> shoot. In terms of shooting positions, 2 nd position when the relationship between the velocity of with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and isokinetic muscle strength was considered, trunk flexion, shoulder extension, left hip abduction, left knee flexion as relevant p< 0. 05, a relationship with right knee extension was found (p< 0. 01). 3 rd position, a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was recorded between trunk flexion, shoulder flexion, left hip abduction, right knee extension and left knee flexion. In 4 th position, between the with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and trunk flexion, shoulder flexion, right hip extension, left hip extension, right hip flexion, left hip flexion, right knee extension, left knee extension, left knee flexion and left hip abduction. A positive relationship (p< 0. 01) between with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> (back) shoots thrown from 6 th and trunk flexion, shoulder extension, shoulder flexion, left hip extension, right hip flexion, left hip abduction, right knee extension and left knee extension. Also a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) between the with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> backhand shoots thrown in 6 th position, and right hip extension and left hip flexion. A positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was seen between the shoots thrown from part 6 th position with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> sweep shoots and trunk flexion and left hip extension. When the relationship between the velocity of without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and isokinetic strength is overviewed according to the positions, in 2 nd position there is a relationship between without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot and trunk flexion and shoulder extension, with the shoulder flexion a positive relationship was seen (p< 0. 01). In 3 rd position, there is a positive relationship (p< 0. 01), was recorded in the trunk flexion, a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was seen in shoulder extension and shoulder flexion. In 4 th position, a positive relationship (p< 0. 01) was found with the trunk flexion. A positive relationship (p< 0. 01) was found with the without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> backhand shoots that were thrown from the 6 th position and trunk flexion, shoulder extension, shoulder flexion. A positive relationship (p< 0. 05) was recorded with the without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> sweep shoots and trunk flexion and shoulder extension. In conclusion, the isokinetic strength produced by the lower and upper limbs’ relation with the velocity of with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoots thrown from different parts was found. The isokinetic strength produced by the upper limbs’ relation with the velocity of without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoots thrown from different parts was found. The isokinetic strength's (produced by the upper limbs) contribution to the velocity of the shoot in without <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoot is higher than with <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> shoots.

The effect of other sleep-disturbing conditions on atrial fibrillation progression is not known. We sought to determine whether frequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep is {{a risk factor for}} progression of atrial fibrillation. In this retrospective study, patients with atrial fibrillation and a clinical suspicion of restless legs syndrome who were referred for polysomnography were divided into two groups based on severity of periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep: frequent (periodic movement index > 35 /h) and infrequent (≤ 35 /h). Progression of atrial fibrillation to persistent or permanent forms between the two groups was compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis. Of 373 patients with atrial fibrillation (77 % paroxysmal, 23 % persistent), 108 (29 %) progressed to persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation during follow-up (median, 33 months; interquartile range, 16 - 50). Compared to patients with infrequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep (n= 168), patients with frequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep (n= 205) had a higher rate of atrial fibrillation progression (23 % vs. 34 %; p= 0. 01). Patients with frequent periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> during sleep were older and predominantly male; however, {{there were no significant differences}} at baseline in clinical factors that promote atrial fibrillation progression between both groups.

40|$|Background: Normative {{values are}} lacking for daily {{quantity}} of infant <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> This {{is critical for}} understanding {{the relationship between the}} quantity of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and onset of independent walking, and will begin to inform early therapy intervention for infants at risk for developmental delay. Methods: We used wearable inertial movement sensors to record full-day <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> activity from 12 infants with typical development, ages 1 – 12 months. Each infant was tested three times across 5 months, and followed until the onset of independent walking. We developed and validated an algorithm to identify infant-produced <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> Results: Infants moved their legs tens of thousands of times per day. There was a significant effect of <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> quantity on walking onset. Infants who moved their legs more walked later than infants who moved their legs less, even when adjusting for age, developmental level or percentile length. We will need a much larger sample to adequately capture and describe the effect of movement experience on developmental rate. Our algorithm defines a <b>leg</b> <b>movement</b> in a specific way (each pause or change in direction is counted as a new movement), and further assessment of movement characteristics are necessary before we can fully understand and interpret our finding that infants who moved their legs more walked later than infants who moved their legs less. Conclusions: We have shown that typically-developing infants produce thousands of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in a typical day, and that this can be accurately captured in the home environment using wearable sensors.

50|$|Individuals with {{restless legs}} {{syndrome}} have increased numbers of K-complexes and these are associated with (and often precede) <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> Dopamine enhancing drugs such as L-DOPA that reduce <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> do not reduce the K-complex suggesting that they are primary and the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> secondary to them. Failure of such drugs to reduce K-complexes in spite of reducing the <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> has been suggested to be why patients after such treatment still continue to complain of non-restorative sleep. Clonazepam is another treatment for RLS; like other benzodiazepines, it inhibits REM sleep by enhancing levels of GABA. This inhibition of REM sleep significantly decreases K-complex count, and unlike L-DOPA treatment, clonazepam studies report improvement in sleep restoration. Therefore, drugs that inhibit REM sleep also decrease K-complex count.|$|R
40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY: In {{the present}} {{longitudinal}} study we investigated {{the relationship between}} prenatal motor behaviour and the postnatal neurological sequelae of infants with spina bifida aperta. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Prenatal isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and general movements of 13 fetuses/infants with spina bifida aperta were assessed by means of ultrasound recordings, and were compared with: 1. the spinal level of morphological defect (meningo-myelocele), 2. the postnatal motor behaviour, 3. the postnatal sensory function, and 4. the final motor outcome. RESULTS: In all 13 cases studied, the spinal defect was either at thoracic (n = 8) or at lumbal (n = 5) level. All fetuses displayed active <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> corresponding to the functioning of low lumbal myelum segments (L 4 - 5 in two cases or L 5 -S 1 in 11 cases), despite vertebral defects at high localisation. These <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were of normal quality (normal in appearance) and endogenously generated, since no external stimulus was exerted to elicit them. This implies that in fetuses with spina bifida aperta active <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> can be generated at spinal segments which are located at (n = 1), or under (n = 12) the meningo-myelelocele. Postnatally, {{for a short period}} of time (mostly during the first few hours), <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> related to myelum function at (n = 1) or lower than (n = 7) the spinal defect were detected. However, only in two infants these early <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were of normal quality and corresponded with the final motor outcome. In contrast to these early neonatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements,</b> early sensory function was strongly related to the spinal defect (r = 0. 76; P = 0. 005) and to the final motor outcome (sensory function predicted outcome in all infants of whom follow-up was performed). CONCLUSION: These data on fetuses/infants with spina bifida aperta strongly indicate that a discrepancy exists between the occurrence of prenatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and the spinal localisation of the meningo-myelocele on the one hand, and between the occurrence of pre- and postnatal <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> on the other hand (quantity and quality) ...|$|R

DESIGN: Changes in heart rate variability (HRV), HRV spectra, and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra associated with idiopathic PLMS were compared with changes associated with isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> during sleep. Furthermore, correlations between electromyographic activity, HRV changes, and EEG changes were assessed. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Whole-night polysomnographic studies of 24 subjects fulfilling the criteria of either periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> disorder (n = 8), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (n = 7), or normal polysomnography (n = 9) were used. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Spectral HRV changes started before all EEG changes and up to 6 seconds {{before the onset of}} all types of <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> An initial weak autonomic activation was followed by a sympathetic activation, an increase of EEG delta activity, and finally a progression to increased higher-frequency EEG rhythms. After movement onset, HRV indicated a vagal activation, and, the EEG, a decrease in spindle activity. Sympathetic activation, as measured by HRV spectra, was greater for PLMS than for all other movement types. In EEG, gamma synchronization began 1 to 2 seconds earlier for isolated <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> than for PLMS. Significant correlations were found between autonomic activations and electromyographic activity, as well as between autonomic activations and EEG delta activity, but not between higher-frequency EEG rhythms and EMG activity or HRV changes.

40|$|Modulatory {{descending}} neurons (DNs) {{that link}} {{the brain to}} body motor circuits, including dopaminergic DNs (DA-DNs), are thought {{to contribute to the}} flexible control of behavior. Dopamine elicits locomotor-like outputs and influences neuronal excitability in isolated body motor circuits over tens of seconds to minutes, but it remains unknown how and over what time scale DA-DN activity relates to movement in behaving animals. To address this question, we identified DA-DNs in the Drosophila brain and developed an electrophysiological preparation to record and manipulate the activity of these cells during behavior. We find that DA-DN spike rates are rapidly modulated during a subset of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> and scale with the total speed of ongoing <b>leg</b> <b>movements,</b> whether occurring spontaneously or in response to stimuli. However, activating DA-DNs does not elicit <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in intact flies, nor do acute bidirectional manipulations of DA-DN activity affect the probability or speed of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> over a time scale of seconds to minutes.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the time structure of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (LM) in {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) syndrome, in order to advance understanding of their clinical significance. LOCATION: Sleep Research Centre, Oasi Institute (IRCCS), Troina, Italy. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Eighty-four patients (16 females, 68 males, mean age 55. 1 y, range 29 - 74 y). METHODS: Respiratory-related <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> (RRLM) and those unrelated to respiratory events (NRLM) were examined within diagnostic polysomnograms alone and together for their distributions within the sleep period and for their periodicity. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients with OSA and RRLM exhibited more periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in sleep (PLMS), particularly in NREM sleep. A gradual decrease in number of NRLM across the sleep period was observed in patients with RRLM. This pattern was less clear for RRLM. Frequency histograms of intermovement intervals of all LMs in patients with RRLM showed a prominent first peak at 4 sec, and a second peak at approximately 24 sec coincident with that of PLMS occurring {{in the absence of}} OSA. A third peak of lowest amplitude was the broadest with a maximum at approximately 42 sec. In patients lacking RRLM, NRLM were evident with a single peak at 2 - 4 sec. A stepwise linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for a diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and apnea-hypopnea index, PLMS remained significantly associated with RRLM. CONCLUSION: The time structure of <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> occurring in conjunction with respiratory events exhibit features of periodic <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in sleep occurring alone, only with a different and longer period.

We investigated how, in the crayfish brain, the synaptic response of local interneurons to statocyst stimulation was affected by <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> on and off a substratum. The magnetic field stimulation method permitted sustained stimulation of statocyst receptors by mimicking body rolling. The statocyst-driven local interneurons were classified into four morphological groups (Type-I–IV). All interneurons except Type-IV projected their dendritic branches to the parolfactory lobe of the deutocerebrum where statocyst afferents project directly. Type-I interneurons having somata in the ventral-paired lateral cluster responded invariably to statocyst stimulation regardless of the leg condition, whereas others having somata in the ventral-unpaired posterior cluster showed response enhancement or suppression, depending on the cell, during <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> on a substratum, but no response change during free <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> off the substratum. The synaptic responses of Type-II and IV interneurons were also affected differently by <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> depending on the substratum condition, whereas those of Type-III remained unaffected. These {{findings suggest that the}} statocyst pathway in the crayfish brain is organized in parallel with local circuits that are affected by leg condition and those not affected...|$|R
40|$|During {{terrestrial}} locomotion, frogs use {{two distinct}} gaits: out-of-phase <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> associated with slow crawling behaviour and in-phase <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> during fast jumps. In Rana esculenta, crawling occurs during feeding, while jumping {{is used as}} an escape strategy. We examined whether a similar velocity-dependent gait shift appears in swimming R. esculenta. Typically, swimming frogs propel themselves by kicking both hind limbs simultaneously. Observations of out-of-phase <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> in swimming frogs have been reported, but were usually assumed to be associated only with directional changes. We demonstrate that alternating-leg swimming is used quite frequently and that it results in a signi®cantly lower velocity to the one obtained by using in-phase <b>leg</b> <b>movements.</b> This difference {{is likely to be}} associated with energetic costs. Mathematical estimates of positive mechanical work required to move the centre of mass revealed that out-of-phase swimming is energetically less expensive than the in-phase gait at a comparable speed, but may not be ef®cient at high speeds. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are higher inertial energy losses for in-phase swimming, but at high speeds jet propulsion and an interaction effect may gain importance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- We {{designed}} a neuro fuzzy control strategy {{for control of}} cyclical <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> of paraplegic subjects. The cyclical <b>leg</b> <b>movements</b> were specified by three ‘swing phase objectives’, characteristic of natural human gait. The neuro fuzzy controller {{is a combination of}} a fuzzy logic controller and a neural network, which makes the controller self tuning and adaptive. Two experiments have been performed, in which the performance of the neuro fuzzy control strategy has been compared with a conventional PID control strategy. I...|$|R
