40|$|Small {{chip and}} Asplund fiber of {{temperate}} hardwood and softwood (beech and red pine respectively) {{as well as}} tropical hardwood (<b>red</b> <b>lauan)</b> were pulped by acidfied chlorite and peracetic acid at laboratory-scale basis. Experimentally holopulp of these three species was made at 5 - 15 % lower yield than theoretical value but obtained in up from 15 - 16 % higher residual pentosan, holopulp of beech and red pine {{was not easy to}} beat as compared with chemical pulps. Nevertheless, <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> was developed on a contrary trend. The holopulp was higher in color reversion and lower in scattering coefficient and opacity than conventional chemical pulp. Also the former had higher tensile, bursting and folding strengths but lower tearing strength than the corresponding characteristics of the latter. The physical properties of peracetic acid pulp were higher than chlorite pulp. The fact, however, happened only to the case of beech but red pine and <b>red</b> <b>lauan.</b> Limited data suggested that pentosan retention was responsible for all the above optical and physical differences...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study types of {{motorized}} vehicles <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running and their characteristics, {{the concept of}} critical distance was introduced, combining with the start and end of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> to classify motorized vehicles <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running into three categories: deliberate and unintentional <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violation at <b>red</b> onset and <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violation at <b>red</b> end. Based on video observation data, the number of motorized vehicles that commit any of the afore-mentioned three types of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violation was statistically analyzed, and then their characteristics under various traffic control and management conditions were explored using z-test method. The {{results show that the}} majority of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> runners at <b>red</b> start are deliberate, while the unintentional <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violators also share some proportion.

40|$|Using {{the same}} digital {{photographs}} of pork chops varying systematically in fat cover, colour, marbling and drip, 12, 590 consumers from 23 countries each selected their preferred chop. Preferences differed considerably between individuals, between groups and between countries when comparing equivalent subsets of consumers taken from each country. Most choices {{were based on}} two appearance characteristics. Overall, both dark and <b>light</b> <b>red</b> pork were preferred equally and often with low fat cover. Preference for the <b>light</b> <b>red</b> pork was frequently chosen in association with no drip. Low fat cover was preferred {{by the majority of}} consumers, particularly in Poland, Finland and Mexico. Strong characteristic pork preferences were given by consumers in Ireland (the majority preferring <b>light</b> <b>red,</b> lean, no marbling and no drip), Australia (<b>light</b> <b>red,</b> lean, no marbling), Korea (marbled), Taiwan (dark red and lean) and Poland (lean).

40|$|Intumescent {{material}} with commercial resin, such as acrylic copolymer resin, {{has been demonstrated}} to be extremely effective in improving the fire performance of wooden materials used for indoor furnishing. This study investigates the enhancement of painted thin <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> (Parashorea spp.) plywood by using intumescent coating with organo-clays added with different types of Cloisite 30 B, Cloisite 10 A and Cloisite 15 A and different amounts of organo-clays (1, 3, 5 and 10 %). These intumescent formulations significantly enhanced the fire retardancy of painted plywood, exhibiting lower peak heat release rates (PHRR) and extending the time to reach PHRR, as compared with plywood panels coated with intumescent coating with absence of organo-clay. Therefore, the amount of organo-clays added in intumescent is important. In additional, 3 % of Cloisite 30 B and 5 % of Cloisite 10 A further enhanced fire retardancy. The FT-IR, (27) Al and (31) P NMR analyses demonstrated that adding organo-clay extended the survival duration of the phosphor-carbonaceous chars structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
