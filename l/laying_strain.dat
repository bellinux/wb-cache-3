These findings concur with other reports in mammals that showed increased hydration and uronic acid in association with early DJD and in models of osteoarthritis (OA).

At the end of the 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 11 th laying month, approximately 40 hens were randomly chosen from each housing system and slaughtered (478 hens in total). Humerus and tibia strengths were analysed using a three-point-bending machine. Keel bone status was evaluated on a scale from 1 (severe) to 4 (no deformity). Shell breaking strength was measured every four weeks, totalling 4, 887 eggs. Statistical analyses were performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Humerus and tibia strengths of LS layers housed in SG were significantly higher compared to LS hens kept in FC. Bone breaking strengths of humerus and tibia in LS and LT layers were highest in the aviary system and the differences to the other housing systems were significant. No significant differences in tibia and humerus bone breaking strengths were found between SG and FC for LT hens.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that chicks acquire substrate preferences during an early 'sensitive' period. If a suitable substrate is absent during this period birds may develop alternative preferences for pecking at feathers. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether early substrate exposure has durable effects on the subsequent behaviour of adult hens. The effects of duration of substrate exposure, substrate change, age at exposure and time since exposure on adult bird behaviour were examined. From days 1 to 210, 144 <b>laying</b> <b>strain</b> birds were housed in pairs in pens with wire floors. The floors were replaced with solid floors covered in wood shavings at different ages and for different durations by allocation to 1 of 12 treatments. Adult birds that had never experienced shavings performed significantly more feather pecking than birds in any other treatment group. Thus, exposure to shavings, even for the minimum exposure duration of 10 days, was protective. However, current substrate was of great importance and adult birds housed on shavings performed significantly more ground pecking and less feather pecking than birds on wire, regardless of previous experience. From day 211 all hens were given shavings or straw, presented alternately for five 24 h sessions over 10 consecutive days. Birds foraged on both substrates and their foraging behaviour was not influenced by previous experience. Dustbathing occurred primarily on shavings and was significantly influenced by the age at which birds had previously been exposed to shavings. Dustbathing on shavings was fairly constant throughout the 10 -day test period in all groups, suggesting that relatively stable preferences had developed. A secondary 'sensitive period' for the formation of adult dustbathing substrate preference may have superseded the early 'imprinting' process. However, adult behaviour was generally flexible and strongly influenced by current substrate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

(E 2) in a 2 x 2 factorial design during the prebreeder period of 20 to 32 weeks. Birds of each treatment were randomized into four breeder treatments when lit at 32 weeks. Breeder performance traits were compared where hens were fed either 35 or 50 g. of protein per hen per day on either a 12 -hr. day with 53. 8 lx. (E 4) or a minimum 14 -hr. day with a minimum intensity of 150 lx. (E 3). Prebreeder treatment significantly influenced body weight at lighting where hens reared on 15. 6 % protein and a 6 -hr. day were the lightest while those on the 18. 5 % protein and a natural day were the heaviest. However, by week 35 these differences had disappeared. Performance traits of age at first egg, egg production, hatchability, broodiness, and egg weight were not affected by the nutritional regimes studied during either the prebreeder or breeder phase. Significant environmental influences existed for age at first egg, egg production, broodiness, hatchability, and body weight. The E 2 /E 4 regime significantly increased the age at first egg over the other three environmental combinations. Egg production was significantly reduced by the E 2 /E 4 treatment when compared to E 1 /E 4 and E 2 / E 3. Broodiness was adversely affected by both the E 4 and the E 2 / E 4 regimes.

The fourth group of layers fed BD enriched with 0. 7 mg Se/kg DM from Se-yeast. After 4 weeks of experiment, no differences in blood Se levels were observed between chickens fed diets supplemented with equivalent doses of SS or Se-yeast, while the 8 -week intake of Se-yeast resulted in significantly higher blood Se levels of layers than from SS (0. 17 vs. 0. 21 mg/L, P˂ 0. 01). The layers given BD showed significantly the lowest Se level. The daily Se balance was positive in all birds with the highest values in chickens fed larger amount of Se-yeast. The balance measurements carried out in week 4 and 8 showed no differences between groups supplemented with equivalent Se amounts in the selenium balance and Se retention (% of Se ingested), both differing from the control group in week 8 only. The 8 -week intake of Se-yeast resulted in significantly higher Se deposition in muscles, heart, gizzard, pancreas, lungs, kidney, Bursa Fabricii and feathers of chickens than that from SS. The highest tissue Se concentrations in all layers were found in the kidney. The layers given diet with larger amount of Se-yeast showed the highest values in the majority tissues.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effect of carcass fat on egg production in broiler breeder hens. Two groups of birds were brought into production {{at the same time}} (after a similar period of delay) but with widely different levels of carcass fat. This was accomplished by subjecting one group to restricted dietary energy and increasing daylength and the other to full feed but declining daylength. After reaching peak production the birds were subjected to a 0, 10 or 20 % reduction in energy intake for the remainder of a 36 week production period. Carcass samples taken at sexual maturity, at peak production and after 24 and 36 weeks of lay indicated that the level of carcass fat did not affect egg production adversely. A 20 % reduction in energy intake reduced production of total and settable eggs significantly during the cold winter months but had no effect on production during the summer months. There was a slight but non-significant improvement in egg production and feed efficiency when energy was restricted by 10 % in the summer. Egg size was not affected significantly by energy restriction in either experiment. Under the conditions of these experiments carcass fat had no significant effect on egg production. Egg production and carcass fat were roughly related to energy intake depending upon the season of the year. POULTRY SCIENCE 54 : 200 - 208, 1975 MOST attempts to restrict the feed or energy intake of <b>laying</b> <b>strain</b> hens while in production have resulted in lower egg production and egg weights (Burmester and Card, 1939; Heywang, 1940). It was tempting to explain the results of these early experi-ments by citing the use of high-fiber, low-en-ergy diets which made it difficult for the hens to overconsume energy. More recent studies in which modern laying diets were employed have yielded results similar to the earlier work.

A total of 1, 350 one-day-old mixed quail were used: 400 of meat-type, 450 of yellow laying, and 500 of red <b>laying</b> <b>strains</b> distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments (each treatment corresponded to one strain) and five replications. The experimental period consisted of 1 to 42 days of age. At 21 days of age, quail sexing was performed by means of sexual dimorphism, being individually identified at one day of age with numbered rings, allowing determining growth curves by gender. Birds were reared in a conventional system, fed ad libitum with diets formulated to meet nutritional requirements. Body weight was determined weekly and assessed using nonlinear models: Logistic, Brody, Von Bertalanffy, and Gompertz, whose parameters were estimated under a Bayesian approach via MCMC algorithm by means of BRugs package from the software R. DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) criterion was used to select the best nonlinear model, i. e. the lower the DIC value is, the better the model goodness of fit to the data. Gompertz model was better adjusted to the data regardless the gender or strain. Meat-type quail had the highest asymptotic weights and the highest age at which growth rate was maximum, followed by red and yellow strains.

Genotypes differed in egg weight, yolk weight, rate of lay, yolk cholesterol concentration (mg cholesterol/g yolk) and egg cholesterol content. Differences among strains were not significant when cholesterol was calculated as the concentration of the egg (mg cholesterol/g egg). Smaller eggs contained a significantly lower cholesterol content than larger eggs. The percentage increase in egg cholesterol content of large eggs was approximately equivalent to the percentage increase in their egg and yolk weights. Age of the hen was significantly positively correlated with yolk cholesterol concentration, egg cholesterol content and daily egg cholesterol output.

The lipid and protein composition of the body free of feathers were the components with the biggest change in the last weeks. Moreover, the chemical composition of the feather showed small variation. The parameters of the Gompertz function assumed values according to the employed adjustment, especially for protein and fat of the body free of feathers carcass. The adjustment of the Gompertz function by fixing the two parameters allowed coherence and biological significance. The allometric coefficients indicate that as the protein weight increased, the proportion of fat increased and the proportion of water and ashes in the body decreased.

The majority of egg consumption in Kuwait and the Gulf area is of the white egg type. However, it is known that the majority consumption in European countries and in the Middle East is of the brown egg type. This could be due to high quality of brown eggs including shell thickness. Therefore, the current research was conducted to assess the quality of brown eggs as compared to white eggs for two <b>laying</b> hen <b>strains</b> under local conditions. Furthermore, comparison between production efficiency of brown and white laying hens was conducted. Hy-line brown and white <b>laying</b> hen <b>strains</b> were used in the current study. During the laying period (22 - 69 weeks of age), percent egg production, egg weight, egg mass, feed consumption and feed efficiency were determined every four weeks. Shell weight, thickness, yolk and albumen weight and percentage and Haugh unit were determined at different laying periods for both brown and white eggs. It was found that egg production, egg weight and egg mass of the brown hens were significantly (P 0. 05) in the feed consumption between brown and white hens. However, feed efficiency was significantly (P< 0. 05) better for brown hens than that of the white hens. In addition, weight and percentage of egg yolk were somewhat lower in the brown eggs than that in the white eggs. It was also found that shell weight an...|$|R
40|$|Two {{thousand}} 1 -day-old layer chicks {{were used}} in the study from Lohman Brown, Isa Brown, Lohman White and Bowans White breeds. The chicks were placed in the at 3 cage densities (211. 8, 274. 5 and 370. 6 cm 2 per bird) and on 3 positions (as top, middle and bottom tiers). All birds were kept under standard management policy and a commercial vaccination program was practiced. Total specific antibody titres to Infectious Brochitis Virus (IBV), Infectious Bursal Desease Virus (IBDV), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Egg Drop Syndrome Virus (EDSV) vaccines at the ages of 5, 10 and 20 weeks were serologically determined by ELISA. Cellmediated immune response was also evaluated. In commercial white egg <b>laying</b> <b>strains</b> specific antibody titres to IBV, IBDV, NDV and EDSV vaccines were greater than in Brown egg layer strains. Keeping in cage created more stress in Brown egg laying chicks than those in white egg laying chicks. As cage density increased, the ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L ratio) slightly increased. Cage position had no influence on the titres of antibodies to IBV and IBDV vaccines but the position of cage in pullets where chicks were stocked, from top to bottom, NDV and EDSV antibody titre decreased and percentage of heterophils, H/L ratio and basophil rates were low. These findings suggest that cage-related stress could be decreased, resistance to diseases and finally well-being of hens may be improved if hens are kept under proper position and density within cage systems with respect to their physiological and behavioral characteristics that controlled by genes...|$|R
40|$|In five {{segments}} of incubation (within the 4 th day, on the 7 th, 14 th, 20 th days {{and in the}} stage of breaking through the shell) we studied the fertility of hatching eggs, the hatchability and embryonic mortality of seven initial <b>laying</b> <b>strains</b> (RIR – 1, RIR – 2, RIR – 3, RIW – 1, SU – 1, BPR – 1 and BPR – 2) {{in the course of}} three egg sets of individual pedigree hatching. The average hatchability of all the seven strains was 71. 5 %, the proportion of unfertilised eggs was 11. 3 % and embryonic mortality reached 17. 2 %. The embryonic mortality of all the seven strains culminated in two periods, i. e. within the 4 th day of incubation (36. 9 % of the total embryonic mortality) {{and at the end of}} incubation (from the 15 th to 20 th day of incubation – 23. 4 % and during breaking through the shell – 18. 1 %). In terms of the inter-line differences, the embryonic mortality was the highest in three lines, which had a higher coefficient of inbreeding (Fx +) on locus K, which is responsible for the rapid type of feathering using feathersexing. Within the 7 th day of incubation the embryonic mortality was higher in both BPR lines (BPR – 1 – 58. 1 %, BPR – 2 – 53. 6 % of the total embryonic mortality), while in the last trimester of incubation and in the period of breaking through the shell it was the lowest (BPR – 1 – 30. 8 %, BPR – 2 – 36. 2 % of the total embryonic mortality) ...|$|R
