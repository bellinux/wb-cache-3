5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of <b>landing</b> <b>lights.</b> Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the <b>landing</b> <b>lights.</b> Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
5|$|The Worcestershire County Air Ambulance, {{which has}} been {{operating}} since 1991, moved to the Strensham site in 1998 under a sponsorship deal with Take a Break, who were operating the service area at the time. Access to the air ambulance site {{can be made from}} the service station itself or from the local road network via the staff entrance to the services. An open day is held at the site each year {{to raise money for the}} operation of the air ambulance. In May 2008 the operational hours of the service was increased from 12 to 14 hours each day, as a result of this, <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> needed to be installed at the base to enable night time use.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new <b>landing</b> <b>lights.</b> The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground handling service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E

5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, {{on the morning of the}} seventh day of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E

25|$|Early on 25 December 1954, at 0330 hours, a British Overseas Airways Corporation Boeing 377 Stratocruiser {{crashed on}} landing at Prestwick, killing 28 of the 36 {{passengers}} and crew on board. The aircraft had been en route from London to New York City, when, on approach to Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. The crash {{has been attributed to}} a number of factors, including: pilot fatigue (the Captain was well over his duty limit due to the aircraft being delayed); the <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> at Prestwick being out of action due to repair; and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> (which might have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall.|$|E

25|$|The {{stronger}} undercarriage {{legs were}} angled 2inches (5.08cm) forward when extended, making the Spitfire more stable {{on the ground}} and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. In addition the retractable <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> were no longer fitted. Structural hard-points were added outboard of the wheel-wells, allowing racks to be fitted under each wing which were capable of carrying one 250lb (113kg) bomb each.|$|E

A centre-line ETC 501 rack typically held a 250kg (550lb) bomb, and wing-mounted racks mounted 300L drop tanks. A EK16 gun camera, as well as <b>landing</b> <b>lights,</b> were fitted to the wing leading edge. The U2 was armed with only two 20mm MG 151 cannon.|$|E
25|$|During its {{greatest}} extent during the Second World War, the air base {{consisted of a}} grass runway measuring , stretching from Bekken to Øvrevann. The runway had <b>landing</b> <b>lights.</b> There were twenty single-aircraft hangars, of which eight were hardened aircraft shelters. There were two air defense positions, one at Elvevoll and one at Heggelund. The armored unit was located at Brattørveita, just northeast of the airport. There were trenches located around the airfield to defend against a land-based attack.|$|E
5000|$|Henderson {{felt that}} <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> was [...] "starting {{to get a}} bit tired of jumping and maybe a bit knowing" [...] and decided to {{campaign}} the horse on the flat in 2003. Four {{and a half years}} after finishing unplaced at Saint-Cloud, <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> returned to flat racing at York Racecourse in May 2003. Assigned top weight of 140 pounds and ridden by Kieren Fallon, he started a 25/1 outsider for a handicap race over fourteen furlongs. He made steady progress in the straight to take the lead near the finish and won by half a length from the Michael Jarvis-trained Hambleden. The gelding was again given top weight of 140 pounds when he started at odds of 7/1 for the Ascot Stakes over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot and finished second of the twenty-seven runners behind Sindapour. On 28 June, <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> started the 9/2 favourite for the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle, but finished tenth behind Unleash.|$|R

25|$|This {{intentional}} oversight {{was to play}} a part in {{the pilots}} being unable to see the vehicles on the runway (they could not from the air). In contrast, the runway crew saw the Tu-154 coming at them from a good distance, its <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> on. They did attempt to contact ground control three times about the lights, but received no response and so ignored them, thinking they were being tested by a plane not on final approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} landing system was operational from 1 August 1986 and on 12 August Coast Aero Center started their two routes, using a ten-seat Beechcraft Super King 200 One week later, the ministry changed the concession for the Oslo and Skien route, so it was also awarded to Coast Aero Center. The service started on 24 October 1986. By November the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration had approved the <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> and other upgrades to the instrument system, which cost NOK3.9 million, causing the airport to have to borrow money. It also bought a used fire engine from Sola. The need for transport was extra high on Monday morning and Friday afternoon, when weekly commuters were flown in. The airport lost NOK668,000 in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The Hawker Hurricane is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{outfitted with}} retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for the pilot. A clean, single-seat fighter, {{it was developed}} to provide a competent combatant for aerial combat against the latest fighter designs that were emerging amongst the air services of other powers of the era. The Hurricane was initially armed with an arrangement of eight remotely-operated wing-mounted Browning machine guns, intended for conducting rapid engagements. The Hurricane was typically equipped for flying under both day and night conditions, being provided with navigation lights, Harley <b>landing</b> <b>lights,</b> complete blind-flying equipment, and two-way radios. Upon its entry to service, much of the performance data was intentionally concealed from the general public, but it was known that the type possessed a speed range of 6:1.|$|E
