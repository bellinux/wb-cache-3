5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the New York area, Washington founded a company producing kerosene gas mantles. At this time, they lived in New Brighton on Staten Island, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby Jersey City. This business was abandoned with the maturation of incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> technology. Washington also had a camera company for a time. By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of two of the servants.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E
5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford {{more than one or}} two ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.|$|E
5|$|Hammer {{was awarded}} the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute for his {{collection}} in 1906. The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000. It then was donated to the Edison Association of Illuminating Companies. The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The display information for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years. In 1931 the <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.|$|E
40|$|Since September 2009, Regulation 244 / 2009 of the European Commission enforces {{the gradual}} {{phase-out}} of incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs.</b> As of September 2012, only energyefficient lighting sources {{will be allowed}} for sale. Among these are halogen <b>light</b> <b>bulbs,</b> light-emitting diodes (LED), or compact fluorescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs?</b> {{often referred to as}} energy-saving <b>light</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The Commission’s justification for the phase-out of conventional <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> maintains that a reduction in the electricity consumed will not only lead to lower energy cost for private households and industrial consumers, {{but at the same time}} lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This article discusses possible reasons for the slow market diffusion of energy-saving <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> and shows that the investment in energy-efficient <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> does not necessarily lead to significant cost reductions. Drawing on some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the use of cheaper incandescent bulbs instead of energy-saving <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> can be economically rational in cases of rather low usage times, in which the higher initial purchasing price might only pay off after very long time spans. Furthermore, due to the coexistence with the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this regulation attains no additional emission reductions beyond those achieved by the ETS alone. We thus conclude that the general ban of incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> is inappropriate and should be abolished by the Commission. Energy efficiency; rebound effect...|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E

5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called ilmenium until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
