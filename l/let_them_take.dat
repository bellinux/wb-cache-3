Its success <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> a more experimental approach towards their next game, the free-to-play Gasketball. Mikengreg {{ran out of}} money during the game's development and the two lived on friends' couches. The game was reviewed favorably upon its August 2012 launch, but did not earn near the developers' estimates. Their next game, TouchTone (2015), spent two years in development.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E

De facto cooperation ensued between local YPG and SAA/NDF units against ISIL, though tensions were high there were several clashes throughout the year.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Joseph {{rises to}} a {{position}} of power in Egypt. Twenty years after being betrayed, he meets his brothers again without them recognizing him. The youngest brother, Benjamin, had remained in Canaan with Jacob, so Joseph takes Simeon hostage and insists that the brothers return with Benjamin. Judah offers himself to Jacob as surety for Benjamin's safety, and manages to persuade Jacob to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> Benjamin to Egypt. When the brothers return, Joseph tests them by demanding the enslavement of Benjamin. Judah pleads for Benjamin's life, and Joseph reveals his true identity.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{visited the}} home of {{historian}} A. J. P. Taylor in Disley. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking [...] "on a monumental scale", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> up residence in the garden summerhouse. In May 1949 Thomas and {{his family moved to}} his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. Just before moving into there, Thomas rented [...] "Pelican House" [...] opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953. It was there that his father died and the funeral was held.|$|E
2500|$|As governor, Gordon faced {{a variety}} of challenges. Besides working to end slavery, Gordon carried {{out a series of}} reforms such as abolishing torture and public floggings where those opposed to the Egyptian state were flogged with a whip known as the kourbash made of buffalo hide. Gordon was well known for being utterly obstinate, joking that: [...] "The Gordons and the camels are of the same race. <b>Let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> an idea into their heads and nothing will take it out. I have a splendid camel-none like it; it flies along and quite astonishes the Arabs". The reforms that Gordon wanted would have changed the basic nature of Ottoman-Egyptian rule, by {{replacing}} a system based on exploitation of the people by the state with one where the state would work for the betterment of the people. These aims eluded him.|$|E

Large numbers of humans have [...] "Goblinized" [...] into orks and trolls, while many human children are born as elves, dwarves, and even more exotic creatures. In North America, indigenous peoples discovered that their traditional ceremonies allow them to command powerful spirits, and rituals associated with a new Ghost Dance movement <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> control {{of much of the}} western U.S. and Canada, where they formed a federation of Native American Nations. Seattle remains under U.S. control by treaty as a city-state enclave, and most game materials are set there and assume campaigns will use it as their setting.|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the evening}} of June 21, Sheriff Thaxton reluctantly agreed {{to go to the}} mine to ensure the truce was carried out and the strikebreakers were given safe passage. Despite being urged to go immediately, he claimed he needed to rest. Thaxton promised to meet Hunter and Major Davis of the Carbondale National Guard company at the sheriff's office at 6 a.m. the {{following}} morning. That evening, Hugh Willis, the local UMWA leader, spoke to union supporters in Herrin. Willis said of the strikebreakers: [...] "God damn them, they ought to have known better than to come down here; but now that they're here, <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> what's coming to them." [...] Gunfire continued throughout the night, and the mob began destroying equipment to prevent the mine from reopening. They used hammers, shovels, and dynamite to wreck the draglines and bulldozers, while keeping the strikebreakers pinned down inside coal cars and behind barricades.|$|E
2500|$|In {{pre-production}} memos, Whedon {{described his}} vision for the score as [...] "spare, intimate, mournful and indefatigable". Just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the Western, he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation. However, {{he did not want}} to step too far into Western clichés to [...] "cause justified derision" [...] and hoped the score would also draw from Chinese and other Asian musical elements. He wanted the musical elements [...] "mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a cliché as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> us out of the story, but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is." [...] Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be [...] "either too airy or too sophisticated".|$|E

2500|$|Jim Sullivan, {{the local}} Official IRA commander, {{feared that the}} troops would launch a bigger raid and {{instructed}} his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, [...] "the Officials realized {{that they would have}} to fight" [...] and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, [...] "The way we looked at it, we were not going to put up our hands and <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, it was perfectly obvious that hundreds and hundreds of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum. The official figures were to be published later: soldiers in the Falls that weekend fired no less than 1,457 rounds.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{writing to}} FEMM's music {{material}} explore themes of girl power, feminism, {{and freedom of}} speech; two examples are the tracks [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] and [...] "Girls Night Out", which lyrically discusses female empowerment and not relying on male labor or assistance. Honey-B commented to an interviewer at Arama! Japan by stating, [...] "We {{leave it to the}} listeners to decide about the message or feel of this track, but as for FEMM, they’re singing about “girl power”. Itʼs okay to be sexy, just donʼt <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> advantage of you. [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] has very aggressive lyrics, but lots of women seem to relate to it. They call it their life anthem." [...] For their first extended play Astroboy, both members did not yet have any professional experience in singing. The duo stated that the first time recording and appearing in a music video as their agents was challenging. FEMM expressed that they would be honored to collaborate with any producers and songwriters who understand their message. Molly Osberg from Vice noted that FEMM combined Japanese fashion and music together. She commented [...] "At least, that's how I imagine we get acts like FEMM, the mesmerizing J-pop electro duo with a backstory more inventive than anything on the SyFy channel right now." [...] Osberg praised the producers and songwriters for being hidden pioneers in order to popularize the group, as she felt producers now were more [...] "the frontmen". Corynn Smith from MTV Iggy was impressed by their English language skills and commented [...] "The pair’s overwhelmingly English discography has something for everyone with electronic taste, whether you’re feeling like a romantic trance trip a la [...] "We Flood the Night", craving a techno remix of '70s J-pop hit [...] "UFO", or in a twerk-tastic, rubber-maid-outfit-clad [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] kinda mood." ...|$|E

50|$|Sharon Gerwitz {{explored}} this, {{writing that}} middle class parents have more {{economic and cultural}} capital than working class parents, and this <b>lets</b> <b>them</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the choices available.

She also noted how middle class parents socialised their children into attending church just to get their children into schools considered reputable. This shows how, as Ball, et al. says, wealth largely determines the extent of choice.|$|R
