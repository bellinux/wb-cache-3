The TiO 2 percentage in samples from NK deposit is greater than that in CP deposit. X-ray diffraction analysis of ilmenite shows characteristic peaks of ilmenite and some altered phases, such as pseudorutile, pseudobrookite, etc. Two ilmenite samples separated from CP and NK deposits were subjected to chemical beneficiation for production of synthetic rutile by a process developed and patented by NIIST. Investigations revealed that ilmenite samples with 32. 95 % and 56 % TiO 2 could be upgraded to synthetic rutile of 95 % TiO 2 content. However, economic viability of upgrading <b>lean</b> <b>ore</b> to synthetic rutile is largely dependent on commercial utilization of large quantities of iron oxide produced as the by product...|$|E
40|$|We used {{conventional}} {{methods to}} investigate the mechanism by which Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonizes a solid surface by assessing pili-mediated sliding, twitching motility, and adherence. A. ferrooxidans slided to form circular oxidized zones around each colony.

The results of reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that the putative major pili gene of A. ferrooxidans strains ATCC 19859, ATCC 23270, and BY 3 genes were transcribed.

40|$|Commercial level {{operation}} of uranium leaching from the ores {{is carried out}} as a continuous process because of techno-economical benefits. Batch kinetic data of uranium leaching from a <b>lean</b> <b>ore,</b> is scaled to multiple continuous stirred tank reactors using the Residence Time Distribution (RTD) model. A graphical approach reported earlier was improved for better predictions of the observed experimental results. Batch data was obtained from a laboratory scale reactor. The scaling is used to predict the temperature rise in a continuous reactor, which happens mostly due to conversion of pyrites present in the ore. The scaling obtained with the modified model is compared with measurements of uranium conversions and reactor temperatures in a pilot scale continuous reactor having three stirred tanks in series. A good comparison is obtained for several different operating conditions of the pilot and commercial scale reactors. Hence, RTD is a good tool for scale-up and design of commercial scale leaching of uranium from lean ores. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of extracting metallic {{values in the}} form of chlorides from low grade multimetallic <b>lean</b> <b>ores</b> using SO 2, O 2 and NaCl as reactants is analysed from a thermodynamic point of view. Gangue materials such as silica and alumina do not react. The oxides of most other metals react to form chlorides. The volatile chlorides can be condensed. The chlorides present in the condensed state can be leached. An efficient separation of the metallic values from the gangue is possible using a combined sulphation-chlorination roasting process. Use of sodium chloride as a chlorination agent is attractive because of its non-toxic nature...|$|R

40|$|XRD, {{and optical}} and {{electron}} microscopy. Itakpe iron ore is hematite-rich, t is mineral being intergrown with magnetite, and silica {{is the major}} impurity. Agbaja ore is an acidic o 61 ite ore consisting of goethite and magnetite, with alumina, silica and phosphorus as major impurities. Itakpe is typical of a rich ore formed by magmatic segregation whilst Agbaja is a <b>lean</b> <b>ore</b> of sedimentary origin. Isothermal mass-change measurements in hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the range 800 - 1100 ~ show Agbaja to be less reducible than Itakpe; in particular, Agbaja is very irreducible at 1100 ~ because of sintering of the ore. Characterization and reducibility experiments were also carried out on Corby (Northamptonshire, UK) iron ore for comparison. Until recently, Nigeria has had no significant iron and steel industry. The total steel consumption in 1968 was estimated as 5. 5 kg/caput, compared with 650 kg/caput for industrialized nations and a world average of 150 kg/caput (Robson, 1968). This steel was obtained either by very small-scale internal manufacture or by large-scale importation. Iron ore reserves in Nigeria have been estimated at 11 000 million tonnes (Anon, 1963) and plans {{have been made to}} use these indigenous ores. The present study was designed to characterize two quite different major deposits from Itakpe and Agbaja and to assess thei...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{magnetic}} separation {{for a certain}} magnetite mine with ultrafine disseminated <b>lean</b> <b>ores</b> has resulted in low performance, as the fine sizes and aggregation of ground mineral particles have caused inefficient recovery of the ultrafine minerals. In this study, we attempt to increase the apparent sizes of target mineral particles, and improve the separation indices, by using a multi-stage grinding-dispersion-selective flocculation-weak {{magnetic separation}} process. The results showed that under the conditions of 500 g/t sodium hexametaphospate (SHMP) as dispersant, 750 g/t carboxymethyl starch (CMS) as flocculant, agitating at 400 rpm for 10 min, with slurry pH 11, and final grinding fineness of 93. 5 % less than 0. 03 mm, the obtained concentrate contained 62. 82 % iron, with recovery of 79. 12 % after multi-stage magnetic separation. Compared to simple magnetic separation, the concentrate’s iron grade increased by 1. 26 %, and a recovery rate by 5. 08 %. Fundamental analysis indicated that, in a dispersed state of dispersion, magnetite particles had weaker negative surface charges than quartz, allowing the adsorption of negative CMS ions via hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the aggregate size of the initial concentrate increased from 24. 30 to 38. 37 μm, accomplishing the goal of selective flocculation, and increasing the indices of separation...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} toward resource efficient, low-carbon closed-loop economies is {{an urgent}} necessity as our world is facing unstable but rising fossil energy prices, resource shortages, and unprecedented environmental challenges. In the E. U. {{in particular the}} prospect of insufficient and often critical raw materials (metals and minerals) will hamper further economic development. For example, the attempts to increase the share of wind energy, solar power, and electric transportation will face a shortage of critical metals {{for the production of}} batteries, PV-panels, and strong magnets. New technologies are required to better separate metals and minerals from <b>leaner</b> <b>ores</b> and secondary materials. The advanced treatment of secondary raw materials is part of Belgium’s strength in recycling and contributes to the vision of closed loop processes.

40|$|Abstract. Studying on {{difficulty}} of copper oxide`s flotation, the activation of new pharmaceutical KLY refractory copper oxide ore achieves better test results {{than the other}} activator. The final recovery rate of copper ore is 83. 99 % and the copper grade of concentrate is 22. 87 %. Through the mechanism of the test shows that the improved ethylene phosphate {{plays a major role}} for the activation, which not only has strong chelation, good activation effect but also reduces the amount of sodium sulfide; moreover, it develops good test indicators. China's copper resources ranked 7 in the world, which reserves small scattered and per capita share. According to statistics, currently there are 920 copper deposits proved in China, and the proven deposits are nearly 72 million tons, the recoverable deposits are 19 million tons, the basic reserves are 30 million tons. Among them, the average grade of copper is only about 0. 8 %, of which the grade greater than 1 % is only 1 / 5. China's copper resources have the following characteristics: large and giant mines are less than small and medium-sized ones; <b>lean</b> <b>ores</b> are less than rich ones; easily exploited and selected ores are less than refractory and difficult exploited ones; the types of deposits have significant differences with more symbiotic and associated ores but less pure ores; the types of ores are complex and the development conditions are poor...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) {{tests were conducted}} in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reactor to investigate the potential of a Chinese sulfur-containing <b>lean</b> iron <b>ore</b> as the oxygen carrier. Two main products of solidfuel pyrolysis and gasification, namely, CH 4 and CO, were selected as the reducing gases. Consecutive reduction−oxidation cycles were first {{carried out in the}} TGA reactor to evaluate the cyclic stability and agglomeration tendency of the oxygen carrier. The effects of the temperature, fuel gas concentration, and reaction gas composition on the reduction reaction were further investigated. Increasing the reaction temperature or fuel gas concentration enhanced the reduction rate and reaction degree of the oxygen carrier. Meanwhile, CO showed much higher reduction reactivity than CH 4. A comparison of the rate index of the iron ore used with those of high-grade minerals indicated that the iron ore had adequate reactivity for its application in solid-fuel CLC technology. The side reaction of carbon deposition was also discussed. Finally, the shrinking-core model with chemical reaction control was adopted to determine the chemical kinetics...|$|R

Since phosphorous is widely acknowledged as steel pollutant and disturbs the blast furnace chemistry, so {{it needs to}} be removed effectively from the ore before the smelting operation. Present paper, therefore, aims to provide the results of phosphorous leaching efficiency noted with HCl, HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 reagents. Results showed that H 2 SO 4 leached the phosphorous quite selectively as compared to HCl and HNO 3.

This paper Summarizes laboratory experimentation of chlorination processes developed for the extraction of tantalum and niobium from their bearing materials, the upgrading of chromite, the treatment of sulfide concentrates, and the decontamination of jarosite, {{as well as for}} the synthesis of potassium ferrate. Each investigation started by a thermodynamic study of different systems (M-O-Cl, M-S-Cl, M = metal) including the calculations of the standard free energy of chlorination reactions and phase stability diagrams of these systems. The kinetics of these chlorination reactions was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of total gas flow rate, temperature, individual reactant partial pressures, etc., on the chlorination reaction rate were investigated. Besides, experiments were also conducted in tubular furnaces. Several different qualitative and quantitative analyses methods were used to evaluate the selectivity and performance of the chlorination processes.
