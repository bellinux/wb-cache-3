In particular, the imperfect channel state information (CSI) and power splitting information receiver (IR) {{are taken into}} account. We model the design as an optimization problem which maximizes the minimum harvested energy among the multi-antenna energy receivers (ERs). Besides, both the secure communication requirement and the <b>lowest</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> storage threshold at IR must be guaranteed in our formulated optimization problem.

Moreover, a suboptimal beamforming design scheme is proposed with low computational complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed robust schemes are more efficient than other schemes in terms of energy harvesting and transmit power saving.|$|R

One of its often stated advantages is the low flux sensitivity toward {{concentration of the}} processed fluid, in contrast to reverse osmosis. In the present paper, we looked at 2 high-solids applications of the dairy industry: skim milk and whey. Performance was assessed under various hydrodynamic conditions to investigate the feasibility of fouling mitigation by changing the operating parameters and to compare performance to widespread membrane filtration processes. Whereas filtration processes are hydraulic pressure driven, membrane distillation uses vapor pressure from heat to drive separation and, therefore, operating parameters have a different bearing on the process. Experimental and calculated results identified factors influencing heat and mass transfer under various operating conditions using polytetrafluoroethylene flat-sheet membranes. Linear velocity was found to influence performance during skim milk processing but not during whey processing. Lower feed and higher permeate temperature was found to reduce fouling in the processing of both dairy solutions. Concentration of skim milk and whey by membrane distillation has potential, as it showed high rejection (> 99 %) of all dairy components and can operate using <b>low</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> and pressures (< 10 kPa).

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study solid fuel produced from biomass by cold extrusion technique. The raw materials used comprised crushed coconut shell char and coconut fiber char mixed with two kinds of binders produced from treated rice straw and molasses. In order to investigate {{the effects of the}} amounts of binder used on the physical properties of the solid fuel produced, the mass ratio of molasses was varied, at 10 : 100, 15 : 100, and 20 : 100, whereas that of the treated rice straw was 15 : 100, 20 : 100, and 25 : 100. In addition, the effects of mixing the ratios of crushed coconut shell char and coconut fiber char were studied by varying their ratios in the mixture (shell: fiber), at 40 : 60, 50 : 50, 60 : 40 and 70 : 30. The results showed that when molasses were used as a binder, increasing both the amount of molasses and coconut shell enhanced the compressive strength of the solid fuel produced. When treated rice straw binder was used, compressive strength also increased with the increasing of coconut shell ratios in the raw material mixture, but decreased with increases in the binder ratio.

40|$|Sulfide is {{commonly}} present in domestic and industrial wastewater. As it is toxic, corrosive and odorous, it often {{needs to be}} removed prior to discharge to sewer or in the sewer system itself, and certainly before discharging into the environment. The scope of this thesis was to develop and demonstrate a novel, low energy electrochemical technique for the removal and recovery of sulfide from wastewater. In addition, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of inorganic sulfur species on organics oxidation in bioelectrochemical systems. The results demonstrate that sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur can generate net electrical power in an electrochemical system. However, while the process effectively removed the sulfide from the wastewater, the elemental sulfur was deposited on the electrodes and deactivated them over time. Sulfide removal rate decreased from its initial value 80 ± 2 % to 62 ± 4 % after 8 days of operation when a lab scale reactor operated continuously in fuel cell mode (external resistance 10 Ω) with a loading rate of 0. 43 ± 0. 04 kg-S m- 3 d- 1 of total anodic compartment (TAC). The removal rate was constant for the following 50 days of operation and significantly decreased to about 10 % after 90 days. On average, the power production was 5 ± 1 W m- 3 TAC with the coulombic efficiency of 88 ± 5 % but the maximum power production capacity of the reactor was 78 W m- 3 TAC using potassium ferricyanide cathode. However, the deposited sulfur could be effectively removed and recovered as a concentrated sulfide/polysulfide solution by reversing the polarity of the electrode with <b>low</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> input. The results also demonstrate that microbial consortia that developed due to the organic electron donors in the wastewater, negatively affected {{the performance of the}} sulfide removal process. The microorganisms were using the electrodeposited sulfur as a preferred electron acceptor over soluble sulfate and the electrode. This process was converting sulfur back to sulfide irrespective of the electrochemical conditions. In batch systems, the sulfide produced in this way could be re-oxidized at the anode and therefore the obtained coulombic efficiency was 97 ± 2 % for acetate oxidation. However, in continuous systems, depending on the operational conditions and wastewater characteristics, the sulfide could leave the system in the effluent. By applying cell polarity reversals at a sufficiently high frequency, it was possible to avoid biofilm formation and hence the re-generation of sulfide from the deposited sulfur. To confirm the effectiveness of the electrochemical sulfide removal in real wastewater, the process was demonstrated on the effluent of an anaerobic digester of a paper mill. Sulfide was removed from 44 ± 7 to 8 ± 2 mg-S L- 1 at a removal rate of 0. 845 ± 0. 133 kg-S m- 3 TAC d- 1 and a recovery rate of 75 ± 4 % with the voltage input of 0. 52 to 1. 3 V. Periodic switching in every 24 hours intervals between anode and cathode was an effective technique to maintain a good sulfide removal performance and avoid unwanted biofilm formation at the anode. Sulfide present in the wastewater could therefore be effectively removed from the liquid phase and harvested as elemental sulfur deposit on the electrode...|$|E
40|$|Electroactive {{polymers}} (EAPs), {{also called}} ‘artificial muscles’, offer a significant potential to articulate soft robotic devices, especially bio-inspired robotic devices, {{due to their}} remarkable properties of compliance, <b>low</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> consumption, suitability for miniaturization, biocompatibility, ability to operate in aqueous environments {{as well as in}} air, and high force output to weight ratio. The EAPs are such special materials that they can be tailored to serve as both sensors and actuators. The EAPs as actuators can be employed as either a soft robotic actuator or a soft robotic manipulator especially in the micro domain for cutting edge applications such as micro manipulation systems, medical devices with higher dexterity, soft catheters with built-in actuation, bio-inspired robotics with better mimicking properties and active compliant mechanisms. To realise these applications, there is an increasing need for enhanced modelling methodologies. The subject of this thesis is, therefore, to establish effective modelling and system identification methodologies to predict the time-varying behaviour of the smart actuators typified by polypyrrole (PPy) trilayer laminated actuators, (i. e. ionic type EAP actuators), and to apply these methodologies to predict the behaviour of new planar and spatial mechanisms articulated with these actuators. This thesis systematically develops a whole structure bending behaviour estimation model based on the differential geometry: the backbone curve approach, which is called the ‘soft robotic model’ of the EAP actuator. Before developing a 3 - dimensional (3 D) soft robotic kinematic model of the EAP actuator, 2 -dimensional (2 D) kinematic and dynamic soft robotic models have been derived. 2 D soft robotic kinematic and dynamic models have been validated experimentally for a range of electrical stimuli (0. 0 − 1. 0 V). Following that, image and video processing algorithms are employed to obtain the tip position data of the PPy-EAP actuator, which are used to estimate the entire bending shape or kinematic configuration of the PPy-EAP actuators as a function of time for a given electrical input. System identification techniques are also employed to identify the dynamic parameters of the PPy-EAP actuator’s soft robotic electromechanical model. A non-linear optimisation method has been proposed to solve the inverse kinematic model in order to estimate the highly non-linear bending behaviour of the PPy-EAP actuator, which is not possible to accurately estimate using the methods proposed in the literature for inverse kinematics. An adaptive boundary-constraint approach has been introduced to the optimisation algorithm {{to make sure that the}} estimated configurations match well with the real configurations of the EAP actuators under any applicable electrical input. The PPy-EAP actuators have also been designed and fabricated to form a lamina emergent compliant mechanism with built-in actuation, which generates a motion emerging out of the PPy-EAP actuator’s planar configuration (i. e. laminated). This mechanism with a conical helix topology can find a place in numerous applications such as micro-swimmers with a helix propeller inspired by bacteria swimming, micro-mixers, controllable stages, auto focusing mechanisms and micro soft robotic manipulation systems. The soft robotic kinematic modelling methodology has been applied to estimate the twining motion of this lamina emergent compliant mechanism with different spiral sizes. Further, inspired by Rapson’s slide mechanism, a continuously stable compliant mechanism based on the bending and sliding principle of the PPy-EAP actuators has been established so that the PPy-EAP actuators’ bending motion is converted into a linear motion The modelling methodology has been further validated by successfully estimating the displacement, velocity and acceleration of this mechanism. The experimental and numerical simulation results suggest that the soft robotic kinematic and dynamic modelling methodology based on the backbone curve approach is very effective in estimating the PPy-EAP actuators’ highly non-linear bending behaviour and dynamic behaviour, and in estimating the mechanism’s output articulated with the PPy-EAP actuators. The proposed methodology can easily be extended to other bending type actuators and smart structures. This study has improved our understanding of the ionic bending type EAP actuators in order to widen their application to new soft robotic applications...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors when low energy houses are built is to have good heat recovery on the ventilation system. However, standard ventilation units use a considerable amount of electricity. This article discusses the consequences on a system level of using hybrid ventilation with heat recovery. The simulation program TRNSYS was used in order to investigate a ventilation system with heat recovery. The system also includes a ground source storage and waste water heat recovery system. The result of the analysis shows that the annual energy gain from ground source storage is limited. However, this is partly a consequence {{of the fact that the}} well functioning hybrid ventilation system leaves little room for improvements. The analysis shows that the hybrid ventilation system has potential to be an attractive solution for low energy buildings with a very <b>low</b> need for <b>electrical</b> <b>energy...</b>|$|R
50|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) {{is a technique}} that uses <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>electrical</b> pulses to artificially generate body movements in individuals who have been paralyzed due to injury to the central nervous system. More specifically, FES {{can be used to}} generate muscle contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), head injury, stroke and other neurological disorders. In other words, a consumer would use the device each time he/she wanted to generate a desired function. FES is sometimes also referred to as neuromuscular {{electrical stimulation}} ^(NMES).|$|R
40|$|The global air {{temperature}} {{has increased by}} 0. 74 ± 0. 18 °C since 1905 and scientists have shown that CO 2 accounts for 55 percentages of the greenhouse gases. Global atmospheric CO 2 has been sharply increased since 1751, however the trend has slowed down in last fifty years in the Western Europe. UK and EU countries have singed the Kyoto agreement to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a collective average of 12. 5 % below their 1990 levels by 2020. In the EU, 40 % of CO 2 emission comes from the residential energy consumption, in which the HVAC system accounts for 50 %, lighting accounts for 15 % and appliances 10 %. Hence, reducing the fossil-fuel consumption in residential energy by utilizing renewable energy is an effective method to achieve the Kyoto target. However, in the UK renewable energy only accounts for 2 % of the total energy consumption in 2005. A novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system {{is driven by the}} solar collector and cooling tower to achieve low energy cooling with low CO 2 emission. This system is novel in the following ways: • Uses cheap fibre materials as the air-to-air heat exchanger, dehumidifier and regenerator core • Heat/mass fibre exchanger saves both sensible and latent heat from the exhaust air • The dehumidifier core with hexagonal surface could be integrated with windcowls/catchers draught • Utilises <b>low</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> and therefore low CO 2 is released to the environment The cooling system consists of three main parts: heat/mass transfer exchanger, desiccant dehumidifier and regenerator. The fibre exchanger, dehumidifier and regenerator cores are the key parts of the technology. Owing to its proper pore size and porosity, fibre is selected out as the exchanger membrane to execute the heat/mass transfer process. Although the fibre is soft and difficult to keep the shape for long term running, its low price makes its frequent replacement feasible, which can counteract its disadvantages. A counter-flow air-to-air heat /mass exchanger was investigated and simulation and experimental results indicated that the fibre membranes soaked by desiccant solution showed the best heat and mass recovery effectiveness at about 89. 59 % and 78. 09 %, respectively. LiCl solution was selected as the working fluid in the dehumidifier and regenerator due to its advisable absorption capacity and low regeneration temperature. Numerical simulations and experimental testing were carried out to work out the optimal dehumidifier/regenerator structure, size and running conditions. Furthermore, the simulation results proved that the cooling tower was capable to service the required low temperature cooling water and the solar collector had the ability to offer the heating energy no lower than the regeneration temperature 60 ℃. The coefficient-of-performance of this novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system is proved to be as high as 13. 0, with a cooling capacity of 5. 6 kW when the system is powered by renewable energy. This case is under the pre-set conditions that the environment {{air temperature}} is 36 ℃ and relative humidity is 50 % (cities such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Spain and Thailand, etc). Hence, this system is very useful for a hot/humid climate with plenty of solar energy. The theoretical modelling consisted of four numerical models is proved by experiments to predict the performance of the system within acceptable errors. Economic analysis based on a case (200 m 2 working office in London) indicated that the novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system could save 5134 kWh energy as well as prevent 3123 kg CO 2 emission per year compared to the traditional HVAC system. Due to the flexible nature of the fibre, the capital and maintenance cost of the novel cooling system is higher than the traditional HVAC system, but its running cost are much lower than the latter. Hence, the novel heat recovery/desiccant cooling system is cost effective and environment friendly technology. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} {{experimental}} {{results of a}} photovoltaic system (PV) provided with two analog and digital MPPT commands. The disadvantage of these commands {{is that they are}} suffering from divergence problems caused by a sudden change in weather conditions (light, temperature,) or load variations. Therefore, we developed a CDCS circuit for the analog MPPT command to optimize the reliability of PV system independently of weather conditions changes or load variations. The functioning of the PV system during whole days shows a very good agreement between the experiment and the optimal simulation of the electric properties of the PV panel (voltage, current and power). The <b>low</b> losses of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> produced by the PV panel (lower than 5 %) and the smooth functioning of the DC/DC converter used (efficiency upper to 80 %) reveal the good functioning and reliability of the systems using both types of MPPT commands conceived and realized during this work...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{interconnection}} of crystalline silicon {{solar cells}} within a photovoltaic module must reach very <b>low</b> levels of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> dissipation {{in conjunction with}} long-term stability. To meet those demands usually connectors are soldered to screen printed pads on solar cells. This technology requires a solderable electrically conducting grid as well as thermal and mechanical robustness of the cell. Especially thin solar cells could be damaged using the soldering technology. Therefore we investigate the adhesive technology for substitution of the conventional solder process. Commonly available adhesives are tested and evaluated. For the most suitable adhesive the process parameters are optimised with regard to curing temperature, curing time and pressure. The settled process parameters are used for contacting and laminating solar cells. For determination of electrical and mechanical properties resistivity measurements and peeling tests are carried out. The long-term behaviour of the adhesive joints is analysed due to temperature cycling.

40|$|We study {{low energy}} {{collective}} modes and transport {{properties of the}} "helical metal" {{on the surface of}} a topological insulator. At <b>low</b> <b>energies,</b> <b>electrical</b> transport and spin dynamics at the surface are exactly related by an operator identity equating the electric current to the in-plane components of the spin degrees of freedom. From this relation it follows that an undamped spin wave always accompanies the sound mode in the helical metal [...] thus it is possible to `hear' the sound of spins. In the presence of long range Coulomb interactions, the surface plasmon mode is also coupled to the spin wave, giving rise to a hybridized "spin-plasmon" mode. We make quantitative predictions for the spin-plasmon in Bi_ 2 Se_ 3, and discuss its detection in a spin-grating experiment. Comment: 4 Pages, 2 Figure...|$|R
