40|$|AbstractThis {{investigation}} aims {{to determine}} the participation ratio of cement matrix and latex network in <b>latex</b> <b>cement</b> co-matrix strength. The first stage {{of this study was}} carried out to investigate the effect of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) on cement matrix participation ratio by measuring degree of hydration and compressive strength. The second stage in this study shows an attempt to evaluate the latex participation ratio in mortar and concrete strength with different latex chemical bases. Effect of latex particle size on latex network strength was studied. The test results indicated that the latex participation ratio in co-matrix strength is influenced by type of cement matrix, type of curing, latex type, latex solid/water ratio, strength type and age. For modified concrete, when the SBR solid/water ratio increases the latex participation ratio in flexural and pull out bond strength increases. The latex participation ratio in co-matrix strength decreases as latex particle size increases...|$|E

The modification mechanism of the latex and fiber on the concrete was also studied by the methods including X-ray test, chemically combined water, heat of hydration, water loss, and scanning electron microscope. Results indicated that the concrete modified by latex and polyester fiber has flexural strength, fracture toughness, and fracture energy of 44. 4 %, 397. 0 %, and 462. 8 % higher than the reference normal concrete, the polymer retarded the hydration process and reduced the hydration degree of cement at early age, while the hydration degree is promoted by the polymer film for its excellent water resistance after 28 [*]d, and the bond between the fiber and cement paste is improved by the latex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{correlation}} between the ratio of styrene-acrylic <b>latex</b> to sulphoaluminate <b>cement</b> and the resistance of <b>latex</b> modified sulphoaluminate <b>cement</b> mortar to hydrochloric acid corrosion was investigated. The weight change rate, compressive strength, and flexural strength of various <b>latex</b> modified <b>cement</b> mortar in the hydrochloric acid solution at different ages were tested and the samples appearance was observed. The {{results show that the}} resistance of <b>latex</b> modified sulphoaluminate <b>cement</b> mortar to hydrochloric acid corrosion is related to the latex/cement ratio. With the increase of the latex/cement ratio, the resistance performance of sulphoaluminate cement mortar to hydrochloric acid corrosion was improved firstly and then decreased. When the polymer/cement ratio was 0. 2, the <b>latex</b> modified <b>cement</b> mortar presented the highest ability in compressive strength, flexural strength, weight change rate, and the appearance, showing its excellent resistance to hydrochloric acid corrosion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to use medium ammonia concentrated latex mixed in mortar for developing the strength and thermal insulation properties. The concentrated <b>latex</b> to <b>cement</b> ratios (P/C) are fixed at 0. 000, 0. 025, 0. 050, 0. 075, 0. 100, 0. 125 and 0. 150 by weight. Cement to sand ratio is maintained at 1 : 2. 75. Water to cement ratio is 0. 50 (not include water content in concentrated latex). The mortar samples are cast for testing the properties followed the ASTM standard. From the results, it is found that the increase of concentrated latex affects in decreasing of density, elongation, compressive strength, bending strength and coefficient of thermal conductivity. For rate of water absorption, it decreases considerably when the concentrated latex is added at small amount but it becomes higher values when adding the concentrated latex reaches at some amount. In the future, this indicates that the use of concentrated latex at some suitable amount can develop the concrete having the properties of waterproof and thermal insulation...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{researches}} {{were performed}} on latex modified concretes and associated properties, however; some vital factors were not given attention in previous works. This study focus on new factor which significantly affects the properties of <b>latex</b> modified <b>cement</b> paste, mortar or concrete. This factor is termed as ‘latex solid/water ratio’ which is defined herein as the ratio of weight of solid latex to weight of total water content of cement composite including the water in latex itself. The effect of this factor on some properties of cement paste, mortar and concrete were experimentally evaluated. Properties of cement paste include the produced calcium hydroxide and ettringite content during hydration process, while those of cement mortar take account of absorption and effect of temperature on compressive strength. Furthermore, {{the effect of this}} factor on the compressive and flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity, water penetration depth and drying shrinkage of concrete were explored. Based on experimental evidences, and spite of using different cement contents, sources of latex, water–cement ratios and slump values, it can be generally concluded that the latex solid/water ratio is a dominant factor affecting different properties of latex modified mortars and concrete...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} physicomechanical {{properties}} of mortar containing high volume of fly ash (FA) as partial replacement of cement in presence of copolymer <b>latexes.</b> Portland <b>cement</b> (PC) was partially replaced with 0, 10, 20, 30 50, and 60 % FA. Copolymer latexes were used based on 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate (2 -HEA) and 2 -hydroxymethylacrylate (2 -HEMA). Testing included workability, setting time, absorption, chemically combined water content, compressive strength, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The addition of FA to mortar as replacement of PC affected the physicomechanical properties of mortar. As the content of FA in the concrete increased, the setting times (initial and final) were elongated. The results obtained at 28 days of curing indicate that the maximum properties of mortar occur at around 30 % FA. Beyond 30 % FA the properties of mortar reduce and at 60 % FA the properties of mortar are {{lower than those of}} the reference mortar without FA. However, the addition of polymer latexes into mortar containing FA improved most of the physicomechanical properties of mortar at all curing times. Compressive strength, combined water, and workability of mortar containing FA premixed with latexes are higher than those of mortar containing FA without latexes...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthetic}} sports {{surface is}} a rnulti-layer structure {{which has become}} very popular as a substitute tor natural grass. This research project was meant to study the feasibility of developing a natural rubber base top covering for an athletic track for Sri Lanka's tropical environment. Here, the scrap rubber crumbs were used as the aggregate which is bound by natural rubber <b>latex</b> and <b>cement.</b> The latter was used to help in drying the surface quickly and also to impart greater hardness. Two types of rubber crumbs, namely tyre crumbs and microqilular crumbs with two types - of latex recipes were used to prepare the samples. One latex formulation is about 60 per cent cheaper than the other. Together with the above variation the main emphasis {{was to determine the}} most suitable type of crumb and its particle size range which resulted in a surface having properties comparable with those of reference samples meant to be used as athletic tracks. The standard tests to evaluate the track performance are stipulated in DIN 18035 Part 6. However, these tests demand a set of specialized apparatus. These were not available and were not possible to turn out locally within the time frame of the project. Thus an attempt was made to compare the results 0 f the test samples with those of the reference samples by carrying out a set of short term standard tests commonly available. These short term tests showed that the proposed formulations give comparable results with the selected reference samples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Waste rubber is an {{environmental}} concern. The large global market of concrete products could usefully consume this waste, {{even if the}} fractions used were very low, provided such concrete mix had sufficient strength and other characteristics. Therefore, the properties of concrete mixes that include natural rubber were studied at 28 days of age, which is a standard time to characterize hardened concrete properties. We included two types of natural rubber in this study, namely natural rubber latex (NRL) and discarded rubber glove. First, 60 % concentrate latex (HA: high ammonia) was used in <b>latex</b> per <b>cement</b> ratio 0. 10 by volume. Second, discarded rubber gloves, passed through a # 6 sieve with 3. 36 mm size, were used to investigate effects of soft rubber particles, on strength and insulation properties of lightweight concrete. The hybrid rubberized concrete mixes had 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 40 % partial substitution of sand by volume, at water-cement ratio of 0. 45 by volume. Density, compressive strength, flexural strength, insulation property, and {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} were measured. A small 10 % fraction of rubber particles improved flexural strength. However, compressive strength decreased with the amount of rubber in concrete. The thermal conductivity was slightly lower than that of normal concrete. Natural rubber addition can produce a moderately lightweight concrete, with good thermal insulation, and the inclusion of rubber glove waste in concrete aggregate appears feasible. Applications could also include non-primary structural uses with medium to low strength requirements, benefiting from other features of concrete. The results suggest that waste rubber can be used to create value-added concrete composites with sufficient structural strength, and improved thermal insulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the FY 1997 barrier material work at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory are to (1) select a waste barrier material and verify that it {{is compatible with the}} Buried Waste Containment System Process, and (2) determine if, and how, the Buried Waste Containment System emplacement process affects the material properties and performance (on proof of principle scale). This test plan describes a set of measurements and procedures used to validate a waste barrier material for the Buried Waste Containment System. A <b>latex</b> modified proprietary <b>cement</b> manufactured by CTS Cement Manufacturing Company will be tested. Emplacement properties required for the Buried Waste Containment System process are: slump between 8 and 10 in., set time between 15 and 30 minutes, compressive strength at set of 20 psi minimum, and set temperature less than 100 {degrees}C. Durability properties include resistance to degradation from carbonate, sulfate, and waste-site soil leachates. A set of baseline barrier material properties will be determined to provide a data base for comparison with the barrier materials when tested in the field. The measurements include permeability, petrographic analysis to determine separation and/or segregation of mix components, and a set of mechanical properties. The measurements will be repeated on specimens from the field test material. The data will be used to determine if the Buried Waste Containment System equipment changes the material. The emplacement properties will be determined using standard laboratory procedures and instruments. Durability of the barrier material will be evaluated by determining the effect of carbonate, sulfate, and waste-site soil leachates on the compressive strength of the barrier material. The baseline properties will be determined using standard ASTM procedures. 9 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs...|$|R
