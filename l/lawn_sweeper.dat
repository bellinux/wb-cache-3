50|$|The story {{began in}} 1975 {{with the idea}} of {{developing}} a new and improved <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper.</b> Soon, Agri-Fab® went on to redesign and manufacture a product that outperformed any <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper</b> on the market. The result attracted the attention of a major retailer and, ultimately, catapulted Agri-Fab into the position of an industry leader of lawn and garden attachments.|$|E
50|$|Not {{everything}} the company produced {{was to be}} attached to a tractor. Agri-Fab was also producing environmentally friendly products that relied on muscle power. In addition to standard wheelbarrows, its precision-balanced poly wheelbarrow allowed the user to haul several times his or her weight. Its silent push reel mower, with blades that were precision ground {{to the point where}} the blade and the cutter bar did not touch, was the best in the business.Even as Agri-Fab added new products, the <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper</b> continued to be the mainstay of the product line. Gradually, Agri-Fab became the dominant source in the <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper</b> business.|$|E
50|$|Agri-Fab {{expanded}} its manufacturing facilities {{to meet its}} customers’ potential needs, {{with the addition of}} a 12,500-square-foot building. The building was finished early in 1987, just in time for the lawn and garden season. The expansion proved necessary. Orders for the new <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper</b> were heavy, and overall company sales doubled.|$|E
50|$|Push <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers,</b> which {{resemble}} a simple wheeled manual lawn mower, are maneuvered and powered by hand. A forward pushing action transfers {{power from the}} wheels to the brush mechanism via a gearing system, causing it to rotate, and the debris is picked up and transferred to a bag or hopper mounted on the machine. Powered <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers</b> resemble push <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers,</b> but the brush mechanism {{is powered by a}} gasoline or electric motor. Tow <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers</b> are towed behind a vehicle, such as a garden tractor or ATV and are designed for use in larger areas. They are generally wider and have greater hopper capacities than push and powered <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper,</b> {{also known}} as a leaf sweeper, is a garden tool for the {{mechanical}} removal of debris, such as fallen leaves, pine needles, twigs, grass clippings or litter, from a lawn or paved area. Lawn sweepers operate via a rotating brush mechanism that sweeps up the debris and deposits it in a collection hopper for disposal.|$|E
50|$|Thatch is a {{build-up}} {{of organic}} matter which can include dead grass, leaves, stems, stolons, rhizomes and overcrowded grass roots and lateral weed growth. Thatch can stifle the growth and health of grass or turf. Removing the thatch helps the grass by encouraging it to thicken up and also makes it stronger and less susceptible to disease. Reducing thatch levels increases the levels of water, air and nutrients that can get through to the root zone of the grass plants. Significant thatch problems in lawns can cause diseases and can encourage moss {{to grow in the}} areas where grass has died. A by-product of scarifying or de-thatching is that moss is also removed, and depending on how deep the scarifying blades are set, root cutting can also occur, and this in turn helps grass to thicken up over time. Scarifying is normally carried out in autumn or spring. When scarifying or de-thatching, not all thatch should be removed as a small amount of thatch is beneficial to the lawn. A lawn that has excessive thatch may feel spongy when trod upon. After removing thatch, it can be swept or raked up using a <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper.</b>|$|E
5000|$|By 1955 a second, larger {{model was}} added to the Eshelman line, a basic six-horsepower open car for two {{passengers}} also named the [...] "Adult Sport Car". These ASCs were 64 in long, 36 in wide and 32 in in height and were powered by an air-cooled rope-started Briggs & Stratton #14 engine (electric starting was optional) that permitted a top speed of 30 mi/h km/h and a 70 mpg fuel consumption rate. Major ASC mechanical differences included 4.50x6 pneumatic tires with four-wheel cable-operated scrub brakes, a foot throttle, and a pedal-operated parking brake. Extra-cost options included a <b>lawn</b> <b>sweeper</b> ($39.95) and a hauling cart ($79.95). The Adult Sport Car was 40inches wide and was equipped with headlamps and taillamps powered by a separate battery that needed occasional charging, as there was no generator. The following year saw a minor restyling on both models including an opening hood, cut-down sides for easier entry and exit, and fully opened rear wheel wells. A utility version of this car was offered for use on golf courses (and advertised as providing [...] "36 holes per gallon"). Also from 1956 the smaller models were powered by Briggs and Stratton aluminum-block engines; the Model 6B engine of 2.25 horsepower in the standard series and the Model 8B engine of 2.75 horsepower in the deluxe cars.|$|E
50|$|Agri-Fab's main products, <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers,</b> use {{rotating}} brushes {{to collect}} debris such as grass clippings, leaves, pine needles, twigs, and other debris {{and they are}} placed into a collection/hopper bag. When the bag fills, it can be emptied onto a compost pile or bagged for disposal. Agri-Fab's produces both tow and push <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers.</b> Carts have also almost always been a major product of Agri-Fab as it produces both steel and poly carts, {{some of which are}} ATV/UTV compatible.|$|R
50|$|AF’s {{business}} model included {{the development of}} a complete product line, ranging from <b>lawn</b> carts, <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers</b> and aerators to fertilizer sprayers, spreaders and snowblades.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lawn</b> <b>sweepers</b> are an {{alternative}} to raking {{or the use of}} leaf blowers and garden vacuums. They are also {{an alternative}} to lawn mower baggers or grass baggers which are generally more expensive and have a smaller capacity.|$|R
50|$|Its line of groomers {{consists}} of spike aerators, plug aerators, and dethatchers. Aerators {{are used to}} loosen compacted soil and allow nutrients to be better absorbed into the soil. They also help the roots of grass to grow deeper and turf to become thicker. As far as dethatchers goes, Agri-Fab produces a variety including one that attaches to most <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers.</b> Dethatchers are used to remove thatch, which is a layer of accumulating/slowly decomposing grass clippings, roots, grass stems, and debris that settle on the ground over time.|$|R
5000|$|Elec-trak branded {{attachments}} included electric trimmers, edgers, chainsaws, radios, arc welders, fork lifts, front-end loaders, rotary brooms, roller aerators, lawn rollers, dump carts, large vacuums, agricultural sprayers, moldboard plows, {{row crop}} cultivators, tillers, disk harrows, sickle bar mowers, belly mowers, front-mounted rotary mowers, front or rear-mounted ganged reel mowers, <b>lawn</b> <b>sweepers,</b> electric rakes, snowblowers, snowplows, golf bag holders, double seats, 120vac rotary inverters, canopy tops, and more. [...] Most of these attachments were {{connected by a}} 36VDC [...] "power take off" [...] using a NEMA 10-50 outlet, usually used in the U.S. for 240VAC clothes dryers and thus compatible with readily available cords {{in most of the}} USA.|$|R
5000|$|Chaplin {{came across}} a {{traction}} driven <b>lawn</b> and leaf <b>sweeper,</b> and realized that if made larger it would offer a solution for sweeping non-ferrous debris. He invented the Fodbuster RockSweeper in 1987. A towable, traction driven sweeper with brush drive mechanism geared to its wheels, the Fodbuster was brought to market to serve military and civilian airfields. [...] Soon after the RockSweeper introduction, the company embarked on an expansion of their product offerings to meet the growing requirements of the aviation industry. New lines were added, including walk-behind vacuum sweepers, small parts organizers, debris deposal containers, and promotional and awareness training materials such as posters, decals and downloadable PowerPoint training presentations. [...] In 2004 Chaplin published [...] "MAKE IT FOD FREE, The Ultimate FOD Prevention Program Manual”. Following the MAKE IT FOD FREE book” project, FODNews.com was launched as a free online news publication. Specializing in news and information about FOD control methods and FOD related issues, it includes links to news articles, instructional materials, research reports, photos, and videos.|$|R
