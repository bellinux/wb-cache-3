This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should listen to them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E

[...] He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, [...] "I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes."

Nick Minichind of VH1 lauded the song for several pointed comments on empowerment which according to him, [...] "are skillfully weaved into the lyrics, without feeling out of place." [...] He also wrote that [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] restores girls' own subjectivity and that the bridge shows a [...] "practically Cleopatra-channeling Beyoncé." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy described [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] as [...] "yet another female-empowerment revolution that is sure to dominate dancefloors this summer". Robert Copsey, also writing for Digital Spy, awarded the song four stars out of five, complimenting the [...] "earthy beats, hypnotising hooks and militant drums pound relentlessly as Queen B declares it's 'GRLZ who run this mutha' with more woman-friendly conviction than Geri Halliwell at a Spice Girls convention circa 1998." [...] Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] is [...] "as devotedly pro-female as the title would <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> expect", and is as dancefloor-directed as Beyoncé gets, {{in the tradition of}} [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Single Ladies". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote [...] " [...] misses the mark big time here" [...] and called the song [...] "plain daft". He, however, praised the song's bridge and Beyoncé [...] "warm, gooey harmonies". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice disapproved of the song's lack of structure, calling it [...] "a bit overstuffed, but fairly enjoyable". Dallas Observer critic Shahryar Rizvi stated that the track [...] "cribs a bit" [...] from Major Lazer's [...] "Pon de Floor" [...] and M.I.A.'s track [...] "Boyz", but added that Beyoncé being a couple of years late in acquiring this sound was [...] "a problem".|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt {{moves on}} to Godwin's accomplishments as a novelist. For over a century, many critics took {{the best of his}} novels, Caleb Williams, as a kind of {{propaganda}} novel, written to impress the ideas of Political Justice on the minds of the multitude who could not grasp its philosophy; this was what Godwin himself had claimed in the book's preface. But Hazlitt was impressed by its strong literary qualities, and, to a lesser extent, those of St. Leon, exclaiming: [...] "It is not merely that these novels are very well for a philosopher to have produced—they are admirable and complete in themselves, and would not <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> suppose that the author, who is so entirely at home in human character and dramatic situation, had ever dabbled in logic or metaphysics." ...|$|E

[...] He landed {{at the port of}} Soto la Marina on the coast of Nuevo Santander (the modern-day state of Tamaulipas). [...] They were initially greeted enthusiastically, but soon they were arrested by General Felipe de la Garza, the local military commander. Felipe de la Garza was notorious in that he had been the head of a short-lived and unpopular revolt during Iturbide's reign. De la Garza gave up without a fight and was presented to Iturbide, who chose to pardon the general and reinstate him in his old post. The roles, as it happened, had not been reversed. Perhaps it was because of this debt that de la Garza wavered in his resolve to detain Iturbide, at first receiving him warmly, then arresting him and, on the way to his trial, de la Garza gave Iturbide command over the military escort that accompanied them, requesting that Iturbide presented himself to the nearby village of Padilla. Iturbide gave his word of honor and did as was bid, surrendering himself to authorities. The local legislature held a trial and sentenced Iturbide to death. [...] When a local priest administered last rites, Iturbide said, [...] "Mexicans! In the very act of my death, I recommend to you the love to the fatherland, and the observance to our religion, for it shall <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> glory. I die having come here to help you, and I die merrily, for I die amongst you. I die with honor, not as a traitor; I do not leave this stain on my children and my legacy. [...] I am not a traitor, no." [...] He was executed by firing squad on 19 July 1824. [...] Three bullets hit him, one of which delivered the fatal blow.|$|E
