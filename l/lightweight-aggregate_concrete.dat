40|$|In February of 1968 a {{cooperative}} research project by the Iowa State Highway Commission (Project No. HR- 136) and the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa was initiated {{in order to}} determine experimentally the creep and shrinkage characteristics of <b>lightweight-aggregate</b> <b>concrete</b> used in the State of Iowa. This report is concerned with Phase 1 of the Project as described in the Prospectus for the project submitted in November of 1967 : "The State Highway Commission is planning to conduct pilot studies in prestressed-lightweight structures fabricated with materials that are proposed for use in bridge structures in the near future. Thus, Phase will have as its immediate objective, investigating the materials {{to be used in the}} above mentioned pilot studies. ‚Äù (1) The work described in this report was also carried out in conjunction with a second cooperative project: "Time-Dependent Camber and Deflection of Non-Composite and Composite Lightweight-Prestressed Concrete Beams" (Project No. HR- 137) ...|$|E
40|$|Steel fiber {{reinforced}} <b>lightweight-aggregate</b> <b>concrete</b> (SFRLAC) {{has many}} advantages applied in structural engineering. In this paper, the autogenous shrinkage and drying shrinkage of SFRLAC {{for up to}} 270 days were measured, considering the effects of types of coarse and fine aggregates with the changes of water-to-binder ratio and volume fraction of steel fiber, respectively. The properties of mix workability, apparent density, and compressive strength of SFRLAC were also reported and discussed in relation to above factors. Test {{results show that the}} development of autogenous and drying shrinkage of SFRLAC was fast within 28 days and tended to be steady after 90 days. The development of autogenous shrinkage of SFRLAC reduced with the increasing water-to-binder ratio and by using the expanded shale with higher soundness and good water absorption, especially at early age within 28 days; the later drying shrinkage was reduced and the development of drying shrinkage was slowed down with the increasing volume fraction of steel fiber obviously; manufactured sand led to less autogenous shrinkage but greater drying shrinkage than fine lightweight aggregate in SFRLAC. The regularities of autogenous shrinkage and drying shrinkage of SFRLAC expressed as the series of hyperbola are analyzed...|$|E
40|$|One {{research}} {{field in}} Leipzig {{deals with the}} design of high strength <b>lightweight-aggregate</b> <b>concretes</b> (HSLWAC). Due to the huge waveband of this concretes with all possible combinations of lightweight-aggregates and mortar matrix the formulation of general rules is difficult. Therefore both components lightweight-aggregates and mortar matrix will be investigated in detail {{in order to achieve}} {{a deeper understanding of the}} internal stress transfer and the failure mechanisms. Moreover the results of the components tests serve as input data for a computer simulation. This instrument should support the prediction and optimization of the compressive strength of LWAC...|$|R
