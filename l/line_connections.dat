5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel <b>line</b> <b>connections,</b> and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and <b>line</b> <b>connections,</b> both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two <b>line</b> <b>connections,</b> each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between <b>line</b> <b>connections</b> each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
25|$|The Tomlinson coupler was {{developed}} by the Ohio Brass Company for mass transit applications, but eventually found use in some mainline railroad vehicles as well. It consists of two squared metal hooks that engage with each other in a larger rectangular frame with air <b>line</b> <b>connections</b> above and below. Since the coupler's development the manufacturing arm of Ohio Brass was purchased by WABCO which now manufacturers the line along with the N-type. The Tomlinson coupler is the most widely used fully automatic heavy rail coupling in North America having been adopted by the DC Metro, MBTA, PATCO Speedline, SEPTA Broad Street Subway, LA Metro, Baltimore Metro, Miami Metro, MARTA Rail and the New York City Subway for its R44/R46 fleet and all modern classes starting with the R142. For applications outside of rapid transit the coupler had to be significantly enlarged to meet the increased strength requirements first appearing in this capacity on the Budd Metroliner and later on the Illinois Central Highliner fleet. Its relative lack of strength is one reason the N-Type has been more successful in the mainline railroad arena.|$|E

2500|$|When the <b>line</b> <b>connections</b> were {{completed}} Graham Bell heard [...] "...explosive sounds, like {{the discharge of}} artillery.... mixed with a continuous crackling noise of an indescribable character". [...] Bell began to troubleshoot his device and after changing his telephone receiver's electromagnet from low to high resistance, voices suddenly emerged from the receiver [...] "clearly and strongly", on a telegraph line connection of some 106km (66 miles) length. [...] Speaking to his son in Paris from Brantford's Dominion Telegraph office, Professor Alexander Melville Bell sang songs, quoted Shakespeare and read poetry. In Paris, news of Bell's test quickly drew crowds of onlookers who witnessed Melville's voice emanating from the crude metal box. With only a telephone receiver Alexander Graham Bell could not respond directly to his father, and instead replied back by telegraph on a separate line to Brantford. Nevertheless Alexander Graham much later declared {{that this was the}} first one-way long distance call [...] "of several miles", but noted it was [...] "the first transmission at a distance, but it was not the first reciprocal conversation over a line. That was held in Boston on 9 October 1876." ...|$|E

2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for <b>line</b> <b>connections.</b> Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|E
