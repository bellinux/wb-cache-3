The circuit offers high combining efficiency, reduced thermal interaction and broad tuning bandwidth. The basic concepts of IMPATT oscillators are discussed. A single diode version of the <b>power</b> <b>accumulator</b> is presented in detail along with an equivalent circuit. A technique to optimize IMPATT oscillators is covered with experimental verification. The power combiner performance is demonstrated utilizing 2, 4 and 8 diodes. The broad tuning bandwidth of the combiner is presented for the eight diode configuration only. The optimum performance of a power combiner is attained when all the diodes, to be combined, have similar characteristics. To achieve the optimum condition, a technique is presented which determines if the diodes are suitable for combiner application...|$|R

Robot systems also receive bonuses to performance depending on the level of various appropriate extensions that have been activated by the robot's pilot. These bonuses usually correspond closely to the particular role that the robot has been designed for, and thus vary as widely as the roles of the robots.|$|R

40|$|Perturbation of {{external}} neutron source can cause significant <b>local</b> <b>power</b> changes transformed into undesired safety-related events in an accelerator driven system. Therefore for the accurate design of MYRRHA sub-critical core {{it is important}} to evaluate the uncertainty of power responses caused by the uncertainties in nuclear reaction models describing the particle transport from primary proton energy down to the evaluated nuclear data table range. The calculations with a set of models resulted in quite low uncertainty on the <b>local</b> <b>power</b> caused by significant perturbation of primary neutron yield from proton interactions with lead and bismuth isotopes. The considered accidental event of prescribed proton beam shape loss causes drastic increase in <b>local</b> <b>power</b> but does not practically change the total core thermal power making this effect difficult to detect. In the same time the results demonstrate a correlation between perturbed <b>local</b> <b>power</b> responses in normal operation and misaligned beam conditions indicating that generation of covariance data for proton and neutron induced neutron multiplicities for lead and bismuth isotopes is needed to obtain reliable uncertainties for <b>local</b> <b>power</b> responses...|$|R

Not only does it draw attention to the <b>power</b> dimension of <b>local</b> governance, it also brings to focus the individuals who play a role on and behind the scenes of governance networks. This article gives a comparative analysis of informal <b>local</b> <b>power</b> structures in three Dutch cities. Drawing on the classical reputational method of Hunter, it presents the 25 most influential persons of each city, their organisational backgrounds and influence resources. The results show that <b>local</b> <b>power</b> structures mainly consist of government executives (mayors, aldermen), entrepreneurs and directors of third sector organisations; local councillors and local civil servants are virtually absent on the lists of influential persons.

All this additional equipment made it necessary to decrease the ammunition load for the main gun to 37 rounds and eliminate the bow machine gun. In the beginning of the 1960s, a T-55K was experimentally fitted with a Uran TV relay apparatus for battlefield surveillance. The tank was fitted with an external camera, the picture from which was relayed to a receiver in a BTR-50PU command vehicle. There was an observation camera mounted on a folding mast which was in turn mounted on a UAZ 69 car. The range within which the picture could be relayed varied between 10 and 30 km.|$|R

Renewable energy technologies equip {{a large number of}} residential homes the capability of <b>local</b> <b>power</b> generation. The varying price of power supply from a smart grid and the existence of <b>local</b> <b>power</b> generation bring opportunities and challenges for energy management at residential homes. This paper proposes a cost-driven residential energy management approach for the adaption of smart grid and <b>local</b> <b>power</b> generation. The target system makes cost-driven scheduling of household appliances by considering the real-time and/or predictable status of smart grid, <b>local</b> <b>power</b> generation, and power consumption demands. The proposed approach minimizes the overall daily electricity cost of household appliances by taking into account both weather and electricity tariff forecasts, predictable home activities, and the flexibility of electricity use.
