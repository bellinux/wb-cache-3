40|$|These days one of {{the real}} {{problems}} that cause the prejudice economic in animal farms yearly is parasitic diseases. For that reason to prevent these problems the use of antiparasitic drugs is necessary. Ivermectin is a broad spectrum antiparasitic agent and different dosage forms such as injection, oral and pour-on used. The aims of this study were evaluation of the efficacy of ivermectin pour-on administration against natural dictyocaulus viviparous nematode infections in cattle and also determine the prevalence rate of this parasite in Tabriz area. In this study in 120 heads of male and female hybrid cattle were carried out LPG (<b>larves</b> per gram of feces) feces test. Willis method was applied for feces test and Stoll method was used for counting nematode <b>larves</b> (LPG). After confirm worm contamination and counting dictyocaulus viviparous nematode <b>larves</b> in feces in infected animals, ivermectin (0. 5 mg kg - 1) pour-on was administrated. Feces test was repeated in 1, 7, 21 and 28 day after treatment. Results showed that total prevalence of dictyocaulus viviparous nematode infections was 5 % cattle’s of Tabriz area. The effects of ivermectin pour-on on dictyocaulus viviparous nematode were 42. 18, 54. 68, 90. 62 and 99. 21 % in 1, 7, 21 and 28 day, respectively. In conclusion because the effect of this drug against dictyocaulus viviparous nematode was > 99 % (p< 0. 05) so in cattle can use this drug in antiparasitic program. Of course the effect of this drug on other nematodes and parasitic infections are needed to be more investigated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The fauna of {{the lower}} few {{centimetres}} of the sea ice in Frobisher Bay, Arctic Canada, consists mainly of meroplanktoNc Young of benthic adults and holoplanktonic representatives of generally benthic groups. The major arctic mplankton species are not included. The ice fauna comprises nematodes, harpacticoid copepods, polychaete larvae, ciliates, various benthic larvae, Young gammaridean amphipods, and others. Some species m u r in the ice as Young animals only, others in al 1 stages of development. Adaptation to the ice is shown best by the copepods, some of which occur there in al 1 stages from egg to adult. The most abundant ice inhabitants reach high concentrations in the ice (nematodes more than 100 OOO, Cyclopina nearly 10 000. m- 2). Others appear to show only accidental presence in the ice, and are found in small numbers only, often at times when great numbers {{of the same species}} ar present in the water below the ice. Probable feeding of the ice fauna and the food Chain linking the ice flora to vertebrate predators are discussed. Key words: arctic waters, sea ice, ice fauna, food Chain, zooplankton ” &SUMI?.

40|$|It i s often {{important}} {{to estimate the}} abundance of a fish stock when the stock is somewhat depleted. For pelagic species this presents great operational difficulties, because adult surveys may be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. Here we introduce a method for estimating the spawning biomass of a stock by means of egg or larval surveys. In particular, we develop a series of models for presence-absence sampling of eggs or larvae and show how presence-absence data {{can be used to}} estimate adult spawning biomass. The models are based on an underlying probabilistic description of the aggregation of eggs or larvae, a search process, and a description of habitat structure. Methodologies are given for estimating the distribution {{of the size of the}} spawning biomass from presence-absence data. A case study of sardine is used to justify a number of the assumptions. The methods are applied to a 1985 survey for sardine eggs and are compared to an alternative method based on egg production.

He begins with a description of the organization of the Station and of the routine work as it was daily carried on there, by himself and his staff, during nearly 6 months. During the day as well as during the night, captures of jungle were made in the forest and the same was done by night, in the Station House chiefly when the athmosphere was damp, just before, during, or after a rain. There was also an intensive search for foci of mosquitoes' <b>larves</b> in the bromelias, in holes, in trees and in the soil. The <b>larves</b> found in these breeding places were brought to a larvarium established in the forest in a place close to the station where they were bred in holes of bambus which were very suitable for them. During daytime, only new hatched mosquitoes have been captured, but during the night it has been possible to catch, inside the Station house, many female mosquitoes, with developped eggs, so confirming Aragão's opinion, that mosquitoes biting during the day are always, newly hatched ones. Some species of Sabetini were captured only inside the Biological Station House, during the night. The habits of the following species were subjected to more accurate investigations. Aedes scapularis, Aedes leucocelaenus, Lutzia braziliae, Culex (Carolia) iridescens, Orthopodomyia albicosta, Goeldia palidiventer, Joblotia compressum, Wyeomyia longirostris, Sabetoides intermedius, Limatus durhami.
