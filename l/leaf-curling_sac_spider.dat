25|$|Cheiracanthium inclusum, {{alternately}} {{known as}} the black-footed yellow <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> or the American yellow <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> (in order to distinguish it from its European cousin C. punctorium), was formerly classified as a true <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> (of the family Clubionidae), and then placed in the family Miturgidae, but now belongs to family Eutichuridae. It is a rather small pale yellow species that is indigenous to the Americas {{and can be found}} living in the foliage of forests and gardens but also can inhabit human homes. Despite common beliefs of necrosis, Cheiracanthium bites cause only localized swelling. C. inclusum is closely related to Cheiracanthium mildei, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North American homes.|$|R
40|$|Dermonecrotic arachnidism is the {{potential}} cutaneous reaction to spider bite venom. The yellow <b>sac</b> <b>spider,</b> genus Cheiracanthium, is historically considered capable of inducing dermonecrotic lesions. However, recently this belief has been hotly debated. In this article, the authors provide {{a brief review of}} dermonecrotic arachnidism and describe a case of a 20 -year-old man who developed severe necrosis and edema of the left thigh, buttock, penis, and scrotum following the bite of a yellow <b>sac</b> <b>spider.</b> Notably, the patient wore a tight-fitting garment for multiple hours following the spider bite, thus compressing the envenomated tissue. This is the first case reporting such severe dermonecrosis resulting from a yellow <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> bite and highlights {{the potential}} effects of tissue compression following spider envenomation...|$|R
