Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees.

As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The October 23, 1931 {{petition}} {{was submitted}} by Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII, in Mosul, asking {{for permission to}} allow the Assyrians to <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{before the end of}} the Mandate, stating that it would be impossible for the Assyrians to live in Iraq. This decision was reached at with the agreement of all the Assyrian leaders and when responses to this petition were delayed, the Assyrians decided to take action and planned for a general 'cessation of service' by all the Levies.|$|E
25|$|The {{paranoia}} {{that rose}} up around Hashimi's announcement and {{the reports that}} the buses were leaving Iraq slowed the influx of activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there to <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq,</b> believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi's actions. The Iraqi authorities, on the other hand, saw Kenneth O'Keefe, Sloan, and other organisers as constantly challenging Hashimi's authority and being deliberately disruptive, and that some would-be shields were taking too long to deploy to sites. Five of the 'trouble makers' {{were then asked to}} leave the country.|$|E

25|$|In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began {{preparing}} for the invasion of Iraq, {{with a host of}} public relations and military moves. In his 17 March 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq,</b> giving them a 48-hour deadline. But the U.S. began the bombing of Iraq on the day before the deadline expired. On 18 March 2003, the bombing of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, Italy and Denmark began. Unlike the first Gulf War, this war had no explicit UN authorisation.|$|E

Smith was willing to cross party lines in support of bills for withdrawing troops from Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The plan of Operation Yoav {{called for}} the {{creation}} of a permanent land corridor to the Negev through Iraq al-Manshiyya. The attack was meant to be carried out on October 17, 1948. It was, however, brought forward 24 hours to October 16 after a recommendation by Yitzhak Sadeh, commander of the 8th Armored Brigade. The attack would mark the first time that tanks would be used by Israel in the southern front. The Israelis hoped that Egypt would concentrate its main defenses in Fallujah, the locality that overlooked the vital Junction position, and therefore <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq</b> al-Manshiyya lightly defended. The village's two main positions were a tell just north, and the village school.|$|E

25|$|After {{the lengthy}} Iraq {{disarmament}} crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq,</b> which was refused, a coalition {{led by the}} United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait. (Turkey had refused to permit its territory {{to be used for}} an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia, estimated to number upwards of 50,000. After approximately three weeks of fighting, Hussein and the Ba'ath Party were forcibly removed, followed by 9 years of military presence by the United States and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected Iraqi government against various insurgent groups.|$|E
25|$|This {{continued}} until Ayyoub al-Jalili headed the Jalili family. He tried {{to enforce the}} Sultan's original firman; however, the people of Bakhdida, as it was known at this time, fought {{with the help of}} Bihnam Bounni, who won the case in the Mosul courts in 1920 and traveled to Istanbul and won the case there in 1923. Nevertheless, Ayyoub al-Jalili and the Jalili family returned again and tried to claim ownership of Bakhdida. On 21 Nov. 1949 judge Moslih al-Den al-Salhani awarded Bakhdida to the Jalili family. The people of Bakhdida presented a petition to the Iraqi government in which they explained the whole history of their village, ending the petition with a request for permission to <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq</b> if the government did not return ownership of the village to them. The courts looked into the matter one last time and on 15 March 1954 awarded the village to the people of Bakhdida.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 presidential election, Obama {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} Iraq War, and Obama withdrew {{the vast majority}} of U.S. soldiers in Iraq by late 2011. On taking office, Obama announced that U.S. combat forces would <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq</b> by August 2010, with 35,000–50,000 American soldiers remaining in Iraq as advisers and trainers, down from the roughly 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq in early 2009. In 2008, President Bush had signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, in which the United States committed to withdrawing all forces by late 2011. Obama attempted to convince Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to allow U.S. soldiers to stay past 2011, but the large presence of American soldiers was unpopular with most Iraqis. By late-December 2011, only 150 American soldiers remained to serve at the US embassy. However, in 2014, the U.S. began a campaign against ISIL, an Islamic extremist terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that grew dramatically after the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from Iraq and the start of the Syrian Civil War. By June 2015, there were about 3500 American soldiers in Iraq serving as advisers to anti-ISIL forces in the Iraqi Civil War, and Obama left office with roughly 5,262 U.S. soldiers in Iraq and 503 of them in Syria.|$|E
