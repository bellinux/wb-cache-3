5|$|Craig {{failed to}} pass 20 in the Fifth Test as Australia won again to take a creditable 3–0 series win, {{something}} highly unexpected {{at the beginning of}} the tour. Overall, Craig's men won 11 of their 20first-class games on tour, and the South African Cricket Annual recognised the Australian captain's <b>leadership</b> <b>by</b> naming him as one of their Five Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded smoothly without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which would have made Harvey captain.

When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, who was still offering to drop himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters <b>leadership</b> <b>by</b> the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|The failed {{offensive}} {{was investigated}} by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that the offensive failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate <b>leadership</b> <b>by</b> the Sisak OG {{as a cause of}} the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the offensive with little, if any, training. Finally, the offensive itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo also criticised the offensive as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's <b>leadership</b> <b>by</b> palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E

5|$|Egan's own {{research}} into the issue showed that the trustees had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished {{their role in the}} church's <b>leadership.</b> <b>By</b> 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the trustees became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's coadjutor bishop. He appealed to the trustees for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted <b>leadership</b> <b>by</b> Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May, {{after days}} of heavy aerial bombardment, the final German {{offensive}} in the Kerch Peninsula, Operation Bustard Hunt, began. The 44th Army quickly collapsed, and the 51st Army was forced to fight off frontal attacks while also defending its open left flank. The 390th, in reserve, was sent into battle at Arma-Eli, and its 789th Regiment delayed the German advance, gaining time {{for the rest of}} the division to set up a defensive line in preparation for a counterattack. However, Lvov and his command staff were killed in an airstrike on the army headquarters, and no counterattack took place. Furthermore, on 13 May, division commander Babayan was wounded and evacuated, further diminishing the army <b>leadership.</b> <b>By</b> 14 May the German advance reached the shores of Kerch Bay, cutting off the troops retreating towards Eltigen and Kamysh-Burun. At this point, the 789th Regiment, now commanded by its commissar, S. Sargsyan, launched a counterattack, throwing the German troops back on the slopes of Mount Mithridat. For three days the regiment, suffering heavy casualties, held its positions and delayed the German advance. However, German troops advanced into Kerch from the southwest and the situation became hopeless. Upon orders from the Crimean Front command, from 14 to 20 May, the 51st Army covered the evacuation of the troops. The remnants of the division were among those evacuated across the Kerch Strait, but the fighting left the division nearly destroyed. It was officially disbanded on 14 June 1942, along with other divisions destroyed in Crimea, and its survivors were used to provide the experienced core of new formations.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his <b>leadership</b> <b>by</b> replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
