Indicators of financial work incentives are needed for identifying any undesired influences of taxes and social transfers on people's work decisions. At the same time, {{a central part of}} recent tax and benefit reform strategies has been to reduce reliance on welfare by â€œmaking work payâ€, that is, to make work an economically attractive option relative to welfare. It is therefore desirable to monitor the effects of such policies as well as the potential for further reform [...] taxation, fiscal policy, household income, marginal effective tax rates, METR, unemployment trap, inactivity trap, <b>low-wage</b> <b>trap,</b> employment, Carone, Salom�ki, Immervoll, Paturot...|$|E
30|$|Although we {{have not}} {{analyzed}} {{the extent to which}} wages rose above the low-wage threshold and how permanent such a rise was, our results indicate that low-wage employment can be a stepping stone into better-paid jobs for some employees. At the same time, staying in the “wrong” kind of firm or occupation can make low-wage employment persistent. The matching of employees to firms in the low-wage sector thus may have important and long-lasting effects on the wage and employment careers of these workers. As also suggested by Andersson et  al. (2005, p.  13), labour market policies that seek to improve the access of low-wage earners to higher-wage firms and occupations could have substantial payoffs. While subsidizing low-wage work is one way of lifting employees' income to decent levels, it may be better to place these low-wage earners in firms and jobs that enable them to leave the <b>low-wage</b> <b>trap</b> on their own initiative.|$|E

More specifically, although job mobility is to a certain degree endogenous (i.e. mainly driven by aspirations to improve one's position), we would like to see whether moving to another firm (as suggested by Andersson et  al. 2005) or to another occupation is a successful strategy for leaving low-paid employment. In particular, if the employee is working in a dead-end firm and/or in a dead-end job with no chances of upward wage mobility, leaving this firm and/or job may be her only way to escape the <b>low-wage</b> <b>trap.</b> 6 Given the limited chances of upward wage mobility in small firms discussed above and assuming that small firms are more likely to promote general skills whereas large firms are more likely to generate specific skills (Bolvig 2005), we would expect that leaving small firms should be particularly promising, whereas leaving large firms may not be so beneficial. A more technical argument would be that individuals in small firms can move to larger, and thus better-paying, firms whereas individuals in the group of largest firms cannot. We also expect that transitions into higher-paid employment are more likely if individuals leave plants that have a large share of low-paid workers. Similarly, although we do not have specific hypotheses here, we will check whether there are occupations where moving out is particularly important and successful. 7 [...]...|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of the first payroll tax {{reductions}} implemented in France in the 90 s on the wage dynamics of low-income employees. Since these policies represent a net transfer from the State to the employer/employee match, they are unlikely to lead to wage reductions for employees of a given productivity level. However, the degressivity of such payroll tax reductions leads to a concave link between wage and productivity such that for given productivity changes, wage increases are lower once the payroll tax reductions are implemented. The {{purpose of this study is}} to test the validity of this <b>low-wage</b> <b>trap</b> hypothesis. Our first empirical strategy simply consists in comparing the evolution of wage increases for employees benefiting from the payroll tax reductions with those of the closest individuals in terms of wages, but not affected by these reductions. This difference-in-difference strategy shows that low-wage employees were more likely than medium-wage employees to get a raise in 1997 than they were in 1994, when payroll tax reductions were only marginal. The substantial minimum wage increase in the period makes it hard, though, to interpret these results causally. Our second empirical strategy compares the individual wage evolutions of a near-to-minimum wage employee between 1994 and 1998 with that of a similar individual but for the 1984 - 1988 period. We observe no significant differential evolutions. Overall, our results suggest that payroll tax reductions did not decrease the expected income of low-wage employees, at least in the short or medium run.
