5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' <b>love</b> <b>is</b> now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his <b>love</b> <b>is</b> unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of <b>love</b> <b>is</b> stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote {{the story in}} early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; {{at the time he}} thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. According to this dialogue, <b>love</b> <b>is</b> driven by a person's soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E

5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens <b>Love,</b> <b>is</b> an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn of <b>Love</b> <b>is</b> one of his more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present {{a challenge to the}} viewer mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E
5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most <b>love</b> <b>is</b> coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; <b>love</b> <b>is</b> replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E
