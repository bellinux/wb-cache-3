After discussing conflicts of obligation, it is asserted that <b>loyalties</b> are divided only when {{the demands of the}} various relationships involved are irreconcilable. As this is an extreme, the major problematic issues fall, then in between, on multiple <b>loyalties</b> and ambiguous <b>loyalties.</b> How and where multiple <b>loyalties</b> arise, and under what conditions they may become ambiguous <b>loyalties</b> lead to the recognition that moral problems are created by leaving in ambiguity things about the relationships involved that would be better sorted out.

40|$|In {{the middle}} of tight {{competition}} of AMDK and AMDIU products in Central Java Province, PT. Indotirta Jaya Abadi as AMDK ‘AGUARIA’ producer in Semarang also facing tight competition. To overcome competition which become tighter and tighter, the company have to analyze consumer <b>loyalties</b> in choosing its AMDK product. The goal {{of this research is}} to know relation between 5 Q, total quality, and consumers <b>loyalties</b> in choosing AGUARIA as their everyday drinking water, testing relation between AGUARIA consumer demography to consumer <b>loyalties</b> in choosing AGUARIA as their drinking water and try to give recommendation to increase consumer <b>loyalties</b> in choosing AGUARIA as their drinking water. To increase consumer <b>loyalties</b> need to maintain good total quality. Total quality to be modeled in five quality functions those are quality of product, quality of process, quality of interaction, quality of infrastructure, and quality of environment. To see correlation between total quality with consumer <b>loyalties,</b> need to analysis correlation test and regression test. With these test can be concluded is there a correlation between total quality with consumer <b>loyalties</b> and to determine exact CRM strategy to be used. From F-Test and T-Test, the total quality function have p-value 0, 844 > 0, 05, it’s mean the total quality do not {{have an effect on the}} consumer <b>loyalties.</b> From correlation test which have been done, it’s found that correlation coefficient of total quality with consumer <b>loyalties</b> is 0. 025. That’s means correlation total quality with consumer <b>loyalties</b> is weak, with equation regression model Y = 3. 065 + 0, 015 X 1 + e. This conclusion arise from the fact that all AMDK products already fulfill the standard and product quality which have been applied to all big company of AMDK in Indonesia, so very difficult to all consumer to choose an AMDK product only from its quality. It is suggested for the next research to study other consumers direct corresponding functions, like price function and brand image function. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>loyalties</b> voters feel towards {{political}} parties {{are central to}} the stability of democratic systems. Political socialisation theories explain these <b>loyalties</b> through parental inheritance. This paper analyses the consequences for party <b>loyalties</b> when parental in-heritance is absent, through an examination of partisanship among Australian immigrants. Three hypotheses to explain immigrant par-tisanship &mdash; withdrawal, economic self-interest, and re-socialisation are tested using a large national survey conducted among immi-grants in 1988. The results support the withdrawal and economic self-interest hypotheses, but reject the re-socialisation hypothesis. The relative periods of time spent in the donor and host societies do not appear to have any influence on partisanship. Lacking the affect-ive bond to parties provided by parental political socialisation, immigrants appear able to change their party <b>loyalties</b> relativel...|$|R

50|$|Parents {{appear to}} be a primary source of {{political}} socialization and partisanship. Much of the theoretical basis for this hypothesis emerged from the fields of child psychology and social learning, which studied the ways in which children are socialized and values inculcated in them. Studies of political partisanship have found that partisanship is strongest when both parents have the same political <b>loyalties,</b> these <b>loyalties</b> are strong, both parents have similarly strong party <b>loyalties,</b> and parental partisanship accords with socio-economic status (for example, the wealthy are Republicans or the poor are Labour supporters).|$|R

5|$|After the Civil War {{began in}} 1861, {{the demand for}} horses {{increased}} and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them {{as far away as}} New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861 Anderson traveled south with brother Jim and Judge Baker, in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had stated to a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons, rather than <b>loyalty</b> to the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing <b>loyalty</b> to the Union. One way that he sought to prove that <b>loyalty</b> was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.|$|E
