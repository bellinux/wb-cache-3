25|$|The gene has 97% {{sequence}} homology with the glycophorin A gene from the 5' UTR approximately 1 kilobase upstream from the exon encoding the transmembrane regions to {{the portion of}} the coding sequence encoding the first 45 amino acids. There is a signal sequence of 19 amino acid residues. The <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> differs by one amino acid and the next 26 amino acids are identical. Amino acids 27-55 of glycophorin A are absent from glycophorin B. This section includes an N-glycosylation site. Only O-glycosylation sites are found on glycoprotein B and these are linked via serine or threonine. Residues 80-100 of glycophorin A and 51-71 of glycophorin B are very similar. The intervening residues in contrast differ significantly. The antigenic determinant for the blood group Ss is located at residue 29 where S has a methionine and s a threonine. This is due to a mutation at nucleotide 143 (C->T). The S antigen is also known as MSN3 and the s antigen as MNS4.|$|E
2500|$|Discovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues, the trp operon in E. coli was {{the first}} repressible operon to be discovered. [...] While the lac operon can be {{activated}} by a chemical (allolactose), the tryptophan (Trp) operon is inhibited by a chemical (tryptophan). [...] This operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, and trp A, which encodes tryptophan synthetase. [...] It also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene (trp R) that binds to the operator. [...] In the lac operon, lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription. [...] Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation. This {{is an example of}} the corepressible model.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} {{of the association of}} the trimeric enzyme complex with the N-terminal <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region is not yet understood; however, it is thought that the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is cleaved from the core peptide putatively by the peptidase contained in the biosynthetic gene cluster.

40|$|We have {{compiled}} {{sequences of}} precursor proteins for 50 mitochondrial proteins {{for which the}} mature amino terminus has been determined by amino acid sequence analysis. Included in this set are 8 precursors that have <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> that are cleaved in two places by mitochondrial matrix proteases. When these eight <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> are aligned and compared, a highly conserved three-amino acid motif is identified as being common to this class of <b>leader</b> <b>peptides.</b> This motif includes an arginine at position - 10, a hydrophobic residue at position - 8, and serine, threonine, or glycine at position - 5 relative to the mature amino terminus. The initial cleavage of these peptides by matrix processing protease occurs within the motif, between residues at - 9 and - 8, such that arginine at position - 10 is at position - 2 relative to the cleaved bond. The rest of the motif is within the octapeptide removed by subsequent cleavage catalyzed by intermediate-specific protease. An additional 14 <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> in this collection (all of those that contain an arginine at - 10) conform to this motif. Assuming that these 14 precursors are matured in two steps, we compared the internal cleavage sites at position - 8 with {{the ends of the}} other 30 <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> in the collection. We find that 74 % of matrix processing protease cleavage sites follow an arginine at position - 2 relative to cleavage...|$|R

A bias is observed in the usage of rare codons for two of the three hydrophobic amino acids for which there are rare codons.

Cells expressing herpes virus ICP- 47 block the generation of this epitope, demonstrating that TAP functions in the transport of the peptide from cytosol to ER. This reveals a pathway for antigen presentation of <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> that involves translocation of a protein to the ER where its leader is cleaved followed by its release into the cytosol and transport back into the ER.

50|$|Thiopeptide {{biosynthesis}} is biochemically {{similar to}} that of cyanobactins, lanthipeptides, and linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs). As with cyanobactins and LAPs, azole and azoline synthesis occurs via the action of an ATP-dependent YcaO-domain cyclodehydratase. In contrast to LAPs, where cyclodehydration occurs via the action of two distinct proteins responsible for <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> binding and cyclodehydrative catalysis, these are fused into a single protein (G protein) in cyanobactin and thiopeptide biosynthesis.

40|$|Several nascent {{peptides}} stall ribosomes {{during their}} own translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. <b>Leader</b> <b>peptides</b> that induce stalling can regulate downstream gene expression. Interestingly, stalling peptides show little sequence similarity {{and interact with}} the ribosome through distinct mechanisms. To explore the scope of regulation by stalling peptides and {{to better understand the}} mechanism of stalling, we identified and characterized new examples from random libraries. We created a genetic selection that ties the life of Escherichia coli cells to stalling at a specific site. This selection relies on the natural bacterial system that rescues arrested ribosomes. We altered transfer-messenger RNA, a key component of this rescue system, to direct the completion of a necessary protein if and only if stalling occurs. We identified three classes of stalling peptides: C-terminal Pro residues, SecM-like peptides, and the novel stalling sequence FXXYXIWPP. Like the <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> SecM and TnaC, the FXXYXIWPP peptide induces stalling efficiently by inhibiting peptidyl transfer. The nascent peptide exit tunnel and peptidyltransferase center are implicated in this stalling event, although mutations in the ribosome affect stalling on SecM and FXXYXIWPP differently. We conclude that ribosome stalling can be caused by numerous sequences and is more common than previously believed...|$|R
40|$|The nonclassical major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) Qa- 1 b accommodates monomorphic <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> and functions as a ligand for germ line receptors CD 94 /NKG 2, which are expressed by natural killer cells and CD 8 + T cells. We here describe that the conserved peptides are replaced by a novel peptide repertoire of surprising diversity {{as a result of}} impairments in the antigen-processing pathway. This novel peptide repertoire represents immunogenic neoantigens for CD 8 + T cells, as we found that these Qa- 1 b–restricted T cells dominantly participated in the response to tumors with processing deficiencies. A surprisingly wide spectrum of target cells, irrespective of transformation status, MHC background, or type of processing deficiency, was recognized by this T cell subset, complying with the conserved nature of Qa- 1 b. Target cell recognition depended on T cell receptor and Qa- 1 b interaction, and immunization with identified peptide epitopes demonstrated in vivo priming of CD 8 + T cells. Our data reveal that Qa- 1 b, and most likely its human homologue human leukocyte antigen-E, is important for the defense against processing-deficient cells by displacing the monomorphic <b>leader</b> <b>peptides,</b> which relieves the inhibition through CD 94 /NKG 2 A on lymphocytes, and by presenting a novel repertoire of immunogenic peptides, which recruits a subset of cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{bacterial}} and eukaryotic systems have identified two-gene operons {{in which the}} translation product of the upstream gene influences translation of the downstream gene. The upstream gene, {{referred to as a}} leader (gene) in bacterial systems or an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in eukaryotes, encodes a peptide that interferes with a function(s) of its translating ribosome. The peptides are therefore cis-acting negative regulators of translation. The inhibitory peptides typically consist of fewer than 25 residues and function prior to emergence from the ribosome. A biological role for this class of translation inhibitor is demonstrated in translation attenuation, a form or regulation that controls the inducible translation of the chloramphenicol resistance genes cat and cmlA in bacteria. Induction of cat or cmlA requires ribosome stalling at a particular codon in the leader region of the mRNA. Stalling destabilizes an adjacent, downstream mRNA secondary structure that normally sequesters the ribosome-binding site for the cat or cmlA coding regions. Genetic studies indicate that the nascent, leader-encoded peptide is the selector of the site of ribosome stalling in leader mRNA by cis interference with translation. Synthetic <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> inhibit ribosomal peptidyltransferase in vitro, leading to the prediction that this activity is the basis for stall site selection. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> are rRNA-binding peptides with targets at the peptidyl transferase center of 23 S rRNA. uORFs associated with several eukaryotic genes inhibit downstream translation. When inhibition depends on the specific codon sequence of the uORF, it has been proposed that the uORF-encoded nascent peptide prevents ribosome release from the mRNA at the uORF stop codon. This sets up a blockade to ribosome scanning which minimizes downstream translation. Segments within large proteins also appear to regulate ribosome activity in cis, although in most of the known examples the active amino acid sequences function after their emergence from the ribosome, cis control of translation by the nascent peptide is gene specific; nearly all such regulatory peptides exert no obvious trans effects in cells. The in vitro biochemical activities of the cat/cmla <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> on ribosomes and rRNA suggest a mechanism through which the nascent peptide can modify ribosome behavior. Other cis-acting regulatory peptides may involve more complex ribosomal interactions...|$|R

Additionally, further sequence analysis of the strain 297 circular plasmids revealed that rearrangements appear to have {{played an important role in}} generating sequence diversity among the members of these three families and that recombinational events in the downstream flanking regions appear to have occurred independently of those within the lipoprotein-encoding genes.
