The legs were a unique design, with Jones standing on eight-inch-high lifts, and {{the legs of the}} Faun attached to his own. His lower leg was eventually digitally erased in post production. Servos in the head flapped the Faun's ears and blinked the eyes, and were remotely operated by David Marti and Xavi Bastida from DDT [...] Especiales while on set.

2500|$|In January 2014, Rick Dyer, {{perpetrator}} of {{a previous}} Bigfoot hoax, {{said that he had}} killed a Bigfoot creature in September 2012 outside San Antonio, Texas. He said that he had scientific tests performed on the body, [...] "from DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot, and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it, and now I'm proving it to the world." [...] He said that he had kept the body in a hidden location, and he intended to take it on tour across North America in 2014. He released photos of the body and a video showing a few individuals' reactions to seeing it, but never released any of the tests or scans. He refused to disclose the test results or to provide biological samples. He said that the DNA results were done by an undisclosed lab and could not be matched to identify any known animal. Dyer said that he would reveal the body and tests on February 9, 2014 at a news conference at Washington University, but he never made the test results available. After the Phoenix tour, the Bigfoot body was taken to Houston. On March 28, 2014, Dyer admitted on his Facebook page that his [...] "Bigfoot corpse" [...] was another hoax. He had paid Chris Russel of Twisted Toy Box to manufacture the prop from <b>latex,</b> <b>foam,</b> and camel hair, which he nicknamed [...] "Hank". Dyer earned approximately US$60,000 from the tour of this second fake Bigfoot corpse. He said that he did kill a Bigfoot, but did not take the real body on tour for fear that it would be stolen.|$|E
50|$|To create <b>foam</b> <b>latex,</b> {{a liquid}} latex base {{is mixed with}} various {{additives}} and whipped into a foam, then poured or injected into a mold and baked in an oven to cure.

5000|$|<b>Latex</b> <b>foam</b> in {{mattresses}} {{is generally}} {{a blend of}} the latex of the Hevea brasiliensis tree and synthetic latex, which is derived from petrochemicals and other substances and fillers. There are, however, natural latex mattresses that leave out polyurethane-based chemicals. <b>Latex</b> <b>foam</b> is produced using either the Talalay or the Dunlop process. Each provides a different feel. Dunlop is generally a firmer foam, Talalay is softer. While the Dunlop process produces a denser foam, the Talalay process produces a lighter one that has more air in it. If you were to weigh each as latex cores, the Dunlop foam would be heavier because it has more latex in it. Talalay is more expensive as its production is more resource intensive. Natural <b>latex</b> <b>foam</b> has a higher latex content than synthetic latex, however, [...] "100% natural latex foam" [...] is misleading.|$|E

5000|$|The Talalay {{process is}} an {{elaborate}} process that yields very controlled densities and product [...] "feel". The formulation uses {{many of the}} same base components as the Dunlop formulation, but without gellation reagents. The result is marketed as a healthier alternative to petroleum-based foams since petroleum-based foams give off volatile organic compounds as they age. In the marketing of products such as beds that include [...] "natural" [...] <b>latex</b> <b>foams</b> created with the Talalay process, these products are sometimes characterised as 'organic' or as completely natural however there are different methods of producing Talalay that alter how natural the formula finishes. One compound called Styrene Butadyne Runner is a form of synthetic latex used by Talalay Global And is mixed with the latex from the hevea tree to form the final Talalay product. Vita Talalay in the Netherlands still produces a Talalay product that is free of Styrene Butadyne and uses the latex from the hevea tree and the entire base.|$|R
