It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of vegetables, 22% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of fruits, and 19% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of vegetables, 31% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of fruits, and 27% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> poor consumption of dairy foods. The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents {{are more likely to be}} obese as adults than those raised by their parents. An American study released in 2011 found the more mothers work the more children are more likely to be overweight or obese.|$|E

50|$|Many crime victimization surveys, {{from many}} countries, do {{show that there}} is a {{correlation}} between the under-reporting of crime and the degree of intimacy between the victim and the offender. The degree of seriousness of offending also affects reporting, with less serious offending <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> police. Also the nature of the offending affects reporting, with sexual offenses far <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported,</b> even when they are serious.|$|R

50|$|Most rapes are {{perpetrated by}} a person known to the victim; however, it is <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than {{stranger}} rape and thus crime statistics often underestimate the prevalence of acquaintance rape compared to national surveys.

25|$|Over {{a period}} of thirty years, Lewis amassed a huge {{personal}} fortune almost solely through targeting wealthy bankers, merchants and other prominent figures. This was most often because more of a profit could be made while they were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> the crime to police. Among his more well-known victims included General John A. Logan, Judge Noah Davis, Charles Francis Adams and, most notably, Irish author Oscar Wilde.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{state that}} {{gay and lesbian}} couples {{experience}} domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. One study focusing on Hispanic men indicated that gay men {{are less likely to}} have been perpetrators or victims of domestic violence than heterosexual men but that bisexual men {{are more likely to have}} been both. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.|$|E

40|$|Sexual assaults are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> {{the police}} than {{physical}} assaults, while sexual assaults by a current partner {{are the least}} <b>likely</b> of all <b>to</b> be <b>reported,</b> even compared <b>to</b> other types of sexual assaults.

There is also reluctance to disclose sexual violence even when physical violence may be identified. This means that sexual assault may remain a hidden aspect of abuse in relationships, even where physical assaults are disclosed.

25|$|Stack {{analyzed}} {{the results from}} 42 studies and found that those measuring {{the effect of a}} celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the death of Kurt Cobain never materialized in an actual increase in suicides. Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors. Similarly the researcher Gerard Sullivan has critiqued research on copycat suicides, suggesting that data analyses have been selective and misleading, and that the evidence for copycat suicides are much less consistent than suggested by some researchers.|$|E
25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual, and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E

The earlier studies showed that <b>reporting</b> <b>to</b> the MCMIS Crash File was incomplete. This report examines the factors that are associated with reporting rates for the state of Minnesota. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the Minnesota Crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Overall, it appears that Minnesota is reporting 79. 9 percent of crash involvements that should be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> the MCMIS Crash file. Reportable cases could be identified in the Minnesota data reasonably well using the coded data, with some qualification for the towed/disabled crash severity. Reporting rates were related to crash severity, with fatal or injury/transported involvements most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported,</b> and tow/disabled crashes <b>less</b> <b>likely.</b> Reporting rates also varied by the type of vehicle, with small buses (8 - 15 passenger) <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than trucks or large buses; by state of registration, with in-state vehicles <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than out-of-state; and by the type of investigation agency (state police, county, or city police).

500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, {{and it seemed to}} have no {{role in the development of}} sexual preference. Homosexual women were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to feel that way during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E
