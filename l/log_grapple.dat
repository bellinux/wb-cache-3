40|$|Noise {{is defined}} as an {{undesired}} sound that constitutes an unwarranted disturbance potentiality modifying animal behaviour or normal functioning. Forest operations commonly involve the use of equipment and machines that can produce noise and be a potential permanent or temporary disturbance for the wildlife. This study simulates noise propagation in a natural area generated during coppice stand harvesting by direct field noise measurements {{and the application of}} a specific GIS model. Two working phases were investigated: felling and yarding operations. Two potential systems were analyzed for the yarding operations: a) yarding by mobile cable yarder and b) skidding by tractor with a three point <b>log</b> <b>grapple.</b> The results are reported in terms of excess noise area for the third-octave bandwidths with the centre in 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. Felling by chainsaws presented the largest area where noise exceeds the ambient natural noise, while in the case of yarding, mobile cable yarding operations presented a smaller area of excess noise than skidding by tractor...|$|E
40|$|The {{grabbing}} {{forces of}} <b>log</b> <b>grapples</b> were modeled and analyzed mathematically under operating conditions when grabbing logs from compact log piles and from bunch-like log piles. The grabbing forces {{are closely related}} to the structural parameters of the grapple, the weight of the grapple, and the weight of the log grabbed. An opera-tional model grapple was designed and tested to validate grabbing forces of the mathematical models while grab-bing logs from five alternative diameter classes under two different working conditions. The working conditions and log sizes affected the grabbing forces significantly. Vali-dation results suggest that the mathematical models de-veloped can be used to estimate the grabbing forces re-quired in the design process of <b>log</b> <b>grapples.</b> The results can be used by equipment manufacturers and researchers involved in the engineering design of grapples used in harvesting operations...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>logging</b> <b>grapple</b> used in swing yarding is {{not moved}} by {{hydraulics}} but by cables. To {{open and close}} the tongs of the grapple, two cables are used. One is tensioned {{and the other is}} slacked off to move the tongs. A third cable goes back to the tail hold then to the yarder. This third cable is used to pull the grapple out into the setting and to create tension for lifting the grapple in the air.|$|R
