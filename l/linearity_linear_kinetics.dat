An initial slow exponential incorporation followed by <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> was characteristic of the two non-essential amino acids, glycine and proline, whereas the two essential amino acids studied, phenylalanine and leucine, showed <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> of incorporation with no detectable delay. The analogue amino acid, p-fluorophenylalanine also showed immediate <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> of incorporation. There was a poor correlation between the rate of formation of acid-soluble pools and incorporation kinetics. However, the rate of formation of the freely diffusible pool of amino acids correlated more closely with incorporation kinetics. The lack of direct involvement of the acid-soluble pool in protein synthesis was also demonstrated by pre-loading of pools before treatment of cells with labelled amino acids. The results partially {{support the hypothesis that}} precursor amino acids for protein synthesis come from the external medium rather than the acid-soluble pool, but suggest that the amino acid which freely diffuses into the cell from the external medium could also be the source...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present effort is threefold. Firstly, it is shown that there exists a principle, that we call Kinetical Interaction Principle (KIP), {{underlying}} the non <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> in particle systems, independently on the picture (Kramers, Boltzmann) used to describe their time evolution. Secondly, the KIP imposes the form of the generalized entropy associated to the system and permits to obtain the particle statistical distribution, both as stationary solution of the non linear evolution equation and as the state which maximizes the generalized entropy. Thirdly, the KIP allows, on one hand, to treat all the classical or quantum statistical distributions already known in the literature in a unifying scheme and, on the other hand, suggests how we can introduce naturally new distributions. Finally, as a working example of the approach to the non <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> here presented, a new non extensive statistics is constructed and studied starting from a one-parameter deformation of the exponential function holding the relation $f(-x) f(x) = 1 $.

40|$|Abstract [...] Dry ground {{phlogopite}} {{was placed}} in deionized water saturated with COs at room temperature and pressure. The bulk solution was buffered between a pH of 5 and 6 which {{is close to the}} pH of natural weathering systems. The conditions imulated a closed system. After 1010 hr, 2. 0 % of the total K, 0. 95 % of the Mg, 0. 54 % of the Si, and 0. 74 % of the F had been released, indicating that the dissolution was incongruent. Most of the K was released within 3 min, apparently by a rapid surface xchange with hy-drogen ion. One-third of the cation-exchange capacity of this phlogopite arises from cations released from the outer surfaces, while two-thirds arises from the release of more deeply seated cations. All cations exhibited ecreasing release with time, the slowest being Si. The rate-controlling "factor " in the later stages is related to the release of Si. It is difficult o distinguish <b>linear</b> from parabolic <b>kinetics</b> in the later stages because of the slow rate of dissolution; however, <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> is most likely.

25|$|Perhaps {{the primary}} graphic {{distinction}} made in classifications {{is that of}} <b>linearity.</b> <b>Linear</b> writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the Latin alphabet and Chinese characters. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a ball-point pen or a calligraphic brush, or cast in bronze. Similarly, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Maya glyphs were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in bas-relief. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the Sumerian script of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its cuneiform descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as braille, are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{three-dimensional}} micromechanical model is presented for simulation {{of the rate}} dependent properties of certain perovskite type tetragonal piezoelectric materials. The model is based on linear constitutive, nonlinear domain switching, and <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> theories. The simulation starts with a virgin bulk material of randomly oriented grains. Then the material is electrically loaded with an alternating voltage of various frequencies, which are {{in the order of}} 0. 01 Hz to 1 Hz. An energy equation in combination with a probability function is used to determine the onset of the domain switching inside the grains. Such a probability function leads to a better phenomenological model for the domain switching even for electrical loadings, which are in a range far below the coercive fields. The propagation of the domain wall during the domain switching process in grains is modeled by means of <b>linear</b> <b>kinetics</b> relations after domain nucleation. The response of the bulk ceramic is predicted by averaging the response of individual grains using Euler angles for the transformation from local coordinates of the grains to global coordinate. Electric displacement hysteresis loops for different frequencies and amplitudes of the alternating electric fields are simulated. A simple micromechanical model without the probabilistic approach is compared with the one that takes it into account. Both models give important insights into the rate dependency of piezoelectric materials, which was observed in some experiments reported in the literature...|$|R
