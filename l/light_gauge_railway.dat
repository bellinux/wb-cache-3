25|$|Garratts {{have several}} {{advantages}} when used on <b>light</b> and narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>railways.</b> They are tank locomotives and {{can easily be}} run tender-first, thus {{eliminating the need for}} expensive turntables or wyes. They {{do not need to be}} run through to terminals, increasing operational flexibility. Because the engine units are separated by the boiler unit, the weight of the locomotive is split over the two units, and they can run over bridges or line sections that might not be able to support conventional or Mallet locomotives of similar weight.|$|R
5000|$|The Shinkani to Hiromi {{section was}} opened in 1920 by the Tobi Railway as a [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railway.</b> In 1928, {{the line was}} {{converted}} to [...] gauge, electrified at 600 V DC, and extended to Inuyama. The company merged with Meitetsu in 1943. The voltage was raised to 1,500 V DC in 1965, and the Inuyama to Shinkani section was double-tracked between 1967 and 1970. Freight services ceased in 1982.|$|R
5000|$|In many provinces [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railways</b> {{were used}} for mines and {{prominently}} in Henan and Sichuan they {{were used for}} rural transportation, ironically {{most of them were}} built in an era when most European light railways had started to dwindle in favour of roads. The Shibanxi Railway in Sichuan is being preserved as China's first heritage steam railway. The Bagou-Shixi Railway is still operating with steam locomotives, partly for heritage purposes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{countries}} where a single standard gauge is dominant, the term light railway {{does not imply}} a narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>railway.</b> Most narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>railways</b> operate as <b>light</b> railways, but not all light railways need be narrow gauge. After Spooner's development of steam haulage for narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>railways,</b> the prevailing view was that the gauge should be tailored according to the traffic: [...] "The nearer the machine is apportioned to the work {{it has to do}} the cheaper will that work be done." [...] From the 1890s, it was recognised that cost savings could also be made in the construction and operation of a standard gauge railway: [...] "light axle-loads and low speeds, not gauge, are the first condition of cheap construction and economical working. Gauge is quite a secondary factor." [...] Break of gauge now became an important factor, and there was much concern over whether this would become an additional cost for the transshipment of goods, or whether this was over-emphasised compared to the amount of warehousing and handling needed anyway. The Irish railway system in particular became a good example of a broad gauge main line system with many independent narrow <b>gauge,</b> , <b>light</b> <b>railway</b> feeder branch lines.|$|R
50|$|The Alster Northern Railway {{was opened}} on 17 May 1953. Though it was {{initially}} planned {{as a simple}} tramway or the like, it was built as a standard <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railway</b> to EBO standards and was thus the first newly built railway line in the Federal Republic of Germany. The tracks were, and are, only attached to the north to the Hamburg-Altona-Neumünster railway (AKN) at Ulzburg Süd. In Ochsenzoll there was neither {{a connection to the}} now closed Deutsche Bundesbahn freight railway to Ohlsdorf nor to the U-Bahn line.|$|R
5000|$|The Stevington and Turvey Light Railway was a [...] narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railway</b> on the {{outskirts}} of the village of Turvey in Bedfordshire, England. It was about 3/4 mi long. The railway was formed in the early 1980s by former members of The Surrey Light Railway which was based in Hersham, Surrey. The railway was established on the former track bed of the Bedford to Northampton Line. The main signal box on the line was named Needham, and contains a 31 lever Westinghouse 'L' frame which originally came from Battersea Park Signal box.|$|R
5000|$|The metre <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railway</b> {{line was}} 23 km long and began in Emden {{district}} station near the state railway station of Emden-West, {{which had been}} expanded in 1935/36 from the minor station of Larrelter Straße. It ran through the Krummhörn landscape via Hinte and Pewsum to the port of Greetsiel on the bay of Leybucht. Within its catchment area the railway was also known as [...] "Jan Klein". (From the official name of Emden station the railway postal stamp used on the light railway was [...] "Emden−Larrelt−Greetsiel", which appeared {{to refer to the}} non-existent station of Larrelt, but was just a short way of writing [...] "Emden-Larrelter Straße − Greetsiel".) ...|$|R
5000|$|The railway was {{incorporated}} in October 1888 and opened on 21 April 1891. It was originally {{considered to be}} built as a [...] narrow gauge track but then executed as a standard <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railway,</b> partly running along a road. There were two companies, the Timoleague & Courtmacsherry Light Railway and the Ballinascarthy & Timoleague Junction Light Railway which were both worked by the Timoleague & Courtmacsherry Extension Light Railway. It became a constituent of Great Southern Railways in 1925. It was originally operated by two locomotives, both from the Leeds works of the Hunslet Engine Company, named Slaney and St. Molaga. These two were joined in 1894 by a third locomotive, again from Hunslet, with the name Argadeen.|$|R
5000|$|The Prater Liliputbahn is a [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>light</b> <b>railway</b> in Vienna, Austria. Opened in 1928, and {{extended}} in 1933, the railway operates {{primarily as a}} tourist attraction, but also provides transport links around the wider area of the Prater park, the amusement park (Wurstelprater), and the sports stadium. Although a year-round service was provided for many years, it is now more common for the railway to close during the months of December, January, and February. Originally steam-operated, the railway now uses a mixture of steam and diesel motive power. The railway {{can be reached by}} bus, tram, or metro from central Vienna, followed by a short walk, but following the extension of tram line 1, there is now a direct interchange with the Vienna tram network at the railway's Rotunda Station.|$|R
