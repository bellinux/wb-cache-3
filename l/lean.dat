5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} <b>lean,</b> but never enough to stop the increasing <b>lean,</b> until a very high <b>lean</b> angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the <b>lean</b> necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual <b>lean</b> angle of the rear frame from the ideal <b>lean</b> angle {{described}} above. The actual <b>lean</b> angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must <b>lean</b> more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and <b>lean</b> angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the <b>lean</b> angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that <b>lean,</b> the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to <b>lean</b> the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider <b>lean</b> varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider <b>lean</b> mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary <b>lean</b> {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to <b>lean</b> away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to <b>lean</b> the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must <b>lean</b> in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more <b>lean</b> is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This <b>lean</b> is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E

40|$|Mutations of the ?? 1 A subunit of P/Q-type {{voltage-gated}} calcium {{channels are}} responsible for several inherited disorders affecting humans, including familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. These disorders include phenotypes such as a progressive cerebellar atrophy and ataxia. The <b>leaner</b> mouse also carries a mutation in the alpha(1 A) subunit of P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which results in a severe cerebellar atrophy and ataxia. The <b>leaner</b> mutation causes reduced calcium ion influx upon activation of P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This disrupts calcium homeostasis and leads {{to a loss of}} cerebellar neurons, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. Because of its similarities with human P/Qtype voltage-gated calcium channel mutations, <b>leaner</b> mouse has served as a model for these disorders to aid our understanding of calcium channel function and neurodegeneration associated with calcium channel dysfunction. The aims of this dissertation were: (1) to precisely define the timing and spatial pattern of <b>leaner</b> Purkinje cell death and (2) to assess the role of caspases and specifically of caspase 3 in directing <b>leaner</b> Purkinje cell death. We used the mechanism independent marker for cell death Fluoro-Jade and demonstrated the <b>leaner</b> Purkinje cell death begins around postnatal day 25 and peaks at postnatal day 40 to 50. Based on this temporal pattern of Purkinje cell death we then investigated the role of caspases in <b>leaner</b> Purkinje cell death. These studies showed that caspase 3 is specifically activated in dying <b>leaner</b> cerebellar Purkinje cells. In addition, in vitro inhibition of caspase 3 activity partially rescued <b>leaner</b> Purkinje cells. Further investigation revealed that caspase 3 activation may be working together with or in response to macroautophagy. This study also indicated a potential role for mitochondrial signaling, demonstrated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in <b>leaner</b> cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, our study revealed that if the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is associated with <b>leaner</b> Purkinje cell death, this process is not mediated by the mitochondrial protein cytochrome C...|$|R
40|$|The <b>leaner</b> mouse {{carries an}} {{autosomal}} recessive mutation in the ? 1 A subunit of neuronal P/Q-type voltage gated calcium ion channels. Due to this mutation, the <b>leaner</b> mouse exhibits severe ataxia, absence seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia. Mutations {{in this same}} gene in humans cause: episodic ataxia type 2, familial hemiplegic migraine, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 and probably the newly recognized form of human inherited epilepsy. Decreased amplitude of calcium current in cerebellar Purkinje cells and decreased calcium buffering capacity suggest that failure of calcium homeostasis {{may lead to the}} neurodegeneration observed in these mutant mice. Both sexes are affected. Despite their neurological dysfunction, homozygous <b>leaner</b> mice are able to breed and produce viable offspring. The survival rate for these pups is highly correlated with early fostering to normal lactating dams. This thesis studies the reproductive dysfunction observed in female homozygous <b>leaner</b> mice and is divided into four parts: onset of puberty, estrous cycle, pregnancy and litter assessment, and hormone levels. We have discovered that the onset of puberty is precocious in <b>leaner</b> females compared to age-matched wild type females, and <b>leaner</b> mice spend more time in estrous than age-matched wild type females. Also, we have observed that <b>leaner</b> mice became pregnant less readily than wild type mice, but once pregnant, female <b>leaner</b> mice produced more pups per litter compared with wild type mice. The number of corpora lutea observed in <b>leaner</b> mice is greater than in wild type mice. In <b>leaner</b> mice, the number of corpora lutea in the ovary corresponding to the uterine horn with the highest number of offspring is larger than the number of corpora lutea found in the ovary corresponding to the other uterine horn. Radioimmunoassays of estradiol hormone levels at postnatal day 28 shows higher levels in <b>leaner</b> compared to age-matched wild type mice. However, at postnatal day 28, the luteinizing hormone levels are similar in both categories of mice. This study of reproductive dysfunction in <b>leaner</b> mice was performed to gain further understanding about the role of intracellular calcium ion signaling in neuronal regulation of reproductive processes in females...|$|R
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in <b>lean</b> angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase <b>lean</b> and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease <b>lean</b> and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of <b>lean.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} <b>lean,</b> independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a <b>lean,</b> gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any <b>lean</b> angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to <b>lean</b> in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (<b>lean</b> angle, <b>lean</b> rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E

40|$|Mutations of the ? 1 A subunit of CaV 2. 1 voltage gated calcium (VGCC) {{channels}} {{are responsible for}} several inherited disorders affecting humans, including familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type and spinocerebellar ataxia type. The <b>leaner</b> mouse also carries an autosomal recessive mutation in the ? 1 A subunit of CaV 2. 1 VGCCs, which, in the homozygous condition, results in a severe cerebellar atrophy and ataxia. The <b>leaner</b> mutation results in reduced calcium influx through CaV 2. 1 VGCCs. To better understand cerebellar neurodegeneration and cerebellar dysfunction we focused our research on elucidating the relationship between mitochondrial function/dysfunction and calcium channel mutations. The aims of this dissertation were: 1) to estimate the extent of neuronal cell death, basal intracellular calcium and mitochondrial (dys) function in cerebellar granule cells (CGC) of adult <b>leaner</b> mice; 2) to analyze {{the role of the}} <b>leaner</b> calcium channel mutation on postnatal development of CGCs; and 3) to test whether inducing increased calcium influx by exposing cultured granule cells to potassium chloride can eliminate or reduce the CGC death. By using mechanism independent Fluoro-Jade staining and apoptosis specific TUNEL staining, we demonstrated that <b>leaner</b> CGC death continues into adulthood and the spatial pattern of granule cell death observed during postnatal development also continues into adulthood. The present investigation showed a reduced resting intracellular calcium in CGC from <b>leaner</b> mice as compared to age matched wild type mice, and tottering mice. The tottering mouse is another mutant mouse that carries a mutation in the ? 1 A subunit of CaV 2. 1 VGCCs like <b>leaner</b> mouse. However, these mice do not show any neurodegeneration and therefore they were used as a second control. Our results also showed that even though CGC of <b>leaner</b> mice have dysfunctional CaV 2. 1 channels, there is no change in depolarization induced Ca 2 + influx, which suggests a functional compensation for CaV 2. 1 calcium channels by other VGCCs. Our results showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential at the time of peak CGC death in <b>leaner</b> mice as compared to wild type CGCs and tottering CGCs. The results of this investigation suggest mitochondrial mediated but reactive oxygen species independent cell death in CGCs of <b>leaner</b> mice...|$|R
