5|$|The Senior Prom {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to be expendable; however, it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced, with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under the fuselage. The aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with folding wings to facilicate carriage by the <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and was powered by a single turbofan engine, with the air intake and exhaust being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground, reducing the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures.|$|E
5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese flight decks at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted to augment the Combat Air Patrol. Spotting his flight decks and <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft</b> would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight intercepting F4Fs.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft</b> and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
50|$|A {{closely related}} term is the F-Pole. This is the slant range between the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft</b> and target, {{at the time}} of interception. The greater the F-Pole, the greater the {{confidence}} that the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft</b> will achieve air superiority with that missile.|$|R
50|$|This is the {{slant range}} between the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft</b> and target {{at the time}} that the missile begins active {{guidance}} or acquires the target with the missile's active seeker. The greater the A-Pole means less time and possibly greater distance that the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft</b> needs to support the missile guidance until missile seeker acquisition.|$|R

25|$|The Wagtail missile was {{intended}} to be fitted with a guidance system that utilised an inertial navigation system and a terrain-following radar, which allowed the missile to be fired from and navigate at extremely low altitudes.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the control system {{was to keep the}} missile centred in the {{guidance}} beam emitted by the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The pilot of the aircraft would keep the beam aligned with the target using his gunsight, which was harmonized with the axis of the radio beam. An advantage of this system was that it would be unaffected by the target aircraft using radar countermeasures such as chaff. The missile's receiver, fitted at the rear, only detected signals from the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R

500|$|Philippine Sea {{arrived in}} Korean waters on 1 August, and became {{flagship}} of Task Force 77 on 5 August. She immediately began launching {{air strikes against}} strategic targets, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began and United Nations and United States Army forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean Korean People's Army. Her first strikes were against Iri, Mokpo, and Kunsan. The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but {{the intensity of the}} battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily close air support missions for troops on the front lines. They also hit targets of opportunity, such as North Korean boats, bridges and dams spotted during missions. As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier. Except for brief rests to re-arm, refuel, or repair, Philippine Sea was in action continuously. She was put in a rotation of continuous action with Valley Forge to assure at least one was <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft</b> at all times. Following the beginning of The Great Naktong Offensive on 31 August, the two carriers launched 263 sorties to prevent the North Koreans from overrunning Pusan Perimeter. The ship sent sorties to defend Masan during the Battle of Masan, in spite of being [...] from the area. The ship steamed to the southern tip of the Peninsula at [...] on 1 September to support the Masan area more easily during the North Korean attacks.|$|E
2500|$|Have Dash II was {{designed}} with a composite body, trapezoidal in shape. [...] This was intended both {{to reduce the}} missile's radar-cross-section and to resist heat at hypersonic speeds, as the missile was intended to operate at Mach 5.

It had a range of slightly under 10 km. Targeting, arming, and firing of the weapon were coordinated by the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft's</b> fire-control system. Detonation was by time-delay fuze, although the fuzing mechanism would not arm the warhead until engine burn-out, to give the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft</b> sufficient time to turn and escape.

2500|$|The Royal Navy was {{an early}} leader in carrier {{aviation}} and, {{in the autumn of}} 1914, purchased the liner [...] for conversion into a seaplane carrier. Operating seaplanes required the carrier to stop to hoist the aircraft out- and in-board by crane, leaving the ship exceedingly vulnerable to U-Boat attacks; this technique fell into disfavour with the Admiralty, who began to seek alternatives. By the middle of 1916, Campania had been fitted with a 200ft (61m) flight deck forward and experiments were being carried out in <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft</b> from this. Against this background, the Admiralty issued a specification for a purpose-built, two-seat patrol and reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1967, Forrestal {{departed}} Norfolk {{for duty}} in waters off Vietnam. In the Gulf of Tonkin on 29 July, Forrestal had been <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft</b> from her flight deck. For four days, the planes of Attack Carrier Air Wing 17 flew about 150 missions against targets in North Vietnam from the ship. On 29 July 1967, during preparation for another strike, a Zuni rocket installed on an F-4 Phantom (#110), misfired, impacting an armed A-4 Skyhawk, side #405, {{parked on the}} port side. [...] The rocket's impact dislodged and ruptured the Skyhawk's 400-gallon external fuel tank. Fuel from the leaking tank caught fire, creating a serious conflagration that burned for hours, killing 134, injuring 161, destroying 21 aircraft and costing the Navy US$72million. On the flight deck that day was Lieutenant Commander (later Senator) John McCain.|$|E
5000|$|After launch, if {{the firing}} {{aircraft}} or surrogate continues {{to track the}} target, periodic updates—such as changes in the target's direction and speed—are sent from the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft</b> to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, {{so that it is}} able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to [...] "catch" [...] the target aircraft in the basket (the missile's radar field of view in which {{it will be able to}} lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the <b>launch</b> <b>aircraft).</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Werfergranate 21 (Wfr. Gr. 21), {{also called}} the 21cm BR (BR {{believed}} to be the abbreviation for [...] "Bordrakete" [...] in official Luftwaffe manuals) was an unguided air-to-air rocket version of the projectile used in the Nebelwerfer 42 and was first used in the defense of Schweinfurt on 17 August 1943. The Wfr. Gr. 21 was mounted on Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters (one launch tube under each wing) and on the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Messerschmitt Me 410 heavy fighters (two launch tubes under each wing) and was the first air-to-air rocket used by the Luftwaffe. Photographic evidence indicates that the Hungarians fitted three tubes under each wing of some of their twin-engined Me 210 Ca-1 heavy fighters. The rockets were used to break up Allied bomber combat box formations in order to enable more effective German fighter attacks against the scattered Allied aircraft. However, the high drag caused by the launchers reduced the speed and maneuverability of the <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft,</b> a handicap that could prove fatal if Allied fighters were encountered. Also, the launch tube's underwing mounting setup, which usually aimed the projectile at about 15° upwards from level flight to counter the considerable ballistic drop of the projectile in flight after launch, added to the drag problem.|$|E
2500|$|Discussions {{included}} {{debate on}} the aircraft carrier's mission. One view {{was that it would}} carry a group of large bombers that would be secured to the flight deck, with no hangar for these aircraft, as they would be too large to move up and down in an elevator. Though they would be built to carry large, nuclear weapons, the total amount of space used for munition storage would be reduced as multiple strikes would not be likely. [...] A small hangar deck would be available for a limited fighter escort and a small magazine for a small number of heavy nuclear weapons. Another plan was that it could be built with conventional attack capability with a large hangar deck for a large air wing and a large magazine. The nuclear attack supporters won in the initial design stage, but the design was modified to carry more fighters. The flush-deck United States was designed to launch and recover the 100,000pound (45 t) aircraft required to carry early-model nuclear weapons, which weighed as much as five tons. The ship would have no permanently raised island or command tower structure. It would be equipped with four aircraft elevators located at the deck edges to avoid decreasing the structural strength of the flight deck. Four catapults would be used to launch aircraft, with two at the bow and two others on {{the outer edge of the}} deck staggered back. The carrier was designed so that it could land aircraft at the rear while at the same time <b>launching</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the catapults at the bow and forward area simultaneously. The construction cost of the new ship was estimated at US$189 million (equivalent to US$ billion in [...] ).|$|E
