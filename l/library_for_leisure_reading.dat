40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the use of community libraries in Namibia. The study aims at finding solid data on the actual use of community libraries, who needs them and what do they need them for. Main questions addressed in the study are as follows: (i) Who are the users of Namibian community <b>libraries?</b> (ii) <b>For</b> which purposes do people use the services provided by community libraries? (iii) In which ways do the users´ demographic characteristics relate to the purposes of use? (iv) Which are the main usage patterns of the community libraries? (v) What are the needs for the development of the services of community libraries based on the suggestions and problems experienced by library users? The study was carried out as a survey in three community libraries in North-Central Namibia. The libraries were chosen to represent community libraries in the previously disadvantages regions to represent the majority of Namibian population and provide information on emerging user needs and usage patterns. The empirical data on demographic characteristics of all users and services used in those libraries was gathered during six days in October-November 2003. The data was analysed using frequencies of variables and a their cross tabulation. The working hypothesis of the study was that Namibian community libraries have changed from the pre-independence Anglo-American model of recreational and cultural institution and lending <b>library</b> mainly used <b>for</b> <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> and borrowing out fiction and hobby type of books, to a primarily educational institution. The hypothesis was clearly supported by the data on the users and usage patterns from the case libraries. Almost 70 % of the users in the three case libraries were learners and students. Community library was mainly used as a learning place, to study and do school work in the library. The other main functions used by varied groups of the community were photocopy service and public ICT access. Although lending continued to be a way of using the library it was not the major usage pattern. 64 % of users did not borrow books and only 1. 5 % of clients used the <b>library</b> only <b>for</b> borrowing. The main usage pattern of the community library as a study place and the most popular resources: textbooks, photocopy service and public ICT access, were interpreted to respond to important educational and socio-economic needs of Namibian communities.

40|$|Objectives – This study {{investigated}} the <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> habits and preferences ofstudents, faculty, staff, and community members at the University of BritishColumbia (UBC) {{in order to determine}} if a <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> collection would fulfill aneed and, if so, what form that collection should take to best serve the population. Methods – This study, conducted in October 2010, consisted of a 19 -question onlinequestionnaire distributed to a random sample of UBC undergraduate students,graduate students, faculty, and community library users and an identical, openparticipation questionnaire for the entire UBC community, including staff andcommunity members. In addition to some demographic information, thequestionnaire gathered information about <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> habits, tendencies, and theparticipants’ preferences for a potential future <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> collection at UBCLibrary. Results – There were 467 valid responses out of 473 total responses received fromUBC undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, and communitymembers. Of the valid responses, 244 were received from the 1, 500 random sampleinvitations (a 16. 3 % response rate). Additionally, the questionnaire was advertised foropen participation for those not invited, resulting in the remaining 229 responses. Results of this study indicated overwhelming support <b>for</b> a <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> collection at UBC Library, with 94 % of respondents stating they might or would use a <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> collection. This study also revealed strong <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> habits among all response groups. However, only 6 % of respondents currently acquire most of their <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> materials from UBC Library. Additional analysis found that UBC Library already owns 81 % of the titles and authors requested by respondents in the survey. Conclusions – Based on the findings, the strong support <b>for</b> a <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> collection, and the fact that many UBC campus residents are not eligible for a free municipal public library card and borrowing privileges, there is a genuine need <b>for</b> a <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> collection at UBC Library.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} {{to what extent}} Constitutional ideals of language equity have been implemented in multilingual publishing, to improve access to trade books. In South Africa, publishing in the different language groups of English, Afrikaans and African languages has taken different paths, due to {{the social and political}} history of the country. The transition to a democratic government and the introduction of a new Constitution in 1996 abolished censorship and established eleven official languages, to be treated equitably. But this study, using a combination of primary and secondary research, examines the disconnect between these Constitutional ideals and the current practice of publishers. Today, there are few African language books available <b>for</b> <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> adults, and this means that the eleven official languages are not being treated or developed equally. This statement is supported by the study’s analysis of the Publishers’ Association of South Africa’s (PASA) industry reports, which provide figures on the sales of books in different languages in the different publishing sectors. The study evaluates the interventions of two trade book initiatives in the development of African language publishing, which are managed by the South African Book Development Council (SABDC) and the National Library of South Africa (NLSA). These initiatives show that the government is aware of the lack of African language books being <b>read</b> <b>for</b> <b>leisure,</b> and is attempting to improve the situation. However, this study argues that a lack of implementation of the government’s language policy and book policy may further be delaying the reaching of Constitutional ideals. Further issues investigated as obstructing access to books include the book reading culture, the status of languages in South Africa, literary awards for African language books and the accessibility of books in bookshops or libraries. The study concludes that there is no clear-cut solution to improve the situation, but recommends changes in various areas connected to book publishing and book reading, {{over an extended period of}} time.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{developments}} in contemporary reading that accompany {{the adoption of}} new reading technologies, principally the eReader and eBook. Using methods of interview and participant observation, the opinions and values of communities of readers have been collected and analysed to explore how those communities describe the experiences of reading and of books. This research focuses on four case studies: people {{who are members of}} reading groups, who have a reading habit which includes at least one book per week, and who describe reading as their main medium <b>for</b> <b>leisure</b> purposes. These are people who express a love of reading, and are comfortable with discussing their own reading experiences. The second case is people who have adopted an eReader <b>for</b> <b>leisure</b> <b>reading.</b> This group share a reading pattern that matches that of the first case in frequency. The third case study investigates Bookcrossing. com, a social network site which promotes a practice of sharing books as gifts, by leaving them in public spaces to form the token for a treasure hunt game, organised through the website. A community has formed around the website Bookcrossing. com, which serves as a record of both the treasure hunt game and the reading experiences for it users. Finally, using the work of Jane Fox and Irene Mensah, the thesis explores the use of Portable Document Format copies of books, where access to an original physical book is limited or unavailable. Material in each case is reviewed and interpreted with respect to the experiential, socio-cultural, and material nature of the data collected. Having established an understanding of the experiences of the reader, based on the interview material collected from the reading group participants, the subsequent case studies offer the opportunity to understand the experiences of reading with, and the use of, the replacement transitional objects, that {{are in the process of}} inculcation in literary society. This thesis uses the concept of the assemblage, adopted from the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, as a model for the book as an object, which simultaneously denotes significance for the experience of reading, of the text it contains as well as wide significance for knowledge, wisdom and the transcendent sign. The contemporary situation is one of transition, from the singular book as an object of reading, that holds a single text or aggregation of texts towards the ‘book’ as an electronic device. This new device for reading has the potential to deliver any text, where format, digital rights and storage conditions are met, and where the text itself holds the potential to connect out to any and all other texts, provided in a digital material form. The research method adopts the concepts of Ludic approach to understanding reading developed by Wolfgang Iser, deconstruction of the nature of language and discourse as developed by Jacques Derrida, and utilising the concepts of Theory of Mind and Metarepresentation elaborated by Lisa Zunshine. The experiences of reading captured in each case study are compared and exposed to the impact of technological developments changing both readers and books...|$|R

The study used the quantitative method. A questionnaire comprising of closed-ended and open ended questions was used to obtain data from Coloured high school learners from two schools. The review of literature relevant to this study involved a number of aspects of which the following are only a few: a look at national and international perspectives regarding leisure reading; the role of teachers and parents {{in the lives of}} these children; the lack of <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> among the respondents as a result of modern technologies. The study was conducted against the background of Bronfenbrenner’s ecosystemic theory which views various levels and entities as subsystems of nesting within the larger system, which is the social context. Each level is dependent on the interaction within and between the other. The family (parents), the school (teachers) form subsystems and both share the membership of the child. These two subsystems collaborate to ensure maximum development of the child. The research question arose from the observation by parents that children are not participating in <b>leisure</b> time <b>reading</b> as much as they should. The results of the study indicated that Coloured learners are involved and interested in <b>leisure</b> <b>reading</b> despite other modern technological devices competing <b>for</b> the learners’ <b>leisure</b> time.
