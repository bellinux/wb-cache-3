Dielectric property of the fiber optic provides complete electrical isolation as well as interference free signaling.

40|$|Transition {{from school}} to {{university}} life is a complex process and cannot be accomplished in a single event. There is now a move away from concentrating activities just into 2 ̆ 7 freshers 2 ̆ 7 week or week zero to what are termed more <b>longitudinal</b> <b>induction</b> programmes. Only key orientation and social engagement events are provided in week zero and the more valuable aims of a successful first year experience (FYE) are achieved by curriculum based support and spreading activities throughout the year. With the growing challenges facing such UK induction programmes from increasing student numbers, greater diversity and fewer resources we show here how one Australian system faces up to those challenges and has found possible ways forward...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} a second year induction programme developed to support student transition. The sophomore slump {{theory suggests that}} students may experience a slump in second year, resulting in poorer outcomes and increased attrition rates (Gump 2007). Students were asked {{to reflect on their}} first year experience in order to identify learning and plan for the year ahead, in order to reduce potential for a slump during second year Design: Students beginning the second year of a four year BSc Honours Nursing programme participated in a one-day induction prior to commencement of semester 1 classes. Students were assigned to groups and asked to reflect on some key questions in relation to their first year experience. Responses were collated on flip chart paper and discussed together. Findings: Emergent themes are discussed here: forward planning, engagement with the institution, and building a strong foundation. Practical implications: This process served to illustrate to staff some of the “hidden curriculum” issues and offered opportunities to focus on areas of student weakness such as referencing and academic writing. Using a combination of reflection, and experiential learning in induction may serve to transition students through the sophomore slump. Value: The challenge for academics is to continue to find ways to enhance the student experience in an increasingly diverse student population, and determine its effect on attrition rates. This paper offers a reflective commentary, exploring the authors’ learning, on the implementation of one innovative programme of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>induction...</b>|$|E
40|$|In axially-symmetric magnets for {{particle}} accelerators, {{the magnetic}} field is usually surveyed by expensive and time-consuming 3 D Hall-probe mappers. Problems arise for a coherent treatment among beam physics requirements, magnet design and manufacturing, and magnetic measurements. For example, when the longitudinal direction of the mapper is misaligned {{with respect to the}} magnet, the measured fringe fields will show spurious components. In this paper, an alternative measurement method, exploiting the inherent axial symmetry of {{the magnetic field}}, is proposed. The magnetic flux linked with a pair of sensing coils is measured {{as a function of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> position. An <b>induction</b> transducer, sensitive to the longitudinal and radial components of the magnetic field, and a measurement system have been designed and prototyped. The experimental proof-of-principle demonstration of the method in comparison with a Hall-probe mapper is presented for a solenoid magnet...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{the purpose}} of {{developing}} a novel ablation therapy for oral cancer, the heat generation behavior of a prototype Ti-coated needle with an inserted carbon steel rod was simulated in a high-frequency induction field at 350 kHz. Based on the magnetic field analysis performed at the inclination angle of θ= 0 o relative to the magnetic flux direction, both the magnetic flux density and eddy current density were the highest at the surface and in its vicinity, but drastically decreased with the depth in the inserted ferromagnetic carbon steel rod. For the simulation image at the inclination angle of θ= 90 o, the eddy current flowed on the outer Ti component which has an enlarged area perpendicular to the magnetic flux direction. The heat transfer simulation was also performed for the tissue-mimicking phantom subjected to the Ti-coated ablation needle using heat analysis software. In the heat transfer simulation images, the temperature distribution was visualized in the <b>longitudinal</b> section for <b>induction</b> times up to 1200 s. The generated heat spread in the transverse direction from the specimen into the tissue-mimicking phantom. However, no significant heat transfer was achieved to {{the underside of the}} specimen, which is situated in the longitudinal direction. These results suggest that the visualization of the heat transfer behavior is effective to obtain the optimum distance among the Ti-coated ablation needles in clinical use...|$|R
40|$|The {{generalised}} longitudinal susceptibility χ(q, ω) affords {{a sensitive}} {{measure of the}} spatial and temporal correlations of magnetic monopoles in spin ice. Starting with the monopole model, a mean field expression for χ(q, ω) is derived as well as expressions for the mean square <b>longitudinal</b> field and <b>induction</b> at a point. Monopole motion is shown to be strongly correlated, and both spatial and temporal correlations are controlled by the dimensionless monopole density x which defines {{the ratio of the}} magnetization relaxation rate and the monopole hop rate. Thermal effects and spin lattice relaxation are also considered. The derived equations are applicable in the temperature range where the Wien effect for magnetic monopoles is negligible. They are discussed in the context of existing theories of spin ice and the following experimental techniques: dc and ac-magnetization, neutron scattering, neutron spin echo, and longitudinal and transverse field μSR. The monopole theory is found to unify diverse experimental results, but several discrepancies between theory and experiment are identified. One of these, concerning the neutron scattering line shape, is explained by means of a phenomenological modification to the theory. Comment: 29 pages, 4 figures; to be published in Phil.

40|$|Evidence from {{multiple}} studies suggests that regulation of emotions {{and intensity of}} affect may be relevant to understanding disordered eating. Emotion regulation concerns {{the ways in which}} emotions are managed in daily life, whereas Affect Intensity (Larsen et al., 1986) refers to individuals‟ typical emotional reactivity. The thesis examines emotion regulation and affect in females with eating pathology (subclinical as well as clinical), and looks at ways dysfunctional regulatory strategies may be improved. The main objective of the present research was to look at the influence of experimentally-induced positive affect on the choice of emotion management strategies. Study 1 looked at typical Affect Intensity and emotion regulation in a sample of subclinically eating-disordered University of Edinburgh students. This study examined functionality of regulatory strategies, typical intensity of affect, and the effects of experimentally induced happiness and sadness on the two. Study 2 introduced the construct of creativity into the discourse on emotions and psychopathology, and looked at creative tendencies in relation to Affect Intensity, emotion regulation and psychopathology (anxiety, depression and sub-clinical eating pathology). Study 3 looked at the effects of Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs) on emotion regulation, life satisfaction, anxiety and depression in a subclinically eating-disordered group and controls. Studies 4 and 5 were carried out in order to test and extend the results of Studies 1 and 3 with a clinical sample. In Study 4, emotion regulation, Affect Intensity and the immediate post-test effect of happiness on emotion regulation and life satisfaction were examined in females clinically diagnosed with eating disorders (i. e. anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and EDNOS). Study 5 looked at how <b>longitudinal</b> happiness <b>induction</b> influenced emotion regulation, eating behaviours and life satisfaction in eating-disordered individuals. One of the main findings across the studies was that females with subclinical and clinical forms of eating pathology tended to experience negative emotions of high intensity, and used predominantly dysfunctional regulatory strategies to manage them. Another important finding was that experimentally-induced positive emotions improved emotion regulation, and encouraged participants to choose healthier affect management strategies. The studies, their implications and contribution to theory and treatment of eating disorders are discussed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transglutaminases are tissue enzymes {{involved}} in different neuronal processes including maintenance and signalling. However, their up-regulation elicited {{by a variety}} of noxae contributes to neurodegeneration. This study tested the hypothesis that experimental inflammation evoked transglutaminase up-regulation in myenteric neurons and that this event had an impact on neuronal survival. METHODS: Rats with or without trinitro-benzene-sulphonic acid-induced colitis were used. One week after colitis <b>induction,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> muscle-myenteric plexus preparations were obtained from left colon to assess tissue-transglutaminase activity, protein and mRNA expression. Double labelling immunofluorescence using antibodies to neuron-specific enolase and transglutaminase was performed to identify myenteric neurons expressing transglutaminase. Additional sets of experiments evaluated the involvement of transglutaminase in the apoptotic process of cultured myenteric neurons. RESULTS: Compared to controls, rats with colitis showed several tranglutaminase/neuron-specific enolase positive myenteric neurons. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that in rats with colitis, the increased neuronal transglutaminase-immunoreactivity was associated with an increased enzyme expression. Similarly, transglutaminase activity was significantly higher than in controls (1100 +/- 280 m U/g vs. 725 +/- 119 m U/g, p< 0. 05). In cultured myenteric neurons incubation with the specific transglutaminase inducer, retinoic acid, significantly increased neuronal apoptosis, whereas the presence of cystamine significantly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental colitis evoked transglutaminase up-regulation and increased activity in myenteric neurons. This mechanism enhances neuronal susceptibility to apoptosis and could contribute to neuropathic changes during gut inflammatio...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a century there has been debate {{concerning}} the mechanism of accommodation-whether the lens capsule or lens material itself determines the functional relationship between ciliary muscle contractility and lens deformation during refractive adaptation. This morphological study in monkey eyes investigates the composition and distribution of several connective tissue components in the accommodative apparatus relaying muscle force to lens organization. Elastin distributes on the marginal surface of the ciliary process. A zonule is composed of fibrillin produced by epithelial cells of the process. In the progress of extension over the posterior chamber, fibrils unite into strands and possess <b>longitudinal</b> plasticity. By <b>induction</b> of the elastin network, strands extend in a concentric direction covering the equatorial region of the capsule. Upon tethering to the lens, the strand ramifies into fibrils, penetrating deeply close to the epithelial layer of the lens and binding with the collagen of the intercellular spaces. Tight linkage of the zonule with the capsule transmits precise contractility. Inside the lens, the cortical layer's elastic connective tissue network forms widely spaced lamellae of crystalline fibers. In contrast, the central nuclear lamellae are tightly opposed. The accumulation of lamellae is greater in the anterior cortex than in the posterior, yielding a more variable anterior chamber depth in the visual axis. The plasticity of the zonule and connective tissue distribution inside the lens produces an adjustable configuration. Thus, tight linkage between the dynamism of the capsule with interaction of the lenticular flexibility provides a novel understanding of accommodation...|$|R
40|$|In {{solenoids}} for particle accelerators, {{the magnetic}} field is usually mapped by means of 3 D Hall-sensing systems through a burdensome and costly procedure. A further problem arises from a coherent treatment between the beam physics requirements, the qualification of numerical models, the design and manufacturing of the magnet, and the magnetic measurements. For example, when the magnet is misaligned {{with respect to the}} longitudinal direction of the mapper, the fringe field shows spurious components. A method was therefore developed for measuring {{the magnetic field}} of axisymmetric magnets by exploiting their inherent symmetry. The method yields a measurement of the magnetic flux linked with a pair of sensing coils {{as a function of the}}ir <b>longitudinal</b> position. An <b>induction</b> transducer, sensitive to the longitudinal and radial components of the solenoid under test, has been designed and constructed. A transport system moves the transducer along the magnet axis, covering the full length of the magnet and including the fringe field. The induced voltage is acquired and integrated digitally in order to yield the flux linkage as a function of the linear position, measured by a laser interferometer. The re-parametrization related to intrinsic relationship between the motion time and the linear translation position along the magnet axis relaxes the requirements on the homogeneous motion of the transport system. After a proof-of-principle demonstration, the uncertainty sources affecting the measurement system were evaluated and their influence on the result assessed. In particular, the measurement model for the translating-coils method is formulated and a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, based on Bayesian inference, is then used to dynamically estimate the distribution of the output quantity, starting from the knowledge of the distributions of all the uncertainty sources considered in the model. According to the indications of the uncertainty analysis results, a translating-coils system was prototyped and integrated in the existing CERN platform, which includes Fast Digital Integrators (FDIs), an encoder board, a motor controller, and the Flexible Framework for Magnetic Measurement (FFMM). The system was validated in a reference solenoid by pointing out more than satisfying agreement of the results. Finally, the system has been employed in challenging measurements on the field, resulting in a reliable and accurate method for the characterization of axially-symmetric magnet systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{progress}} in the HCX experimental program since the last HIF-VNL Program Advisory Committee Review (February 14 - 15 2002). On July 25 2002 the experiment was shut down for about four weeks to move the control room. A principal area of effort has been to obtain and evaluate the first experimental results carried out with a matched and well-aligned K+ ion beam transported through 10 electrostatic transport quadrupoles. These are the main results and highlights to date: (1) There is no emittance growth within {{the sensitivity of the}} diagnostics, and little beam loss. The beam centroid is aligned to within 0. 5 mm and 2 mrad of the central axis of the channel, and the envelope mismatch amplitude is < 2 mm. (2) A long-life, alumino-silicate source has replaced a contact-ionization source, eliminating depletion induced experimental uncertainties. (3) Significant differences between the experimental data and early theoretical calculations of the beam envelope propagating through the electrostatic quadrupoles were encountered. More detailed envelope models and simulations were developed and experimental parameter sensitivities were analyzed. This work has resolved most of the discrepancy and achievable limits on envelope predictability and control are being probed. (4) The experimental current density distribution, J(x,y), and phase-space data are being used to initialize high-resolution simulations to enable realistic modeling and detailed comparisons to experiment. In other areas of HCX R&D: (1) We have made {{progress in}} the development of new time-resolved phase-space diagnostics that will speed up data acquisition in this and other upcoming beam experiments in the HIF-VNL. (2) Preliminary results from a Gas, Electron Source Diagnostic (GESD) are presented, which measures gas desorption and secondary electrons. The secondary emission yield varies as cos- 1 (q), as predicted theoretically. Data from the GESD will be relevant to upcoming experiments on particle loss and electron effects in a magnetic quadrupole lattice. (3) The design of the superconducting quadrupole cryostat needed for a future phase of HCX experimentation has been refined and a vendor has been selected from a group of five that submitted bids. Construction of an optimized prototype quadrupole began this summer. (4) The design of a <b>longitudinal</b> bunch control <b>induction</b> module is near a final design review (DOE SBIR Phase II). The module will apply agile control of the acceleration waveforms to correct for space charge field effects on the head/tail of the beam...|$|R
