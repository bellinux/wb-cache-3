60|$|By nightfall {{the storm}} was at an end, and the sun set in a perfect blaze of glory. Of the gale only a stiff breeze remained, and Captain Marshall lost no time in setting his sails as before. All the loose seams had been mended and the Stormy Petrel now took in no more water than was usual with her, and is usual with {{ordinary}} <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|R

She wasn't much of a <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> when we left England, but the sun had fried all the pitch out o' her seams, and you might ha' put your finger through some of them.

Anyone with an eye for <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> can distinguish that topsail-schooner there, well ahead {{of the rest of}} the tiny fleet, skimming the water with swift grace, and immediately behind her the three-masted polacca--hm! have we not seen her in these waters before?--and the two graceful feluccas whose lateen sails look so like the outspread wings of a bird! ...|$|R
6000|$|These {{lines were}} {{published}} by Dr. Brugsch-Bey {{before he had}} heard of my discoveries of metals and of a modern turquoise-digging in the Land of Midian. He had decided that [...] "'Atháka" [...] lay {{to the east of}} Suez, chiefly from the insistence laid upon the shipping; <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> would certainly not be required for a sail of three or four hours. Moreover, as I have elsewhere shown, Jebel 'Atakáh, the [...] "Mountain of Deliverance," [...] {{at the mouth of the}} Wady Musá, was referred to the Jews at some time after the Christian era, and probably during the fourth and fifth centuries, when pilgrimages to the apocryphal Mounts Sinai became the fashion.|$|R
25|$|The Indus civilisation's economy {{appears to}} have {{depended}} significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC {{may have been the}} first civilisation to use wheeled transport. These advances may have included bullock carts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft.</b> Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what they regard as a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal in western India (Gujarat state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.|$|R

60|$|So eager was I {{to belong}} to some <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft,</b> that I would not stop even {{to look at the}} wonders of the town, before we took the {{direction}} of the wharves. Rupert was for pursuing a different policy, having an inherent love of the genteeler gaieties of a town, but I turned a deaf ear to his hints, and this time I was master. He followed me with some reluctance, but follow he did, after some remonstrances that bordered on warmth. Any inexperienced eye that had seen us passing, would have mistaken us for two well-looking, smart young sailor-boys, who had just returned from a profitable voyage, and who, well-clad, tidy and semi-genteel, were strolling along the wharves as admirateurs, not to say critics, of the craft. Admirateurs we were, certainly, or I was, at least; though knowledge was a point on which we Were sadly deficient.|$|R
60|$|But I had {{no reason}} to regret that the Highlander was not a liner; for aboard of those liners, from all I could gather from those who had sailed in them, the crew have terrible hard work, owing to their {{carrying}} such a press of sail, in order to make as rapid passages as possible, and sustain the ship's reputation for speed. Hence it is, that although they are the very best of <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft,</b> and built in the best possible manner, and with the very best materials, yet, a few years of scudding before the wind, as they do, seriously impairs their constitutions--like robust young men, who live too fast in their teens --and they are soon sold out for a song; generally to the people of Nantucket, New Bedford, and Sag Harbor, who repair and fit them out for the whaling business.|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic peninsulas {{of western}} Europe present {{intriguing}} cultural parallels that reach back into later prehistory. Furthermore, direct evidence of interconnections from the fifth millennium BC is {{revealed by the}} movement of specific materials such as Iberian variscite. Brittany and Galicia were key nodes within this potential network of maritime interaction, but debate continues as to the routes that were chosen and the navigational abilities involved. Did early seafarers keep close to the coast and did long journeys involve many intermediate landfalls? Or did crews venture direct crossings of the Bay of Biscay? In the absence of surviving evidence {{for the kinds of}} vessel likely to have been used by Neolithic seaborne navigators, modern wind and current data are here used to generate models indicating journey times for small <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> powered only by oars, following the coastal or the direct route. The results are discussed within the context of selected material flows (jadeitite, variscite, copper, Beakers) and against a background of potentially changing maritime technology...|$|R
60|$|Neb {{gave us a}} call at daylight. The {{wind was}} fresh at west-north-west, but the tide was just {{beginning}} to run on the flood. I was so impatient to be rid of my guests, that all hands were called immediately, and we got the sloop under-way. The pilot professed himself willing to beat up through the narrow passages above, and, the Wallingford's greatest performance being on the wind, I was determined to achieve my deliverance that very tide. The sloop drew more water than was usual for the up-river craft, it is true, but she was light, and, just at the moment, could go wherever the loaded Albany vessels went. Those were not the days of vast public works; and as for <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft,</b> none had ever crossed the Overslaugh, so far as had come to my knowledge. Times have changed greatly, since; but the reader will remember I am writing of that remote period in American history, the year of our Lord 1803.|$|R
60|$|The rafts {{were very}} well, and the house-boats and the traders' boats, {{but the most}} majestic feature of the riverlife was the tow of coal-barges which, going or coming, the 'Avonek' met every few miles. Whether going or coming they were pushed, not pulled, by the {{powerful}} steamer which gathered them in tens and twenties before her, and rode the mid-current with them, when they were full, or kept the slower water near shore when they were empty. They claimed the river where they passed, and the 'Avonek' bowed to an unwritten law in giving them the full right of way, from the time when their low bulk first rose in sight, with the chimneys of their steamer towering above them and her gay contours gradually making themselves seen, till she receded from the encounter, with the wheel at her stern pouring a cataract of yellow water from its blades. It was insurpassably picturesque always, and not the tapering masts or the swelling sails of any <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> could match it.|$|R
6000|$|Mary Pratt was observant, {{and of a}} mind so constituted, {{that its}} {{observations}} usually led her to safe and accurate deductions. Great was the surprise of all on the Point when it became known that Deacon Pratt had purchased and put into the water, the new <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> that was building on speculation, at Southold. Not only had he done this, but he had actually bought some half-worn copper, and had it placed on the schooner's bottom, {{as high as the}} bends, ere he had her launched. While the whole neighbourhood was [...] "exercised" [...] with conjectures on the motive which could induce the deacon to become a ship-owner in his age, Mary did not fail to impute it to some secret but powerful influence, that the sick stranger had obtained over him. He now spent nearly half his time in private communications with Daggett; and, on more than one occasion, when the niece had taken some light article of food over {{for the use of the}} last, she found him and her uncle examining one or two dirty and well-worn charts of the ocean. As she entered, the conversation invariably was changed; nor was Mrs. White ever permitted to be present at one of these secret conferences.|$|R

40|$|The {{settlers}} of the Maldives {{came from}} many lands, {{but in the}} battle for survival in difficult conditions, they melded together into one nation. In a country that is more sea than land, they learned to live in harmony with the ocean, developing a unique culture suitable to their environment. Oral traditions, evidence from archaeological sites, some available historical documents and foreign notices, serve to prove that in the past they were one of the most nautical of all the countries on the Indian Ocean rim. They learned to use the monsoon winds to their advantage during journeys to distant places. By the fourth century of the first millennium, they had navigational knowledge and <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft</b> which enabled them to undertake long voyages The Maldivians discovered the money cowrie in their islands and used it for trade with neighbouring countries. Fishing was the main economic activity and the chief exports consisted of cowries, coir rope, fish, tortoise shell and ambergris. Boat-building became an art and a skill that earned them the attention of other countries, and a craft was developed that was unique to Maldives and yet accommodated useful features from other ship-building lands. The sea-going vessels were versatile enough to be adapted to all necessary conditions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to trace the tradition of Maldivian seafaring, up to the time of the arrival of the Portuguese in the early sixteenth century. With this objective in mind, we shall be looking at information from archaeological findings, oral traditions and historical records where these exist, and also from present-day Maldivian writers.

6000|$|In the hospital, and that, too, at a {{place like}} Pensacola there was little {{opportunity}} for me to break out into my old excesses; though I found liquor, {{on one or two}} occasions, even there, and got myself into some disgrace in consequence. On the whole, however, the discipline, my situation, and my own resolution, kept me tolerably correct. It is the restraint of a ship that alone prevents sailors from dying much sooner than they do; for it is certain no man could hold out long who passed three or four months every year in the sort of indulgencies into which I myself have often run, after returning from long voyages. This is one advantage of the navy; two or three days of riotous living being all a fellow can very well get in a three years' cruise. Any man who has ever been in a vessel of war, particularly in old times, can see the effect produced by the system, and regular living of a ship. When the crew first came on board, the men were listless, almost lifeless, with recent dissipation; some suffering with the [...] "horrors," [...] perhaps; but a few weeks of regular living would bring them all round; and, {{by the end of the}} cruise, most of the people would come into port, and be paid off, with renovated constitutions. It is a little different, now, to be sure, as the men ship for general service, and commonly serve a short apprenticeship in a receiving vessel, before they are turned over to the <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft.</b> This brings them on board the last in a little better condition than used to be the case; but, even now, six months in a man-of-war is a new lease for a seaman's life.|$|R
60|$|Marble {{was not a}} man of idle vaunts. He {{soon had}} {{everybody}} at work, with a system, order, silence, and activity, that proved he was master of his profession. Nor was the language which might sound so boastful to foreign ears, altogether without its justification. Forty Americans were a formidable force; and, well directed, I make no doubt they would accomplish far more than the ordinary run of French seamen, as they were governed and managed in the year 1800, and, counting them man for man, would have accomplished in double the time. Our crew had now long acted together, and frequently under the most trying circumstances; and they showed their training, if men ever did, on the present occasion. Everybody was busy; and we had the shears up, and both masts stepped, {{in the course of a}} few hours. By the time the main-mast was in, I had the fore-mast rigged, the jib-boom in its place, the sprit-sail yard crossed--everything carried a spar under its bowsprit then--and the lower yard up. It is true, the French had got everything ready for us; and when we turned the hands to, after dinner, we actually began to strike in cargo, water, provisions, and such other things, as it was intended to carry away. At dusk, when we knocked off work, the Emily looked like a <b>sea-going</b> <b>craft,</b> and there was every prospect of our having her ready for sea, by the following evening. But, the duty had been carried on, in silence. Napoleon said there had been more noise made in the little schooner which carried him from l'Orient to Basque Roads, than was made on board the line-of-battle ship that conveyed him to St. Helena, during the whole passage. Since that memorable day, the French have learned to be silent on board ship, and the fruits remain to be seen.|$|R
