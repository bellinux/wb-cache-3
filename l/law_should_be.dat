5|$|According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the {{application}} of local custom, custom that is accepted into <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E

5|$|Real {{property}} {{law in the}} English and Welsh legal system had evolved from feudalism, and was an immensely complex system understood by {{only a small number}} of lawyers. In particular peculiarities meant that land owned by beneficiaries could be sold without the agreement of all the beneficiaries involved, something partially rectified by the Settled Land Act 1882 and the Land Transfer Act 1897. Despite these statutes reform in this area was still needed, and Lord Haldane presented reform bills to parliament in 1913, 1914 and 1915 with no real progress thanks to the opposition of the Law Society. In March 1917 a Reconstruction Subcommittee under Sir Leslie Scott was created to consider land policy after the First World War, and Schuster (who had devilled for Scott when working as a barrister in Liverpool) was appointed as a member. The subcommittee decided that the <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> changed to merge real and personal {{property law}}, and that outdated aspects of land law such as copyholds and gavelkind should be eliminated. When Birkenhead became Lord Chancellor in 1919 he inherited the problem of English property law, and immediately instructed Schuster to prepare the department for forcing a bill through Parliament on the matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} meaning theory, which {{is closely related}} to textualism, is the view that interpretation of a written constitution or <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based on what reasonable persons living {{at the time of its}} adoption would have understood the ordinary meaning of the text to be. Most originalists, such as Justice Scalia, are associated with that view.|$|E

25|$|The rationalist {{notion that}} all <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{condensed}} and comprehensively {{written in a}} code was challenged by social, economic and political mutations which imposed a need for the text to be constantly updated.

25|$|Somalis {{for centuries}} have practiced {{a form of}} {{customary}} law, which they call xeer.

It is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century. Given the dearth of loan words from foreign languages within the xeer's nomenclature, the customary law appears to have evolved in situ.|$|E

25|$|A {{corollary}} of {{the rule}} of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a barrister in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.

25|$|Welsh law usually {{applied in}} the Welsh Marches {{as well as the}} areas ruled by Welsh princes.

For example, when Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn was in dispute with Roger Mortimer about some lands, it was Gruffydd who wanted the case heard under English law and Mortimer who wanted Welsh law to apply. The matter went to the royal justices, who decided in 1281 that since the lands concerned lay in Wales, Welsh <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney-General {{submitted}} {{that there}} are two possible ways in which to interpret the word law. First, it could be taken to refer only to statutes and the common law applicable in Singapore. Secondly, it could be interpreted to include rules of customary international law.

25|$|Responsibility for {{enforcement}} of the qanuns rests both with the National Police and with a special Sharia police force unique to Aceh, known as the Wilayatul Hisbah (Sharia Authority). All of the qanuns provide for penalties including fines, imprisonment, and caning, the latter a punishment unknown {{in most parts of}} Indonesia. Between mid-2005 and early 2007, at least 135 people were caned in Aceh for transgressing the qanuns. In April 2016, a 60-year-old non-Muslim woman was sentenced to 30 lashes for selling alcohol drinks. The controversy is that qanun is not allowed for non-Muslim person, and national <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used instead as in other parts of Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since the}} kingdom was now governed under a constitution, {{it was the}} cabinet that would decide. Opinion was split {{on the right to}} {{succession}} of Prince Chula Chakrabongse. A key figure was Pridi Phanomyong, who persuaded the cabinet that the <b>Law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as excluding the prince from succession, and that Prince Ananda Mahidol should be the next king. It also appeared more convenient for the government to have a monarch who was only nine years old and studying in Switzerland. On 2 March 1935, Prince Ananda Mahidol was elected by the National Assembly and the Thai government to succeed his uncle, King Prajadhipok, as the eighth king of the Chakri Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Émile Durkheim {{wrote in}} The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, {{the body of}} civil law {{concerned}} primarily with restitution and compensation grows {{at the expense of}} criminal laws and penal sanctions. Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies {{in which there is a}} high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities. For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of <b>law</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.|$|E
