50|$|A <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a device}} that allows the front brakes to lock {{independently}} of the rear brakes via a switch. The device is an electric solenoid that controls a valve which allows the brakes to be controlled individually, this allows the front brakes to be locked and the rear brakes to be open. This allows the driver to spin the rear wheels without wasting the rear brakes. This method {{is referred to as}} <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> and is popular among enthusiasts who like to do burnouts frequently.|$|E

5000|$|Drag {{racing is}} a {{motorsport}} often run using cars with manual transmissions. Manual transmissions allow drivers {{to control the}} amount of power transferred from the engine to the wheels by manipulating both clutch and throttle inputs, allowing vehicles to accelerate quickly without losing traction. However, launching a vehicle requires simultaneous gas pedal and clutch pedal inputs, preventing drivers from manipulating the brakes with their feet. Without brake input, drivers staging their vehicle at the starting line would roll if the clutch was slightly engaged. If the driver's vehicle rolled across the staging line {{before the start of}} a drag race, driver would [...] "red light" [...] and would disqualify them from that race nullifying the results or being declared DNF ("Did Not Finish"). The <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> prevents vehicles from rolling by allowing the driver to control the clutch and accelerator using foot input and braking with the hand. In an automatic transmission vehicle, a <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> allows the engine to rev up to its peak power RPM and launch aggressively from the starting line.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, line locks can be {{installed}} on the rear brake lines. When the <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> is activated, fluid pressure {{is prevented from being}} transferred to the rear, allowing the rear wheels to spin freely while the front brakes can be controlled with the brake pedal. This allows one to creep at varying speeds while maintaining a burnout. Achieving such a burnout requires manipulation of both throttle and brake inputs. The burnout is initiated by manipulating the clutch with the left foot and both the brake and gas pedal with the right foot. The brakes must be held while revving up the engine, then the clutch is released while continuing to hold the brakes. Once the rear tires start spinning, the left foot is used to control the brakes while the right foot continues to control the throttle.The only advantage for such a setup is the ability to maintain a burnout at relatively low wheel low speeds, which reduces wear on the rear tires. This method can be used to increase tire temperature to provide better traction prior to a drag run, but it is also often used purely for show, such as in drifting exhibitions or simply for the personal enjoyment of the driver.Many modern sport-oriented cars now offer optional line locks for drag and show purposes, such as the so-called [...] "burnout mode" [...] found on the 2015 Ford Mustang.|$|E
50|$|Although less common, rolling burnouts can be {{achieved}} with modified <b>line</b> <b>locks</b> by proportionally increasing the front brake pressure and the throttle to keep the car at a steady speed. This makes the rear tires slip and spin faster than the front tires and burnout.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{construction}} of a narrow frequency-band laser with optical feedback. We use a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser diode centered at the cesium D₂ transition wavelength, [gamma] = 852 nm. The linewidth of this diode is reduced by several orders of magnitude by means of optical feedback from an external cavity. The system is further stabilized by locking the path length between diode and cavity to optimize coupling between them. The absolute frequency of our laser is fixed by means of a delay <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> system that uses the beat note between our laser and a fixed reference laser to set our laser's frequency. We present both the theory behind these systems and data from our own setup. We then finally discuss potential uses of the narrow laser in atomic physics experiments, including detection of a single atom in an optical cavity. by Michael J. Childress. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|In the DIAL technique, {{the water}} vapor {{concentration}} profile {{is determined by}} analyzing the lidar backscatter signals for laser wavelengths tuned 'on' and 'off' a water vapor absorption line. Desired characteristics of the on-line transmitted laser beam include: pulse energy {{greater than or equal}} to 100 mJ, high-resolution tuning capability (uncertainty less than 0. 25 pm), good spectral stability (jitter less than 0. 5 pm about the mean), and high spectral purity (greater than 99 percent). The off-line laser is generally detuned less than 100 pm away from the water vapor line. Its spectral requirements are much less stringent. In our past research, we developed and demonstrated the airborne DIAL technique for water vapor measurements in the 720 -nm spectral region using a system based on an alexandrite laser as the transmitter for the on-line wavelength and a Nd:YAG laser-pumped dye laser for the off-line wavelength. This off-line laser has been replaced by a second alexandrite laser. Diode lasers are used to injection seed both lasers for frequency and linewidth control. This eliminates the need for the two intracavity etalons utilized in our previous alexandrite laser and thereby greatly reduces the risk of optical damage. Consequently, the transmitted pulse energy can be substantially increased, resulting in greater measurement range, higher data density, and increased measurement precision. In this paper, we describe the diode injection seed source, the two alexandrite lasers, and the device used to <b>line</b> <b>lock</b> the on-line seed source to the water vapor absorption feature...|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} taken WHT {{optical spectrum}} of the BAL QSO Q 13031308 shows interesting changes in the spectral characteristics of the absorption systems. In particular, the equivalent widths {{of many of the}} broad absorption lines have markedly increased with respect to observations taken 15 yr earlier by Foltz et al., with the more blueshifted components showing the greatest increase by a factor of < 5 in optical depth. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the data is that, in the rest frame of the quasar, the line-of-sight outflow velocity of the clouds has only increased by < 55 km s 21 in a rest-frame time interval of 5 ± 6 yr. Various examples of doublet <b>line</b> <b>locking</b> are still visible in the system, and we present a provisional model analysis of the spectrum showing that theories based on small cloud velocity interactions via <b>line</b> <b>locking</b> can successfully explain the general appearance of the spectrum and its variability.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to make rear-wheel drive burnouts easier by installing [...] "line locks", devices which allow fluid pressure on the front brakes to be maintained while releasing the pedal to free the rear brakes.

40|$|We present Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer {{spectra of}} the quasar RX J 1230. 8 + 0115 (V 14 : 4; z 0 : 117). In {{addition}} to Galactic, Virgo, and intervening absorption, this quasar is host to a remarkable intrinsic absorption complex. Four narrow absorption line systems, strong in C iv, Nv, and O vi, lie within 5000 km s 1 of the QSO redshift. Three {{of the systems}} appear to be <b>line</b> <b>locked,</b> two in N v and two in O vi, with the common system residing in between the other two (in velocity). All three systems show signs of an intrinsic origin—smooth windlike profiles, high ionization, and partial coverage of the central engine. The fourth system, which appears at the systemic redshift of the QSO, may originate from host galaxy or intervening gas. Photoionization analyses imply column densities in the range 19 : 1 < log NðHÞ < 21 and ionization parameters in the range 1 : 3 < log U < 0 : 3.

40|$|We {{present a}} new general scheme for calculating the {{structure}} and dynamics of radiation pressure driven, photoionized flows. The new method goes one step beyond the Sobolev approximation. It involves a numerical solution of the radiative transfer in absorption lines including the effects of differential expansion and line interactions such as <b>line</b> <b>locking</b> and blanketing. We also present a new scheme for calculating the radiation pressure due to trapped line photons in finite, differentially expanding flows. We compare our results for the radiation pressure force with those obtained using the Sobolev approximation and show {{the limitations of the}} latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the Sobolev method gives a poor approximation near discontinuity surfaces and its neglect of line blanketing can lead to erroneous results in high velocity flows. We combine the newly calculated radiation pressure force with self-consistent photoionization and thermal calculations to study the dynamics and spectral features of broad absorption line flows and highly ionized gas flows in AGN. A comparison with Sobolev-type calculations shows that the latter over estimates the flow's terminal velocity and, conversely, under estimates its opacity. We also show that <b>line</b> <b>locking</b> on broad emission lines can {{have a significant effect on}} the dynamics and spectral features of AGN flows.
