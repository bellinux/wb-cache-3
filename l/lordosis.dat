25|$|Promotes sexual {{receptivity}} in estrus, and induces <b>lordosis</b> behavior. In non-human mammals, it also induces estrus (in heat) {{prior to}} ovulation, which also induces <b>lordosis</b> behavior. Female non-human mammals are not sexually receptive without the estrogen surge, i.e., {{they have no}} mating desire when not in estrus.|$|E
25|$|Regulates {{the stereotypical}} sexual {{receptivity}} behavior; this <b>lordosis</b> behavior is estrogen-dependent, which is {{regulated by the}} ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, a male rat {{castrated}} {{just after}} birth will be feminized, and the adult will show female sexual behavior {{in response to}} estrogen (sexual receptivity, <b>lordosis</b> behavior).|$|E
25|$|Nearly all mammals display sex-dimorphic {{reproductive}} {{and sexual}} behavior (e.g., <b>lordosis</b> and mounting in rodents). Much research {{has made it}} clear that prenatal and early postnatal androgens play a role in the differentiation of most mammalian brains. Experimental manipulation of androgen levels in utero or shortly after birth can alter adult reproductive behavior.|$|E
25|$|When {{scoliosis}} is suspected, weight-bearing full-spine AP/coronal (front-back view) and lateral/sagittal (side view) X-rays {{are usually}} taken {{to assess the}} scoliosis curves and the kyphosis and <b>lordosis,</b> as these can also be affected in individuals with scoliosis. Full-length standing spine X-rays are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at three- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, MRI investigation is warranted {{to look at the}} spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiplash}} injury from {{an automobile}} accident is called a cervical acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver {{studies have shown that}} as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a kyphosis while the upper cervical spine maintains its <b>lordosis.</b> As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.|$|E
25|$|A female Asian golden cat at the Washington Park Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo) {{showed a}} {{dramatic}} increase in the frequency of scent marking during estrus. At the same time, she often rubbed her neck and head on inanimate objects. She also repeatedly approached the male in the cage, rubbed on him, and adopted a receptive posture (<b>lordosis)</b> in front of him. The male's rate of scent marking increased during this time, as did his frequency of approaching and following the female. The male's mounting behavior included a nape bite, but in contrast to other small felids, the bite was not sustained.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid is {{a common}} enzymatic {{cofactor}} in mammals used in the synthesis of collagen. Ascorbate is a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Freshwater teleost fishes also require vitamin C in their diet or they will get scurvy. The most widely recognized symptoms of vitamin C deficiency in fishes are scoliosis, <b>lordosis</b> and dark skin coloration. Freshwater salmonids also show impaired collagen formation, internal/fin hemorrhage, spinal curvature and increased mortality. If these fishes are housed in seawater with algae and phytoplankton, vitamin supplementation seems to be less important.|$|E
25|$|Hatshepsut had the {{expedition}} commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, {{which is also}} famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Ati. The Puntite Queen is portrayed as relatively tall and her physique was generously proportioned, with large breasts and rolls of fat on her body. Due to the fat deposits on her buttocks, it has sometimes been argued {{that she may have}} had steatopygia. However, according to the pathologist Marc Armand Ruffer, the main characteristic of a steatopygous woman is a disproportion in size between the buttocks and thighs, which was not the case with Ati. She instead appears to have been generally obese, a condition that was exaggerated by excessive <b>lordosis</b> or curvature of the lower spine. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.|$|E
500|$|Averaging [...] in height, Saddlebreds {{are known}} for their sense of {{presence}} and style, as well as for their spirited, yet gentle, temperament. They may be of any color, including pinto patterns, which have been acknowledged in the breed since the late 1800s. They are considered a gaited breed, as some Saddlebreds are bred and trained to perform [...] four-beat ambling gaits, one being a [...] "slow gait" [...] that historically was one of three possible ambling patterns, and the much faster rack. The breed does have a hereditary predisposition to <b>lordosis,</b> a curvature of the spine, as well as occupational predispositions to upper respiratory and lameness issues.|$|E
500|$|<b>Lordosis,</b> {{also known}} as swayback, low back or soft back, {{has been found to}} have a {{hereditary}} basis in Saddlebreds and a recessive mode of inheritance. The precise mutation has not yet been located, but researchers believe it to be somewhere on horse chromosome 20. Researching this condition may help more than just the Saddlebred breed as it may [...] "serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species." [...] Due to the head position common in the show ring, Saddlebreds can have impairments to the upper respiratory system, while the shoeing and movement required of the horses can cause leg and hoof injuries and increased lameness. [...] A swayback is penalized as a fault at shows, in addition to other conformation flaws.|$|E

2500|$|Neurons of the PAG {{are excited}} by endorphins and by opiate analgesics. [...] It {{also plays a}} role in female copulatory {{behavior}} (see <b>Lordosis</b> behavior) via a pathway from the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.|$|E
2500|$|An EDF (elongation, derotation, flexion) cast is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of Infantile Idiopathic scoliosis. [...] This method of treatment for correction was developed by UK scoliosis specialist Min Mehta. [...] Scoliosis is a 3-dimensional problem that needs to be corrected on all 3 planes. The EDF casting method has the ability to elongate the spine through traction, derotate the spine/pelvis, and to improve <b>lordosis</b> and overall body shape and alignment.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two primary}} flaws in back conformation, a [...] "too-straight" [...] or [...] "roach" [...] back and its opposite, a too low or [...] "swayback" [...] (<b>lordosis).</b> [...] Horses {{may also have}} [...] "well-sprung" [...] ribs or be too narrow, called [...] "slab-sided." [...] A horse may also have very high bony withers, which is not {{generally}} a flaw, though {{they can make a}} saddle hard to fit. [...] Too low withers, called [...] "mutton withers," [...] can make it difficult to keep a saddle on without rolling or slipping, and may be correlated to a shorter stride.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{with the}} chronic, {{congenital}} form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations {{depending on the}} degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: aesthenic (very thin or [...] "lanky") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA. [...] Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract, retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar <b>lordosis,</b> visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma, rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury.|$|E
2500|$|SPS {{was first}} {{described}} by Moersch and Woltman in 1956. Their {{description of the}} disease was based on 14 cases that they had observed over 32 years. Using electromyography, they noted that motor-unit firing suggested that voluntary muscle contractions were occurring in their patients. Previously, cases of SPS had been dismissed as psychogenic problems. Moersch and Woltman initially called the condition [...] "stiff-man syndrome", but the first female patient was confirmed in 1958 and a young boy was confirmed to have it in 1960. Clinical diagnostic criteria were developed by Gordon et al. in 1967. They observed [...] "persistent tonic contraction reflected in constant firing, even at rest" [...] after providing patients with muscle relaxants and examining them with electromyography. In 1989, criteria for an SPS diagnosis were adopted that included episodic axial stiffness, progression of stiffness, <b>lordosis,</b> and triggered spasms. The name of the disease was shifted from [...] "stiff-man syndrome" [...] to the gender-neutral [...] "stiff-person syndrome" [...] in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Scoliosis {{may be a}} {{byproduct}} of strong selection for bipedalism. For a bipedal stance, a highly mobile, elongated lower spine is very beneficial. For instance, the human spine takes on an S-shaped curve with lumbar <b>lordosis,</b> which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk. Selection for bipedality was likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder. Bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged {{for a variety of}} different reasons, many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages. It may increase viewing distance, which can be beneficial in hunting and foraging as well as protection from predators or other humans; it makes long distance travel more efficient for foraging or hunting; and it facilitates terrestrial feeding from grasses, trees, and bushes. Given the many benefits of bipedality which depends on a particularly formed spine, it is likely that selection for bipedalism played a large {{role in the development of}} the spine as we see it today, in spite of the potential for [...] "scoliotic deviations". According to the fossil record, scoliosis may have been more prevalent among earlier hominids such as Australopithecus and Homo erectus, when bipedality was first emerging. Their fossils indicate that there may have been selection over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today, favoring a spine that could efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of scoliosis.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the span}} of the back dips {{excessively}} in the center, a condition known as <b>lordosis,</b> it is called swaybacked (other names include saddle-backed, hollow-backed, low in the back, [...] "soft" [...] in the back, or down in the back). [...] It is a common back condition, particularly in older horses, and in general an undesirable conformation trait. [...] Swayback is caused in part from a loss of muscle tone in both the back and abdominal muscles, plus a weakening and stretching of the ligaments. As in humans, it {{may be influenced by}} bearing young; it is sometimes seen in a broodmare that has had multiple foals. [...] However, it is common in older horses whose age leads to loss of muscle tone and stretched ligaments. It also occurs due to overuse or injury to the muscles and ligaments from excess work or loads, or from premature work placed upon an immature animal. [...] Less often, a long-backed horse that in poor condition may develop a sway at a younger age simply due to lack of exercise, particularly if kept in a stall or small pen for long periods without turnout. Equines with too long a back are more prone to the condition than those with a short back, but as a longer back is also linked to smoother gaits, the trait is sometimes encouraged by selective breeding. [...] It has been found to have a hereditary basis in the American Saddlebred breed, transmitted via a recessive mode of inheritance. Research into the genetics underlying the condition has several values beyond just the Saddlebred breed as it may [...] "serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of regulation of this estrogen-dependent <b>lordosis</b> reflex {{have been identified}} through different types of experiments. When the VMN is lesioned <b>lordosis</b> is abolished; this suggests {{the importance of this}} cerebral structure in the regulation of <b>lordosis.</b> Concerning hormones, displays of <b>lordosis</b> can be affected by avariectomy, injections of estradiol benzoate and progesterone, or exposure to stress during puberty. Specifically, stress can suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and therefore decrease concentrations of gonadal hormones. Consequently, these reductions in exposure to gonadal hormones around puberty can result in decreases in sexual behavior in adulthood, including displays of <b>lordosis.</b> <b>Lordosis</b> can also be elicited by human manual cutaneous stimulation of the flanks followed by the rump-tail base-perineum region; this allows the researcher to evaluate the effects of his experiments with a simple palpation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lordosis</b> behavior, {{also known}} as {{mammalian}} <b>lordosis</b> (Greek <b>lordōsis,</b> from lordos [...] "bent backward") or presenting, is the naturally occurring body posture for sexual receptivity to copulation present in most mammals including rodents, elephants, and felines. The primary characteristics of the behavior are a lowering of the forelimbs but with the rear limbs extended and hips raised, ventral arching of the spine and a raising, or sideward displacement, of the tail. During <b>lordosis,</b> the spine curves dorsoventrally so that its apex points towards the abdomen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lordosis</b> as {{an exaggerated}} lordotic (convex) {{curvature}} of the lumbar region, is known as lumbar hyperlordosis and also as [...] "swayback". Temporary <b>lordosis</b> is common during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Caufriez 2007 {{reported}} {{effects of}} 10 weeks hypopressive training on posture. The results included reduced lumbar <b>lordosis</b> and cervical <b>lordosis,</b> decreased kyphosis. Subjective improvements {{were reported by}} the subjects regarding postural comfort.|$|E
50|$|Measurement and {{diagnosis}} of lumbar hyperlordosis can be difficult. Obliteration of vertebral end-plate landmarks by interbody fusion {{may make the}} traditional measurement of segmental lumbar <b>lordosis</b> more difficult. Because the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels are most commonly involved in fusion procedures, or arthrodesis, and contribute to normal lumbar <b>lordosis,</b> {{it is helpful to}} identify a reproducible and accurate means of measuring segmental <b>lordosis</b> at these levels.|$|E
50|$|More precisely, the <b>lordosis</b> sexual reflex {{is mainly}} {{hardwired}} in the spinal cord, {{at the level}} of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae (L1, L2, L5, L6 and S1). In the brain, several regions modulate the <b>lordosis</b> reflex. The vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum, via the vestibular tract, send information which makes it possible to coordinate the <b>lordosis</b> reflex with postural balance. More importantly, the ventromedial hypothalamus sends projections that inhibit the reflex at the spinal level. For this reason, in general, the <b>lordosis</b> reflex is not functional. Sex hormones control reproduction and coordinate sexual activity with the physiological state. Schematically, at the breeding season, and when an ovum is available, hormones (especially estrogen) simultaneously induce ovulation and estrus (heat). Under the action of estrogen in the hypothalamus, the <b>lordosis</b> reflex is uninhibited. The female is ready for copulation and fertilization.|$|E
5000|$|Promotes sexual {{receptivity}} in estrus, and induces <b>lordosis</b> behavior. In non-human mammals, it also induces estrus (in heat) {{prior to}} ovulation, which also induces <b>lordosis</b> behavior.

5000|$|The term <b>lordosis</b> {{refers to}} the normal inward lordotic {{curvature}} of the lumbar and cervical regions of the human spine. [...] The normal outward (convex) curvature in the thoracic and sacral regions is termed kyphosis or kyphotic. The term comes from the Greek <b>lordōsis,</b> from lordos [...] "bent backward" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lordosis</b> is {{a reflex}} action that causes many non-primate female mammals {{to adopt a}} body {{position}} that is often crucial to reproductive behavior. The posture moves the pelvic tilt in an anterior direction, with the posterior pelvis rising up, the bottom angling backward and the front angling downward. <b>Lordosis</b> aids in copulation as it elevates the hips, thereby facilitating penetration by the penis. It is commonly seen in female mammals during estrus (being [...] "in heat"). <b>Lordosis</b> occurs during copulation itself and in some species, like cat, during pre-copulatory behavior.|$|E
