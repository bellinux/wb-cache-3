6000|$|Frank {{approached}} the door cautiously and stopped {{when he reached}} it. The dog crouched {{near the center of}} the kitchen floor, with a woman's straw hat in front of him from which there trailed a couple of chewed-up feathers. He looked up at Frank with a <b>low,</b> <b>warning</b> growl which said very plainly, [...] "Come no farther!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I was [...] "It" [...] {{the last}} time Broken-Tooth tried this. He had gained {{the end of the}} branch and begun his teetering, and I was {{creeping}} out after him, when suddenly there came a <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> cry from Lop-Ear. I looked down and saw him in the main fork of the tree crouching close against the trunk. Instinctively I crouched down upon the thick limb. Broken-Tooth stopped teetering, but the branch would not stop, and his body continued bobbing up and down with the rustling leaves.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Henry, {{who was now}} {{travelling}} behind the sled, emitted a <b>low,</b> <b>warning</b> whistle. Bill turned and looked, then quietly stopped the dogs. To the rear, from around the last bend and plainly into view, on the very trail they had just covered, trotted a furry, slinking form. Its nose was to the trail, and it trotted with a peculiar, sliding, effortless gait. When they halted, it halted, throwing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that twitched as it caught and studied the scent of them.|$|E

60|$|But here, in {{this open}} glade where Tantor flapped his giant ears and swayed his huge bulk {{from side to}} side, the ape-man must pass along {{the surface of the}} ground--a pygmy amongst giants. A great bull raised his trunk to rattle a <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> as he sensed the coming of an intruder. His weak eyes roved hither and thither but it was his keen scent and acute hearing which first located the ape-man. The herd moved restlessly, {{prepared}} for fight, for the old bull had caught the scent of man.|$|E
60|$|One day as {{they were}} moving slowly along beside a river they came {{unexpectedly}} upon a native village. Some children were playing beside the water. The boy's heart leaped within his breast at sight of them--for over a month he had seen no human being. What if these were naked savages? What if their skins were black? Were they not creatures fashioned in the mold of their Maker, as was he? They were his brothers and sisters! He started toward them. With a <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> Akut laid a hand upon his arm to hold him back. The boy shook himself free, and with a shout of greeting ran forward toward the ebon players.|$|E
60|$|The future {{sometimes}} seems to sob a <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> {{of the events}} it is bringing us, like some gathering though yet remote storm, which, in tones of the wind, in flushings of the firmament, in clouds strangely torn, announces a blast strong to strew the sea with wrecks; or commissioned to bring in fog the yellow taint of pestilence covering white Western isles with the poisoned exhalations of the East, dimming the lattices of English homes with the breath of Indian plague. At other times this future bursts suddenly, as if a rock had rent, and in it a grave had opened, whence issues the body of one that slept. Ere you are aware you stand {{face to face with}} a shrouded and unthought-of calamity--a new Lazarus.|$|E

5|$|On August11, the Jamaica Red Cross {{opened its}} Emergency Operations Center in {{preparation}} for Hurricane Charley and placed the warning level at one, the <b>lowest</b> <b>warning</b> level. Residents throughout the country stocked up on emergency supplies and non-perishable food, noted {{by an increase in}} sales at shops. In Saint James Parish, emergency officials activated all necessary agencies by August11. Late on August11, emergency officials quickly opened 50 shelters in the parish. In Saint Elizabeth Parish, 100 residents sought refuge in the six shelters opened throughout the parish. A total of $1.5million (JMD; US$17,000) was allocated by the Ministry of Local Government for repairs after the storm. The Jamaica Red Cross alerted local branches to be prepared as Charley approached.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he started}} as a faint rhythmic {{throbbing}} came out of it. It suggested marching feet, and grew louder while he listened, until he heard the men stumbling among the sleepers of the tram‐line. Maccario said something, and the Sin Verguenza moved in nearer the building by little paths among the cane, while when they stopped again Appleby found himself {{on the verge of}} the tram‐line with the outer wall of the hacienda close in front of him. A few shadowy objects that stumbled among the sleepers were growing into visibility a little farther along the line. They stopped and stood still a moment when a hoarse shout rose from the building, and then moved on again when somebody flung them a <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> from amidst the cane. Then they stopped close in front of the gate of the patio, and Appleby felt a little quiver run through him as he heard the question of the sentry.|$|E
60|$|Godfrey and Luka {{had brought}} with them some fox-skins and sat wrapped up in them, {{but in spite of}} that they felt the cold as they waited hour after hour. Godfrey dozed off several times, and at last slept for three or four hours. He was awakened by a touch from Luka, and a <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> to keep silence. The morning was {{breaking}}. He found that the Ostjaks had built a sort of shelter of bushes, which had the effect of breaking the force of the north wind and of hiding them from the water-fowl. Raising his head cautiously he saw before him a sheet of shallow water; this was absolutely covered with geese, a few swans being seen here and there. Luka had warned him not to fire until the Ostjaks had shot all their arrows, as the sound of his gun would at once scare the whole flock. The edge of the water was about forty yards away. The Ostjaks and Luka had both made holes through the bushes in front of them so as to be able to shoot without exposing their heads. Moving gently Godfrey found a spot where he could see through the boughs. The natives were just ready to shoot. There were three swans close {{to the edge of the}} water, and the bows twanged almost together.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Denton's friends {{called upon}} her, {{and most of}} them invited her to their houses. A few were politicians, {{senators}} or ministers. Others were bankers, heads of business houses, literary men and women. There were also a few quiet folk with names that were historical. They all thought that war between France and England would be a world disaster, but were not very hopeful of averting it. She learnt that Carleton was in Berlin trying to secure possession of a well-known German daily that happened at the moment to be in low water. He was working for an alliance between Germany and England. In France, the Royalists had come to an understanding with the Clericals, and both were evidently making ready to throw in their lot with the war-mongers, hoping that out of the troubled waters the fish would come their way. Of course everything depended on the people. If the people only knew it! But they didn't. They stood about in puzzled flocks, like sheep, wondering which way the newspaper dog was going to hound them. They took her to the great music halls. Every allusion to war was greeted with rapturous applause. The Marseillaise was demanded and encored till the orchestra rebelled from sheer exhaustion. Joan's patience was sorely tested. She had to listen with impassive face to coarse jests and brutal gibes directed against England and everything English; to sit unmoved while the vast audience rocked with laughter at senseless caricatures of supposed English soldiers whose knees always gave way {{at the sight of a}} French uniform. Even in the eyes of her courteous hosts, Joan's quick glance would occasionally detect a curious glint. The fools! Had they never heard of Waterloo and Trafalgar? Even if their memories might be excused for forgetting Crecy and Poictiers and the campaigns of Marlborough. One evening--it had been a particularly trying one for Joan--there stepped upon the stage a wooden-looking man in a kilt with bagpipes under his arm. How he had got himself into the programme Joan could not understand. Managerial watchfulness must have gone to sleep for once. He played Scotch melodies, and the Parisians liked them, and when he had finished they called him back. Joan and her friends occupied a box close to the stage. The wooden-looking Scot glanced up at her, and their eyes met. And as the applause died down there rose the first <b>low</b> <b>warning</b> strains of the Pibroch. Joan sat up in her chair and her lips parted. The savage music quickened. It shrilled and skrealed. The blood came surging through her veins.|$|E
