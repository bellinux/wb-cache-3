5|$|General Admirals {{armament}} {{was made}} and installed in Russia. Her battery deck carried thirty-six 60-pounder muzzle-loading guns and four long 36-pounder chase guns. The upper deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her upper deck to the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> and two long 36-pounders moved from the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> to the upper deck.|$|E

5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} basic design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E
5|$|The {{lift bridge}} {{is the last}} of several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden swing bridge was built in 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E

5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the <b>lower</b> <b>deck.</b> However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo control position in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Slade, the Surveyor of the Navy {{and former}} Master Shipwright at Deptford Dockyard, was the {{designer}} of the Venus-class of 36-gun frigates. Alongside their smaller cousin, the 32-gun Southampton class, the Venus-class represented an experiment in ship design; fast, medium-sized and heavily-armed, capable of overhauling smaller craft and single-handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers. As a further innovation, Slade borrowed from contemporary French ship design by removing the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> gun ports and locating the ship's cannons solely on the upper deck. This permitted the carrying of heavier ordinance without the substantial increase in hull size {{that would have been}} required to keep the lower gun ports consistently above the waterline. The <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> carried additional stores, enabling Venus-class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E

5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} bascule bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the <b>lower</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} rapid transit along the Bloor–Danforth line's route {{was made in}} a 1910 report that was prepared by an American firm of transit consultants. This study had been commissioned by a special commission, which included City Controller Horatio Clarence Hocken and Mayor of Toronto Joseph Oliver. In their final report, the consultants suggested that the Prince Edward Viaduct, which spans the Don River Valley, should include a <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> for a future subway. The <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> was built, but the first plan for a line to use it was not made until June 15, 1933, when the TTC published a report which suggested construction of a subway and an expressway broadly following Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. The estimated cost {{of the project was}} $120 million, but the plan was not implemented. Plans for a somewhat longer route, running east to west from Victoria Park Avenue to the Humber River, were proposed by the Toronto Planning Board in December 1943, although the report did not include costings. During the fall of 1911, the City of Toronto put out a tender for the construction of concrete tubes to carry a subway. However, when the cost of the subway was put to a referendum, the construction of the subway tunnels was rejected.|$|E
5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Drake class {{consisted of}} two breech-loading (BL) 9.2-inch (234mm) Mk X guns in single turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her secondary armament of sixteen BL 6-inch (152mm) Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> and were only usable in calm weather. A dozen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder (76mm) 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Two additional 12-pounder 8-cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore. The ships also carried three 3-pounder (47mm) Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450mm) torpedo tubes.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} [...] "safety deck" [...] between C and D decks for lifeboats {{and marine}} evacuation systems, with the boat deck housing {{replicas of the}} original lifeboats. Space for the deck was made by <b>lowering</b> <b>decks</b> D and below by 2.8 metres, and for the taller centre section of the safety deck, which would have housed the lifeboats, by raising the superstructure by 1.3 metres. In spite of the reduced draft, space was made for the <b>lowered</b> <b>decks</b> by removing the orlop deck, which mainly housed the boilers.|$|R

5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F.

The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the June 1942 Battle of Midway, the IJN ordered the ship's unfinished hull converted into an aircraft carrier. Her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time, with structural work complete {{up to the}} <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> and most of her machinery installed. The main deck, lower side armor, and upper side armor around the ship's magazines had been completely installed, and the forward barbettes for the main guns were also nearly finished. The navy decided that Shinano would become a heavily armored support carrier—carrying reserve aircraft, fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers—rather than a fleet carrier.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> of the Bay Bridge, {{but the system}} was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|To assist its weapon {{systems in}} hitting their target, Furious was {{completed}} with one fire-control system for each side, with separate directors for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally {{controlled by a}} Dreyer Fire-Control Table on the <b>lower</b> <b>deck</b> while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors. The existing fire-control directors were removed when Furious received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the pom-poms, were mounted {{on top of the}} new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over {{the course of the war}} Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a Type 290 air-search radar.|$|E
