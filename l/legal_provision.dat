40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} planned damages actions for {{breaches}} of EC antitrust law {{in order to}} assess their impact on consumer welfare. It first examines the current legal situation and concurs that the European Union needs to regulate damages actions for breaches of EC antitrust law so that a higher number of consumers could be compensated for their losses. This paper then discusses the main <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> proposed by the Commission in the Green and in the White paper on damages actions for breaches of EC antitrust law. The analysis of these proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> is done using arguments specific to the economic analysis of law. It is demonstrated that most of these proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> will enhance consumer welfare but that there are also proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> which will damage consumer welfare. The paper concludes that the planned damages actions for breaches of the EC law will be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, the Commission should amend some of the proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> in order to help consumers further...|$|R

Under {{the direction of}} Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination.

Between 1868 and 1907, there were approximately 4.7million deaths from smallpox.|$|E

The borough is {{home to one of}} the oldest Mesoamerican sites in the valley, Cuicuilco, as well as several major parks and ecological reserves.

25|$|The West Cornwall Railway {{had been}} opened as a {{standard}} gauge line {{but there was a}} <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> that enabled the Cornwall Railway to demand that they install broad gauge rails. Since this was obviously conducive to more efficient operation, the Cornwall company activated the requirement in 1864. The West Cornwall company was in the same severe financial difficulty as the Cornwall Railway, and had to surrender its line to the Associated Companies, who themselves installed the broad gauge rails. The takeover took effect from 1 July 1865, and broad gauge goods trains started running on 6 November 1866, with passenger trains from 1 March 1867. This significantly improved operations, and with through passenger trains running from Penzance to London, the subordinate status of the Falmouth line was emphasised: it was now simply a branch line, thought of recapturing the packet traffic having long since been forgotten.|$|E

500|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{claims in}} Florida, some already considered by Crittenden {{during his first}} term as attorney general, continued during his second term. Specifically, some of the claimants objected to a <b>legal</b> <b>provision,</b> passed by Congress years after the Adams–Onís Treaty, that allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse to pay claims awarded by Florida courts that he found not to be [...] "just and equitable". The claimants contended that this allowed an executive officer to overrule a judicial decision {{in violation of the}} doctrine of separation of powers. Crittenden held that the secretary's ruling was just as much a judicial action as that of the Florida judges. Further, he reiterated his 1841 decision that no interest could be paid on claims arising from damages resulting from Jackson's invasion. Despite this opinion, a Florida judge awarded interest to one of the claimants, and the government appealed the case to the Supreme Court, with Crittenden serving as the government's counsel. The Court upheld Crittenden's entire opinion in its ruling.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} covered {{extensively}} by the country's newspapers. In The Straits Times of Singapore, lawyers who were interviewed said anime fans {{would not have}} a strong defence against Odex if proof of uploading or downloading of unauthorised videos was presented. In his analysis, Thomas Koshy—a legal academic writing in Today—questioned the legality of Odex's threatening criminal prosecution of downloaders. Koshy maintained that only the Attorney-General had the power to prosecute {{and that there was no}} indication that he had authorised Odex to conduct prosecutions on his behalf. Moreover, Koshy opined that it was improper for Odex to have combined its demand for compensation with a threat of criminal prosecution; although Odex's letters alleged [...] "illegal downloading activity", the company threatened punishment associated with the more serious offence of distributing materials which infringed copyrights. Koshy noted that Odex had cited a <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> intended to regulate people's file sharing for monetary gain rather than downloading by a casual consumer. Burton Ong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, suggested that an anime fan who downloaded a few episodes may have been able to rely on [...] "fair dealing" [...] as a defence against the charge of copyright infringement. One of the criteria for pursuing this line of defence would have been proving that the download subsequently boosted, rather than undermined, the commercial viability of the anime industry.|$|E

The two fines are apparently a compromise so that the murderer is both punished and forgiven. However, it is at least dubious {{whether or not this is}} a valid historical account, given the lateness of the story (originating hundreds of years after Patrick's time).|$|E
