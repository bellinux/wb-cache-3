40|$|Hybrid poplars (Populus spp.) are {{propagated}} {{by inserting}} 12 – 15 inch cuttings {{next to each}} water emitter in a denuded 160 or 271 acre (65 or 110 hectare) field. The number of stems/hectare depends upon the final product: 500 for sawlogs, 1, 750 for pulp, and 2, 750 – 5, 500 for biomass. Adult pale <b>green</b> <b>weevils</b> are strong fliers. They immigrate into these newly planted areas from adjacent mature stands where they are not considered serious pests to mature trees. Adult pale <b>green</b> <b>weevils</b> are considered reestablishment pests, damage is more likely when propagation follows a harvest of an earlier rotation of trees. Our objectives are (1) to alert growers that the pale <b>green</b> <b>weevil</b> is a potential reestablishment problem for propagation using cuttings, and (2) to suggest how to protect these new plantings from weevil attack...|$|R
