6000|$|Dr. Dawson's {{results are}} the more remarkable, as the {{numerous}} specimens of British coal, from various localities, which I have examined, tell one tale as to the predominance of the spore and sporangium element in their composition; and as it is exactly in the finest and purest coals, such as the [...] "Better-Bed" [...] coal of <b>Lowmoor,</b> that the spores and sporangia obviously constitute almost the entire mass of the deposit.|$|E

50|$|Woodlands {{is today}} {{situated}} on half {{an acre of}} land. The garden contains large mature trees, including a weeping fig, silky oaks, jacarandas, poincianas, Moreton Bay chestnuts, casuarinas, pines, flame trees and an albizia. It has a privet hedge along the front fence dating from at least the 1920s. A decorative wrought iron fence, gates and matching tree guards, constructed of <b>Lowmoor</b> iron and marked Baleys Patent Albion, survive from Charles Plant's time.|$|E
5000|$|A {{previous}} club called Sutton Town existed until 1997. They {{played in}} the Northern Counties East League. They also spent time in the Midland Football League and the Northern Premier League. They were regular competitors in the Nottinghamshire Senior Cup. They still hold the joint record for most cup wins, along with Nottingham Forest. They were based at Priestsic Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield. Following {{the loss of the}} ground for the building of a supermarket, they moved to <b>Lowmoor</b> Road in the neighbouring town of Kirkby-in-Ashfield. They changed their name to Ashfield United because of a sponsorship deal with Ashfield District Council, however the club folded in 1997. This club was also nicknamed The Snipes.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 August 1848 by the York and North Midland Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{on the east side}} of <b>Lowmoor</b> Road. The station was originally known as Cliff Common Gate, although the 'Gate' was dropped in October 1864. A second platform was built in 1889 when the line was doubled. The goods yard consisted of three sidings, one serving a cattle dock behind the up platform, a further siding on the opposite side of the line behind the down platform and a private siding called Malt Kiln siding. The main freight handled at the station was 1187 tons of potatoes, 665 tons of hay/clover and 399 tons of vegetables. The station closed to passengers on 20 September 1954 although it was still used for excursions until 1957. The station closed to goods traffic on 28 January 1964.|$|E
5000|$|By 1840 Bradford {{was known}} for having {{some of the most}} smoke-filled air in Britain.As early as 1803 an act had stated that, [...] "Engine {{chimneys}} are to be erected of sufficient height as not to create a nuisance by the emission of smoke. All owners of engines etc. are to construct fireplaces thereof in such a manner as most effectually to destroy and consume the smoke arising therefrom." [...] However, little was done to enforce the laws. There was a general feeling that the factories provided work, so should not be pushed too hard to reduce pollution.An 1841 account said, [...] "The condition of Bradford is dreadful. <b>Lowmoor</b> iron-forges most extensively spread their suffocating exhalations on the one side ... On the other side, Bowling Iron Hell (for it is one truly) casts a still denser atmosphere and sulphurous stench..."The Bowling Iron Company was fined on 12 December 1874, but only for £5 with £9. 10s. costs for ten offences.The population suffered high levels of respiratory diseases, peaking in 1890 during an influenza epidemic.|$|E
50|$|The axle {{was made}} of best <b>Lowmoor</b> wrought iron, and had run about 220,000 miles during its 7 years service (normal life was 10 years or 300,000 miles). The {{fracture}} surface of the principal break showed {{what is now called}} a slow growth region on the outer part of the diameter, with a fast growth section at the centre. Although Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate did not recognize the problem as fatigue, he had seen many similar fracture surfaces in his career, attributing the break to the two keyways machined into the outer surface of the axle. He was quite right. The fatigue cracks probably grew from {{one or more of the}} sharp corners of the keyways, extending slowly around the circumference until the axle could no longer support its load, and the crack (or cracks) grew catastrophically. The load on an axle is complex, but involves both bending from the load in the vehicle above, and torsion from the rotation of the axle. He suggested that the four keyways rather than two be used, effectively spreading the load. Nowadays, the sharpness of the corners would also be reduced, so lessening the stress concentration. Thickening the shaft was done after this accident, and would also have helped to lower net stresses in the axle.|$|E
50|$|North of the town, {{the civil}} parish meets West Ashby and Low Toynton, south of Milestone House on the A153 (Louth Road). The {{boundary}} skirts {{the east of}} the town, crossing Low Toynton Road, following the Viking Way then meeting the River Waring. It briefly follows north of the A158, to a caravan park, where it meets High Toynton. Southwards on Mareham Road it meets Mareham on the Hill, east of Stonehill Farm. South of the town, and north of Telegraph House, it meets Scrivelsby, following High Lane westwards to cross the B1183, south of Loxley Farm, then the A153 and skirts the southern edge of the sewage works next to the River Bain where it meets Roughton (Thornton). It follows the Old River Bain west of the A153 northwards across the river meadows, crossing the Horncastle Canal (and Viking Way). Eastwards it crosses the B1191, south of Langton Hill, where at <b>Lowmoor</b> Lane it meets Langton. It follows Langton Lane northwards, with Mill House Farm (Langton Mill) to the west, meeting Thimbleby. It meets the B1190 where the pylons cross the road then the A158 at the B1190 junction, briefly following Accommodation Road to the east. It skirts the north of the town, briefly following Elmhurst Road, passing south of Elmlea Farm. and straight through Elmhirst Lakes. At the River Bain near Hemingby Lane, it meets West Ashby.|$|E
