However, due to parameter estimation errors, one may find ambiguous results in practice. Hence, {{it is essential}} to identify relevant stocks to alleviate the impact of estimation error in portfolio selection. To this end, we propose a <b>linkage</b> <b>condition</b> to link the relevant and irrelevant stock returns via their conditional regression relationship.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether sprint cycling performance could be improved using a non-circular chainring (Osymetric: ellipticity 1. 25 and crank lever mounted nearly perpendicular to the major axis), in comparison with a circular chainring. Twenty sprint cyclists performed an 8 s sprint on a cycle ergometer against a 0. 5 N/kg- 1 friction force in four crossing conditions (non-circular or circular chainring with or without clipless pedal). Instantaneous force, velocity and power were continuously measured during each sprint. Three main characteristic pedal downstrokes were selected: maximal force (in the beginning of the sprint), maximal power (towards the middle), and maximal velocity (at the end of the sprint). Both average and instantaneous force, velocity and power were calculated during the three selected pedal downstrokes. The important finding of this study was that the maximal power output was significantly higher (+ 4. 3 %, p < 0. 05) when using the non-circular chainring independent from the shoe-pedal <b>linkage</b> <b>condition.</b> This improvement is mainly explained by a significantly higher instantaneous external force that occurs during the downstroke. Non-circular chainring can have potential benefits on sprint cycling performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a new field}} of {{statistics}} has become of importance in many branches of experimental science. This is the Monte Carlo Method, so called because {{it is based on}} simulation of stochastic processes. By stochastic process, it is meant some possible physical process in the real world that has some random or stochastic element in its structure. This is the subject which may appropriately be called the dynamic part of statistics or the statistics of 2 ̆ 2 change, 2 ̆ 2 in contrast with the static statistical problems which have so far been the more systematically studied. Many obvious examples of such processes {{are to be found in}} various branches of science and technology, for example, the phenomenon of Brownian Motion, the growth of a bacterial colony, the fluctuating numbers of electrons and protons in a cosmic ray shower or the random segregation and assortment of genes (chemical entities responsible for governing physical traits for the plant and animal systems) under <b>linkage</b> <b>condition.</b> Their occurrences are predominant in the fields of medicine, genetics, physics, oceanography, economics, engineering and industry, to name only a few scientific disciplines. The scientists making measurements in his laboratory, the meteriologist attempting to forecast weather, the control systems engineer designing a servomechanism (such as an aircraft or a thermostatic control), the electrical engineer designing a communication system (such as the radio link between entertainer and audience or the apparatus and cables that transmit messages from one point to another), economist studying price fluctuations in business cycles and the neurosurgion studying brain wave records, all are encountering problems to which the theory of stochastic processes may be relevant. Let us consider a few of these processes in a little more detail. In statistical physics many parts of the theory of stochastic processes were developed in correlation with the study of fluctuations and noise in physical systems (Einstein, 1905; Smoluchowski, 1906; and Schottky, 1918). Consequently, the theory of stochastic processes can be regarded as the mathematical foundation of statistical physics. The stochastic models for population growth consider the size and composition of a population which is constantly fluctuating. These are mostly considered by Bailey (1957), Bartlett (1960), and Bharucha-Reid (1960). In communication theory a wide variety of problems involving communication and/or control such as the problem of automatic tracking of moving objects, the reception of radio signals in the presence of natural and artificial disturbances, the reproduction of sound and images, the design of guidance systems, the design of control systems for industrial processes may be regarded as special cases of the following general problem; that is, let T denote a set of points in a time axis such that at each point t in T an observation has been made of a random variable X(t). Given the observations [x(t), t ϵT] and a quantity Z related to the observation, one desires to from in an optimum manner, estimates of, and tests of hypothesis about Z and various functions h(Z) ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is unusual}} {{to find a}} {{negotiation}} not linked {{to at least one}} other negotiation. In some domains, such as international trade policy, we can identify negotiation networks with parties simultaneously involved in negotiations in global, multilateral, regional and bilateral trade policy settings. A single party (i. e., a national government) will manage similar issues in all four settings and also manage these same issues with multiple parties in a single setting. International trade policy is one of many "linkage-rich" environments. This study examines the relationship between two discrete but linked treaty negotiations: the Singapore - Australia Free Trade Agreement of 2003 (SAFTA) and the United States - Singapore Free Trade Agreement of 2003 (USSFTA). Case analysis identifies five structural factors that enhance the potential and fundamentally shape the nature of negotiation linkage dynamics. If linkage occurs then role theory can be employed to define two functional role types, a link-pin party (Singapore in this study) and linked parties (Australia and the U. S.). Such theory and case analysis support the development of propositions and help establish guidance for managing negotiation behavior. Key structural characteristics that appear to create linkage dynamics in this study are used to build a four-part structural framework that maps the universe of negotiation linkage phenomena and determines the fundamental nature of four discrete <b>linkage</b> <b>conditions.</b> This framework also provides descriptive and prescriptive guidance for managing strategy and power in linked negotiations.

40|$|This paper {{starts out}} from the optimistic {{assumption}} that the basic policies for environmental economic development are known but uncertainties surround the speed of their adoption. In many developing countries the key obstacle is poor governance: consequently, renewable resources continue to be mined, non-renewable resources are depleted irresponsibly, and reductions in pollution intensity lag. Recent research identifies resource abundance as an important cause of policy failure. This is because the primary sector remains large in relation to GDP so that differences in the scale of natural resource rents (and in their socio-economic <b>linkages)</b> <b>condition</b> macro policy in important ways. Most developing countries are resource-rich, a condition that engenders predatory political states that deploy resource rents in ways that cumulatively distort the economy so it falls into a staple trap, which undermines economic growth and environmentally sustainable policies. Sound macroeconomic policy {{is critical to the}} success of microeconomic measures like much of environmental policy, a fact often neglected by environmental reformers. There are two implications of this. First, in the long term, improved governance will enhance environmentally sustainable management of: renewable resources (by taking account of the total economic value of resources); finite resources (guided by the need to maintain genuine saving); and the global pollution sinks (by flattening the environmental Kuznets curve). Second, until such improvements occur, environmental policies are likely to underperform unless they are adapted to take account of flawed macro policies. Environmental reformers therefore need to support efforts by the international financial institutions to improve macroeconomic management.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine {{the characteristics of a}} nonlinear linkage installed in a power control system incorporated in a ground simulator. The nonlinear linkage provided for increased control-stick motion for relatively small simulator response at control motions near neutral. The quality of the control system was rated on the ease and precision with which various tracking tasks were performed by the pilots who operated the simulator. The results obtained with the nonlinear linkage installed in the control system were compared with those obtained by using the normal linear control system. Several combinations of nonlinearity of the linkage were tested for various dynamic characteristics of the simulator. It was found that the pilots were able to track almost as well with the nonlinear linkage installed as with the normal system. All of the pilots were of the opinion, however, that the nonlinearity was an undesirable feature in the control system because of the apparent lack of simulator response through the neutral range of the linkage where relatively large stick deflections could be made with very little simulator motion. The results showed that increased lag between the target and chair position, higher stick-force levels, and uneven stick forces due to the dynamics of the linkage were general characteristics of all the nonlinear <b>linkage</b> <b>conditions</b> tested. It was also found that for cases of low simulator damping, rapid control motions caused considerably higher overshoots when the nonlinear linkage was installed than were obtained for the normal linear control system. These characteristics were considered to be sufficiently undesirable to out-weigh the advantages to be gained from the use of a nonlinear linkage in the control system of an airplane...|$|R

40|$|Many {{developing}} {{market economies}} were strongly distorted during the 1960 s and 1970 s by fashionable policies to force industrialisation and they experienced growth collapses {{when exposed to}} the price shocks of the 1970 s. In this context, the centrally planned economies were even more highly distorted and they too experienced collapse, albeit a decade later because they were less exposed to trade shocks. Economic reform has had mixed results in both sets of countries and this paper develops a model of governance to explain the main variations among the transition countries. The model incorporates a neglected factor, namely how {{the scale of the}} natural resource rents and their socio-economic <b>linkages</b> <b>condition</b> government behaviour. It posits that resource-poor countries are more likely than resource-rich countries to engender a developmental political state, which has sufficient autonomy to pursue coherent policies and also the aim of raising social welfare. The two principal reasons for this are, first, that the governments of resource-poor countries tend to be less distracted from the task of wealth generation by the capture of resource rents and, second, the political economy of resource-poor countries tends to build greater political accountability. The basic model is adapted to explain differential progress with reform among the transition economies by adding to the resource rents two more key initial conditions identified in the literature, namely history (the length of exposure to central planning) and geography (proximity to a dynamic market economy). The model predicts that the most propitious conditions for transition reform arise among the relatively undistorted, resource-poor coastal economies of East Asia, followed by the moderately distorted higher-income (and low-rent) countries of Eastern Europe. The paper shows that the transition countries broadly support the predictions. There are anomalies, however, which require two additional factors to explain them, namely access to geopolitical rents conformity to a regional norm of political state. Political Economy,...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{contribute}} to a better understanding of how inter-firm <b>linkages</b> determine the <b>conditions</b> for firm learning. The overall objective is to explore the relationship between the organizing of linkages and the process of accumulating capability. These goals are achieved by focusing on the analysis of how a firm's diverse set of <b>linkages</b> affects the <b>conditions</b> for learning. The conceptual framework developed differentiates between three types of inter-firm linkages; activity coordinating, resource combining, and actor connecting. Learning, defined as the process of capability accumulation, is assumed to be related to the nature and pattern of a firm's linkages. In order to link the framework with real life phenomena, the methodology of the study reflects a hermeneutic approach which emphasizes understanding and interpretation rather than verification of theories and hypotheses. For the sake of `understanding' three case studies from firms in Kenya and Tanzania are presented that explore the different roles of various types of <b>linkages</b> in determining <b>conditions</b> facilitating or constraining learning. The main assumption that a firm's linkages comprise a precondition for learning has proven fruitful, in the light of the study's empirical findings. The study points to the central influence on capability accumulation of establishing different types of linkages. The cases reveal that the firms had a diverse and differentiated set of linkages. These were typically manifested in market-like relationships with other local firms, whereas linkages to international firms were of relational nature. Actual linkage formation is explained as the result of firms' efforts, which in an interactive fashion, are linked to the type of opportunity provided to firms. However, this is to a great extent the perceived set of opportunity from the perspective of a firm rather than the actual reality. The study concludes that the prevalent way of organizing inter-firm linkages has created vicious circles which should be seen as a challenge to policy makers to counter negative effects...|$|R

All members older than 18 were studied clinically and by neuroimaging. Genetic linkage analysis was conducted using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers located between D 7 S 502 and D 7 S 479.  RESULTS—The family included three generations. Among the 25 members investigated, 11 had an abnormal cerebral MRI, eight of them being symptomatic, and 12 were asymptomatic with a normal MRI. The status of the two remaining members could not be established {{on the basis of}} clinical and MRI data. The family reported shares some striking features with other previously linked families—namely, a high clinical penetrance and the presence of multiple lesions within most of the affected members. A lod score of 4. 04 was obtained with marker D 7 S 657 with no recombinant. Significant lod scores were also obtained with D 7 S 524 (Zmax= 3. 32 at θ= 0. 00) and D 7 S 630 (Zmax= 3. 44 at θ= 0. 00).

This paper studies {{the relationship}} between multi-level linkages and local autonomy, a facilitating condition found to {{increase the likelihood of}} local successful collective action. A technique known as fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was applied to a longitudinal comparative data set. In the context of the decentralization of a protected area system in Costa Rica (1986 - 2006), it traced the emergence and endurance of autonomy among local institutions for biodiversity conservation. The technique illustrates which set of multi-level linkages combined in different ways, and at different points in time, to reach the same outcome (local autonomy). The findings show that a unique set of combinations of multi-level linkages led to the emergence of local autonomy among institutions for biodiversity conservation governance. In contrast, a more diverse set was associated with the endurance of local autonomy over time, suggesting that institutional diversity may play a more prominent role in the maintenance of institutional robustness than in processes of institutional emergence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the structural linkages that may {{exist between the}} G 7 national interest rates. Its aim is to exploit some new techniques in cointegration analysis to see to what extent conclusions can be drawn purely from the data without imposing any arbitrary identification <b>conditions.</b> <b>Linkages</b> between I(1) series are examined as structural relations, using a technique that is a variation of a method proposed by Davidson that involves {{the introduction of the}} new concept of an irreducible cointegrating vector. In order to distinguish between structural and solved irreducible cointegrating relations, the ranking of irreducible cointegrating vectors according to the criterion of minimum variance is introduced. This methodology is applied to the system linking the G 7 short-term interest rates, obtaining some interesting results. ...|$|R
