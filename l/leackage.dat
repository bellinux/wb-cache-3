40|$|The {{work of the}} gas {{transmission}} {{pipeline system}} is regulated by the thousands of valveses and {{other elements of the}} shut-off valves, located in different places. Information about the current status of each valve, and confidence in its technical serviceability is an important element in the control of pipeline system. There are a number of problems that adversely affect the  valving operation. Principal among them - is the lack of siystematical approach in valving diagnostics. To solve this problem, developed a new approach to the valving diagnostics – multi-level diagnostics. Depending on the level of diagnosis, we get a different amount of information about the object.   The focus is on the 3 rd level of diagnosis, which allows to determine the <b>leackages</b> of valves, and identify type of defects quantitatively. This level of diagnosis is regarded as an example of Method «Micropuls». The method «Micropuls» based on the theory of mechanical vibrations and forced with high accuracy to set the time, frequency and spectral characteristics of noise in the details of the valve, and their spatial location and intensity of that {{in the presence of a}} system of analysis allows to determine the state of the object, its faults and defects. Micropulse technology is based on the impact on the measured object micropower impulses, records the response and subsequent filtering, decoding and analyzing the data.                    Specially designed calibrated pulses can effectively influence the measured objects (valve) over a wide range of structural dimensions and mounting schemes, regardless of physical location of the valve. ...|$|R
40|$|International audience—This paper {{presents}} a novel Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) framework for 3 D extraction of the substrate electrical network. The proposed CAD tool (framework) models effi-ciently the minority carrier propagation inside substrate network especially for smart power ICs. Today, the minority carrier propagation into the substrate is ignored in existing SPICE simulators. It can be simulated using finite element methods in TCAD. Generally, TCAD simulations are accurates but take long time. Thus, they become of limited help for large scale ICs involving hundreds of transistors. In {{the context of}} the FP 7 AUTOMICS project, the extraction tool will take into consideration the minority carriers effects. It will allow the designer to predict the minority carrier propagation through the substrate. This can be useful in evaluation the efficiency of ESD protection and latchup faults due to this <b>leackage</b> current in the substrate specially in HV/HT applications. With the proposed substrate network, the three-dimensional layout parasitics are constructed and substrate noise is simulated before first silicon fabrication.

In the last decades the indications of this principle extended to other clinical situations, another than neurologic bladder. Autors report their experience regarding continent appendico-vesicostomy in cases with retentionist bladder. Materials and methods: From 2000 to 2002, this procedure was performed in 6 male patients, with age between 6 and 14 years, with retentionist bladder. The underlying clinical conditions were myelomeningocele, MEN II B syndrome, traumatic injuries of the posterior urethra, posterior urethral valves. It was used the classical procedure, but with the specification that we didn’t close the vesical neck. Results: In five cases (83. 33 %) the outcome is good, one patient died. In 2 cases the initial intermitent catheterization was difficult, but subsequentely the maneuvre becomes facile. Episodes of urinary tract infection decreased in frecvency and azothat retention remains stable. Social insertion is good; there is no urinary <b>leackage</b> and catheterization is performe for 5 - 6 times daily.

40|$|The S. Eufemia Lamezia plain, {{located in}} central Calabria, is {{characterized}} by the presence of a multi-layered aquifer. In particular, it was studied the intermediate artesian aquifer, content in the Pliocene sands and sandstones. The collection of new lithostratigraphic data, related to drilling for water supplies, allowed to draw the map of the top of intermediate artesian aquifer underlying in the study area. The top surface of sands and sandstones map, presented here, seems to confirm the structural-geological data of the surface showing, also in depth, the conditioning of tectonics on the study area and on the groundwater flow. The analysis of the selected stratigraphic data shows that the studied aquifer is constituted by Pliocene deposits of sand and sandstones, confined to the top by Pliocene clay. Therefore locally hydraulic connections with the shallow aquifer for <b>leackage</b> phenomena are possible. The supply of the studied aquifer happens mainly for lateral recharge because the clay horizon that borders with the top of the aquifer prevents direct transfer of rainfall recharge. However, a reduced recharge rate is due to the meteoric recharge, which is possible in limited parts of the territory to the east of the study area and over. Therefore, this study aims to implement the knowledge of the groundwater flow of S. Eufemia plain by returning the top intermediate confined aquifer map which, is little studied but strongly exploited because, respect to the shallow aquifer, is more productive and more protected by potential contamination due to the presence of the aquiclude/aquitard which isolates it by the top...|$|E
40|$|Pelvic perineal {{recurrence}} rate is {{the major}} therapeutic problem after curative surgery of extraperithoneal rectal cancer, after lower anterior resection as well as abdomino-perineal resection: local failure rate is high, particularly for stages B 2 -C. Radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy {{proved to be an}} useful adjunct to surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy, with 40 to 50 Gy doses, has shown local improvement, but causing intestinal damaging, There is now evidence that hyperthermia enthances radiation effects, by killing radioresistant acid tumor cells. In order to give high postoperative radiation doses, without intestinal damage, and to kill acid tumor cells by hyperthermia, we developed a device, able both to displace intestinal loops and to produce combined hyperthermia. From 1993 to 1995, four patients with Astler-Coller stages B 2 (2 patients), C 1 (1 patient) and C 2 (1 patient) distal cancer, were operated by Hartmann's procedure and treated with postoperative radio-hyperthermia with our device. Overall radiation dose delivered in the pelvic area was of 65 Gy, associated with three heating sessions at 43 degrees C for 30 minutes. Pelvic infection occurred in one patient; all pelvic byopsies were negative and no bowel damage was found. Three patients underwent recanalization, one had anasthomotic <b>leackage.</b> The C 1 and C 2 stage patients died from hepatic metastasis, 18 and ii months after recanalization; one B 2 stage patient is still under treatment and the other is alive and disease free 13 months after recanalization.

40|$|Then anastomotic <b>leackage</b> after large bowel surgery still {{represents}} a great complication {{there are multiple}} efforts to find the causes for this problem. In this experiment we examined {{by means of an}} animal test the effect of an intraperitoneally applied gentamicin on the wound healing process after bowel anastomosis. We determined the quality of wound healing by means of an immunohistochemical analysis of multiple parameters which have an influence of the composition of the extracellular matrix respectively represents components of the extracellular matrix. We examined the collagen content, thecollagen type I/III ratio, the matrixmetaloproteinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, the profibrinogen zytokine TGF-beta, the transcription factor Y-box (YB) protein- 1 and Ki- 67. The determination of these parameters followed on the postoperative days 3, 5 and 14 in two groups to value the quality of the scar. Our present data suggest that gentamicin next to the antibiotic effect is able to improve anastomotic healing. Intraperitoneally applied gentamicin increases mechanical stability of colonic anastomosis in rats in comparison with both increased overall collagen content and an increased collagen type I/III ratio. However, animal experiments,particularly rodent animal midels,have their natural limitations,and results cannot be extrapolated directly to the situation of humans. In particular,the animals con not be reflect any underlying human disease or co-morbidity. In this experiment we could show {{for the first time that}} the local application of gentamicin improves the quality of intestinal wound healing, as it is previously shown for the mesh integretion within the abdominal wall. It has to be an issue for further studies to reveal the molecular mechanisms of gentamicin to affect the ECM and in particular the collagen metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Heterostructure {{field effect}} {{transistors}} (HFETs) {{on the basis}} of Group III nitrides are increasingly gaining importance for the application as RF power amplifier devices. A common feature of the layer structure of such transistors is a GaN buffer which is usually deposited on non-native substrates, e. g. sapphire, silicon or SiC. A subsequent ternary barrier layer, such as AlGaN or AlInN, allows the realization of a so-called two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) at the GaN interface. Even without further doping and only due to polarisation induced carriers, an approximately triangular quantum well in the GaN buffer can be generated. This structure is characterized by a high sheet carrier concentration as well as by a high mobility. This fact in combination with the outstanding physical properties of GaN (high band gap and high breakdown field) is the precondition for the devices in the above mentioned field of application. In order to realize such HFETs, a baseline process was developed and established at the ITHE. In one part of this thesis, the development and the physical basis of each process step are described. Furthermore, the interactions between different process parameters and the physical properties of the resulting devices were identified and interpreted. During this process, the mesa isolation was refined, the metal semiconductor contacts were improved, i. e. the ohmic contact resistance as well the gate <b>leackage</b> current were reduced, and the whole process chain was optimized in terms of reproducibility and reliability. Although every single process step is important, the surface passivation plays an especially essential role in the device performance. Without a passivation layer, surface-related dispersion effects cannot be minimized or even eliminated. Therefore, one focus of this thesis was the development of such a passivation process. Based on a comparison between the literature on surface passivation and data obtained in experiments, a layer with good passivating properties could be realized. As a result, {{a deeper understanding of the}} physical process of the realization of such a surface passivation could be gained. Furthermore, the influence of a passivation ealier in the process cycle was investigated. Based on this baseline process, AlGaN/GaN as well as AlInN/GaN HFETs were produced, investigated and compared with regard to their DC and RF characteristics. The influence of the aluminium concentration in the AlGaN barrier layer on the electrical properties of SiN passivated transistors was examined. Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 N/GaN HFETs on silicon substrates with a gate length of 1 µm and a gate width of 100 µm exhibited a power density and a power added efficiency of 2 W/mm and 26 %, respectively, at a frequency of 2. 14 GHz. The gate <b>leackage</b> currents, which were increased after depositing the passivation layer, could be reduced by using a thin insulating layer inserted between the gate metal and the barrier layer. These so called metal-insulator heterostructure field effet transistors (MISHFETs) were evaluated in terms of their physical properties. The deposition of the passivation layer as early as possible offers further potential for the improvement of the device performance. Nearly lattice-matched AlInN/GaN HFETs were successfully processed. Due to higher polarization charges compared to their AlGaN/GaN counterparts, these devices are characterized by high current densities, even at thin barrier layers. HFETs with a nearly lattice-matched 10 nm thick barrier layer exhibited sheet carrier concentrations of 1. 7 x 1013 cm- 2, leading to current densities of more than 1 A/mm. An important advantage of a thin barrier layer is the positive influence on the frequency behavior. A current gain cut-off frequency and a maximum power gain cut-off frequency of 14 GHz and 32 GHz, respectively, at a gate length of 1 µm could be achieved. A SiN-based surface passivation did not prove as effective in reducing the dispersion effects as demonstrated for AlGaN-based transistors. As a consequence, there is still need for further development of an appropriate passivation process for transistors based on this materialsystem...|$|E
40|$|Within {{water and}} gas {{distribution}} networks dissipation valves {{are widely used}} {{in order to reduce}} the pressure in the pipes to an optimum. Such valves create a local increase of water or gas velocity by a reduction of the net section and a sudden expansion. Thus, a strong energy dissipation is determined by turbulent mixing. In many case the amount of energy to be dissipated is variable on time. Therefore, automatic valves are used which can vary automatically the opening gate to obtain the downstream pressure optimum value. Hydro power is a very valuable energy source because of the absence of toxic products in the connected power plants. Unfortunately, almost the whole number of water courses are already used for power production. The construction of new dams is not considered sustainable for environmental reasons. In water (gas) distribution network a part of the hydraulic energy has to be dissipated, in order to grant a correct supply for all users. For the increasing economic and social cost of the other energy sources, the recovery of this energy could be traied if appropriate hydraulic machines would be available. The new pressure reducing control valve is designed to obtain two different tools: Reduce water (gas) pressure to the optimum value; Grant the complete shut off of the valve when necessary; Transform the exceeding energy in mechanical or electric energy. The propose machine differs from the already known system for energy production and pressure regulation in its unique configuration, allowing a low cost and easy solution for energy production along pressure pipelines. Patents are pending on the machinary and on most application thereof. The new valve can be used in almost all cases where energy dissipation in a fluid network is required. In all cases mechanical or electric energy production is realized. The main situations where energy can be produced in a water network are the following: -Pressure regulation along water supply pipelines in presence of high ground slopes. The use of the new machine gives two benefits: containment of water pressures along the pipelines and energy production. -Pressure regulation in water distribution networks located in very steep areas. The use of dissipation valves is necessary to grant optimum pressure values in all points of the pipelines network. -Pressure regulation in gas distribution networks. The use of dissipation valves is always necessary to reduce the high pressure value of the primary pipelines to the low pressure value of the town distribution network. -Pressure reduction in deteriorated distribution networks. Pressure reduction is usually suggested to reduce <b>leackage.</b> -Pressure regulation in distribution networks with large pressure gradients. Pressure increase above the optimum value can be used to produce energy. Such gradients are always present in the daily regime of distribution networks. -Pressure variations during the lifetime of a pipeline. Energy dissipation is always requested in new waterworks because of the smaller energy losses in new pipes compared with the project ones. The new valve is suited for the following industries: -Municipal water supplies; -Irrigation water supplies. -Municipal gas supplies; -Industrial water supplies...|$|E
40|$|Puropse: The aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether non traumatic, sterile corneal {{perforations}} could be succesfully sealed by oversewing them with a Polyrethane-Patch and which factors affect the prognosis of this procedure. Method: We supplied 33 corneal perforations with a Patch from PU. In 21 of 33 cases an additional Sklera or a corneal patch was inserted into the defect. In 19 / 33 cases additional tissue adhesive was used and in 29 / 33 cases we additionally applied Aprotinin eyedrops after the surgery. Results: The operation procedure was simple and could frequently accomplished in topiccal anaesthesia. Except a reversible Neovascularisation of the corneal surface, which seems to depend on the time the patch stays on the eye, no serious complications arose, which were associated with the surgery. The Patch could be removed remove uncomplicatedl in all cases or it fell off spontaneously. In one of 33 cases there was a fistula on the first day after surgery, wich could be sealed easily by one suture. Immediately after Patchremoval 91 % of the perforations were closed. 3 months after surgery 82 % were still closed. The successrate was worse with 6 / 10 (60 %) versus 20 / 22 (90 %) cases, if an underlaying immunological desease was the reason for the perforation (p= 0, 053). The prognosis seems to be improved by a systemic Immunsuppression. The successrate rate could not be significantly improved by the additional use of a skleral or corneal patch, of tissue adhesives or by the post operative topical application of Aprotinin. If a <b>leackage</b> (3 / 33) showed up imidiatly after the removal of the pach the prognosis was bad. 2 from 3 patients suffered an irreversible functional loss. Durig the further follow up 3 patients suffert from a recurrent perforation, 2 of these could be sealed succesfully by patching them agin. The prognosis seemed to be much better if there was a complete epithelialisation of the corneal surface after patchremoval, the result is however not significant. 21 of 33 cases achieved a visual acuity of hand movements or more badly, but only in 5 cases a penetrating keratoplasty was accomplished at the quit eye. 3 of these cases reached a VA from 0, 2 to 0, 4. Conclusion: Non-traumatic, sterile corneal perforations can be sealed immediately, simply and successfully with a Patch made of PU so that the integrity of the eyeball can be restored. A permanent closure of the perforation can be achieved in 82 % of the cases. Due to the worse prognosis with an underlaying immunologically desease, systemic immunosuppression is important. On the calm eye a penetrating keratoplasty should be considered for functional rehablitation. Since such corneal perforations are rare, the group of our patients is very heterogeneous the patients therapy apart from the polyurethanepatch varied, a statistic analysis and a comparison with other procedures are of reduced value and difficult despite the relatively large number of patients. Therefore no clear statement can be made whether inserting a skleral patch, using additional tissue adhesives or Aprotinin affects the result to a favorable outcome...|$|E
