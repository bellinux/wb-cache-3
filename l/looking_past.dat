25|$|The River Mole flows nearby. As {{its name}} suggests, {{the river in}} places goes {{underground}} due to the chalk bed being dissolved, forming swallow holes (sinkholes). Ian Middleton tells of his father, sometime in the 1950s, the village police officer P.C. Middleton, <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> his bathroom mirror one morning whilst shaving to see a mature oak tree disappear into the ground. It {{turned out that the}} river flowing underground had been gradually wearing away the supporting ground under the tree, forming a giant such hole which had collapsed. The subsequent pit was not filled in until about 1968 approx when it was still 30ft deep and 30ft across. P.C. Middleton also reportedly removed parts from an unexploded V2 rocket which fell in the village during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In 1979 in Tanzania the Bahá'í community participated in a seminar on alcoholism and drug abuse organized by the Karibu Tanzania Project under the Ministry of National Culture and Youth. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. This was the beginnings of ecological preservation projects by Bahá'ís began in this era. And a review <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> 1987 focused on deepening women in the understanding of the Bahá'í Faith because widens their perspective and gives them self-confidence. This can be done by holding women's conferences at local, regional, and perhaps, national levels to both deepen them in the Bahá'í teachings and to provide a forum for discussion of women's ideas and concerns. As a follow-up, the production and circulation of a women's magazine, focusing on the same topics as the conferences, and with special emphasis on nutrition education, would be helpful. A 1986 review noted three larger projects in Tanzania - a carpentry workshop, and a nursery school were up and running and plans for a technical/agricultural school were initiated. This school developed into the Ruaha Secondary School (see below.) Additionally, a program to train volunteer community health educators was conducted. In 1989 a Bahá'í expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Tanzania training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries.|$|E
500|$|The two systems' {{differences}} reflect [...] "competing {{theories of}} knowledge... In a sense, the Widener system was Aristotelian; its divisions were empirical, describing and reflecting the languages and cultural origins {{of books and}} highlighting their relations {{to one another in}} language, place, and time; , by contrast, was Platonic, <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> the surface of language and nation to reflect the idealized, essential discipline in which each [...] might be said to belong." ...|$|E
500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally got to where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Halo developer Bungie's former content manager Frank O'Connor said that {{the inclusion of the}} Arbiter as a playable character in Halo2 {{was supposed to be a}} [...] "secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist" [...] and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut. We knew we had a trilogy on our hands, so we were <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> the shock of playing as the enemy [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The film {{presents}} Ricky as its [...] "visionary, {{spiritual and}} mystical center". He sees {{beauty in the}} minutiae of everyday life, videoing {{as much as he}} can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.|$|E

2500|$|Much like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a [...] "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists. Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of [...] "Pilgrims and Natives <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> their differences" [...] to break bread. Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the [...] "cultural and political amnesia" [...] of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: [...] "We do not have to feel guilty, but we do need to feel something." [...] Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: [...] "One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting." [...] Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving have been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving).|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be <b>looking</b> <b>past</b> me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
