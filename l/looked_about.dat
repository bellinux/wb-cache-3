Football was a sport that had degenerated into dangerous tactics such as: the flying wedge, punching, kicking, piling-on, and elbows to the face. Almost any violent behavior was allowed. Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season.|$|E
25|$|Churchill <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> {{for a way}} {{to improve}} his public {{standing}} after the defeat. He arranged to travel as a war correspondent to South Africa, fortified by a letter of recommendation to the high commissioner, Alfred Milner, from the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, who had been a friend of his father, and by a promise of a military attachment. His reputation was considerably improved by his war reports published in national newspapers, and by his own military exploits, particularly his capture by and escape from the Boers.|$|E
25|$|Visitors {{enter the}} exhibit through a re-created {{scene of a}} Calusa fishing village as it may have <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> 500 years ago. A young Calusa boy carries home a shark on his shoulder, and behind him lies the village and view toward the Gulf of Mexico. Just past the village are four large glass wall panels {{depicting}} southwest Florida Indian art and environments. These images suggest the richness and complexity of both the cultural and natural history of the region. Beyond the panels is an orientation area, large enough for docents and teachers to gather a small group and introduce the exhibit. Interpretive panels preview the content and themes of the hall, augmented by a collage mural of south Florida people and environments.|$|E

This can't be them. No way!". Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson particularly like them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E
500|$|Nansen {{called this}} first land [...] "Hvidtenland" [...] ("White Island"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> them. It was {{apparent}} {{that they were in}} an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land. They could only continue south in the hopes of finding a geographical feature they could pinpoint with certainty. On 16 August Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder, marked on Payer's maps as on the western coast of Franz Josef Land. Nansen's objective was now to reach a hut and supplies that had been left by an earlier expedition at a location known as Eira Harbour, {{at the southern end of}} the islands. However, contrary winds and loose ice made further progress in the kayak hazardous, and on 28 August Nansen decided that, with another polar winter drawing near, they should stay where they were and await the following spring.|$|E

2500|$|Hairy Lee – A hairy {{version of}} Weebl {{and an expert}} on hypnotism. He is {{probably}} a caveman, which would explain the hair and the fact he usually talks in grunts. First appeared in [...] "Hairy." [...] Known as [...] "Baldie Lee" [...] in the 1980s prior to an overdose on cheese. However, prior to and following this event, he <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> the same. He may have just seemed bald in comparison with Weebl and Bob's mullets, which were inexplicably destroyed {{near the end of the}} episode. This could be the reason as to why his name may be a play on words of the British soft cheese brand [...] "Dairylea". He played a female dancer's [...] "Left Bum Cheek" [...] in DJ Pie Safety's music video in [...] "DJ".|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dink {{was assassinated}} in Istanbul around 12:00 GMT on January 19, 2007, as he {{returned}} to the offices of Agos. The killer was reported to have introduced himself as an Ankara University student who wanted to meet with Mr. Dink. When his request was rejected, he waited in front of a nearby bank for a while. According to eyewitnesses, Dink was shot by a man of 25 to 30 years of age, who fired three shots at Dink's head from the back at point blank range before fleeing the scene on foot. According to the police, the assassin was a man of 18 to 19 years of age. Two men had been taken into custody in the first hours of the police investigation, but were later released. Another witness, the owner of a restaurant near the Agos office, said the assassin <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> 20, wore jeans and a cap and shouted [...] "I shot the infidel" [...] as he left the scene. Dink's wife and daughter collapsed when they heard the news, and were taken to the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2000, Westbrook {{was photographed}} at the British Soap Awards, where {{an image of}} her missing [...] was given {{to a series of}} tabloid newspapers, {{unveiling}} her secret and highlighting her excessive drug abuse. Westbrook was checked into rehab and, six months later, she appeared on the Channel 4 show The Priory with the claim that she was clean and had been free from drugs for months. However, hosts Jamie Theakston and Zoë Ball struggled to get coherent answers from Westbrook, who was under the influence of drugs despite her claims of abstinence. Reflecting back on the event in 2002, Westbrook commented [...] "I said I was clean, but it was obvious I wasn't. I <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> 50, and my voice was shaky. I should never have been allowed on. They wanted to laugh at me, rip me apart. I despise that sort of thing, but it did me the world of good because watching it I realised, 'I'm so ill.' When it came to the crunch I thought, 'Hang on. I don't want to die.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On a Sunday {{night in}} Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the Cougars {{challenged}} the #2 ranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons the tournament's #2 and highest remaining seed. Wake ranked #10 in Division I in shots {{per game and}} came out shooting. In only the 3rd minute, the Deacons' top scorer passed from the end line to their #2 scorer, Bakero, who blasted {{the ball into the}} net from 9 yards in front. On the Cougars' lone corner kick of the game, both Ebbesen and his shot on goal were knocked down by the Wake keeper, but Ledbetter got to the rebound and netted [...] it to tie the score. SIUE <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> {{to take the lead in}} the 51st minute on a Jambga breakaway, but the Deacons' keeper, Cases Mundet, stayed with the pass to Ebbesen and blocked his point-blank shot. After repeated stops and saves by the Cougar defense, in the 72nd minute, it was again Bakero who redirected a shot that Dal Santo was ready to stop and scored the game winner. Although SIUE looked to be dominated in the statistics, out-shot 24–6 and bested on corner kicks 9–1, Wake Forest knew they had been in a fight; [...] "“I give SIUE credit." [...] said Wake's coach Muuss. [...] "They were blocking shots, battling." [...] But Wake Forest's win ended the Cougars' 14-game unbeaten streak, their 2016 season, and the college careers of Ivan Gutierrez, Jason Hackett, Andrew Kendall-Moullin, and Austin Ledbetter.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{began his}} lifelong kinship with Native Americans in Devils Lake. The {{first people to}} meet and greet him as he {{stepped down from the}} {{platform}} of the train were a small band of Sioux. [...] "They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: [...] "How cola!" [...] Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town. [...] He passed by a large pile of bones, and wondered what it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Although a satire of the {{aesthetic}} movement is dated today, fads and hero-worship are evergreen, and [...] "Gilbert’s pen was rarely sharper than when he invented Reginald Bunthorne". Gilbert originally conceived Patience as a tale of rivalry between two curates and of the doting ladies who attended upon them. The plot {{and even some of}} the dialogue were lifted straight out of Gilbert's Bab Ballad [...] "The Rival Curates." [...] While writing the libretto, however, Gilbert took note of the criticism he had received for his very mild satire of a clergyman in The Sorcerer, and <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> for an alternative pair of rivals. Some remnants of the Bab Ballad version do survive in the final text of Patience. Lady Jane advises Bunthorne to tell Grosvenor: [...] "Your style is much too sanctified [...] your cut is too canonical!" [...] Later, Grosvenor agrees to change his lifestyle by saying, [...] "I do it on compulsion!" [...] the very words used by the Reverend Hopley Porter in the Bab Ballad. [...] Gilbert's selection of aesthetic poet rivals proved to be a fertile subject for topsy-turvy treatment. [...] He both mocks and joins in Buchanan's criticism of what the latter calls the poetic [...] "affectations" [...] of the [...] "fleshly school" [...] – their use of archaic terminology, archaic rhymes, the refrain, and especially their [...] "habit of accenting the last syllable in words which in ordinary speech are accented on the penultimate." [...] All of these poetic devices or [...] "medievalism's affectations", as Bunthorne calls them, are parodied in Patience. [...] For example, accenting the last syllable of [...] "lily" [...] and rhyming it with [...] "die" [...] parodies two of these devices at once.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, the National Christmas Tree was {{relocated}} to Lafayette Park {{north of the}} White House. The 1931 Norway spruce had again become damaged, and the National Park Service purchased two [...] "Koster" [...] blue spruce cultivars to plant {{on the west side}} of Sherman Square with the intent of using alternating between trees each year. But when it became clear later that year that the National Christmas Tree would have to be moved from Sherman Square, the agency asked the Commission of Fine Arts (which had partial jurisdiction over planting decisions around the White House) for permission to plant the two trees to the southeast and southwest of the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square. [...] The Commission of Fine Arts opposed the plan, and suggested that two fir trees be planted east and west of the statue instead. For a time, the National Park Service hoped to plant two trees (of an undetermined species) on the Ellipse near the White House, but in the end acceded to the Commission of Fine Art's plan. Two [...] high Fraser firs from North Carolina were planted to the [...] east and west of the Jackson statue. The trees were planted just a few weeks before the tree lighting ceremony, and the western tree was chosen to begin the alternating use of the trees because it was more visible from the first family's living quarters. During the tree lighting ceremony, President Roosevelt drew attention to the statue of Andrew Jackson and asked the American people to be as courageous in the face of the depression as Jackson had been throughout his lifetime. The tree did not light when Roosevelt threw the switch. The tree remained unlit for about five seconds while Roosevelt worriedly <b>looked</b> <b>about,</b> but then the lights came on.|$|E
2500|$|Viewing the {{battlefield}} from horseback {{on the hill}} at Jebel Surgham, Kitchener commented: [...] "Well, we have given them a damn good dusting". As the British and Egyptians advanced in columns, the Khalifa attempted to outflank and encircle the columns; this led to desperate hand-to-hand fighting. Churchill wrote of his own experience as the 21st Lancers cut {{their way through the}} Ansar: [...] "The collision was prodigious and for perhaps ten wonderful seconds, no man heeded his enemy. Terrified horses wedged in the crowd, bruised and shaken men, sprawling in heaps, struggle dazed and stupid, to their feet, panted and <b>looked</b> <b>about</b> them". The Lancers' onslaught carried them through the 12-men-deep Ansar line [...] with the Lancers losing about 70 dead while killing hundreds of the enemy. Following the annihilation of his army, the Khalifa ordered a retreat and early in the afternoon, Kitchener rode in triumph into Omdurman and immediately ordered that the thousands of Christians enslaved by the Ansar were now all free people. Kitchener lost fewer than 500 men while killing about 11,000 and wounding 17,000 of the Ansar. Burleigh summed the general mood of the British troops: [...] "At Last! Gordon has been avenged and justified. The dervishes have been overwhelming routed, Mahdism has been [...] "smashed", while the Khalifa's capital of Omdurman has been stripped of its barbaric halo of sanctity and invulnerability." [...] Kitchener promptly had the Mahdi's tomb blown up and his bones scattered. Queen Victoria, who had wept when she heard of General Gordon's death, now wept for the man who had vanquished Gordon, asking whether it had been really necessary for Kitchener to desecrate the Mahdi's tomb. In a letter to his mother, Churchill wrote that the victory at Omdurman had been [...] "disgraced by the inhuman slaughter of the wounded and...Kitchener is responsible for this". There is no evidence that Kitchener ordered his men to shoot the wounded Ansar on the field of Omdurman, but he did give before the battle what the British journalist Mark Urban called a [...] "mixed message", saying that mercy should be given, {{while at the same time}} saying [...] "Remember Gordon" [...] and that the enemy were all [...] "murderers" [...] of Gordon. The victory at Omdurman made Kitchener into a popular war hero, and gave him a reputation for efficiency and as a man who got things done. The journalist G. W. Steevens wrote in the Daily Mail that [...] "He [...] is more like a machine than a man. You feel that he ought to be patented and shown with pride at the Paris International Exhibition. British Empire: Exhibit No. 1 hors concours, the Sudan Machine". The shooting of the wounded at Omdurman, along with the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb, gave Kitchener a reputation for brutality that was to dog him for the rest of his life, and posthumously.|$|E
