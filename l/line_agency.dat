40|$|South Africa {{has over}} 4 700 storage dams, about 700 {{of which are}} owned and {{controlled}} by Government. Public dams were primarily constructed for domestic, irrigation and industrial water supply. Over time secondary uses for recreation and tourism have been established. Many of the public dams have been stocked with indigenous and alien fish species, predominantly for recreational angling. Given widespread rural unemployment, poverty and undernourishment, the development of inland fisheries on public dams and natural water bodies has much potential for improving rural livelihoods and food security. There is also potential for inclusion of communities in other value chains linked to economic activities around public dams such as recreational fishing and tourism. The public dams and natural water bodies fall under various implicit institutional arrangements depending on primary and secondary activities on a given water body. These determine the existing formal and informal power dynamics and related decision-making arrangements and controls under current use-right practices. This paper analyses the existing property rights that determine access, co-management options and governance arrangements necessary to promote sustainable development of inland fisheries in South Africa. Attention needs {{to be given to}} the various ways of explicit definition and enforcement of property and access rights if communities are to realise the potential benefits from use of public dams for fisheries and other economic activities. Achieving this will require a developmental approach based on principles of inclusive, representative, equitable, accountable and effective governance.

40|$|For {{the better}} part of the last two decades, market {{fundamentalism}} in its many formulations relied on markets as the ultimate gold standard against which all public policies were valued and compared. Today communities and regions are looking for stronger, more effective and more transparent public authorities unencumbered by and less subservient to unaccountable market forces. It has long been argued that markets should be embedded in social institutions, arrangements and practices. The two questions now at the front of the agenda are — is globalization likely to be embedded any time soon? And, how will globalization foster a just society? This paper examines a dynamic sense of the common good, or what I call the social bond. The social bond is the ethical-normative dimension of public policy arising from the relations, institutions and practices which we share in common. If we believe that globalization can be tamed, protecting the social bond is a high priority. For many countries a ‘thick and sinewy’ social bond operates to limit the intrusiveness of markets at the micro and also at the macro-public policy level. A social bond requires institutional protection, a vibrant civil society and public values to limit the reach of markets. A proactive public authority is needed to support the social bond and the active goal of building inclusive societies. In many jurisdictions, the state is no longer seen as the front <b>line</b> <b>agency</b> to contain private interest and defend public need. It is evident that the legacy of Thatcher liberalism is still with us as ‘things public ’ are attacked as being too expensive and bureaucratic. This loss of a vital and pragmatic confidence in the public has left a void, which has yet to be filled. The following paper examines the pressures and forces pushing for the re-emergence of the public domain in its multi-dimensional aspects. The public good normally refers to obligations, responsibilities and undertakings that ar...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{introduce}} the Decision Support System (DSS), which is an area informatics approach to area studies, and the research network complex based on DSS's application in Thailand. In particular, the paper presents and discusses current activities of the DSS research network {{at the national level}} in Thailand rather than being a theoretical and analytical study of the DSS mechanism or its cases. DSS has wide applications in Thailand, extending to various fields such as agricultural and natural resource management, economic and social management, historical and cultural preservation, and so on. DSS generally refers to a support system embedded into a computer system for providing intellectual resources with the appropriate numerical model necessary for decision making in production activities. Agricultural and natural resources have been the foundation of social and economic development in Thailand since the country's first national plan in the 1960 s. Decision making to maintain agricultural productivity as well as to protect natural resources requires well-integrated data sets. The Thailand Research Fund (TRF) established a DSS research and development network (TRF-DSS) in 2002 to help various research teams in Thailand develop DSS tools and components for addressing agricultural and natural resource management issues. Using a “systems” approach, the DSS framework allows researchers and users to identify and integrate key components as well as to define databases and model-base management systems. This paper focuses on the TRF-DSS research and development network, which consists of 12 universities, two line agencies in Thailand, and a <b>line</b> <b>agency</b> in Cambodia. During 2002 – 10, a total of 59 research projects were granted a budget allocation of 140. 1 million baht, and a budget of 15. 4 million baht was allocated to support activities of the network. In addition, 10 projects were funded to carry out postproject activities, with a total budget of 1. 5 million baht. More than 20 DSS tools were developed and implemented by various users, ranging from policy makers to provincial and local government agencies engaged in short- and long-term planning and management. Most DSS tools were designed to allow the integration of biophysical and socioeconomic data as well as the decision support modules for alternatives evaluation and analysis. These approaches support the choices of dynamic simulation models as well as multi-criteria analyses for modelbase software development. They also allow users to evaluate various alternatives in agricultural and natural resource management. Networking is a powerful platform for DSS research and development and may be applied to other types of research and development agenda in Thailand, such as area study projects. DSS tools contribute to an understanding of sustainability of production systems against a background of climate change, poverty reduction, and food security...|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of state institutions {{is central to}} the efficient delivery and management of infrastructure. The paper examines two models for improving the skills of managers in central and <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> of government for infrastructure procurement and management in emerging economies. The first examines the role of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) unit, a specialist agency equipped with the technical capabilities, transactional experience and budget to provide training and assistance to <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> for the effective delivery of infrastructure projects. Integrated into this model, and used by several nations, is the use of trained relationship managers to manage service contracts including government commissioned build operate transfer (BOT), outsourcing and concession arrangements. This approach uses relationship management principles whereby the regulatory framework of the contract in matters such as price, quality, service standards, and performance measurement is exercised within the contract. The second model is the Gateway approach to infrastructure project analysis and development. Gateway was initially implemented in the United Kingdom and has been widely adopted in OECD countries over the past decade as an alternative governance framework for public projects that require the participation of multiple government agencies, private advisers, several levels of approvals and close liaison between the executive and political arms of government. Gateway imposes new disciplines on the project procurement process, requires central and <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> to undertake professional development training and imposes new governance standards for large and complex infrastructure procurement projects. Evidence suggests that Gateway is playing a significant role raising the {{capacity of}} public agencies to manage large and complex procurement projects, and improving procurement performance...|$|R

They use a diagnostic questionnaire to elicit the relative {{strengths and weaknesses of}} specific systems in terms of instilling fiscal discipline, strategically assigning spending priorities, and making the best use of limited resources. In applying their methodology to a sample of seven countries (Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Malawi, New Zealand, Thailand and Uganda) they also examine how donor assistance affects expenditure outcomes. In New Zealand, reform focused on achieving general fiscal discipline and technical efficiency. In Australia, reform focused on strategic priorities and a shift from central to <b>line</b> <b>agencies.</b> The two countries took different paths, but both sought to alter incentives that affect the size, allocation, and use of resources and to improve transparency and accountability. Systems in Indonesia and Thailand were reasonably effective in instilling fiscal discipline, butIndonesia seemed better at allocating resources to protect basic social services and alleviate poverty during fiscal austerity periods. Thailand's overcentralized system did not capitalize on useful information from <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> and lower levels of government.

Donors provided incentives for short-term fiscal discipline, but the imposed spending cuts impeded the prioritizing of expenditures and multiple donor projects fragmented budgets.

40|$|Studies of {{strategic}} HRM have dominated HRM research {{over the last}} three decades. Focusing on the HRM-organisation performance relationship, researchers take various themes and perspectives in their approach to strategic HRM. Among these themes, two contrasting approaches {{of strategic}} HRM continue to flourish: first, the best practice approach suggests that certain HRM practices will have the same effect irrespective of context and, second, the best fit approach suggests that the choice of HRM practices should be designed in accordance with an organisations’ specific context. While there is little consensus on what constitutes strategic HRM, the most common feature agreed in this field is the notion of the strategic integration; aligning HRM practices with organisations’ overall strategic objectives (vertical fit) and with each other (horizontal fit). Utilising the best fit approach as its theoretical framework, this study examines how vertical and horizontal fit is practised in the Indonesian civil service and what factors likely influence the prevalence of vertical and horizontal fit in the Indonesian civil service context. This study is significant for two important reasons. Firstly, the literature suggests that there are limited studies examining the best fit concept in the civil sector despite its implementation in the private sector positively contributing to organisational performance improvement. Secondly, the study provides enlightenment on how the best fit approach could contribute to performance improvement in the Indonesian civil service. This is in line with the fact that negative images of the Indonesian civil service are continuously highlighted although various HRM reform initiatives have been put in place. To achieve the objectives of the study, the qualitative case study approach accompanied by semi-structured interviews was employed involving 53 senior officials and one focus group discussion from eight Indonesian government agencies, consisting of three central agencies mandated to manage human resources, the National Bureaucratic Reform Team and four <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> from both central and local governments. Thematic analysis was employed for data analyses and NVIVO software was used to manage the data. The study suggests three main findings. First, various HRM initiatives in relation to the HRM reform have been introduced in the Indonesian civil service differentiating them from the old HRM practices. However, the findings indicate that some HRM policies are still contradicting and hinder vertical and horizontal fit. Second, despite the contradictory policies, vertical and horizontal fit {{can be seen in the}} <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> which have been acknowledged as ‘reformed agencies’. This demonstrates that the <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> play an important role in aligning HRM practices with the line agencies’ goals and objectives and with one another although they are bounded by HRM policies that are unlikely to support the vertical and horizontal fit concept. Third, factors influencing the prevalence of vertical and horizontal fit include knowledge of contemporary HRM in both central <b>agencies</b> and <b>line</b> <b>agencies,</b> commitment from the line agencies’ leaders, devolvement of HRM to the <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> and the socio-political and economic environments of the Indonesian civil service. The findings of the study raise policy, practical and theoretical implications. In terms of policy implications, the study highlights the importance of fit in HRM policies to support the achievement of the line agencies’ goals. Therefore, when formulating an HRM policy, the central agencies need to ensure that the HRM policy is linked to line agencies’ goals and to other HRM policies. This is to ensure synchronisation among the policies and thus maximising the achievement of the line agencies’ goals. From the practical perspectives, the study highlights important points which can be learned by the central agencies in carrying out their strategic role with regard to the formulation of HRM policies; by the <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> in maximising the contribution of HRM to the achievement of the goals and objectives of the agencies through the implementation of the best fit concept, and by the leaders of the agencies in providing continuous support to each of the involved parties in the <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> and involving the HRM department in all agency’s strategic decision-making. In relation to the theoretical implication, it is clear that the best fit approach is not thoroughly applied due to factors discussed previously. However, this does not mean that the best fit concept cannot be implemented. As argued by McCourt & Ramgutty-Wong (2003), instead of adopting the whole concept of best fit, a modulated approach reflecting the best fit concept, such as selecting individual HRM practices and experimenting with devolution, is possible for civil service organisations which still embrace centralised HRM systems. As demonstrated in the findings, some of the <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> being studied seem to be ready to adopt the best fit approach given that they have knowledge of the best fit concept, strong support from the top leader, less political intervention and less corruption, collusion, and nepotism practices in their HRM practices...|$|R
