40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} in which direction policies change in periods of crisis. Do they <b>lead</b> to the <b>hardening</b> of norms or the introduction of softer rules governing public policies? Based on the study of policy change in two periods of economic governance – the 2003 / 2005 Stability and Growth Pact crisis, and the 2009 - 2013 economic governance crisis, this article explains why the policy change in the first case led to softer governance mechanisms, while during the second crisis, soft governance mechanisms were transformed into hard law. In applying the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) to study these policy changes, we argue that the wider the window of opportunity and the more coherent the coalition of policy entrepreneurs, the higher the possibility for these actors to push in favour of legally constraining norms. Hence it is not solely the power or capacity of one policy entrepreneur, in this case – the German government – that <b>leads</b> to <b>hardening</b> of soft law, but the coherence of the coalition the policy entrepreneur is able to build...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} {{research has}} been undertaken into the development of lead-extrusion damping technology. The high force-to-volume (HF 2 V) devices developed at the University of Canterbury {{have been the subject}} of much of this research. However, while these devices have undergone a limited range of velocity testing, limitations in test equipment has meant that they have never been tested at representative earthquake velocities. Such testing is important as the peak resistive force provided by the dampers under large velocity spikes is an important design input that must be known for structural applications. This manuscript presents the high-speed testing of HF 2 V devices with quasi-static force capacities of 250 - 300 kN. These devices have been subjected to peak input velocities of approximately 200 mm/s, producing peak resistive forces of approximately 350 kN. The devices show stable hysteretic performance, with slight force reduction during high-speed testing due to heat build-up and softening of the lead working material. This force reduction is recovered following cyclic loading as heat is dissipated and the <b>lead</b> <b>hardens</b> again. The devices are shown to be only weakly velocity dependent, an advantage in that they do not deliver large forces to the connecting elements and surrounding structure if larger than expected response velocities occur. This high-speed testing is an important step towards uptake as it provides important information to designers...|$|R
6000|$|Alloy.--Common bullets of lead, whether round or conical, are far {{inferior}} {{to those of}} hard alloy; for the latter penetrate much more deeply, and break bones, instead of flattening against them. A mixture of very little tin, or pewter (which is lead and tin), with <b>lead,</b> <b>hardens</b> it: we read of sportsmen melting up their spoons and dishes for this purpose. A little quicksilver has the same effect. Sir Samuel Baker, {{who is one of}} the most experienced sportsmen both in Ceylon and in Africa, latterly used a mixture of nine-tenths lead and one-tenth quicksilver for his bullets. He says, [...] "This is superior to all [other] mixtures for that purpose, as it combines hardness with extra weight; the lead must be melted in a pot by itself to a red heat, and the proportion of quicksilver must be added a ladleful at a time, and stirred quickly with a piece of iron just in sufficient quantity to make three or four bullets. If the quicksilver is subjected to red heat in the large leadpot, it will evaporate." [...] Proper alloy, or spelter, had best be ordered at a gun-maker's shop, and taken from England instead of lead: different alloys of spelter vary considerably in their degree of hardness, and therefore more than one specimen should be tried.|$|R

30|$|Hardness {{increase}} {{induced by}} annealing {{has also been}} also frequently observed in plastically deformed large-grained polycrystalline materials. This phenomenon has been named as a “strain-ageing hardening” effect which means annealing (ageing) the deformed materials <b>leads</b> to <b>hardening.</b> In Fe 97 Si 3 alloy (grain size = 30 μm) that was plastically deformed to ∼ 20 % strain, annealing at 573 K for an hour increases the hardness by ∼ 4.6 % [52]. Origin of this increased hardness, however, is different than that in our nanocrystalline Ni. In plastically deformed large-grained polycrystalline materials, the major resistance for further plastic deformation comes from the long-range stress field of multiplicated dislocations. Annealing can segregate Si to the multiplicated dislocations, increasing the stress {{that is needed to}} move these dislocations.|$|R

The sponge-dried but still moist paper is then inked with an oil-based ink, which sticks preferentially to the hardened (drier) areas. The result is a positive image in the color of the ink. As with other forms of printmaking, the ink application requires considerable skill, and no two prints are identical.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{formation}} of subgrains {{in the course}} of plastic deformation is explained {{as a result of a}} trend to make the deformation easier by locally reducing the number of active slip systems. Local preference of one slip system changes the crystal orientation with respect to stress (Schmid factor), thus leading to geometrical softening or hardening. The trend to subgrain formation is treated in the framework of continuum mechanics as an instability against internal bending for the simple case of a crystal originally oriented for symmetric double slip. Once formed, the boundaries of the subgrains <b>lead</b> to <b>hardening</b> as they induce long-range internal back stresses in the interior of the subgrains by forcing the mobile dislocations to take a bowed configuration.

40|$|Synopsis [...] The heat of {{hydration}} {{in massive}} concrete structures can raise the temperature to a level where thermal cracks etc can pose a problem. Hardening retarders are admixtures that lower the rate of hydration, distribute the heat release over time and lower maximum temperature in concrete. Such admixtures will inherently lead to lower early strength, but should lead to comparable 28 days strength to reference concrete. Relative large amounts of urea works, in particular when the additional retardation of setting (not hardening) is counteracted by the set accelerator calcium nitrate. However, these dosages are high, and urea will also slowly decompose to ammonia that may limit the urea application to outdoor use, if any. The latest potential admixtures are combinations of minor amounts of strong setting retarders like organic acids (0. 1 - 0. 3 %) with the setting accelerator calcium nitrate (1 - 3 %), where a true synergy between the two <b>leads</b> to <b>hardening</b> retardation.

In a saturated context {{and outside the}} excavation disturbed zone (EDZ), the claystone exhibits a 11. 6 -mm black rim at the cement/paste interface, which shows a different mechanical behaviour {{from the rest of}} the claystone.

The increase of the modulus of deformability in the black rim is between 15  GPa and 20  GPa according to the scale. Moreover, an overall decrease of the modulus of deformability from the smallest to the largest scale is observed in each zone. In view of the mineralogy and petrographic observations, higher values of modulus of deformability in the black rim are related to carbonate content and its distribution.

50|$|The sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) is a membrane bound structure {{found within}} muscle cells, {{that is similar}} to the endoplasmic reticulum in other cells. The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions (Ca2+). Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant, with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell. This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes (the calcium {{is said to be a}} second messenger; see calcium in biology for more details). Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate (found in chalk) and calcium phosphate, two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones. This means that too much calcium within the cells can <b>lead</b> to <b>hardening</b> (calcification) of certain intracellular structures, including the mitochondria, leading to cell death.
