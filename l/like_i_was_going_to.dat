2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? What do you mean I have to be there at 11? What do you mean I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
50|$|We {{always got}} the crowd going... We loved {{to play the}} Roaring '60s, and I would be up on that high stage they had and dance while I played this Farfisa organ I had. As I danced, I would rock the organ <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn it over into the crowd. They would scream with each rock, but I never dropped it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} the New World to-day has progressed where the Old World {{seems to have been}} {{stricken}} with a terrible blindness. Our secret-service system has never been better, and frankly I hear many things which <b>I</b> don't <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to talk to Lord Dorminster this afternoon very seriously, but in the meantime I wanted to speak to you.

5000|$|Chris Shivers - People ask {{me all the}} time. They say you know, {{what was}} your rankest bull? I say well it's hard to answer because, you know, the rankest bull I ever got on was {{probably}} Dillinger, and I was 96 and 1/2 points on him and it felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be about 88 points you know because just so in time and everything just worked {{the way it was}} supposed to, but he was a super rank bull.|$|E
5000|$|In an MTV online chat, Godsmack vocalist Sully Erna {{said that}} [...] "Awake" [...] is Godsmack [...] "getting some closure, on a past relationship". Erna then said: [...] "That's me getting closure on a relationship. I'm {{just saying that}} now I'm awake, and I'm {{able to deal with}} {{everything}} I have to deal with.

5000|$|He {{abandoned}} the album when he realised that [...] "I wasn't {{proud of the}} songs <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> performing the music because <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the way that people reacted rather than because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> proud of the songs." [...] He dropped out of university and [...] "had a real self-destructive moment" [...] and has said that [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through a quarter or a midlife crisis, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not even 20."

5000|$|The first round, {{a couple}} of belts to his head, and I see a glassy look coming over his eyes. Jesus Christ, {{a couple of}} jabs and he's going to fall down? I began to panic a little. I was {{supposed}} to be throwing a fight to this guy, and it looked <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end up holding him on his feet... By fourth round, if there was anybody in the Garden who didn't know what was happening, he must have been dead drunk." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Saatchi Art Aoshima admitted that, [...] "I was bored to death, even when I was hanging out with my friends.

50|$|In October 1953, I {{was up in}} the Canadian Rockies, {{supervising the}} {{drilling}} of an oil well. Although my family were in good health and good spirits and I was making good money, I was deeply depressed and worried. Early one morning I went up into the mountains and talked with the Lord in prayer. I told Him that although it looked <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become wealthy as a result of my oil ventures, if in His wisdom it would not be good for me or my family I hoped He would put an end to it.|$|E

50|$|Seeing {{one another}} {{about the same}} time, the MiG flight and my flight dropped extra fuel tanks.. He was so low he was {{throwing}} up small rocks. I dropped down to get him, but to hit him I had to get down in his jet wash. He'd chop the throttle and throw out his speed brakes. I would coast up beside him, wingtip to wingtip. When it looked <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> overshoot him, I would roll {{over the top and}} come down {{on the other side of}} him. When I did, he'd go into a hard turn, pulling all the Gs he could. This guy was one fantastic pilot.|$|E

He began drawing {{for hours on end}} whenever he visited his grandmother. Waichulis admitted that when he decided to go to college for art, people he had known throughout his life were baffled, “I’m a geeky kid from Northeastern Pennsylvania. When I told people I {{was going to go to}} school for art, they looked at me <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> build a nuclear missile in my backyard.” Anthony’s parents stood behind him when he decided to attend college to pursue his love for art.|$|E

5000|$|Street {{produced}} Shotter's Nation, {{the second}} album by Pete Doherty's band Babyshambles. The {{recording of the}} album {{was said to have}} been a hard process, due to Street's lack of co-operation with Pete Doherty. Street later commented that [...] "Pete wasn't in a very good state for the first couple of weeks of making the record for the reasons that people know about. It was a bit worrying to be honest with you. There were a couple of times I had to fire warning shots across his bow, say 'Listen, you've got to sort yourself out here because if you don't I can't work with you'. I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let down the rest of the band if I walked away from things." [...] Street went on to produce the band's third album Sequel to the Prequel.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{was scared}} to death,” she says, “because I had to make so many major {{decisions}} about breast reconstruction, hormonal treatments, possible chemotherapy, and everything else. My knowledge of breast cancer was only that it happened to other women, not me.” But communicating her fears, and realizing that other women had similar worries and stories to share, was empowering. “I know that this sounds hokey,” Nancy says, “but when I sat in that room, {{for the first time}} I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> live and that I was not alone. Sitting {{in a room full of}} women who were dealing with the same issues, who were also scared to death, gave me strength.” Likewise, Nancy says, her communication with a peer match counselor—a volunteer from the SHARE hotline who also had DCIS—was inspiring: “She shared her story with me, and it gave me hope.” ...|$|E
5000|$|At 2000 Sydney Games, she won two {{gold medals}} in the 100 m T46 and 200 m T46 events, and a bronze medal in the 400 m T46 event.

She said [...] "“I did feel a lot of pressure, but the greatest pressure I felt was the pressure I put on myself. I remember before my final in the 200m, I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be physically sick. I’d never felt like that before. My usual mindset was ‘whatever happens happens." [...] She won two more gold medals at the 2004 Athens Games in the 100 m and 200 m T46 events.

6000|$|... "No, Leonard," [...] she begged, [...] "please don't {{do or say}} {{anything}} foolish. Since we do meet again, though, <b>like</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to ask you one question. What made you {{come to me and}} ask me to marry you that day?" ...|$|R

5000|$|On September 27, Main Sequence {{attempted}} to gain his third consecutive Grade I {{victory in the}} Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at Belmont Park. As well as Twilight Eclipse and Imagining, his opponents included Big Blue Kitten (winner of the United Nations Stakes and the Sword Dancer Invitational in 2013) and Real Solution (winner of the Arlington Million and the Manhattan Handicap). The gelding raced in fifth before moving up into third on the outside on the final turn. He took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the renewed challenge of Twilight Eclipse to win by head. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into interference caused when Main Sequence hung to the left in the closing stages and bumped the runner-up, but allowed the result to stand. Maragh admitted that on this occasion, he may have sent the horse into the lead too early saying [...] "When he made the lead, {{it was a little}} sooner than we wanted. He started loafing a little bit; I tried to make him see the other horse and a little contact happened. I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be OK on the inquiry, but it was nerve-wracking." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jack Burke, Jr. said he {{was never}} {{comfortable}} taking advice from a caddie and that he always gave them the same instructions {{before the start of}} a tournament: [...] "If you will stand two club lengths from my ball at all times, and don't step onto the putting green once, you will get a very nice tip when we're finished." [...] Burke said he only broke this policy one time in his professional career—during the 1956 Masters Tournament when assessing a four-foot putt on the 18th hole.I surveyed the putt and didn't like what I saw one bit. It was downhill, left to right and fast as the devil. This putt was so frightening, the consequences of missing it so great, I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pass out. That's when I called Pappy over.Jack Burke, Jr.Burke said that Pappy was [...] "one of the great Augusta National caddies" [...] and that he knew all of the dips and swales on the course. [...] Burke {{went on to say that}} he never relied on Stokes but that he needed him at that time. Burke said he whispered to Stokes: [...] "It's inside the left edge, right?", and that he remembered Stokes words, and his soothing voice—"It sure is, pro. Just go on and cruise her on in there." [...] Burke made the putt and subsequently won the tournament that year.|$|E
5000|$|Snyder-Hill {{grew up in}} Upper Sandusky, Ohio. One of {{the things}} he remembers about his {{childhood}} was the local newspaper running an April Fool's joke on April 1, 1994 about gay people and the KKK. The [...] "joke" [...] was that gay people and the KKK would march at a parade in the small conservative town. [...] As a child it bothered him, reinforcing the idea that it was wrong to be gay, he writes in his book. Later in life, after all of the activism and publicity on September 27, 2014, the same newspaper honored him in an article about his activism. [...] He uses this as an example of Trusting the Power of your voice and how it can change hearts and minds. In his book Soldier of Change from the closet to the forefront of the gay rights movement, he details his coming out while at war. Describing a night of an artillery battle he describes, [...] "All of the sudden there was a huge explosion off to our left. That {{was the first time in}} my life I thought I might actually die. I happened to look up at a picture of my brother and his girlfriend. All those years of hiding who I was, being scared of it and not admitting or understanding it stopped right then. My whole life had been fake. And if I were to die, I would have never been honest with myself, never let myself love another person. I was so scared, and I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die alone." [...] He later discusses how a visit to Dachau when he lived in Germany also changed his life. He took pictures while visiting this holocaust site. One of the photos was a uniform with a pink triangle on it. He didn't understand at the time what that meant, but later while in college he started wearing gay pride symbols and one of the was the pink triangle with the inscription Silence = Death. He attributes that moment in his life to the moment when he was thrust into Activism. [...] He then started speaking out while in college at The Ohio State University. A student had written a letter in the college newspaper The Lantern. The student thanked gay people for leaving Columbus to march on Washington, and said that for the first time in his life he didn't have to worry about contracting AIDS. This infuriated Snyder-Hill, who for the first time publicly wrote back a response. Snyder-Hill writes [...] "I have recently come out, I am no different than you; well, you know, I might be a little different - I just got back from defending my country in Operation Desert Storm. When I say defending my country I mean defending everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation - that means everyone, including you. [...] From this point on Snyder-Hill knew he had a calling to defend LGBT rights. He was out during college, but when he decided to re-join the US Army Reserve in March of 2001, everything would change. He had to go back into the closet ...|$|E
