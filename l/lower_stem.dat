500|$|Aloe vera is a {{stemless}} or very short-stemmed plant {{growing to}} 60–100cm (24–39in) tall, spreading by offsets. The leaves are thick and fleshy, green to grey-green, with some varieties showing white flecks on their upper and <b>lower</b> <b>stem</b> surfaces. The {{margin of the}} leaf is serrated and has small white teeth. The flowers are produced in summer on a spike up to [...] tall, each flower being pendulous, with a yellow tubular corolla 2–3cm (0.8–1.2in) long. Like other Aloe species, Aloe vera forms arbuscular mycorrhiza, a symbiosis that allows the plant better access to mineral nutrients in soil.|$|E

50|$|Agrotis segetum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} species of Noctuid moths whose larvae are called cutworms. The larvae are generally grey, sometimes tinged with purple. They attack the roots and <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> of a huge range of plants (see list below) and can be a particularly serious pest of root vegetables and cereals. Attacking the <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> often results in cutting down seedlings, which is why this species is classed as a cutworm.|$|R
500|$|Gills {{are free}} and closely spaced, and white in colour. They can be thick, and are often forked. The stem is [...] long, and [...] x [...] thick. [...] It is lightly stuffed (filled with a cottony tissue) and then hollow, {{and there is a}} slight {{tapering}} to the top. It is white in colour, with flat grey hairs, often in a zig-zag pattern. It does not bear a ring and has fragile, cottony, brownish or charcoal-coloured oblique girdles of volval remnants around the stem base and <b>lower</b> <b>stem.</b> The volva is white to grey, powdery and delicate. The flesh is white and does not change colour when cut. Although it lacks any distinctive odor, it tastes sweet.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its modern}} {{use as a}} numeral (as {{with the other two}} episema, stigma and koppa) no {{difference}} is normally made in print between an upper case and lower case form; the same character is typically used in both environments. However, occasionally special typographic variants adapted to an upper case style have also been employed in print. The issue of designing such uppercase variants has become more prominent since the decision of Unicode to encode separate character codepoints for uppercase and lowercase sampi. Several different designs are currently found. Older versions of the Unicode charts showed a glyph with a crooked and thicker <b>lower</b> <b>stem</b> (...) [...] While this form has been adopted in some modern fonts, it has been replaced in more recent versions of Unicode with a simpler glyph, similar to the lowercase forms (...)

50|$|Some {{parts of}} the iris are poisonous. Because both the foliage and {{rhizomes}} are toxic, most mammalian herbivores usually leave Iris untouched, although the Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) occasionally feeds on their rhizomes and <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> and the White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) sometimes nibbles the leaf edges.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{principle}} of aeroponic growing is to grow plants suspended {{in a closed}} or semi-closed environment by spraying the plant's [...] roots and <b>lower</b> <b>stem</b> with an atomized or sprayed, nutrient-rich water solution. The leaves and crown, often called the canopy, extend above. The roots of the plant are separated by the plant support structure. Often, closed-cell foam is compressed around the <b>lower</b> <b>stem</b> and inserted into {{an opening in the}} aeroponic chamber, which decreases labor and expense; for larger plants, trellising is used to suspend the weight of vegetation and fruit.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assay the disease {{incidence}} degree of Sclerotium rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii in sixteen most popular commercial cultivars of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) in Republic of Korea. The degree of disease incidence was evaluated on pot experiments. In pot experiments using artificial inoculation, the Sclerotium rolfsii caused a stem rot on seedling of sweet potato plants and causes a crown rot on <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> near or at the soil line at favorable environmental conditions. White mycelial mats and sclerotia were formed at the infection sites. Plants severely infected were fell over or died because <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> near soil surface were rotten. The degree of disease incidence was varied according to cultivars. Two cultivars, Bio-mi and Deayumi, were very resistant, while five cultivars, Shinjami, Shingeonmi, Hongmi, Yeonjami, and Shinhung- 3 were highly susceptible...|$|R

50|$|The {{best way}} to manage this disease is to prevent it by {{avoiding}} injuries to the roots and <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> of sugar maples. This {{can be accomplished by}} using the same, well-placed trails every year through the sugar bush and by using tubing systems instead of buckets to collect sap. When infection does occur, the tree should be cut down and the wood promptly removed to reduce inoculum.|$|R

50|$|The Rafflesiaceae are {{a family}} of rare {{parasitic}} plants found in the tropical forests of east and southeast Asia, including Rafflesia arnoldii, which has the largest flowers of all plants. The plants are endoparasites of vines in the genus Tetrastigma (Vitaceae) and lack stems, leaves, roots, and any photosynthetic tissue. They rely entirely on their host plants for both water and nutrients, and only the emerge as flowers from the roots or <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> of the host plants.|$|R
40|$|Water {{relations}} in cotton plants infected with Phymatotrichum omnivorum were studied {{to determine the}} mechanism of wilt development. Relationships between leaf water and osmotic potentials, relative water contents, and diffusive resistances of leaves from diseased and waterstressed healthy plants were similar, indicating that wilting was not due to changes in leaf osmotic regulation. Rates of recovery from wilting, measured as increases in relative water content with time in both diseased and waterstressed healthy plants were identical. There {{was no significant difference}} in root dry weight of healthy and diseased plants, indicating that wilting is not a consequence of reduced root area. Resistance to water flow in roots and <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> increased significantly over those of healthy plants as upper leaves of diseased plants began to wilt. However, resistance to water flow in petioles of diseased plants was unchanged. These results show that wilting in cotton plants is probably the consequence of increased resistance to water flow in roots. Results of a preliminary study indicate that a high-molecular-weight substance produced by the fungus in culture may cause blockage of xylem elements in roots and <b>lower</b> <b>stems</b> and contribute to the increased resistance to water flow...|$|R
25|$|Allium tricoccum is a bulb-forming {{perennial}} with broad, smooth, {{light green}} leaves, often with deep purple or burgundy tints on the <b>lower</b> <b>stems,</b> and a scallion-like stalk and bulb. Both the white lower leaf stalks and the broad green leaves are edible. The flower stalk appears after the leaves have died back, unlike the similar Allium ursinum, in which leaves and flowers {{can be seen}} at the same time. Ramps grow in close groups strongly rooted just {{beneath the surface of the}} soil.|$|R
