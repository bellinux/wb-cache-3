Ten mini-modules of glass /encapsulant /backsheet {{structure}} were laminated under {{the condition of}} the same curing time and pressure, but different curing temperatures and aged in damp-heat accelerated ageing test in order to investigate the effect of temperature on the durability of PV module packaging and performance. Results show that the mini-modules using EVA as encapsulant were affected more by the <b>laminating</b> <b>temperature</b> compared to the mini-modules using modified ionomer. For EVA modules, samples with relatively low curing temperatures at 135 - 140 ºC appeared to have higher adhesion between EVA and glass, lower moisture permeability into module and better dielectric of cells than those with high curing temperatures...|$|E

La 0. 4 Sr 0. 6 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) -SDC cathode was coated on the SDC electrolytes to form a single cell. The lamination was tried at different laminating temperatures and pressures and the co-firing was carried out at different temperatures. The results showed that the <b>laminating</b> <b>temperature</b> should above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the binder. The laminating pressure of 70 MPa resulted in warp of the samples. The best co-firing temperature of the anode-supported SDC film electrolyte was 1400 °C. The SDC film electrolyte formed well adherence to the anode. The NiO-YSZ anode had larger flexural strength than the NiO-SDC anode.

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} are sought for optimal temperature distributions {{to control the}} interlaminar stresses near the free edges of composite laminates subjected to uniaxial loading. Optimal through-thickness temperature gradients are obtained by minimizing appropriate performance indices that are functions of the far-field properties, {{with respect to the}} through-thickness temperature differences. Through the application of these temperatures, effects of local mismatches as well as global mismatches in two of the elastic properties, the Poisson's ratio and coefficient of mutual influence, are minimized. Numerical examples are given for several lay-ups made of graphite epoxy. It is shown that for a cross- or angle-ply <b>laminate</b> a uniform <b>temperature</b> rise or drop can completely eliminate all of the interlaminar stresses, whereas for other <b>laminates</b> nonuniform <b>temperature</b> distributions must be applied to minimize the stresses...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} interlaminar and tool–laminate shear tests {{performed}} on a twill 2 2 PP/glass fabric {{are described in}} this paper. The influence of the <b>laminate</b> <b>temperature,</b> pullout velocity and normal pressure on the interlaminar shear stress and friction coefficient are evaluated, {{as well as the}} effect of cooling the specimen from the melt to simulate real forming conditions. Opposite trends were observed for the variation of the shear stress and friction coefficient whether the tests were performed above the melt temperature of the matrix or above the crystallization temperature (135, 140, and 155 C) after cooling from the melt temperature. For the interlaminar shear tests, this was caused by the shift from an interlaminar to an intralaminar shear deformation mode occurring. For the tool–laminate shear tests, this was caused by the shift from matrix shear at the interface tool–laminate to direct Coulomb friction of the fibers with the tool with an increase of the normal pressure and/or an increase of the matrix viscosity with decreasing temperatures. Above the melt temperature of the matrix, the friction coefficient and shear stress were higher at the tool–laminate interface than in the interlaminar region while at temperatures close to the crystallization temperature they became lower at the tool–laminate interface. A summary of these observations is made and a discussion of their possible impact on the forming of parts is enlightened...|$|R

Results indicate that the mechanical properties of Kevlar 49 /epoxy <b>laminates</b> are <b>temperature</b> dependent over the range- 55 &deg;C to 150 &deg;C. The addition of moisture magnifies temperature sensitivity. At 150 &deg;C and near saturation moisture content (5 weight percent), a strength loss of 60 - 70 percent and an effective stiffness loss of 40 percent from dry, room temperature values are measured. At 21 &deg;C, saturated specimens {{are found to be}} 35 - 40 per-cent weaker than dry material. At low temperature (- 55 &deg;C), strengths increase with the addition of moisture. Over the range of conditions tested, failure was not catastrophic, but was characterized by a loss in load carry-ing capacity. Microscopic examination of failure modes indicates that flexural strength is determined by the ease with which filaments compres-sively buckle. These results indicate that care must be taken when design-ing with Kevlar-reinforced composites for use at elevated temperatures after exposure to moist environments. An accurate prediction of the ex-pected composite moisture content and service temperature is important to the design process...|$|R

40|$|The Composite Fitting Attachment (COFA) {{system was}} {{developed}} by Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) to join thermoplastic (TP) brackets to carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) using ultrasonic welding. This complex process means experimental characterisation of the joint is crucial. Three aspects of the joint formation were investigated: weld development over time, temperature in the weld and surrounding laminate, and failure loads of the joint. Weld development over time was investigated using cross sectional micrographs, differential scanning calorimetry and hot stage. This indicated under a given set of weld parameters, the energy director of the COFA joint started to collapse after 0. 025 secs of ultrasonic vibration and collapse distance is directly proportional to the input actuator energy. Various spherulite sizes were observed at the joint interface divided by striations suggesting varying cooling rates in the TP during resolidification. Minimal percentage crystallinity changes using various cooling rates were measured. Interface and through thickness <b>laminate</b> <b>temperatures</b> were measured using thermocouples. Measured interface temperatures were in excess of 500 °C and 300 °C for joints welded at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. Maximum times for which any portion of the laminates measured above 200 °C were under 1 second and just over 1 second for joints welded at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. These short times {{are expected to be}} insufficient to allow thermal degradation of the laminates during welding. Failure test of COFA joint were performed under axial, transverse and shear loads. The shear load test case was newly developed to fully characterise the load-bearing capabilities of the joint. All tests passed the 200 N requirement. Transverse loading applied at 90 ° to the CFRP's first ply is the critical load case. Three different failure mechanisms were observed including CFRP laminate damage through first ply fibre pull out.
