5|$|The Modells' {{collaboration}} with U2 {{for the film}} was facilitated by their involvement with the band in researching <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> technology in 1997 for use at Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards. At the time, the only giant <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> in existence was being used by U2 on their PopMart Tour. To learn about the technology, David Modell toured with U2 on-and-off {{for a period of}} six months. During that time, he befriended Catherine Owens, who served as the group's art director since their 1992 Zoo TV Tour.|$|E

5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{followed}} in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its cymbal and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog sounds. In the 1990s, Roland included {{samples of the}} 808 in its successful Groovebox devices. In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 reissue with features including an <b>LED</b> <b>display,</b> MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E

50|$|Most watches with <b>LED</b> <b>displays</b> {{required}} that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds, because LEDs used so much power {{that they could not}} be kept operating continuously. Watches with <b>LED</b> <b>displays</b> were popular for a few years, but soon the <b>LED</b> <b>displays</b> were superseded by liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness you had to press a button to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.|$|R
