40|$|Antimicrobial {{photodynamic}} therapy (APDT) combined with endodontic treatment {{has been recognized}} as an alternative approach to complement conventional root canal disinfection methods on bacterial biofilms. We developed an in vitro model of bioluminescent Candida albicans biofilm inside curved dental root canals and investigated the microbial reduction produced when different light delivery methods are employed. Each light delivery method was evaluated in respect to the <b>light</b> <b>distribution</b> provided inside <b>curved</b> root canals. After conventional endodontic preparation, teeth were sterilized before canals were contaminated by a bioluminescent strain of C. albicans (CEC 789). Methylene blue (90 μM) was introduced into the canals and then irradiated (λ[*]=[*] 660 nm, P[*]=[*] 100 mW, beam diameter[*]=[*] 2 mm) with laser tip either in contact with pulp chamber or within the canal using an optical diffuser fiber. <b>Light</b> <b>distribution</b> was evaluated by CCD camera, and microbial reduction was monitored through bioluminescence imaging. Our findings demonstrated that the bioluminescent C. albicans biofilm model had good reproducibility and uniformity. <b>Light</b> <b>distribution</b> in dental tissue was markedly dependent on the light delivery system, and this strategy was directly related to microbial destruction. Both light delivery systems performed significant fungal inactivation. However, when irradiation was performed with optical diffuser fiber, microbial burden reduction was nearly 100 times more effective. Bioluminescence is an interesting real-time analysis to endodontic C. albicans biofilm inactivation. APDT showed {{to be an effective}} way to inactivate C. albicans biofilms. Diffuser fibers provided optimized <b>light</b> <b>distribution</b> inside <b>curved</b> root canals and significantly increased APDT efficiency.

The sample contains 87 classical Cepheids pulsating in one, two or three radial modes, 924 type II Cepheids divided into BL Her, W Vir, peculiar W Vir, and RV Tau stars, and 20 anomalous Cepheids - first such objects found in the Galactic bulge. Additionally, we upgrade the OGLE Collection of RR Lyr stars in the Galactic bulge by adding 828 newly identified variables. For all Cepheids and RR Lyr stars, we publish time-series VI photometry obtained during the OGLE-IV project, from 2010 through 2017. We discuss basic properties of our classical pulsators: their spatial <b>distribution,</b> <b>light</b> <b>curve</b> morphology, period-luminosity relations, and position in the Petersen diagram.

40|$|AbstractCardiovascular {{effects are}} {{considered}} frequent during drug safety testing.

These effects were analyzed using statistical analysis and cloud representation with marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> for the contractility index and heart rate as to assess the effect relationship between cardiac variables. Arterial blood pressure, left ventricular pressure, electrocardiogram and body temperature were monitored. The application of data cloud with marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> to heart rate and contractility index provided an interesting tactic during the interpretation of drug-induced changes particularly during selective time resolution (i. e. marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> restricted to Tmax). Taken together, the present data suggests that marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>curves</b> can be a valuable interpretation strategy when using the rat cardiovascular telemetry model to detect drug-induced cardiovascular effects.

Morphologies and sizes of mesophase microbeads are characterized by scanning electronic microcopy (SEM), polarized light optical microphotography (PLOM) and laser particle size analyzer. SEM and PLOM results exhibit that mesophase microbeads have a narrow size distribution and many large particle in heterogeneous system. In homogeneous system, there are a great deal of smaller mesophase microbeads and a very little of larger mesophase microbeads. The laser particle size analysis results show that size distribution of mesophase microbeads in heterogeneous system is quite different from that in homogeneous system. There are multi-peaks on volume <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> in heterogeneous system. Larger mesophase microbeads are mainly in tens micron peak of size <b>distribution</b> <b>curve.</b> In homogeneous system, particle size of mesophase microbeads has a wide distribution and only single peak on size <b>distribution</b> <b>curve.</b> Moreover, sulfur concentration in reaction system makes the size of mesophase microbeads increase and the size <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> move to larger particle diameter.

The study includes results of numerous water retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity predictions from the particle size <b>distribution</b> <b>curve.</b> These predictions were accomplished for both forested and agricultural soils. Predicting water retention characteristics from particle size <b>distribution</b> <b>curve</b> could be accomplished at a reasonable level of accuracy when the semi-physical and van Genuchten's methods were used.
