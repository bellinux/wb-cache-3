5|$|Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991, Tuđman {{met with}} Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, both ethnic Croats, in the Banski dvori. The {{purpose of the}} meeting was to persuade Marković to leave his {{position}} {{as the head of}} the Yugoslav federal government, which he appeared reluctant to do, and to discuss the need for Croatia's independence. The meeting was adjourned for lunch that was to be attended by presidential aides. Tuđman made another effort at persuading Marković, trying to appeal to his Croatian origin. The three left the lunch as dessert was being served and moved into the president's office to continue their discussion. After Tuđman <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> everyone else followed.|$|E

25|$|The {{participants}} {{who refused to}} administer the final shocks neither insisted that the experiment be terminated, nor <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to check {{the health of the}} victim without requesting permission to leave, as per Milgram's notes and recollections, when fellow psychologist Philip Zimbardo asked him about that point.|$|E

25|$|The countess {{entered the}} room again to find Elisabeth distraught and weeping uncontrollably. At this point, the Emperor {{appeared}} outside her apartments, {{and was forced to}} wait there with Nopcsa, who was controlling himself only with great effort. The Empress broke the news to her husband in private; he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> a broken man.|$|E
25|$|Describing {{the alleged}} rape, {{she said that}} {{what began as a}} consensual sexual {{encounter}} in her room turned non-consensual. She alleged that Nungesser choked her, slapped her face, held her wrists, and anally raped her, while she struggled and told him to stop. Sulkowicz said that after the alleged assault, Nungesser immediately <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> without speaking.|$|E
25|$|In this {{capacity}} he achieved considerable notoriety in Rome for his violent actions, frequently ordering {{the execution of}} suspected traitors on the spot. When in 79, a plot by Aulus Caecina Alienus and Eprius Marcellus to overthrow Vespasian was uncovered, Titus invited Alienus to dinner and ordered him to be stabbed before he had even <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

25|$|One method Nilsson {{used for}} murdering the {{children}} {{was to put}} them into a washtub and then place heavy objects—such as a washboard and coal scuttle—on top of them. She then <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and returned hours later when the children were dead. The next step in her procedure was to burn their bodies. On occasions when she did not burn them, she dug graves and buried them.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Milligan played {{games with}} the medium itself. Whole scenes were written in which {{characters}} would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, {{but it would be}} another character who had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June {{after the}} match between England and Algeria a fan {{was able to}} break through the FIFA-appointed {{security}} staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room. The breach took place shortly after Prince William and Prince Harry had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The trespasser was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The Football Association lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.|$|E
60|$|Those who dwelt in {{the city}} staked gold and silver coin, while the men just {{returned}} from the mines staked gold-dust and nuggets. These last were conspicuous from their rough clothing, rugged, bronzed, and weather-worn countenances. Many of them played most recklessly. Several successful diggers staked immense sums, and either doubled or lost, {{in two or three}} throws, the hard earnings of many months of toil, and <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> penniless.|$|R

25|$|Hitchcock {{went down}} to his room to sleep. Three times he heard {{knocks on the door}} only to find no one there. After finding another cadet drunk, Hitchcock saw Davis head over to room No. 5 where {{thirteen}} cadets were partying. Davis, seeing Hitchcock's arrival, warned the other cadets. The captain entered the room, ordering one of the cadets to open up another cadet's footlocker, but the cadet refused. Hitchcock ordered no more disorder, <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and started looking for Thornton around 04:50.|$|E
25|$|With emotion {{still in}} his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again {{recapped}} the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining {{the significance of the}} pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, {{and that there was no}} report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for a while.|$|E
25|$|While {{working as}} a teacher, Johnson also read the law {{to prepare for the}} bar. In 1897, he was the first African American {{admitted}} to the Florida Bar Exam since the Reconstruction era ended. He was also the first black in Duval County to seek admission to the state bar. In order to be accepted, Johnson had a two-hour oral examination before three attorneys and a judge. He later recalled that one of the examiners, not wanting to see a black man admitted, <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Johnson drew on his law background especially during his years as a civil rights activist and leading the NAACP.|$|E

25|$|Tournament {{organiser}} Danny Jordaan dismissed {{concerns that}} {{the attack on the}} Togo national team which took place in Angola in January 2010, had any relevance to the security arrangements for the World Cup. There were also reports of thefts against visitors to the country for the World Cup. Tourists from China, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Japan and Colombia had become victims of crime. On 19 June after the match between England and Algeria, a fan was able to break through the FIFA-appointed security staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room.

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of July 25, Stokes met with African American civic leaders who had participated in the Mayor's Committee effort. For the most part, only militant groups had participated in the peace patrols. Moderate {{neighborhood}} leaders, like pastors, had largely stayed home, and the militants and some other African American civic leaders deeply resented the lack of participation by moderates. There was general agreement that the Mayor's Committee had been only partially effective, and a curfew was discussed. While the group debated, Stokes <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and held a press conference at which he announced the National Guard would once more patrol Glenville's streets. The mayor's announcement left many African American leaders feeling betrayed. Other black officials and white business owners criticized Stokes for using the Mayor's Committee patrols in the first place, which they viewed as a complete failure.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} appearance in London was opposite Agnes Nicholls, in Wallfahrt nach Kevlaar by Engelbert Humperdinck at the St James's Hall, with the Handel Society under J. S. Liddle in late April 1903, and immediately afterwards he {{appeared at the}} Westmorland Festival. In June 1903 he was auditioned at the Royal College of Music in London by Charles Villiers Stanford, who <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and brought Hubert Parry in to hear him as well. The violinist Professor Kruse, who was then attempting to revive the Saturday 'Pops' at the St James's Hall jumped {{out of his chair}} and promptly engaged him, and it was Kruse who arranged for his first appearance in Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius early in 1904 as an addition to his Beethoven Festival. Harry Plunket Greene, who had encouraged Elwes through this audition, also remained his lifelong friend.|$|E

25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey’s words “air {{his views}} freely unhampered by the {{presence}} of that old dragon Robertson”. He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee’s conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that “The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated.” It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly McKenna were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as “the Kitchener dodge” and was angry at the discussion behind his back and, concerned that Lloyd George wanted to “play hanky panky”, refused to go.|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with Lotshe and Thompson, {{the king was}} still hesitant to make a decision. Thompson appealed to Lobengula with a rhetorical question: [...] "Who gives a man an assegai [...] if he expects to be attacked by him afterwards?" [...] Seeing the allusion to the offered Martini–Henry rifles, Lobengula was swayed by this logic, and {{made up his mind}} to grant the concession. [...] "Bring me the fly-blown paper and I will sign it," [...] he said. Thompson briefly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to call Rudd, Maguire, Helm and Dreyer in, and they sat in a semi-circle around the king. Lobengula then put his mark to the concession, which read: ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the talus pueblos were built on the south facing side of the mesas. During winter months the afternoon sun would warm the southern cliffs melting the snow, but the northern facing cliffs frequently had snow all winter long. Imagine what it must have been like to live in the talus pueblos during the long winter months. In this arid environment, firewood was scarce, and the fires that were built <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> full of smoke.|$|R
