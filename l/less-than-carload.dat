25|$|The new {{railroad}} {{was organized}} under {{the presidency of}} Robert Frazer, a precocious civil engineer formerly employed by the Lehigh Valley Coal Company. Frazer's first goal was to reduce dependence on ore traffic by extending the railroad from a wye at Struble to State College. The branch would carry passenger traffic, <b>less-than-carload</b> freight, and coal for the college power plant. Because of the railroad's slender financial reserves, the Oreland Branch was removed and its rails used for the State College extension. The first train ran over the new branch on April 2, 1892. The original station was located at College Avenue and Frazier Street and built in the Queen Anne style. The building of the extension also increased passenger service, with three trips per day (except Sunday) each way from Bellefonte to State College, and two per day each way from Waddle to Red Bank. The Bellefonte Central also promoted passenger traffic by building an amusement park on the former Benjamin Hunter farm, which it called Hunter's Park, and by investing in the University Inn, which provided hotel accommodations for visitors to Penn State and had its own stop on the railroad. However, the railroad discontinued passenger service on the Red Bank Branch in 1894. Many of the miners had left the area when ore banks shut down after Bellefonte Furnace went out of blast, and few riders remained for the Waddleâ€“Red Bank trains.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{passengers}} generally {{were not}} allowed access to the baggage car, they were included in {{a great number of}} passenger trains as regular equipment. The baggage car is a car that was normally placed between the train's motive power and the remainder of the passenger train. [...] The car's interior is normally wide open and is used to carry passengers' checked baggage. Baggage cars were also sometimes commissioned by freight companies to haul <b>less-than-carload</b> (LCL) shipments along passenger routes (Railway Express Agency was one such freight company). Some baggage cars included restroom facilities for the train crew, so many baggage cars had doors to access them just like any other passenger car. [...] Baggage cars could be designed to look like the rest of a passenger train's cars, or they could be repurposed box cars equipped with high-speed trucks and passenger train steam and air connections. A special type of baggage car came equipped with doors on one end to facilitate transport of [...] large pieces of equipment and scenery for Broadway shows and other productions. These [...] "theatrical" [...] baggage cars were assigned theatrical names (i.e. Romeo and Juliet), and were similar to the [...] "horse cars" [...] that were used to transport racehorses.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{considerable}} {{planning and}} expenditure in 1930 {{was going into}} improving the passenger operation, it was hoped to increase revenue from the IR's freight business. <b>Less-than-carload</b> (LCL) overnight deliveries [...] between the various IR-linked towns (and to or from Ohio) was not available from the competing railroads; the latter typically required {{two to three days}} to complete a shipment. An example is delivering machined parts made in Terre Haute overnight to Fort Wayne auto manufacturer Auburn. Prior to 1930, cartage business already existed due to the interurban's ties to local power companies. At night the IR's arch windowed wood bodied box motors would rumble down the quiet brick streets of an Indiana town towing one or two gondolas loaded with coal for the local power plant. In some cases, freight trains operating on city streets became an objection of town councils, particularly if those trains operated during the day. Many merchants, newspapers, and small manufacturing companies used the frequent interurban scheduling provided. Had this freight business increased with an improving economy along with the greater sales generated by a motivated sales force, the IR would have had a promising future. The idea was a good one, but the national economy didn't improve. Instead, it collapsed further. When the Indiana Railroad lost its important freight interchange connection with neighboring interurban Dayton and Western (which connected at Dayton with the busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban to the Ohio towns of Toledo, Cincinnati, Springfield, and Columbus) prospects for the line's survival were poor. The C abandoned operations in early 1938 when it lost its interurban connection to Cleveland. The IR continued to barely survive with just Indiana freight business, but its lines were abandoned one by one. Today, one operation on IR track survives as the Southern Indiana Railroad between Speed and Watson Jct handling concrete from Essroc Cement for interchange with the CSX/B at Watson trains using diesel locomotives.|$|E

5000|$|Graham Paper was {{incorporated}} in August 1880. [...] In 1897, the company experienced a major financial setback {{with the loss}} of large stock inventory, due to a fire that destroyed half of the Security warehouse in St. Paul, Minnesota. [...] In the late 1890s, the company decided to relocate from the waterfront district to the Cupples block, a state-of-the-art industrial development project being constructed in the Mill Creek Valley area of St. Louis. According to geographer Virginia Henry, many business elite considered the move ill-advised, as it was commonly believed that Graham Paper was moving too far from its business contacts in the downtown area. [...] She notes, however, that [...] "the move proved to be a wise one for not long afterward many of the printers in the old town began moving out and locating further west." [...] Additionally, she notes: [...] Among the numerous economies furnished to the tenants in the Cupples Station Blocks were those of elimination of delay and expense of drayage, saving of waste and damage to goods in handling, and transaction of business entirely under cover, especially advantageous during inclement weather. Also, they were able {{to make use of the}} practice of <b>less-than-carload</b> lots--the assembling of <b>less-than-carload</b> shipments into carloads.|$|E

50|$|Freight railroads {{continued}} to decline as motor freight captured {{a significant portion}} of the <b>less-than-carload</b> business. This loss of business, when combined the highly regulated operating environment and constrained pricing power, forced many railroads into receivership and the nationalization of several critical eastern carriers into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Deregulation of the railroads by the Staggers Act in 1980 created a regulatory environment more favorable to the economics of the railroad industry. In the 1990s, the increase in foreign trade and intermodal container shipping led to a revival of the freight railroads, which have effectively consolidated into two eastern and two western private transportation networks: Union Pacific and BNSF in the west, and CSX and Norfolk Southern in the east. Canadian National Railway took over the Illinois Central route down the Mississippi River valley.|$|E

50|$|Organized as an Iowa {{corporation}} on February 12, 1881, {{the railroad}} was built with 113 mi of track. It had 18 locomotives on its roster as it started operations, and by 1898 the H&S listed 14 locomotives. Most original H&S locomotives were 4-4-0s {{built by the}} Pittsburgh Locomotive Co. The H&S track was built connecting Humeston, Iowa westward to Shenandoah, Iowa. To the east it handed traffic off to the MI&N and, later, to the Keokuk and Western Railroad, successor to the MI&N. The H&S had enough business and was doing well enough to be acquired outright by the Burlington Route in 1901. Primary traffic {{on the line in}} the early 1900s was bituminous coal mined in southern Iowa, grains, cattle and livestock, <b>less-than-carload</b> merchandise, and timber products. The railroad also had a considerable passenger business up until about 1920.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} change made under the Terra Transport subsidiary was {{the move to}} the carriage of <b>less-than-carload</b> (LCL) freight. A large fleet of distinctive green intermodal shipping containers were ordered and used in place of boxcars. These containers could be stacked on flatcars of mainland trains, fitted onto the decks inside the ferries, and then placed on flatcars of trains in Newfoundland or transported entirely by truck. During the mid-1980s, trains composed almost entirely of the distinctive TT containers were common. The handling time for freight dropped considerably, as containers could be easily removed from the trains in each community and the loading/unloading at Port aux Basques was significantly improved over standard freight cars. Another significant change the closure and abandonment all of CN's branch lines in the province by 1984, leaving only the main line operational.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1960s, the PGE {{operated}} an intermodal {{service that}} transported truck trailers between North Vancouver and Prince George, and to places further north. Unlike {{most of the}} railway's other traffic, most of the intermodal traffic was northbound. In April 1982, the railway combined its piggyback and <b>less-than-carload</b> (LCL) services {{to form a new}} Intermodal Services Department. BC Rail halted its intermodal services in 2002. Starting in 1958, the railway started to haul grain from the Peace River District, serving grain elevators at Dawson Creek, Buick, Fort St. John, and Taylor. With an amendment to the Western Grain Transportation Act in 1985 that included the railway in the Act, it became economical for the railway to transport grain, and it also carried grain from Northern Alberta bound for Prince Rupert, interchanging with CN at Dawson Creek and Prince George.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} sidings also {{exist on the}} NHRR. At Buckingham Valley, a small siding that once served the Buckingham Valley Trolley Association is {{presently}} used as a Repair-in-progress, or RIP-track. At Wycombe, the team track once used for <b>less-than-carload</b> deliveries is utilized as car storage {{for a number of}} NHRR's out-of-service passenger cars. At Grenoble, another siding created by severing the southern switch of a passing siding is present. This siding once held a number of pieces of equipment that were eventually scrapped. Today only passenger car 1542 remains on this siding as it was flipped over onto its side by vandals. At Ivyland, exists another RIP-track, typically used for storing MoW equipment. The final siding on the railroad is in Warminster {{on the north side of}} the Street Road crossing. This siding is used for short-term storage of interchange freight equipment and storing the diesel locomotive assigned to freight service when not in use.|$|E
5000|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's Northern Central {{line was}} double-tracked and {{equipped}} with block signals between Baltimore and Harrisburg by World War I. The line carried heavy passenger and freight traffic until the 1950s. On-line freight included flour, paper, milk, farm products, coal, and <b>less-than-carload</b> shipments between such settlements as White Hall, Parkton, Bentley Springs, Lutherville, {{and the city}} of Baltimore. Local commuter service, referred to as the [...] "Parkton local," [...] operated over the 28 mi between Calvert Station in Baltimore and Parkton, Maryland. Long distance passenger trains equipped with sleepers and dining cars were also operated by the PRR over the line from Baltimore Penn Station to Buffalo, Toronto, Chicago, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri, with through-sleeping car service as far as Houston, Texas (see 1955 timetable, below). Much of the PRR through freight service to points west was routed via its electrified Port Road Branch along the Susquehanna River to Enola Yard in Harrisburg, however, instead of the Northern Central line.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Shore Electric {{went into}} {{bankruptcy}} on October 5, 1932. It continued operation under court ordered receivership thereafter until abandonment. As its passenger business waned {{with the increasing}} number of private automobiles on paved roads and the effects of the Depression, it outlasted most connecting interurban lines by concentrating on freight business. LSE had developed a marginally profitable freight service interchanging with the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad at Toledo to deliver <b>less-than-carload</b> (LCL) freight from southern Ohio factories to Cleveland. The C&LE traction freights continued straight through Toledo to Cleveland on LSE trackage on a tight overnight schedule providing next day delivery that competing steam railroads could not equal by at last two days. LSE also introduced an early intermodal service called the [...] "Railwagon," [...] that would enable truck trailers to be loaded on a specially designed flatcar without the need for a loading ramp or crane. Bureaucratic delays by Ohio motor carrier regulators doomed the service.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the long}} {{distance}} to New York City and the fact there was no high-speed electric service, commuter ridership at Riverhead stations, such as Laurel was minimal. Statistics from the winter of 1930 reveal {{that there were no}} daily commuters to western LIRR terminals, and there was no change the following summer. The low numbers at Laurel, forced the railroad to take action.As early as 1925, the LIRR petitioned the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to allow for the discontinuation of its Laurel station agent. The PSC denied the request on July 14, 1925. Nevertheless, the LIRR won a second request in May 1938 and was allowed to close the Laurel agency. The stipulation was that the company maintain suitable facilities for the receipt of carload and <b>less-than-carload</b> shipments of freight. Since it was a non-agency station, it was placed under control of nearby Mattituck. In the next few months in 1939, the Laurel depot was made into a shelter by boarding up the windows and removing the track-side wall. The shed was razed in the year 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Automobiles for {{individuals}} were also handled by express in closed boxcars. Gold and silver bullion {{as well as}} cash were carried in large amounts between the mint and banks and Express messengers were armed for security. Small business money shipments and valuables such as jewellery were routinely handled in small packets. Money orders and travellers' cheques were {{an important part of}} the express company's business and were used worldwide in the years before credit cards. Canadian Express Cartage Department was formed in March 1937 to handle pickup and delivery of most express shipments including <b>less-than-carload</b> freight. Their trucks were painted Killarney (dark) green while regular express company vehicles were painted bright red. Express routes using highway trucks beginning in November 1945 in southern Ontario and Alberta co-ordinated railway and highway service expanded service to better serve smaller locations especially on branchlines. Trucking operations would go on to expand across Canada making it an important transport provider for small shipments. Deregulation in the 1980s, however, changed everything and trucking services were ended [...] after many attempts to change with the times.|$|E
50|$|It is {{unlikely}} that the M&StL would have survived the 1960s as a stand-alone company. The merger of the Hill Lines in 1970 would have eventually done in the company as M&StL enjoyed significant bridge traffic from both GN and NP. The BN merger would have meant a massive loss of bridge traffic as BN would have done what it could to keep that traffic on its own rails. M&StL was losing <b>less-than-carload</b> (LCL) traffic to the trucking and barge industries which eroded traffic further. The other Granger mergers as well as bankruptcies would have crippled M&StL remaining bridge connections. Losing out on the TP&W property in the mid-1950s was a significant setback for the company. Things might have turned out different for the M&StL had it been able to acquire the TP&W. Perhaps the company would have eventually merged with a partner other than C&NW. In the end, Chairmen Swiren and President Schroeder recognized that the losses the M&StL had already suffered - and other losses it was sure to suffer in the future - was a clear indication that merger was really the only option left for the company. So, the company was sold when its value was as high as the Directorate thought they could get for their company.|$|E

5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{was started}} quite {{late in the}} [...] "copper boom" [...] and the railway's fortunes turned after two years. The open roasting of the ores prior to smelting, necessary {{because of the high}} sulfur content, released clouds of smoke and toxic fumes, which had disastrous effects on any plant life that came in contact with it. In July 1910, following the filing of a suit by the U.S. government regarding damage being done to the nearby national forests, the Bully Hill smelter was closed down, never to revived by General Electric. The cost if installing mechanical roasters was to costly in light of the now declining copper prices. Meanwhile, the SV&E continued providing a service with a [...] "skunk" [...] gasoline motor car being used in later years to carry passengers, mail and express from Pitt out on the line. While the smelter business was shaky, there was at least a <b>less-than-carload</b> business of sorts with milk, farm equipment, papers, and hay being handled by the line. In 1917, Walter Arnstein, president of the Oakland and Antioch Railroad, and owner of the Nevada County Narrow Gauge, secured a long-term lease and the mining of copper and zinc resumed. DeLamar's original 30" [...] gauge railroad was utilized to transfer the ore to DeLamar where it was loaded onto standard gauge cars and shipped via the Sacramento Valley and Eastern and the Southern Pacific to the Mammoth Smelter at Kennet (now under Shasta Lake). Smelting operations were revived at Bully Hill in early 1920, only to be stopped again following declining prices in 1922. In 1920, Shasta Zinc and Copper Company acquired the mine and smelter area and in 1924, consolidated several mines in the area, including the Afterthought at Ingot, from which an ariel tramway was constructed in 1925, connecting it with the smelter at Bully Hill, about 8 mi away. A material known as Shasta zinc oxide was produced, which was an ingredient in paint and rubber tires among other things. The final product was shipped out via SV&E and SP to San Francisco where it was placed on a steam ship to be sent to Baltimore.|$|E
