50|$|Some {{performance}} tradeoffs {{are typically}} necessary {{when choosing a}} matrix card for use with mixed signals. For example, if both high frequency and low current signals must be switched, take extra care when reviewing the specifications of the card. The card chosen must have wide bandwidth, as well as good isolation and <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> current. A single matrix card may not satisfy both requirements completely, so the system builder must decide which switched signal is more critical.|$|E
50|$|In this technique, high {{frequency}} performance {{is achieved by}} using two cores without air gaps. One of the two main cores is {{used to create a}} saturable inductor and the other is used to create a {{high frequency}} transformer effect. In another approach, three cores can be used without air gap. Two of the three cores are used to create saturable inductor, and the third core is used to create a high frequency transformer effect. Advantages of saturable inductor sensors include high resolution, high accuracy, <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> and gain drift, and large bandwidth (up to 500 kHz). Drawbacks of saturable inductor technologies include limited bandwidth for simpler design, relatively high secondary power consumption, and risk of current or voltage noise injection into the primary conductor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{long-term}} {{popularity of}} discrete complementary JFETs {{is a result}} of the ability of the designer to obtain better circuit performance at lower cost points than what can be obtained with more modern highly integrated devices. Well-known audio designers, like John Curl, Nelson Pass and Erno Borbely, also have proven to the marketplace, that discrete complementary JFETs are one of the better ways to achieve high-quality, low-noise audio designs [...] [...] Complementary JFET duals are also noted for their low equivalent noise voltage, high operating voltage, thermal tracking characteristics, <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> voltage, low pinch-off voltages, low input bias currents, and very high input impedance. All of these characteristics make these devices ideal for use in high performance audio, sensor and measurement applications.|$|E

50|$|An {{instrumentation}} (or instrumentational) amplifier {{is a type}} {{of differential}} amplifier that has been outfitted with input buffer amplifiers, which eliminate the need for input impedance matching and thus make the amplifier particularly suitable for use in measurement and test equipment. Additional characteristics include very <b>low</b> DC <b>offset,</b> <b>low</b> drift, low noise, very high open-loop gain, very high common-mode rejection ratio, and very high input impedances. Instrumentation amplifiers are used where great accuracy and stability of the circuit both short and long-term are required.|$|R

The appearance of these vehicles is regarded in Japan as conspicuous and attention-seeking, as owning this type of vehicle is expensive, with regards to the annual road tax obligation.|$|R
50|$|One classic {{use for a}} chopper {{circuit and}} where the term is still in use is in chopper amplifiers. These are DC amplifiers. Some types of signals that need amplifying can be so small that an {{incredibly}} high gain is required, but very high gain DC amplifiers are much harder to build with <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> and 1/ noise, and reasonable stability and bandwidth. It's much easier to build an AC amplifier instead. A chopper circuit is used {{to break up the}} input signal {{so that it can be}} processed as if it were an AC signal, then integrated back to a DC signal at the output. In this way, extremely small DC signals can be amplified. This approach is often used in electronic instrumentation where stability and accuracy are essential; for example, it is possible using these techniques to construct pico-voltmeters and Hall sensors.|$|E

Based on the E36 platform, the Z3 Roadster was considered the E36/7 platform. The M Roadster could run a wider track under the flared wheel arches as well as wider wheels and tires to try to tame the increased power. Standard tyre sizes for the M Roadster is 225/45r17 at the front and 245/40r17 at the back. The <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> of the rear wheels allows plenty of flexibility to increase the rear tire width. A dual exhaust system fed each set of three cylinders to two dual tailpipes. The Z3 M roadster was the first BMW to feature this quad exhaust design which has since become an BMW M division signature.|$|E
5000|$|These customizations are {{typically}} grouped in certain common configurations. A player with a correct swing of average strength (clubhead speeds about 85-100 mph at impact) will generally want a driver with a regular-flex shaft, 10.5° loft, a <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> (0-2°) towards a [...] "closed" [...] face (angled toward the player), {{and a low}} centre of gravity. This has generally been shown {{to provide the best}} overall distance and flight behaviour from an average swing, and drivers with this configuration are widely available. Drivers with a low closed offset or no offset are often called [...] "game improvement" [...] drivers or simply [...] "regular" [...] drivers. Ladies and seniors typically have slower swing speeds (60-85 mph), and so to maximise distance, it is important to increase [...] "hang time" [...] so that the lower horizontal velocity at launch can carry the ball farther. These players generally benefit from a more flexible shaft and a higher loft angle; this combination [...] "times" [...] the release of stored energy in the shaft to the slower swing, and the increased loft will launch the ball higher and increase backspin to improve flight time. The standard women's driver has a 13° loft and [...] "Lady"-flex shaft, while senior men's drivers average 11° and have an [...] "intermediate"- or [...] "senior"-flex shaft.|$|E

These systems need to have very <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> as well as very <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> drift over time and temperature. High precision is required in these fields. Such fields like instrumentation, automotive and industrial applications require precision amplifiers within reasonable cost and simplicity.

40|$|The LMP 7300 is a {{combination}} comparator and reference with ideal specifications for precision threshold detecting. The precision 2. 048 V reference comes with a 0. 25 % maximum error. The comparator features micropower (35 µW), <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> voltage (0. 75 mV max), and independent adjustable positive and negative hysteresis. Hysteresis control for the comparator is accomplished through two external pins. The HYSTP pin sets the positive hysteresis and the HYSTN pin sets the negative hysteresis.

This isolation prevents any undesirable interaction allowing the IC to maintain a precise threshold voltage during level detection. The combination of <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> voltage, external hysteresis control, and precision voltage reference provides an easy to use micropower precision threshold detector.

40|$|The {{multiplier}} is {{a fundamental}} analog building block. Analog multipliers are used in many systems such as filters, neural networks, automatic gain control circuits, and phase alignment systems. As with any circuit, analog multipliers are plagued by DC offsets. When considering techniques for removing this offset, the question of continuous regulation versus calibration arises. We can easily implement a calibration method, however, how often one must calibrate becomes an issue. Additionally, calibration typically forces the multiplier to suspend normal operation while the offsets are being measured. In this thesis, a technique for continuously regulating offset in multipliers is studied in isolation.
