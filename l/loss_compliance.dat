40|$|Numerical {{formulae}} {{are given}} for calculation of storage and <b>loss</b> <b>compliance</b> {{from the course}} of the creep compliance for linear viscoelastic materials. These formulae involve values of the creep compliance at times which are equally spaced on a logarithmic time scale. The ratio between succeeding times corresponds to a factor of two. A method is introduced by which bounds for the relative error of those formulae can be derived. These bounds depend on the value of the damping, tan δ. The calculation of the storage compliance is easier with the lower damping values. This calculation involves the value of the creep compliance at time t 0 = 1 /ω, and that of its derivative with respect to the logarithm of time in a rather narrow region around t 0. In contrast the calculation of the <b>loss</b> <b>compliance</b> is more difficult with the lower damping values. This calculation involves the value of the derivative of the creep compliance with respect to the logarithm of time in a broad interval around t 0. © 1969 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Viscoelastic {{properties}} of skin samples were measured in {{three types of}} mice (tight skin, Tsk, control and Mov- 13), that are known to differ with regard to content of type I collagen. The experimental design used uniaxial stretching and measured the creep response and the complex compliance. The creep response was measured directly. The complex compliance was determined using a Wiener-Volterra constitutive model for each sample. The models were calculated from data obtained by applying a stress input having a pseudo-Gaussian waveform, and measuring the strain response. The storage compliance of Mov- 13 and control skin were similar and were greater than Tsk (p< 0. 001). The <b>loss</b> <b>compliance</b> of each group was significantly different (p< 0. 001) from each other group;, Tsk had the lowest and control had the highest <b>loss</b> <b>compliance.</b> The phase angle of the Mov- 13 and Tsk were similar and were less than the controls (p< 0. 001). The creep response was fit with a linear viscoelastic model. None of the parameters in the creep model differed between groups. The results indicate that gene-targeted and mutant animals have soft tissue mechanical phenotypes that differ in complex ways. Caution should be exercised when using such animals as models to explore the role of specific constituents on tissue properties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{distress}} modes of asphalt pavements is the rutting that occurs at high operating temperatures, {{and it is}} believed that the accumulated strain in asphalt binder is mainly responsible for the rutting. The asphalt industry has tried to use the parameter 1 /J″ as the specification parameter for the determination of the susceptibility of asphalt pavements to rutting. It was, however, recognized that this parameter is not suitable for polymer-modified asphalts, and currently, the repeated creep and recovery test (dynamic creep test) is studied as a new pecification tool. In this paper, we study the general response of binders to a train of shear-stress pulses with a constant rest time between the pulses. We have found that the viscous approximation of the creep compliance function yields a suitable description of the test when the creep recovery is very weak. To extend the description to cases with significant recovery, an alternative model is proposed. Using the simple approximation of the continuous retardation spectrum, L, by the reduced <b>loss</b> <b>compliance,</b> L is modeled by a gamma-type distribution function. With this form of the shear compliance function, one can successfully describe the dynamic creep test in various polymer modified asphalts...|$|E

The process parameters used in FDM have significant influence on the part quality and its properties. This process produces the plastic part through complex mechanisms and it involves complex relationships between the manufacturing conditions {{and the quality of}} the processed part. In the present study, the influence of multi-level manufacturing parameters on the temperature-dependent dynamic mechanical properties of FDM processed parts was investigated using IV-optimality response surface methodology (RSM) and multilayer feed-forward neural networks (MFNNs). The process parameters considered for optimization and investigation are slice thickness, raster to raster air gap, deposition angle, part print direction, bead width, and number of perimeters. Storage compliance and <b>loss</b> <b>compliance</b> were considered as response variables. The effect of each process parameter was investigated using developed regression models and multiple regression analysis.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify some of the psychosocial barriers to compliance in a hospital-based weight control intervention program for adolescents. Forty obese adolescents, 10 to 16 years of age, and their parents were surveyed prior to participa tion in a behavioral change weight control program at a major teaching hospital. Significant correlations were obtained between weight loss outcome and six factors. In obese adolescents, weight loss was significantly associated with their beliefs regarding: (1) personal control over weight, (2) barriers or difficulty of losing weight, (3) medical problems as a cause of their obesity, (4) family problems as a cause of their obesity, and (5) perceived willingness of family members to diet. It is suggested that greater weight loss in children who perceived more barriers/difficulty and less family willing ness to diet may reflect the importance of having realistic expectations related to be havioral compliance. In addition, a positive parental attitude or expectation that the child was less likely to be overweight in the future was associated with greater weight <b>loss</b> <b>compliance.</b> Other parental health beliefs, however, did not generally predict the child's weight loss response to the intervention.

40|$|Wave or {{vehicular}} {{action on}} an ice sheet {{as well as}} structural vibrations and thermally induced loading cause cyclic loading on an ice sheet. To better understand the effects of cyclic loading {{on the strength of}} sea ice, cyclic loading tests have been conducted at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). In addition, the corresponding ice behaviour was modelled based on Cole (1995), thereby describing the viscoelastic response of saline ice subjected to a cyclic stress. The aim {{of this study was to}} design and execute a reproducible experimental campaign for saline ice subjected to a cyclic compression, and to model the stress-strain relationship of the ice. Specifically, the effects of frequency and displacement amplitude were studied. The laboratory-grown saline ice was frozen from a mixture of sea water and fresh water with a salinity of approximately 8. The structure was classified as S 2 columnar ice through inspection of thin sections. The specimens were retrieved from horizontal and vertical cylindrical cores. The porosities of the specimens ranged from 22 to 34 ppt and the salinities from 2 to 4. The experiments were performed by applying a sinusoidal varying uniaxial displacement of one piston of the loading frame using a stepper engine. An initial compressive load (equivalent to 1 MPa) was reached by applying a constant strain rate. The model uses kinematics to describe the ice behaviour, which is explained by the line defaults in the ice lattice, so-called dislocations. The input parameters of the model are the central relaxation time of dislocation relaxation, the dislocation density and an empirically derived distribution factor. The model results were given by the amplitude and phase lag of the steady-state stress response for an applied sinusoidal strain. The experimental campaign proved to be reproducible and demonstrated the stress response of saline ice subjected to a cyclic compression well. However, some improvements of the experiments are recommended; most importantly, a higher resolution of the strain sensors and more stringent displacement control, such that the input strain can be defined. The results from the experiments furthermore showed a dependence of the energy dissipation on the loading frequencies, as well as a considerable influence of stress relaxation on specifically the first cycle of the tests. To compare the tests and the model, the strain signal was filtered to remove the influence of the strain sensor location. The parameter used to compare the experimental results to the model was the <b>loss</b> <b>compliance,</b> which describes the energy dissipation per load cycle and is derived from the area per loop of the stress-strain curve. A discernible trend was an apparent increase in the <b>loss</b> <b>compliance</b> for an increasing frequency or per consecutive test, which may be caused by an increase of the dislocation density. In conclusion, the experimental method provides a successful experimental campaign that demonstrates the energy dissipation per cycle. The model provides solid results for the steady-state response of saline ice subjected to cyclic compression. Offshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|E

However, there are no data to support this assertion. We hypothesize that RTC level will not influence weight outcomes following surgery. In 227 consecutive patients undergoing adjustable gastric banding surgery, we recorded reasons for seeking surgery, and RTC measured with the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment. Scores were blinded until study completion. The primary outcome measure was percentage of excess BMI loss at 2 years (%EBMIL- 2); others included compliance and surgical complications. Of 227 subjects, 204 (90 %) had weight measurement at 2 years. There was no significant correlation between RTC score and %EBMIL- 2 (r = 0. 047, P = 0. 5). Using the median split for RTC score the lowest 102 subjects mean %EBMIL- 2 was 52. 9 ± 26. 9 % and the highest 52. 2 ± 28. 3 %, P = 0. 869.

This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of everolimus with tacrolimus in kidney transplantation recipients. Methods: Results were limited to English-language articles. Trials where recipients received another regimen were excluded. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE were searched via the optimally sensitive strategies for the identification of randomized trials, combined with the following MeSH headings and text words: Everolimus, Certican, Zortress, tacrolimus, prograf, and kidney transplantation. Results: Five relevant studies of everolimus in combination with tacrolimus were identified and results of them were interpreted. Two trials investigated Fix dose of everolimus in combination with low (1. 5 - 3 mg) versus standard dose of tacrolimus (4 - 7 mg). One trial investigated variable doses of everolimus (1. 5 mg/day or 3 mg/day) in combination with fix dose of tacrolimusand two trials compared fix dose of everolimus versus reduction or elimination of tacrolimus. Sample size of RCTs ranged from 20 to 398 and the follow up time ranged from six to 24 months. The quality score on the Jadad score was 3 in all five trials indicating moderate quality. Conclusion: Immune suppressive regimens including everolimus in combination with tacrolimus therapy show better safety and efficacy compared with single-mode but these differences were not significant in overall studies. In general, compared with a regimen without combination of everolimus with tacrolimus, the newer immunosuppressive regimen consistently reduced the incidence of short-term biopsy-proven acute rejection.

40|$|The South African Demographic and Health Survey (1998 and 2003) {{revealed}} that urban black women {{had the highest}} prevalence of overweight/obesity and central obesity across all population and gender groups. This trend was confirmed by the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES- 1) who reported {{a substantial increase in}} the prevalence of obesity among black South African women. Hence, the high prevalence of overweight/obesity and central obesity among urban black South African women needs to be addressed through targeted weight loss/management interventions, as obesity and central obesity are risk factors {{for the development of a}} number of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, from the international literature, it is evident that overweight/obese black women are less likely to embark on a weight loss intervention, while those who seek treatment, are unlikely to complete the intervention, as weight loss interventions targeting as well as including black women have reported attrition rates ranging from 0 to 79 %. In addition, at this point in time, no common attrition tendencies have been documented for large clinic-based weight loss interventions targeting African-American women in the United States of America. As there is a serious paucity of published information on weight loss interventions targeting overweight/obesity in urban black South African women, the aim of this research was to investigate weight management-related focus areas in overweight/obese black (Zulu) women residing in an urban area in South Africa. This information is essential to advise the development of healthy weight loss interventions and appropriate messaging to promote weight loss and maintenance in black South African women. In order to achieve the this aim, the following research questions were formulated: (i) What is the weight management related profile of overweight/obese treatment-seeking black women; (ii) What is the outcome of a culturally sensitive healthy weight loss intervention in terms of weight <b>loss,</b> <b>compliance</b> (attendance of intervention sessions, lifestyle changes) and attrition: and (iii) Which factors may explain the outcomes of the culturally sensitive healthy weight loss intervention? To guide the investigation of these research questions the researcher first set out to identify weight management-related focus areas for overweight/obese black women from the literature. Ten succinct focus areas emerged and include the following: 1) treatment seeking behaviour; 2) weight loss success; 3) compliance to and attrition from weight loss programmes; 4) cultural influences on body shape and size perception and satisfaction; 5) cultural influences on food choices and eating patterns 6) cultural influences on physical activity; 7) environmental factors and social support; 8) appropriateness of the weight loss programme for the target population; 9) dietary restraint, disinhibition, perceived hunger and bingeing and 10) psychological well-being (depression) ...|$|E

By applying this model the following important results were derived: i) Lipatov's empirical formula for defining the mesophase at Tg was shown to yield reasonable results and ii) the evaluation of the size of mesophase over the entire viscoelastic spectrum was shown to remain almost constant and in conformity with the values defined by the other versions of the model.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{review the}} {{clinical}} and cost-effectiveness of basiliximab, daclizumab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS) and sirolimus as possible immunosuppressive therapies for renal transplantation in children. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched up to November 2004. REVIEW METHODS: Data from selected studies were extracted and quality assessed. An economic model [Birmingham Sensitivity Analysis paediatrics (BSAp) ] was produced {{based on an}} adaptation of a model previously developed {{for the assessment of}} the cost-effectiveness of immunosuppressants in adults following renal transplant. RESULTS: For the addition of basiliximab, one unpublished paediatric randomised control trial (RCT), reported that the addition of basiliximab to tacrolimus-based triple therapy (BTAS) failed to significantly improve 6 -month biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft function, graft loss and all-cause mortality. No significant difference between groups was seen in 6 -month or 1 -year or longer graft loss, all-cause mortality and side-effects. In a meta-analysis of adult RCTs, the addition of basiliximab to a ciclosporin, azathioprine and steroid regimen (CAS) significantly reduced short-term BPAR. There {{was no significant difference in}} short- or long-term graft loss, all-cause mortality or side-effects. One adult RCT was included for the addition of daclizumab to CAS, which reported reduced 1 -year BPAR, although no difference between groups was seen in either 1 - or 3 -year graft loss, all-cause mortality and side-effects. For tacrolimus versus ciclosporin, one unpublished paediatric RCT found that a regimen of tacrolimus, azathioprine and a steroid (TAS) reduced 6 -month BPAR and improved graft function [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ] compared with CAS. This improvement in BPAR with tacrolimus was as shown in the meta-analysis of adult RCTs. There was evidence, particularly in children, that in comparison with ciclosporin, tacrolimus may reduce long-term graft loss, although there is no benefit on total mortality. The total level of withdrawal in children was reduced in children receiving tacrolimus. Adult RCTs showed an increase in post-transplant diabetes mellitus with tacrolimus. For MMF versus azathioprine, a meta-analysis of adult RCTs showed MMF [regimen of ciclosporin, MMF and a steroid (CMS) ] to reduce 1 -year BPAR compared with azathioprine (CAS). There was evidence, particularly in children, that in comparison with azathioprine, tacrolimus may reduce long-term graft loss, although there is no benefit on total mortality. There was an increase in the level of cytomegalovirus infection with MMF, although the overall level of withdrawal due to adverse events was not different to that of azathioprine-treated adults. No study comparing MPS with azathioprine (CAS) was identified. In an adult RCT comparing MMF with MPS, there was no significant difference between groups in 1 -year efficacy or side-effects. One unpublished paediatric RCT assessed the addition of sirolimus to CAS. BPAR, graft loss and all-cause mortality were not reported. In two adult RCTs, compared with azathioprine, sirolimus reduced 1 -year BPAR, reduced graft function (as assessed by an increased serum creatinine) and increased the level of hyperlipidaemia. No significant differences were seen in other efficacy and side-effect outcomes. On an adult RCT comparing sirolimus with ciclosporin, there were no significant differences between groups in 1 -year efficacy or side-effects with the exception of an increased level of hyperlipidaemia with sirolimus substitution. Both the assessment group and drug companies assessed the cost-effectiveness of the newer renal immunosuppressants currently licensed in children using an adaptation (BSAp) of the Birmingham Sensitivity Analysis (BSA) model. This model is based on a 10 -year extrapolation of 1 -year BPAR results sourced from paediatric RCTs or adult RCTs (where paediatric RCTs were not available). The addition of basiliximab and that of daclizumab to CAS was found to increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and decreased overall costs, a finding that was robust to sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of replacing ciclosporin with tacrolimus was highly sensitive to the selection of the hazard ratio for graft loss from acute rejection, dialysis costs and the incorporation (or not) of side-effects. The ICERs for tacrolimus versus ciclosporin ranged from about 46, 000 pounds/QALY to about 146, 000 pounds/QALY. Although sensitive to varying the hazard ratio for graft loss with acute rejection, the ICER for replacing azathioprine with MMF remained in excess of 55, 000 pounds/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In general, compared with a regimen of ciclosporin, azathioprine and steroid, the newer immunosuppressive agents consistently reduced the incidence of short-term biopsy-proven acute rejection. However, evidence of the impact on side-effects, long-term graft <b>loss,</b> <b>compliance</b> and overall health-related quality of life is limited. Cost-effectiveness was estimated based on the relationship between short-term acute rejection levels from RCTs and long-term graft loss. Both the addition of daclizumab and that of basiliximab were found to be dominant strategies, that is, regarding cost savings and increased QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin was highly sensitive to key model parameter values and therefore may well be a cost-effective strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of MMF compared with azathioprine, although also sensitive to model parameter, was unattractive. There is a particular need for RCTs to assess the use of MMF, MPS and daclizumab for renal transplantation in children where no such evidence currently exists. Future comparative studies need to report not only on the impact of the newer immunosuppressants on short- and long-term clinical outcomes but also on side-effects, compliance, healthcare resource, costs and health-related quality of life...|$|E

Two, the polystyrene and polybutadiene glass transitions, are treated according to the method of time-temperature superposition referred to above.

40|$|Abstract Background As {{schizophrenia}} {{patients are}} typically suspicious of, or are hostile to changes {{they may be}} reluctant to accept generic substitution, possibly affecting compliance. This may counteract drug costs savings due to less symptom control and increased hospitalization risk. Although <b>compliance</b> <b>losses</b> following generic substitution have not been quantified so far, one can estimate the possible health-economic consequences. The current study aims to do so by considering the case of risperidone in Germany. Methods An existing DES model was adapted to compare staying on branded risperidone with generic substitution. Differences include the probability of non-compliance and medication costs. Incremental probability of non-compliance after generic substitution was varied between 2. 5 % and 10 %, while generic medication costs were assumed to be 40 % lower. Effect of medication price was assessed as well as the effect of applying <b>compliance</b> <b>losses</b> to all treatment settings. The probability of staying on branded risperidone being cost-effective was calculated for various outcomes of a hypothetical study that would investigate non-compliance following generic substitution of risperidone. Results If the incremental probability of non-compliance after generic substitution is 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 7. 5 % and 10 % respectively, incremental effects of staying on branded risperidone are 0. 004, 0. 007, 0. 011 and 0. 015 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Incremental costs are € 757, € 343, -€ 123 and -€ 554 respectively. Benefits of staying on branded risperidone include improved symptom control and fewer hospitalizations. If generic substitution results in a 5. 2 % higher probability of non-compliance, the model predicts staying on branded risperidone to be cost-effective (NICE threshold of ₤ 30, 000 per QALY gained). <b>Compliance</b> <b>losses</b> of more than 6. 9 % makes branded risperidone the dominant alternative. Results are sensitive to the locations at which <b>compliance</b> <b>loss</b> is applied and the price of generic risperidone. The probability that staying on branded risperidone is cost-effective would increase with larger compliance differences and more patients included in the hypothetical study. Conclusion The model predicts that it is cost-effective to keep a patient with schizophrenia in Germany on branded risperidone instead of switching him/her to generic risperidone (assuming a 40 % reduction in medication costs), if the incremental probability of becoming non-compliant after generic substitution exceeds 5. 2 %. </p...|$|R

The lack of MMP- 9 impaired thrombus resolution by 27 % and this phenotype was rescued by the transplantation of wildtype bone marrow cells. Using novel biomechanical techniques, we demonstrated {{that the lack of}} MMP- 9 significantly decreased thrombus-induced loss of vein wall compliance. Biomechanical analysis of th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent, life-threatening {{disease in}} which a marked increase in alveolar surface tension has been repeatedly observed. It is caused by factors including a lack of surface-active compounds, changes in the phospholipid, fatty acid, neutral lipid, and surfactant apoprotein composition, imbalance of the extracellular surfactant subtype distribution, inhibition of surfactant function by plasma protein leakage, incorporation of surfactant phospholipids and apoproteins into polymerizing fibrin, and damage/inhibition of surfactant compounds by inflammatory mediators. There is now good evidence that these surfactant abnormalities promote alveolar instability and collapse and, consequently, <b>loss</b> of <b>compliance</b> and the profound gas exchange abnormalities seen in ARDS. An acute improvement of gas exchange properties together with a far-reaching restoration of surfactant properties was encountered in recently performed pilot studies. Here we summarize {{what is known about}} the kind and severity of surfactant changes occuring in ARDS, the contribution of these changes to lung failure, and the role of surfactant administration for therapy of ARDS. </p...|$|R
40|$|The rst part of {{the present}} work focuses on {{expected}} risk of loan portfolio in sense of capital adequacy within IRB approach with accent on input parameters PD, LGD, E and M. We deal with determining of speci c provision to incurred credit <b>loss</b> in <b>compliance</b> with IAS 39 and regarding the analysis of both approaches we show, that in recent conditions speci c provision does not correspond with expected loss as required by Basel II. Next we introduce the internal models for estimating PD, LGD and CF, which are inputs to the calculation of expected loss and partly speci c provision. We discuss the expected loss as a factor determining the nal value of a loan and we show a calculation of risk premium based on the time to default. Last we compare current method for calculation of capital requirement with method based on conditional loss given default.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a weight loss program, MV Nutrition, created by a registered dietitian, which uses the key components of a successful weight loss program, such as behavior modification techniques, calorie restriction, self-monitoring, and exercise, in addition to counseling and instruction by registered dietitians. The study was an analysis of existing de-identifiable data. Anthropometric data, including weight, body fat percent, and waist circumference, and behavioral cues, including meal frequency, daily fat consumption, fruit/vegetable intake, and breakfast consumption, were analyzed. Participants decreased weight (n= 150), waist circumference (n= 110), and body fat (n= 128) (p< 0. 0001 for women and men from baseline to final measurement). When comparing weight <b>loss</b> by <b>compliance</b> to the recommended eating behaviors, people who were compliant lost more weight. In conclusion, this study showed that by monitoring behaviors and receiving dietary counseling sessions from a registered dietitian, one can successfully lose weight...|$|R
40|$|Background: A 150 cm(3) pear-shaped gastric balloon with a 30 cm-long {{duodenal}} {{stem and}} a 7 g metallic weight at its distal end {{was designed and}} developed to facilitate weight loss by (a) delaying gastric emptying thus enhancing interprandial satiety, and (b) stimulating antral and duodenal receptors of satiation. Methods: Twenty-six patients (body mass index of 29 to 40 kg/m(2)) who failed to lose weight despite dietary intervention underwent endoscopic implantation of the balloon device. Patients were monitored for tolerance to the balloon, complications, weight <b>loss,</b> and <b>compliance</b> with a restricted caloric intake. Results: Six men and 20 women with a median body weight of 93. 0 kg (range, 73. 5 to 119. 9), median body mass index 34. 3 kg/m(2) (range, 28. 8 to 39. 5) underwent balloon implantation for a median period of 4. 0 months (range, 0. 75 to 6. 0). Twenty-two patients successfully complied with a 1250 to 1500 kcal daily diet restriction during the study period. Median weight reduction was 6. 5 kg (range, 3. 7 to 19. 9). Patients with initial body weight of > 90 kg tended to loose more weight (8. 1 kg) than patients weighing < 90 kg (4. 5 kg) (P = 0. 14). Nine patients with dwell times of 6 months lost 11. 5 +/- 4. 6 kg. The balloon malfunctioned in 4 patients (in I patient, the balloon leaked spontaneously but remained in the stomach and in 3 patients, the balloon migrated distally). Conclusions: Our novel balloon device may be effective in inducing weight <b>loss</b> by promoting <b>compliance</b> with a restricted caloric intake and is well tolerated due to its small size. Complications resulted from balloon rupture, which can be easily prevented by enhancements in design and use of alternative materials...|$|R
40|$|A 1 D {{model for}} the {{simulation}} of blood flow in arteries is studied here. Derived from the general 3 D equations, it computes the section area of the artery and the volumic flux of the flow for each longitu-dinal position and time. The present article deals with {{the identification of the}} main parameter of this model linked to the artery compliance. Even {{in the case of an}} artery experiencing a <b>loss</b> of <b>compliance</b> in some portion, the inverse problem is successfully solved by using a reduced number of experimental or numerical measurements. 2. Keywords: Optimization, blood flow, 1 D models. In order to reduce the cost of complex 3 D fluid-structure computations of blood flow in arteries, a one dimensional model have been developed based on the averaging of the general three dimensional equations [1, 3]. Under a certain number of hypotheses for the artery flow and geometry, it computes the section area A(t, z) and the volumic flux Q(t, z) at any longitudinal position z and time t. Suc...|$|R
40|$|Heliox {{has a lower}} {{density and}} higher {{diffusion}} capacity compared to oxygen-in-air. We hypothesized that heliox ventilation allows for a reduction in minute volume ventilation and inspiratory pressures needed for adequate gas exchange in an animal model of an acute lung injury. After intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg), adult rats were randomized to ventilation with either a gas mixture of helium/oxygen (50 : 50 %) or oxygen/air (50 : 50 %). They were mechanically ventilated according to the ARDSnet recommendations with tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg and monitored with a pneumotachometer. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for markers of lung injury, and embedded lung sections were histologically scored for lung injury. Heliox limited the increase in driving pressures needed to achieve preset tidal volumes, with a concomitant decrease in <b>loss</b> of <b>compliance.</b> Heliox did neither allow for reduced minute volume ventilation in this model nor improve gas exchange. Also, heliox did not reduce lung injury. Heliox modestly improved respiratory mechanics but did not improve lung injury in this rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrom...|$|R
40|$|Background As {{schizophrenia}} {{patients are}} typically suspicious of, or are hostile to changes {{they may be}} reluctant to accept generic substitution, possibly affecting compliance. This may counteract drug costs savings due to less symptom control and increased hospitalization risk. Although <b>compliance</b> <b>losses</b> following generic substitution have not been quantified so far, one can estimate the possible health-economic consequences. The current study aims to do so by considering the case of risperidone in Germany. Methods An existing DES model was adapted to compare staying on branded risperidone with generic substitution. Differences include the probability of non-compliance and medication costs. Incremental probability of non-compliance after generic substitution was varied between 2. 5...|$|R
25|$|The up {{and down}} {{fluctuation}} of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the heartbeat. Pulse pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant. The <b>loss</b> of arterial <b>compliance</b> that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|R
40|$|At {{its very}} early phase, septic shock is {{characterized}} by severe hypovolemia related to abundant fluid <b>losses,</b> increased venous <b>compliance</b> and maldistribution of extracellular fluid (interstitial edema, splanchnic pooling). It results in a drop in venous return and cardiac output. Volume expansion, with crystalloids or colloids produces a hyperdynamic state with high cardiac output and low peripheral resistances. The quantity of liquid administered rather than its composition is the main determinant. Clinical examination and hemodynamic monitoring (Swan-Ganz catheter) appear to provide the most useful criteria to assess the limits of liquid administration. Better understanding in the mechanisms of circulatory dysfunction due to the inflammation cascades might soon lead to a new approach in fluid therapy...|$|R
