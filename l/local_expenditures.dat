50|$|Prefectural {{government}} functions {{include the}} organization of the 47 prefectural police forces, the supervision of schools and the maintenance of prefectural schools (mainly high schools), prefectural hospitals, prefectural roads, the supervision of prefectural waterways and regional urban planning. Their responsibilities include tasks delegated to them by the national government such as maintaining most ordinary national roads (except in designated major cities), and prefectures coordinate and support their municipalities in their functions. De facto, prefectures as well as municipalities have often been less autonomous than the formal extent of the local autonomy law suggests because most of them depend heavily on central government funding - a dependency recently further exacerbated in many regions by the demographic transition which hits rural areas harder/earlier as cities can offset it partly through migration from the countryside -, and because in many policy areas, the basic framework is set tightly by national laws, and prefectures and municipalities are only autonomous within that framework. In recent decades, there have been several reforms to try to reduce the fiscal dependency of local governments. By fiscal 2007, prefectural and municipal taxes constituted 43.3% of the total tax revenue, while prefectural and municipal governments accounted for 58.9% of total government spending; central government transfers and loans still cover a substantial part of <b>local</b> <b>expenditures.</b>|$|E

The potential importance of this issue is illustrated by a brief review of an on-going discussion about how to finance the regional public transit system in Toronto, Canada.

40|$|The {{decentralization}} {{process was}} continuous in Romania starting with 1990, generating {{the implication of}} local authorities in local public finance, {{as a result of}} exclusives, shared and delegate competences and, so, the necessity of ensuring a good management of resources and expenditures.

40|$|While the {{literature}} on how intergovernmental grants affect the budget of receiving jurisdictions is numerous, the very few studies that explicitly deal with likely endogeneity problems focus on grants targeted towards specific sectors or to specific type of recipients. The results from these studies are mixed and make clear that knowledge about grants effects is to this date still insufficient. This paper contributes by estimating causal effects on <b>local</b> <b>expenditures</b> and income tax rates of general, nontargeted grants to Finnish municipalities. This is done in a difference-in-difference model utilizing policy-induced increases in grants {{to a group of}} remotely populated municipalities. The robust finding is that increased grants have a negligible effect on local income tax rates, but that there is an immediate one-to-one correspondence between grants and <b>local</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Furthermore, expenditures continue to increase also some time after the grant increase, although this response is estimated less precisely.
