40|$|Quantification {{of dairy}} cattle {{nitrogen}} (N) excretion and secretion {{is necessary to}} improve the efficiency with which feed N is converted to milk N (ENU). Faecal and urinary N excretion and milk N secretion are correlated {{with each other and}} thus are more accurately described by a multivariate model that can accommodate the covariance between the three observations than by three separate univariate models. Further, by simultaneously predicting the three routes of excretion and taking advantage of the mass balance relationships between them, covariate effects on N partitioning from feed to faeces and <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> and from <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> to milk and urine N and animal ENU can be estimated. A database containing 1094 lactating dairy cow observations collated from indirect calorimetry experiments was used for model development. Dietary metabolisable energy content (ME, MJ/kg DM) increased ENU at a decreasing rate, increased the efficiency with which feed N was converted to <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> and decreased the efficiency with which <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> was converted to milk N. However, the parameter estimate of the effect of ME on post-absorption efficiency was not different from zero when the model was fitted to a data subset in which net energy and metabolisable protein were at or above requirement.

During vegetative period, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> was allotted with largest proportion to leaf blade, lesser to stem and sheath and the least to root.

40|$|The {{present study}} with young poplar trees aimed at characterizing {{the effect of}} O 2 {{shortage}} in the soil on net uptake of NO 3 - and NH 4 + and the spatial distribution of the N taken up. Moreover, we assessed biomass increment as well as N status of the trees affected by O 2 deficiency. For this purpose, an experiment was conducted in which hydroponically grown young poplar trees were exposed to hypoxic and normoxic (control) conditions for 14 days. 15 N-labelled NO 3 - and NH 4 + were used to elucidate N uptake and distribution of currently <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> and N allocation rates in the plants. Whereas shoot biomass was not affected by soil O 2 deficiency, it significantly reduced root biomass and, consequently, the root-to-shoot ratio. Uptake of NO 3 - but not of NH 4 + by {{the roots of the}} trees was severely impaired by hypoxia. As a consequence of reduced N uptake, the N content of all poplar tissues was significantly diminished. Under normoxic control conditions, the spatial distribution of currently <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> and N allocation rates differed depending on the N source. Whereas NO 3 - derived N was mainly transported to the younger parts of the shoot, particularly to the developing and young mature leaves, N derived from NH 4 + was preferentially allocated to older parts of the shoot, mainly to wood and bark. Soil O 2 deficiency enhanced this differential allocation pattern. From these results we assume that NO 3 - was assimilated in developing tissues and preferentially used to maintain growth and ensure plant survival under hypoxia, whereas NH 4 + based N was used for biosynthesis of storage proteins in bark and wood of the trees. Still, further studies are needed to understand the mechanistic basis as well as the eco-physiological advantages of such differential allocation patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} forms of excess nitrogen (amino acids vs ammonia) on the partitioning of nutrients between milk production and body weight change in lactating ewes suckling twin lambs were investigated. Effects on nutrient intake, ewe and lamb live weight changes, milk yield and composition, and nitrogen (N) balance were assessed. Nine abomasally cannulated lactating 4 year-old Coopworth ewes with mean initial weight of 66. 41 ± 5. 90 kg each suckling twin lambs with initial litter weight of 5. 72 ± 1. 22 kg were used. All ewes were fed the same basal diets in 12 equals meals at 2 -hour interval. Treatments consisted of abomasal infusions of water (control), casein (150 g/d), and ammonia (85 g/d) in two periods with a carry-over design. Lambs were fed with milk from their own mothers throughout the experimental periods and also given {{the same amount of}} 200 g/d of creep feed in the second period. Ewe dry matter intakes and live weight gain (LWG) were not different between treatments. Lamb LWG was lowest in the ammonia group (p< 0. 05). Casein infusion tended to increase (p< 0. 10) mean milk yield by 33 % while ammonia infusion tended (p< 0. 10) to reduce it by 15 % of that of control. Milk fat yield was lower (p< 0. 05) in the casein group while no differences were found in milk protein, lactose, total solids, and solid non fat (SNF) yields. Ewes in the ammonia group had the lowest milk protein (p< 0. 05), highest fat (p< 0. 01), and lowest milk SNF concentrations. Milk lactose and total solids concentrations were not affected by treatments. Dry matter and organic matter digestibilities, digestible dry matter and digestible organic matter intakes were not different between treatments. Casein and ammonia treatments increased N digestibilities (p< 0. 05) and slightly increased N intake (p< 0. 10). Nitrogen retention per kg metabolic weight was highest in the ammonia group (P< 0. 05). The efficiencies of <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> utilisation for milk protein synthesis were higher in the control and casein groups (P< 0. 05) while that for body protein synthesis was higher in the ammonia group (P< 0. 05). Compared to ewes in the control group, those in the ammonia group showed a higher preference for partitioning the <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> into body protein synthesis by about 17 % (P< 0. 05) and a lower preference for partitioning the <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> into milk protein synthesis by about 20 % (P< 0. 05).

Hairy vetch and barley were single- or mix cropped at 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75 and 0 : 100 ratios. Results: Analysis of variance of two years data showed hay yield, <b>absorbed</b> <b>N,</b> P and K amounts and crude protein content varied among years and different planting ratio, significantly, with higher amounts in the second year. The highest dry matter yield, <b>absorbed</b> <b>N,</b> P and K and crude protein content were obtained in 50 : 50 planting ratio. The land equivalent ratio was more than one for all mix cropping treatments, with the highest value in 50 : 50 planting ratio, which also led to the highest LER in respect to crude protein.

Based on changing rates of 15 N accumulation during 15 -min time courses, translocation of the concurrently <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> through each region of the intact root was calculated and distinguished from direct absorption from the medium. Of the 15 N accumulated in the 5 -mm root tip after 15 min, less than 15 and 35 % had been absorbed directly from the external solution at 0. 1 and 10 mm NO 3 − concentration of the external solution, respectively. The characterization of the apical portion of the primary root as a sink for concurrently <b>absorbed</b> <b>N</b> was conconfirmed in a pulse-chase experiment that showed an 81 % increase of 15 N in the 5 -mm root tip during a 12 -min chase (subsequent to a 6 -min labeling period). The lateral roots alone accounted for 60 % of root influx and 70 % of 15 -min whole root 15 N accumulation at either 0. 1 or 10 mm. NO 3 − concentration of the external solution. Because relatively steady rates of 15 N accumulation in the shoot were reached after 6 min, the rapidly exchanging pools in lateral roots must {{have been involved in}} supplying 15 N to the shoot.

BackgroundThe everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (Absorb) is a novel approach to treating coronary lesions. A persistent inflammatory response, fibrin deposition, and delayed endothelialization have been reported with overlapping first-generation drug-eluting stents. MethodsForty-one overlapping Absorb and overlapping Xience V (XV) devices (3. 0 × 12 mm) were implanted in the main coronary arteries of 17 nonatherosclerotic pigs with 10 % overstretch. Implanted coronary arteries were evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at 28 days (<b>Absorb</b> <b>n</b> = 11, XV n = 7) and 90 days (<b>Absorb</b> <b>n</b> = 11, XV n = 8), with immediate histological evaluation following euthanasia {{at the same time}} points. One animal from each time point was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy alone. A total of 1, 407 cross sections were analyzed by OCT and 148 cross sections analyzed histologically.
