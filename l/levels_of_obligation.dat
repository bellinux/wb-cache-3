The contemporary English modal system has a long history of semantic and morphological development, or grammaticalization, which currently consists of auxiliary modals that function with lexical verbs to express <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> necessity, ability, permission, and degrees of certainty. For native speakers of English, determining the appropriate contexts and form of a specific modal verb is second nature. However, grasping the contextual complexity of the English modal system can be difficult for English language learners. Deontic modals such as must, have to, have (got) to and should are often presented to English language learners as relatively equal in meaning and contextual appropriateness, which makes gaining a native-like command of these modals even more difficult. This study, on a small scale, describes contemporary usage through a comparison of similar studies and data from a series of sociolinguistic interviews with native speakers of American English. The participants range from the ages of 25 - 50. They were chosen from the local population of Manhattan, KS and have lived in Kansas for a minimum of 10 years. Through a quantitative analysis of the tokens, patterns of dialogic use will be extrapolated from the linguistic data. The research questions will seek to find established patterns of deontic modal use that in order to identify practical applications of usage-based research for textbook publishers, curriculum designers, and educators...|$|E

40|$|While {{the reasons}} why states create {{international}} institutions have attracted sustained academic interested in international relations {{for more than three}} decades, the question why states design these institutions in such a variety of ways is only emerging on the academic agenda. This study seeks to contribute to the institutional design debate by transferring the principles of transaction cost economics theory from the context of in- ter-firm to that of inter-state cooperation. Transaction cost economics shares with other functionalist design theories the core assumption that actors adopt the design that best addresses the specific hazards a given problem poses to their cooperative undertaking, whereby they have to balance the merits and drawbacks associated with individual design options. Specifically, states face a dilemma between adopting a mode of governance, which fosters higher levels of compliance (hard law with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> precision and delegation) and one, which allows for flexible adjustments to changing circumstances (soft law). Which type of design is most appropriate, depends on the underlying problem constellation-categorised here based on the three variables asset specificity, behavioural uncertainty, and environmental uncertainty. This study hypothesises that 'harder' governance structures are pertinent when the intensity of asset specificity (the incentives to shirk and the vulnerability to shirking by others) and behavioural uncertainty (the difficulty involved with detecting non-compliance) are high. In contrast, 'softer' institutions are required as the possibility of unforeseen changes in the understanding of the causes, consequences or remedies of a problem increases (environmental uncertainty). Whether form does indeed follow function according to this logic will be tested qualitatively on the basis of four international institutions established between 1988 and 2003. These institutions have in common that they all seek to tackle problems arising at the fuzzy border between crime and war, such as conflict diamonds, the trafficking in narcotic drugs and small arms and light weapons, and money laundering. These institutions differ from each other, however, in terms of their design, spanning the full spectrum from high to low degrees of legalisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{events of}} recent years have {{prompted}} a closer examination of the legal complexities arising from transnational armed conflicts pitting a state against a non-state organized armed group based outside the state 2 ̆ 7 s territory. For much of the Twentieth Century it remained unclear whether human rights law would apply to a state 2 ̆ 7 s conduct during armed conflict or occupation. Despite continuing objections {{on the part of}} a handful of states, a consensus is evolving in favor of the view that human rights law applies in full alongside humanitarian law. Once it is settled that human rights law does not cease to apply by reason of the inception of a state of armed conflict, it is easy to see how this body of law would apply alongside humanitarian law in an internal armed conflict. The situation becomes more complex, however, when a state is engaged in a non-international armed conflict taking place outside of that state 2 ̆ 7 s territory. Unlike human rights law, the law of armed conflict was designed to apply primarily in an inter-state context. Thus, the vast majority of its provisions would clearly apply to a state 2 ̆ 7 s extraterritorial conduct, specifically in the territory of the opposing state. But what of that branch of humanitarian law that was developed to regulate non-international (i. e., non-inter-state) armed conflict? Recently, controversy arose as to whether Common Article 3 applied only to internal conflicts. The question of the extraterritorial application of Common Article 3 must be examined in light of the more general evolution in humanitarian law in favor of recognizing rights of individuals as such. There has been a substantial degree of convergence between the law of international armed conflict and the law of non-international armed conflict. A result of this convergence has been that individuals involved in a non-international armed conflict can now benefit from many of the protections once available only in the context of inter-state conflicts. At the same time, some have relied on this convergence to extend to non-international armed conflicts not only the prohibitions of the law of international armed conflict, but also, controversially, authorizations. In any event, notwithstanding continuing controversy over its content, there seems to be a general consensus supporting the proposition that the law of non-international armed conflict applies extraterritorially. As noted above, demonstrating the applicability of humanitarian law outside of a state 2 ̆ 7 s territory is facilitated by the fact that the bulk of the law of armed conflict was designed to apply in an interstate context, presupposing that states would be acting on each other 2 ̆ 7 s territory. That some of these rules are now deemed to apply even in an internal setting does not lessen the presumption that they will still apply extraterritorially, at least insofar as they consist of prohibitions and do not purport to impose obligations on third states. The situation is more complex under human rights law, which was not primarily designed to apply extraterritorially. In order to ascertain whether human rights law is applicable in the context of transnational conflicts with non-state groups, it is essential to consider the extent to which human rights law is applicable in relation to individuals outside the state 2 ̆ 7 s territory. Most of the jurisprudence of human rights bodies, which have greatly elaborated on the content of states 2 ̆ 7 obligations under the various human rights treaties, has been developed in the context of alleged violations committed on the territory of the respective state party. Can these same standards be transposed onto the state 2 ̆ 7 s conduct abroad? Thus, it would seem that there may be an identifiable trend toward recognizing varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> In particular, it may be that negative obligations apply whenever a state acts extraterritorially (at least with respect to intentional human rights violations, as opposed to indirect consequences), but that the degree of positive obligations will be dependent upon the type and degree of control (or power or authority) exercised by the state. Such obligations are limited by a scope of reasonableness even when applied to a state 2 ̆ 7 s conduct within its territory; there is no reason why application to a state 2 ̆ 7 s extraterritorial conduct would not similarly be bounded by a scope of reasonableness, such that the adoption of affirmative measures is only required when and to the extent that the relevant party de jure or de facto enjoys a position of control that would make the adoption of such measures reasonable. This approach would preserve the integrity of the respective treaties and would vindicate the universal nature of human rights, which is proclaimed in the preambles of all of the human rights treaties considered in this analysis. At the same time, it would not place unreasonable burdens on states parties. From its inception, the international law of armed conflict followed the projection of power. The jus in bello would apply to armed conflicts irrespective of physical location, so long as opposability as between the warring parties was satisfied. The same could be said of the law of state responsibility for injury to aliens. While the application of both bodies of law clearly extended beyond the state 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional reach, neither could penetrate into the sphere of the state 2 ̆ 7 s domestic jurisdiction in the narrowest sense. Human Rights law was developed to fill that gap. But just as humanitarian law ultimately began to press inward against that external membrane of a state 2 ̆ 7 s domestic jurisdiction, human rights law has now begun to exert outward pressure against the inner wall of the state 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction. Indeed, these two processes - of inward penetration and outward projection - can be seen along a single continuum with a common seam. That seam is manifested in the structural evolution of the international legal system that was consolidated in the years immediately following World War II. The principal structural development of that period was the emergence of the individual human being as a subject of international law, capable of bearing international rights and duties. This structural development corresponded to a coalescence of values around a principle conceived as transcendental and universal - human dignity. Recognition by the newly re-conceived international community that the dignity of the individual human being was something entitled to legal protection led to the transformation of this principle into positive law. It is this conception of human rights as both transcendental and universal that pushes against the concept of jurisdiction - pushing simultaneously into the domestic sphere and out of it - and underscores both its artificiality and diminished existence. It is this conception, far more than the force of legal reasoning from positive law, that has enabled both human rights law and humanitarian law to grasp the outer and inner reaches of the power of the state. To the extent these rules are designed to protect individuals from abuses of state power, realization of that design entails application coextensive with the projection of that power. While the exact contours of their application may not be settled, the traditional principles of good faith and reasonableness in the circumstances provide ample guidance for shaping those contours...|$|E

This poses a challenge to measurement. It is not enough to assess the extent to which rights are enjoyed in a country or whether rights enjoyment has increased over time. Evaluating {{the extent to which a}} State is compliant with its <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> result at any given time requires that one assess the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> rights enjoyment relative to the extent <b>of</b> the state's <b>obligation</b> at that time. In as much as a state is obligated to fulfill economic and social rights to the maximum of available resources, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> a state's <b>obligation</b> depends on its resource capacity, and this changes over time. Thus, the principle of progressive realization poses two challenges to gauging the extent to which countries are compliant with their <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> result under the Covenant. First, a country's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> must be benchmarked at the initial time period of concern and second, the country's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> must be benchmarked as its resource capacity evolves over time.

I argue that the extent to which (a) is problematic depends {{on the extent to which}} (b) is problematic. Further, that (b) IS not problematic to the deontological conception if we view it not as a way to cash out epistemic justification, but as a way to understand normativity in general. I do this by making a distinction between merely evaluative and deontological <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> appraisal and that it is only in the latter that the notion <b>of</b> an <b>obligation</b> functions. I argue that it is nonsensical to use sortal terms at the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> (where obligations carry the notion of blameworthiness), i. e. that there cannot be obligations from an epistemic point of view anymore than there can be obligations from an ethical point of view. However, sortal terms can be used to distinguish between differing types of reasons (which, on their own, operate at the merely evaluative level) " but because obligations only emerge out of a network of differing sorts of reasons, it does not make any sense to talk about different sorts <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> I strengthen that last claim up by arguing, against the evidentialist, that there are such things as non-epistemic reasons for belie...|$|R

Until now, most participatory exercises used an organizational model that resembled research projects. Here, funded by governments or research institutions, scientific and/or not-for-profit organizations developed a concept and organized dialogue events, analysed the outcomes and presented the documentation to its political sponsors. These constellations easily allow political bodies to criticize, downplay or even ignore the results of these exercises, especially when they contradict or defy their current political preferences or priorities. The ‘citizens’ dialogues on future technologies’ are different in this regard.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{interactions}} of two energy policy instruments, namely a White Certificates (WhC) scheme as an innovative policy instrument for energy efficiency improvement and energy taxation. These policy instruments differ {{in terms of}} objectives and final impacts {{on the price of}} electricity. We examine the effect of these policy instruments in the electricity sector, focusing on electricity producers and suppliers in a competitive market. Using microeconomic theory, we identify synergies between market players and demonstrate the total effect on the electricity price when suppliers internalize the behaviour of producers in their decisions. This model refers to an ideal market situation of full liberalization. The cases we examine consist of electricity producers with and without a carbon tax, electricity suppliers with and without an electricity tax, and with WhC obligations. Furthermore, we present a parallel implementation of WhC for electricity suppliers with carbon tax on electricity producers and an electricity tax with WhC obligations to electricity suppliers. We demonstrate differences in optimization behaviour of producers and suppliers. Based on a couple of cases of WhC with carbon and electricity taxes, various positive and negative effects of both schemes in terms of target achievement and efficiency are present, which can lead to an added value of such schemes in the policy mix, although uncertainties of outcomes are quite high. A basic finding is that in a merit order several parameters can increase final electricity price after the implementation of different policies: demand for electricity and electricity supply cost at a large scale and then follow the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> for energy saving, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> penalty, and price of WhC (representing the marginal costs of energy saving projects).

A total of 115 auditors participated in this study. This research provides evidence that the auditors with professional conflict awareness will have higher intention towards whistle-blowing. The findings also indicate that there are moderating effects <b>of</b> organizational moral <b>obligation</b> in the relationship between organizational conflict and intention towards whistle-blowing reporting. Specifically, the results indicate that with low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> moral <b>obligation,</b> auditors are more likely and have more intention to blow the whistle in the presence of fraud or wrongdoing in the organization. Finally, auditors who have high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> self-awareness will have high intention towards whistle-blowing reporting when dealing with professional conflict. As a conclusion, based on the analysis, auditors who experience professional conflict, social influence and self-efficacy (without being influenced by the moderator) will only intend towards whistle-blowing reporting if deemed necessary. In addition, auditors who encounter professional conflict and at the same time have high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> statutory moral <b>obligation</b> and self-awareness will have higher intention towards whistle-blowing reporting...|$|R
40|$|The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) favours {{negotiated}} settlements for disputes. However, arbitrations {{according to}} Article 22. 6 of the DSU {{have been carried}} out as compulsory conventional arbitrations, even though such arbitrations do not offer strong incentives for the parties to reach a settlement. For quite some time, scholars have studied other forms of arbitration that may encourage settlements more strongly, such as final offer arbitration. Yet this form of arbitration has received rather limited attention in the academic discussion about dispute settlement under the WTO. This article explores to what extent final offer arbitration might make sense for settling WTO disputes and concludes that it would be suitable for arbitrations pursuant to Article 22. 6 of the DSU, specifically for setting the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> and, under certain circumstances, for deciding on so-called cross-retaliation pursuant to Article 22. 3 of the DSU. Before negotiations start, parties to a dispute should agree on final offer arbitration if arbitration should be deemed necessary. Such an agreement might be expressed in a pre-emptive joint proposal on procedural aspects. Amendment of the DSU would then be unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|Social {{contexts}} {{are often}} ignored {{as a possible}} explanation for ethnic group differences in reports <b>of</b> family <b>obligation.</b> One reason is that too often, social scientists rely on the false dichotomy between economic versus cultural explanations as the culprit behind ethnic differences in family behavior. This study adds much needed nuance to the literature on family obligation among ethnic minority youth by using data from urban and rural North Carolina and Southern California to investigate how social contexts are associated with family obligation. Using a sample of Latino adolescents we find that attending schools in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of co-ethnics is positively associated with family obligation, as is having {{a strong sense of}} ethnic identity. In addition, we find that among adolescents attending schools in neighborhoods with other Hispanics, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> family <b>obligation</b> are higher for those with a stronger, rather than a weaker sense of ethnic belonging...|$|R
