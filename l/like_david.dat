5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s {{and into}} the early 2000s pop music {{consisted}} mostly of a combination of pop-hip hop and R pop, including a number of boy bands.

Also notable was the influence of hip-hop producers on popular music in the mid-late 2000s, including the Neptunes and Timbaland, who made the sounds first heard on Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds and Nelly Furtado's Loose imitated throughout popular radio with artists Madonna, Akon and Lady Gaga.

25|$|Small, {{intricate}} paintings, usually depicting {{history and}} biblical subjects, were produced {{in great numbers}} in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. Many were created by anonymous artists, however artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrik van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger and Hendrik de Clerck were all successful cabinet painters {{during the first half}} of the 17th century. These artists, as well as followers of Adam Elsheimer <b>like</b> <b>David</b> Teniers the Elder, remained partly shaped by continued mannerist stylistic tendencies. However, Rubens influenced a number of later artists who incorporated his Baroque style into the small context of these works. Among them are Frans Wouters, Jan Thomas van Ieperen, Simon de Vos, Pieter van Lint, and Willem van Herp. These small paintings were traded widely throughout Europe, and by way of Spain to Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Some historians, <b>like</b> <b>David</b> Arnold, have {{suggested}} that it so happened because many of these tribes were simply small communities of low-caste and nomadic people living {{on the fringes of}} the society upon rudimentary subsistence, often wandering to survive as petty traders, pastoralists, gypsies, hill and forest dwelling tribes, which did not conform to the British colonial idea of civilised living, of settled agriculture and waged labour. The trouble came, however, when criminality or professional criminal behaviour was taken to be hereditary rather than habitual, that is when crime became ethnic, and what was merely social determinism till then became biological determinism. This paradigm shift seems to have arisen out of the prevalent belief in 19th century Europe that people with peripatetic lifestyles usually were a menace to society and required control or at least surveillance. Elsewhere the concept of Reformatory Schools for such people had already been initiated by mid-19th century by social reformers.|$|E
25|$|Radical expressivism {{evolved from}} the {{pedagogical}} ideals of moderate expressivism, and its primary difference lies in its focus on group, rather than individual, development and expression. For example, In 1966, Susan Sontag published {{a collection of essays}} in which she stresses the importance of Happenings, “a cross between art exhibit and theatrical performance,” in order to facilitate a sense of group identity, community, and engagement with audience through a shared, unique artistic experience. Radical expressivists Charles Deemer and William Lutz also suggest that English composition should be taught as and considered a sort of Happening. Deemer locates the problem with the composition course in its lack of subject content and asserts that writing demands inspiration that can be attained from teacher-induced Happenings, as “clear writing and clear thought follow only after clear experiences.” Lutz’ claims {{are similar to those of}} Deemer, noting the need for creative inspiration in the classroom, a typically stagnant environment in which he claims nothing creative can be taught; he argues for the employment of Happenings in the English classroom in order to “make the student respond directly to his own experience and not someone else’s.” Other such pedagogues include Marshall McLuhan, who presents the idea of using hot, engaging media when teaching rather than cold, sterile media in the classroom, and Geoffrey Sirc, who promotes an avant-garde approach to composition pedagogy by encouraging students’ exuberant, unpolished expressions in writing. Sirc can almost be considered a “post-social turn” theorist; his 1980s research claims that the traditional classroom space is confining and argues that the language of “Main Street” should be encouraged in student writing, attacking the idea of suitable “academic” writing presented by theorists <b>like</b> <b>David</b> Bartholomae. Furthermore, in his own English classroom, Sirc employs the study of rap music and its cultural and racial implications; he views rap music as “loaded with language, desire, style, and humanity” and imbued with poetry he describes as “blunt narratives of the human heart,” teaching students about truth, communication, and reality and effectively strengthening their writing. Thus, while retaining many of the ideals of individuality and uninhibited expression associated with Moderate Expressivism, the composition pedagogy of radical expressivism is distinguished by its focus on group reality and community experience, belief in the art and inspirational potential of the Happening, and view that popular media can potentially be used as a pedagogical tool.|$|E
