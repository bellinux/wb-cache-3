40|$|Abstract. <b>Online</b> <b>learning</b> {{is machine}} learning, {{in real time}} from {{successive}} data samples. Meta <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> consists in combining several <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms from a given set (termed portfolio) of algorithms. The goal can be (i) mitigating {{the effect of a}} bad choice of <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms (ii) parallelization (iii) combining the strengths of different algorithms. Basically, meta <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> boils down to combining noisy optimization algorithms. Whereas many tools exist for combining combinatorial optimization tools, little is known about combining noisy optimization algorithms. Recently, a methodology termed lag has been proposed for that. We test experimentally the lag methodology for <b>online</b> <b>learning,</b> for a stock management problem and a cartpole problem. ...|$|R

Scales for measuring <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> readiness include at least four or five dimensions (Hung, Chou, Chen, & Own, 2010; Yu & Richardson, 2015) which capture the above-stated factors.
