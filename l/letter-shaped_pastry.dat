They leave the shoe with a carrot or some hay in it {{and a bowl of}} water nearby [...] "for Sinterklaas' horse", and the children sing a Sinterklaas song. The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes. Typical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include hot chocolate, mandarin oranges, pepernoten, speculaas (sometimes filled with almond paste), <b>letter-shaped</b> <b>pastry</b> filled with almond paste or a chocolate letter (the first letter of the child's name made out of chocolate), chocolate coins and marzipan figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits or and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in colored aluminum foil.|$|E
