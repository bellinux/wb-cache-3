2500|$|The 5th Cavalry Division was {{organised}} into two columns for the pursuit to Homs.

Kelly), [...] "B" [...] Battery HAC and armoured cars, with {{the remainder of the}} division in the rear column, a day's march behind. Chauvel ordered them to advance up the Nahr el Litani valley between the Lebanon and Anti Lebanon mountain ranges, while 1,500 regular Hejaz soldiers commanded by Nuri Bey part of the Sharif of Mecca's Sherifial Force commanded by Prince Feisal, covered the cavalry's right flank by advancing north along the main Damascus to Homs road.

2500|$|When {{the first}} {{vehicles}} reached the Presidential Palace, the <b>leading</b> <b>column</b> was ambushed and {{came under heavy fire}} from Chechen small arms and rockets, directed from the roofs and basements along the street. The Chechen ambush would typically funnel the Russian armored columns into [...] "killing fields", {{and then the}} RPG gunners would knock out the first and last vehicles in the line, thereby trapping the rest of both battalions in the middle. Almost useless in urban combat, Russian tanks were unable to elevate their tank barrels high enough to engage the top floors of many buildings, or low enough to fire into the basements.|$|E

2500|$|Tripoli was {{occupied}} unopposed on 13 October by the 7th (Meerut) Division led once {{again by the}} XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery following Bulfin's orders for {{the continuation of the}} coastal advance northwards. The <b>leading</b> <b>column</b> was followed by the 19th Infantry Brigade Group commanded by Brigadier General W. S. Leslie which arrived on 18 October. The remainder of the 7th (Meerut) Division arrived not long after. Rothon arrived in Tripoli on 18 October, after a [...] march over mountain passes and sand. [...] "Felt absolutely done up when we got here and at times felt like lying down and giving in as I feel as if my very life blood is being drawn from me in these long marches, in addition to which we are only at half strength which means double work for us all."

2500|$|Dust {{and smoke}} over the {{battlefield}} and intermittent reports from artillery and contact patrol observers, {{had led to}} the commanders in the 32nd Division at first gaining {{the impression that the}} initial attack had gone well. The 14th Brigade moved forward in two columns from shelters and at [...] the 1st Battalion, Dorset Regiment in the lead of the left-hand column advanced in artillery formation behind a screen of skirmishers. As the battalion debouched from Authuille Wood, machine-gunners in the [...] opened fire and only 66 men reached Leipzig Redoubt. The two following companies were pinned down in the wood and the British front line. The commander of the 19th Lancashire behind the 1st Dorset, had a smoke screen made by the brigade [...] Stokes mortars to cover the right flank and then sent forward three companies to the Leipzig Redoubt. The companies advanced in waves of [...] but were shot down despite the smoke; only 42 men made it across. Word was sent back from the redoubt not to send more troops forward, as the area was overcrowded. Two Russian saps dug before the attack were opened and secure contact established with the redoubt. The right-hand column saw the fate of the <b>leading</b> <b>column</b> and was held back in Authuille Wood.|$|E

60|$|The {{movement}} {{was not made}} a day too soon. Clouds were gathering, {{the wind was blowing}} from the north, and there was every prospect of a fall of snow, which would have rendered the passage of the Bara Pass impossible. The 3rd Ghoorkhas led the way, followed by the Borderers, with the half battalion of the Scottish Regiment and the Dorsets. Behind them came the baggage of the brigade and headquarters, the rear of the <b>leading</b> <b>column</b> being brought up by the 36th Sikhs. General Kempster's Brigade followed, in as close order as possible; having detached portions of the 1st and 2nd Ghoorkhas, and the 2nd Punjab Infantry, to flank the whole force.|$|E
60|$|The {{order for}} {{officers}} to assemble was sounded in the evening, {{and it was}} arranged that the return march was to start at four on the following morning. The coveted post of <b>leading</b> the <b>column</b> was given to a company of the West African Frontier Force.|$|R
60|$|As the Americans advanced, the {{artillery}} {{on both sides}} opened fire. The <b>leading</b> <b>columns</b> of the colonists soon snowed signs of disorder. The Seventeenth Regiment fixed bayonets and with great gallantry charged the enemy in front of them, driving them back with considerable slaughter; and so far did they advance that they were separated from the other battalions, and cutting {{their way through the}} American force the regiment pursued its march to Maidenhead. The Fortieth and Fifty-fifth fought stoutly, but were unable to make their way through the American force, and fell back to Brunswick, while the Americans occupied Princeton. At daybreak Lord Cornwallis discovered the retreat of the American army, and being apprehensive for the safety of Brunswick, where great stores of the army were accumulated, marched with all haste toward that town.|$|R

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the Imperial Guard in two heavy columns, led by Ney himself, were advancing, the guards being followed by every available {{man of the}} infantry and cavalry. One of these columns skirted the inclosure of the Hougoumont, the other moved against the center. They pressed forward {{until they reached the}} top of the slope, and a hundred cannon were brought up and unlimbered, while the artillery on the opposite slope rained round shot and shell upon the British squares and artillery. The English guns tried in vain to answer them: they were wholly overmatched. Gun after gun was dismounted, horses and men destroyed; but as soon as the <b>leading</b> <b>column</b> of the guards reached the point when their own guns had to cease fire, the English artillery opened again, and terrible was the havoc they made in the dense columns. Still the guard pressed on until they {{reached the top of the}} crest; and then the British guards leaped to their feet and poured in a tremendous volley at close quarters, fell on the flank of the column, broke it, and hurled it down the hill.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new Krylov subspace iteration for large scale eigenvalue problems that is able to accelerate the convergence through an inexact (iterative) solution to a shift-invert equation. The method also takes full advantage of an exact solution when {{it is possible to}} apply a sparse direct method to solve the shift-invert equations. We call this new iteration the Truncated RQ iteration (TRQ). It is based upon a recursion that develops in the <b>leading</b> k <b>columns</b> of the implicitly shifted RQ iteration for dense matrices. Inverse-iteration-like convergence to a partial Schur decomposition occurs in the <b>leading</b> k <b>columns</b> of the updated basis vectors and Hessenberg matrices. The TRQ iteration is competitive with the Rational Krylov Method of Ruhe when the shift-invert equations can be solved directly and with the Jacobi-Davidson Method of Sleijpen and Van der Vorst when these equations are solved inexactly with a preconditioned iterative method. The TRQ iteration is related to both of th [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{specially}} treated large-pore silica {{and enhanced}} with a proprietary bonding process, Vydac MS reversed-phase (RP) {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} columns offer superior performance for peptides and proteins. The deamidation of human growth hormone (HGH) has been monitored for many years by RP using Vydac columns. The Vydac MS C 4 column provides the best overall performance characteristics (recovery, resolution, and peak symmetry) for the common important assay of HGH and desamido HGH. Although hydrophobic membrane proteins are particularly difficult to separate, the Vydac MS C 4 column provides better separation and recovery (up to 86 % higher than other <b>leading</b> <b>columns)</b> for a reptilian reovirus p 14 protein and myristolyated form, a component of a potentially new vaccine-delivery system. Separation of the trypsin digest of fetuin, a glycoprotein, exhibits improved selectivity for peptide mapping on a Vydac MS C 18 column compared to other C 18 columns, revealing some peaks otherwise not seen. The improved selectivity for peptides on the Vydac MS columns results in better primary structure definition and easier identification of degradation products and other protein characteristics...|$|R
