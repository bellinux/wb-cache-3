50|$|Word <b>line</b> <b>core</b> {{memory was}} {{often used to}} provide {{register}} memory. Other names for this type are linear select and 2-D. This form of core memory typically wove three wires through each core on the plane, word read, word write, and bit sense/write. To read or clear words, the full current is applied {{to one or more}} word read lines; this clears the selected cores and any that flip induce voltage pulses in their bit sense/write lines. For read, normally only one word read line would be selected; but for clear, multiple word read lines could be selected while the bit sense/write lines ignored. To write words, the half current is applied to one or more word write lines, and half current is applied to each bit sense/write line for a bit to be set. In some designs, the word read and word write lines were combined into a single wire, resulting in a memory array with just two wires per bit. For write, multiple word write lines could be selected. This offered a performance advantage over X/Y line coincident-current in that multiple words could be cleared or written with the same value in a single cycle. A typical machine's register set usually used only one small plane of this form of core memory. Some very large memories were built with this technology, for example the Extended Core Storage (ECS) auxiliary memory in the CDC 6600, which was up to 2 million 60-bit words.|$|E

40|$|Changes {{in levels}} of stellar {{activity}} can mimic absorption signatures in transmission spectra from circumplanetary material. The frequency and magnitude of these changes is thus important to understand in order to attribute any particular signal to the circumplanetary environment. We present short-cadence, high-resolution out-of-transit Hα spectra for the hot Jupiter host HD 189733 {{in order to establish}} the frequency and magnitude of intrinsic stellar variations in the Hα <b>line</b> <b>core.</b> We find that changes in the <b>line</b> <b>core</b> strength similar to those observed immediately pre- and post-transit in two independent data sets are uncommon. This suggests that the observed near-transit signatures are either due to absorbing circumplanetary material or occur preferentially in time very near planetary transits. In either case, the evidence for abnormal Hα variability is strengthened, although the short-cadence out-of-transit data do not argue for circumplanetary absorption versus stellar activity caused by a star-planet interaction.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{estimating}} {{the mass of}} a supermassive black hole, applicable to obscured AGNs. This method estimates the black hole mass using {{the width of the}} narrow core of the neutral FeKa emission line in X-rays and the distance of its emitting region from the black hole based on the isotropic luminosity indicator via the luminosity scaling relation. We collect the line width data of the neutral FeKa <b>line</b> <b>core</b> for seven type- 1 AGNs and seven type- 2 AGNs obtained by the Chandra HETGS. Assuming the virial relation between the locations and the velocity widths of the neutral FeKa <b>line</b> <b>core</b> and the broad Hb emission line, the luminosity scaling relation of the neutral FeKa <b>line</b> <b>core</b> emitting region is estimated. We find that the FWHM of the neutral FeKa <b>line</b> <b>core</b> falls between that of the broad Balmer emission lines and the corresponding value at the dust reverberation radius for most of the type- 1 AGNs and for all of the type- 2 AGNs. This suggests that significant fraction of photons of the neutral FeKa <b>line</b> <b>core</b> originates between the outer BLR and the inner dust torus in most cases. The black hole mass M_FeKa estimated with this method is then compared with other black hole mass estimates, such as the broad emission-line reverberation mass M_rev for the type- 1 AGNs, the mass M_H 2 O based on the H 2 O maser and the single-epoch mass estimate M_pol based on the polarized broad Balmer lines for the type- 2 AGNs. We find that M_FeKa is consistent with M_rev for the most of the type- 1 AGNs and with M_pol for all of the type- 2 AGNs. We also find that M_FeKa is correlated well with M_H 2 O for the type- 2 AGNs. These results suggest that M_FeKa is a potential indicator of the black hole mass especially for obscured AGNs. In contrast, M_FeKa for which the same virial factor as for M_rev and M_pol is adopted is systematically larger than M_H 2 O by about a factor of about 5.

The narrow Hα <b>line</b> <b>cores</b> {{observed}} with the Keck high resolution spectrograph of thirteen hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarfs are analysed using line blanketed Non-LTE model atmospheres. The synthetic line profiles reproduce the observed <b>line</b> <b>cores</b> very well. Hence {{no evidence for}} additional line broadening due to rotation or to magnetic fields can be found.

There were five observations over an interval of ∼ 125 days in 2001, each with an exposure time of ∼ 170 ks. The combined data constitute the highest signal-to-noise Fe-K spectrum having the best velocity resolution in the Fe-K band to date (FWHM ∼ 1860 km s − 1). The combined data show a resolved Fe Kα <b>line</b> <b>core</b> (FWHM = 1700 + 410 − 390 km s− 1) with a center energy of 6. 397 ± 0. 003 keV, consistent with an origin in neutral or lowly ionized Fe, located between the BLR and NLR, as found by Kaspi et al. (2002). We also find that excess flux {{around the base of the}} Fe Kα <b>line</b> <b>core</b> can be modeled with either a Compton scattering “shoulder ” or an emission line (with about the same flux as the <b>line</b> <b>core)</b> from a relativistic accretion disk, having an inclination angle of 11 ◦ or less.

An intrinsic width of 1500 + 460 − 340 km s− 1 FWHM is still required in this model. Moreover, more complicated scenarios involving both a Compton-shoulder and a disk line cannot be ruled out.

40|$|We analyze a 1 -hour {{time series}} of Ca II H {{intensity}} spectra and polarimetric spectra around 630 nm to derive {{the signature of}} the chromospheric heating and to investigate its relation to magnetic fields.

We study {{the power of the}} Fourier transform at different wavelengths and their phase relations. We perform local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions of the data to obtain the magnetic field, once including the Ca spectra. We find that the emission in the Ca II H <b>line</b> <b>core</b> at locations without detectable photospheric polarization signal is due to waves that propagate from low forming continuum layers in the line wing up to the <b>line</b> <b>core.</b> The phase differences of intensity oscillations at different wavelengths indicate standing waves for v < 2 mHz and propagating waves for higher frequencies. The waves steepen into shocks in the chromosphere. On average, shocks are both preceded and followed by intensity reductions. In field-free regions, the profiles show emission about half of the time. The correlation between wavelengths and the decorrelation time is significantly higher in the presence of magnetic fields than for field-free areas. The average Ca II H profile in the presence of magnetic fields contains emission features symmetric to the <b>line</b> <b>core</b> and an asymmetric contribution, where mainly the blue H 2 V emission peak is increased. We find that acoustic waves steepening into shocks are responsible for the emission in the Ca II H <b>line</b> <b>core</b> for locations without photospheric magnetic fields.
