By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class <b>locations,</b> <b>and</b> were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the role of}} multivariate distribution structures on random asset returns in determining the optimal allocation vector for an expected utility maximizer. All our conclusions pertain for the set of risk averters. By carefully disturbing symmetry {{in the distribution of}} the, possibly covarying, returns, we ascertain the ordinal structure of the optimized allocation vector. Rank order of allocations is also established when a permutation symmetric random vector is mapped into the returns vector through <b>location</b> <b>and</b> scale shifts. It is shown that increased dispersion in the vectors of <b>location</b> <b>and</b> scale parameters benefit, ex-ante, investors as does a decrease in the rank correlation coefficient between the <b>location</b> <b>and</b> scale parameter vectors. Revealed preference comparative static results are identified for the <b>location</b> <b>and</b> scale vectors of asset returns.
