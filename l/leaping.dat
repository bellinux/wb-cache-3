5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called <b>leaping</b> motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This <b>leaping</b> locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E

5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and <b>leaping.</b> Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 2013, SeaWorld Orlando opened Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin to the public. The opening drew {{thousands}} of guests to the ride, with some waiting {{more than four}} hours to board.

5000|$|Dusky {{dolphins}} {{perform a}} number of aerial displays, including <b>leaps,</b> backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, spins, and noseouts. They also perform head-over-tail <b>leaps</b> which have been called the most [...] "acrobatic" [...] of the displays. A headfirst re-entry is performed when a dolphin <b>leaps</b> entirely {{out of the water}} and positions its back in a curve while it flips the tail to land back in the water head-first. [...] "Humping" [...] is similar, except the snout and tail remain in the water when the dolphin is the arch. <b>Leaps,</b> head-over-tail <b>leaps,</b> backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, and spins are often done over and over again. Young dusky dolphins apparently are not born with the ability to perform the <b>leaps</b> and must learn to master each one. Calves appear to learn the <b>leaps</b> in this order: noisy <b>leaps,</b> head first re-entries, coordinated <b>leaps,</b> and acrobatic <b>leaps.</b> Adults may perform different <b>leaps</b> in different contexts, and calves may independently learn how to perform <b>leaps,</b> but learn when to perform these when interacting others.|$|R
40|$|Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins (<b>LEAPs)</b> are {{ubiquitous}} proteins {{expected to}} play major roles in desiccation tolerance. Little is known about their structure - function relationships because of the scarcity of 3 -D structures for <b>LEAPs.</b> The previous building of LEAPdb, a database dedicated to <b>LEAPs</b> from plants and other organisms, led to the classification of 710 <b>LEAPs</b> into 12 non-overlapping classes with distinct properties. Using this resource, numerous physico-chemical properties of <b>LEAPs</b> and amino acid usage by <b>LEAPs</b> have been computed and statistically analyzed, revealing distinctive features for each class. This unprecedented analysis allowed a rigorous characterization of the 12 <b>LEAP</b> classes, which differed also in multiple structural and physico-chemical features. Although most <b>LEAPs</b> can be predicted as intrinsically disordered proteins, the analysis indicates that <b>LEAP</b> class 7 (PF 03168) and probably <b>LEAP</b> class 11 (PF 04927) are natively folded proteins. This study thus provides {{a detailed description of}} the structural properties of this protein family opening the path toward further <b>LEAP</b> structure - function analysis. Finally, since each <b>LEAP</b> class can be clearly characterized by a unique set of physico-chemical properties, this will allow development of software to predict proteins as <b>LEAPs...</b>|$|R

5|$|The club crest {{has been}} a rampant lion since 1936, which was also {{introduced}} by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; {{the first was a}} single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club's Scottish roots. The lion bore a striking resemblance to signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall's crest was two <b>leaping</b> red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a <b>leaping</b> lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, so named after Zampa Road, the postal address of The Den.|$|E
5|$|Despite the scare {{over his}} back complaint, Miller {{returned}} from New Zealand {{to play in}} the 1946 season, {{which turned out to be}} his last season in the VFL; St Kilda's finished second-last. Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high <b>leaping</b> marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia. Miller thus became one of the few players to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that a native pony existed in Wales before 1600 BC. The original Welsh Mountain Pony {{is thought to have}} evolved from this prehistoric Celtic pony. Welsh ponies were primarily developed in Wales, and their ancestors existed in the British Isles prior to the arrival of the Roman Empire. Bands of ponies roamed in a semi-feral state, climbing mountains, <b>leaping</b> ravines, and running over rough moorland terrain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>LEAP</b> {{was created}} in 1992 by Christian Beck, who felt that lawyers’ {{workflow}} could be improved using technology.

50|$|Alternatively, {{the tiger}} can capture a goat. Tigers can capture by the short <b>leap</b> as in {{draughts}} and Alquerque. The <b>leap</b> {{can only be}} done if the tiger is already adjacent to the goat {{at the beginning of}} its turn. The tiger cannot move (next to a goat) and then <b>leap.</b> Nor can it <b>leap</b> over an adjacent goat, and then move. The tiger must either move or <b>leap</b> exclusively on its turn. To perform the short <b>leap</b> method the tiger <b>leaps</b> over the adjacent goat, and lands on a vacant intersection point adjacently behind the goat that was <b>leaped</b> over. The <b>leap</b> must follow the pattern on the board, and it must be done in a straight line. Only one goat may be captured in a turn, and is removed from the board. Captures are not compulsory.|$|R
50|$|The Gregorian {{calendar}} is a solar calendar. A regular Gregorian year {{consists of}} 365 days, but {{as in the}} Julian calendar, in a <b>leap</b> year, a <b>leap</b> day is added to February. In the Julian calendar a <b>leap</b> year occurs every 4 years, but the Gregorian calendar omits 3 <b>leap</b> days every 400 years. In the Julian calendar, this <b>leap</b> day was inserted by doubling 24 February, and the Gregorian reform did not change {{the date of the}} <b>leap</b> day. In the modern period, it has become customary to number the days {{from the beginning of the}} month, and 29 February is often considered as the <b>leap</b> day. Some churches, notably the Roman Catholic Church, delay February festivals after the 23rd by one day in <b>leap</b> years.|$|R
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole.

5|$|In August 2009, after {{dozens of}} people {{reported}} seeing a mermaid <b>leaping</b> out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award for proof of its existence.

5|$|Other {{species with}} which the common toad could be {{confused}} include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by <b>leaping.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Leap</b> years {{starting}} on a Friday, along with <b>leap</b> years that start on Sunday, occur most frequently {{of all the}} <b>leap</b> years (15 times out of the 97 total <b>leap</b> years) in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks) in the Gregorian calendar.

5|$|Reptile's Fatalities in Mortal Kombat II {{consist of}} {{revealing}} his reptilian face {{in order to}} devour the opponent's head, or turning invisible and severing the opponent's torso.

In a series retrospective, the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and {{arboreal}} quadrupeds, often observed <b>leaping</b> {{through the}} upper canopy of the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They {{are also the}} most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, {{and they are very}} sensitive to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal, and have loud, raucous calls.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} to gaze at the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of <b>leaping</b> through water.|$|E

5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. She then tells him that {{she had nothing to}} do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings were real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, <b>leaping</b> off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and <b>leaping</b> lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
