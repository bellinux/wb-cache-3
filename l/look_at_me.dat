For ATLiens, the band aimed for a consistent set of songs {{in which a}} listener would not need to skip tracks; OutKast wrote around 35 songs for the album and reduced them to fourteen.

500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals.

500|$|... "I Am Your Leader" [...] is a {{hardcore}} {{hip-hop and}} electro-hop song that runs {{for three minutes}} and thirty-three seconds. The production consists of a [...] "chilled-out, humming beat punctuated on the chorus with a blunted fake-horn hook—halfway between classic-era Neptunes and <b>Look</b> <b>At</b> <b>Me</b> Now" [...] according to Andrew Unterberger of Popdust. It also contains repetitive, high-pitched, off-pitch synth hooks, and a booming, static bass. [...] "I Am Your Leader" [...] makes use of sparse beats, frills, minimal instrumentation, and allows Minaj’s rhymes to be the focal point, all of which gives the song [...] "something of a mixtape feel" [...] according to Joe Rivers of No Ripcord. In his review of the song, Unterberger of Popdust noted Hit-Boy's modern hip hop production, saying [...] "Diplo and Bangladesh might have to watch their back after the up-and-comers contributions to this album." [...] Adam Fleischer of XXL said [...] "Nicki dishes boast-heavy verses about how she’s better than all these other bitches." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1849, Tubman {{became ill}} again, which diminished her {{value as a}} slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but {{could not find a}} buyer.

She said later: [...] "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and trying to sell me." [...] When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, [...] "I changed my prayer," [...] she said.

500|$|Chao is seen {{in almost}} every video as {{sporting}} a pair of sunglasses, a habit which kindled viewer interest. Tong attributes the sunglasses as contributing to Chao's [...] "cool factor".

Chao also parodies popular songs, such as the Justin Bieber hits [...] "As Long as You Love Me" [...] and [...] "Boyfriend", as well as criticizing and poking fun at other people, usually with profane language. Fans of Chao {{are referred to as}} [...] "Chao Nation". Beth Hong of The Vancouver Observer writes that Chao {{is an example of a}} [...] "FOB" [...] or a [...] "Honger". Tong– speaking in character– refutes this, stating that [...] "a FOB is a fresh-off-the-boat immigrant that come [...] all the way from China to study in North America.

500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well take a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges."
