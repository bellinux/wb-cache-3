50|$|In early July 2000, the US Navy {{announced}} that Lake Erie had been designated the Navy's theater-wide test ship for the AEGIS <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Exoatmospheric</b> <b>Projectile</b> intercept flight-test series. For {{the next two}} years, Lake Erie would be dedicated to conducting these critical tests. Lake Erieâ€™s home port in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, made the ship's participation in tests at the Pacific Missile Range Facility off Kauai cost-effective with the Navy anticipating that the ship would not deploy operationally again for about two years.|$|E
40|$|The {{current status}} and {{potential}} scientific applications of intelligent 1 - 5 -kg projectiles {{being developed by}} SDIO and DARPA for military missions are discussed. The importance of advanced microelectronics for such small spacecraft is stressed, and it is pointed out that both chemical rockets and EM launchers are currently under consideration for these <b>lightweight</b> <b>exoatmospheric</b> <b>projectiles</b> (LEAPs). Long-duration power supply is identified as the primary technological change required if LEAPs are {{to be used for}} interplanetary scientific missions, and the design concept of a solar-powered space-based railgun to accelerate LEAPs on such missions is considered...|$|R
