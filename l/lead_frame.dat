The house in a northern suburb to which these pages were addressed {{had a bit of}} garden before the bow-windows, a deep porch of good appearance, coloured glass with imitation <b>lead</b> <b>frame</b> in the front door. He paid five-and-forty pounds a year for it, and did not think the rent too high, because Mrs. MacWhirr (a pretentious person with a scraggy neck and a disdainful manner) was admittedly ladylike, and in the neighbourhood considered as [...] "quite superior." [...] The only secret of her life was her abject terror of the time when her husband would come home to stay for good. Under the same roof there dwelt also a daughter called Lydia and a son, Tom. These two were but slightly acquainted with their father. Mainly, they knew him as a rare but privileged visitor, who of an evening smoked his pipe in the dining-room and slept in the house. The lanky girl, upon the whole, was rather ashamed of him; the boy was frankly and utterly indifferent in a straightforward, delightful, unaffected way manly boys have.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{kinds of}} {{integrated}} circuit packaging {{are made by}} placing the silicon chip on a <b>lead</b> <b>frame,</b> wire bonding the chip to the metal leads of that <b>lead</b> <b>frame,</b> and covering the chip with plastic.

50|$|During encapsulation, {{bonding wires}} can be severed, shorted, or touch the chip die, usually at the edge. Dies can crack due to {{mechanical}} overstress or thermal shock; defects introduced during processing, like scribing, can develop into fractures. <b>Lead</b> <b>frames</b> may contain excessive material or burrs, causing shorts.
