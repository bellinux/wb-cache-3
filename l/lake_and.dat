5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, a {{passable}} {{dirt and}} gravel road connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> Marysville. The portion between Lower <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather, at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll-road via Upper <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> Bartlett Springs was available for $1.50 each way or $2.50 round trip. This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>and</b> between Marysville and Rough and Ready (where it used Spenceville Road). Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap, the old turnpike was not passable; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers. Between Williams and Colusa, the road was paved in concrete, as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first (1910) bond issue, specifically as Route 15, connecting the west Sacramento Valley trunk (Route 7, now I-5) with the county seat of Colusa.|$|E

40|$|In Mount Rainier National Park, {{the northwestern}} {{salamander}} usually inhabits relatively large <b>and</b> deep <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds (average size= 0. 3 ha; average depth > 2 m) that contain flocculent, organic bottom sediments and abundant coarse wood. Prior to 1970, salmonids were introduced into {{many of the}} park's <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds that were typical habitat of the northwestern salamander. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare, in <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds with suitable habitat characteristics for northwestern salamanders, the observed abundances of larvae in <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds with and without these introduced salmonids. Day surveys of 61 lakes were conducted between 1993 and 1999. Fish were limited to <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds deeper than 2 m. For the 48 <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds deeper than 2 m (i. e., 25 fishless <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> 23 fish <b>lakes),</b> the mean <b>and</b> median observed abundances of northwestern salamander larvae in fishless <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds was significantly greater than the mean and median observed abundances of larvae in <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds with fish. Northwestern salamander larvae were not observed in 11 fish lakes. These lakes were similar in median elevation, surface area, and maximum depth to the fishless lakes. The 12 fish lakes with observed larvae were significantly lower in median elevation, larger in median surface area, and deeper in median maximum depth than the fishless lakes. Low to null observed abundances of northwestern salamander larvae in <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds with fish were attributed to a combination of fish predation of larvae and changes in larval behaviorLarson and Hoffman "Abundances of northwestern salamander larvae in Montane <b>lakes</b> with <b>and</b> without fish, Mount Rainier National Park, Washington.
