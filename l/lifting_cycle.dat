40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} thermal {{analysis}} of a direct driven hydraulic setup (DDH). DDH combines the benefits of electric with hydraulic technology in compact package with high power density, high performance and good controllability. DDH enables for reduction of parasitic losses for better fuel efficiency and lower operating costs. This one-piece housing design delivers system simplicity and lowers both installation and maintenance costs. Advantages of the presented architecture are the reduced hydraulic tubing {{and the amount of}} potential leakage points. The prediction of the thermal behavior and its management represents an open challenge for the system as temperature is a determinant parameter in terms of performance, lifespan and safety. Therefore, the electro-hydraulic model of a DDH involving a variable motor speed, fixed-displacement internal gear pump/motors was developed at system level for thermal analysis. In addition, a generic model was proposed for the electric machine, energy losses dependent on velocity, torque and temperature was validated by measurements under various operative conditions. Results of model investigation predict ricing of temperature during <b>lifting</b> <b>cycle,</b> and flattened during lowering in pimp/motor. Conclusions are drawn concerning the DDH thermal behavior...|$|E
40|$|The Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem is a {{generalization}} of the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem, where {{the cost for}} travel between two nodes {{is dependent on the}} nodes and their position in the tour. Inequalities for the Asymmetric TSP can be easily extended to the TDTSP, but the added time information can be used to strengthen these inequalities. We look at extending the <b>Lifted</b> <b>Cycle</b> Inequalities, a large family of inequalities for the ATSP. We define a new inequality, the Extended Cycle (X-cycle) Inequality, based on cycles in the graph.

HRs were determined using Polar Vantage XL Heart Watch monitors programmed to record HRs at 5 sec intervals, beginning with the initial lift and ending when the HR decreased during the mcavery period after the final lift of the pyramid cycle. The exact time for each lift was determined. The HR during the last 5 sec was used to represent the HR during that lift. HRs obtained immediately after the lift represented the initial recovery HR. Peak recovery HR was the highest rate obtained during the recovery period, There were no significant (p a. 01) differences in HRs reported during, immediately after, or at peak recovery between test days at the respective percentages for either bench or squat cycle. HRs for squats among the various repetitions were significantly (p. O 1) differences between days in the total time to complete either bench or squat cycles. The total time to complete the squat cycle was significantly (p 6. 001) longer than the bench cycle. Self-reported resting HRs {{were not significantly different}} (p >. 01) between days.

Compared to earlier work on lifted belief prop-agation, our formulation leads to a convex op-timization problem for lifted marginal inference and provides an upper bound on the partition function. We provide two approaches for im-proving the lifted TRW upper bound.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{structural}} motion on the aerodynamics of the X- 56 A airfoil are investigated experimentally. An oscillatory plunging mechanism provides a sinusoidal plunging motion. The static aerodynamic {{characteristics of the}} X- 56 A airfoil model are verified against computational results from XFLR 5 and thin airfoil theory. The plunging experiments are carried out at a Reynolds number of 200, 000 to be comparable to CFD simulations and future 1 / 2 scale flight test experiments. Two nominal angles of attack {{were used in the}} plunging experiments: 10 degrees and 12 degrees. At both angles, the oscillation parameters used (k = 0. 61 and 0. 70, h = 0. 030 - 0. 048) provide effective angles of attack that extend up to and past the region associated with static stall. For the case of a nominal angle of 10 degrees, the phase-averaged <b>lift</b> <b>cycles</b> are seen to oscillate symmetrically about the static CL value and increasing the oscillation amplitude increases the magnitude of the CL variation. A comparison with CFD and Theodorsen's theory shows fair agreement, but the comparison to theory worsens as the oscillation amplitude increases. This is due to limitations in Theodorsen's theory and uncertainty in the experimental CL. An FFT of the lift shows the primary frequency to be the same as the plunging frequency for all cases. For the case of a nominal angle of 12 degrees, the phase-averaged <b>lift</b> <b>cycle</b> is no longer symmetric about the static lift value. A comparison of CL between the experimental data and CFD simulations shows reasonable agreement. Observing the pressure distribution around the airfoil at this higher angle reveals a growth-reduction cycle experienced by the laminar separation bubble which is not seen to occur in the 10 degree case. An FFT of the lift at this angle again shows the primary frequency to be equivalent to the plunging frequency. Additionally, the first harmonic is more prominent at this angle. Hot wire measurements behind the airfoil show an oscillation about the free stream value for the 10 degree cases and a drastic periodic drop in velocity for the 12 degree cases. This drop in velocity is thought {{to be associated with the}} passage of a vortex which can also be seen in CFD visualizations...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the power demand of the hoist motor in rubber-tired gantry (RTG) cranes with nonparallel cables has been {{developed}} to measure the energy consumption in a typical <b>lift</b> <b>cycle.</b> From measurements taken at the Port of Felixstowe, {{it has been observed}} that the peculiar geometrical characteristics of the hoisting mechanism cause the power demand to increase with the container height in constant rotor speed conditions. The change in the angle of the hoisting ropes causes an increase in torque load and power consumption. By using information extracted from the crane's geometry, it has been possible to calculate the potential energy increase given the weight and vertical position of the container. The load torque on the hoist motor and the vertical speed of the mass have also been calculated, allowing for the modeling of the hoist motor power consumption when lifting containers with constant rotational speed.

Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the <b>lift</b> <b>cycle.</b> Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path.

50|$|One {{focus of}} {{ergonomic}} principles is maintaining neutral postures, which are postures in which muscles {{are at their}} normal length and able to generate the most force, while reducing stress and possible injury to muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones- therefore, in the workplace or in everyday life, it is ideal for muscles and joints to maintain neutral positions. Additionally, to prevent hand, wrist, and finger injuries, understanding when to use pinch grips (best for fine motor control and precise movements with low force) and power grips (best for high-force movements done repeatedly) is important for employees and general tasks outside the workplace. The choice of tools should match that of the proper grip and be conducive to neutral postures, which is important for employers to consider when purchasing equipment. In order to reduce injuries to the low back and spine, it is recommended to reduce weight and frequency of <b>lifting</b> <b>cycles</b> as well as decreasing {{the distance between the}} body and the load to reduce the torque force on the back for workers and individuals doing repeated lifting to avoid fatigue failure of the spine. The shape of objects being lifted should also be considered, especially by employers, because objects which are easier to grip, lift, and access present less stress on the spine and back muscles than objects which are awkwardly shaped and difficult to access.|$|R
40|$|Squat and stoop lifting {{have been}} {{examined}} in some detail, but limited data exist regarding the sudden release of load during such lifting. Ten participants performed squat and stoop lifting trials with loads of 20, 40, 60 and 80 N, and sudden release was randomly included {{in one of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>cycles.</b> Postural perturbation was recorded via centre of pressure displacement using a force platform and the electromyographic response of trunk and lower limb muscles was recorded. Results indicated that irrespective of lifting posture, an 'ankle' response strategy to sudden release was elicited, where the anterior muscles of the lower limb contracted first, followed by the anterior trunk muscles, relaxation of the posterior trunk muscles and, finally, relaxation of the posterior lower limb muscles. The latency of muscles responding by contraction tended to decrease slightly with increasing load for both postures, while the latency of muscles responding by relaxation increased, resulting in increased trunk muscle co-contraction durations. The postural disturbance appeared to be greater for squat lifting than stoop lifting at the higher loads of 60 and 80 N, as the centre of pressure moves significantly closer to the posterior limit of static stability (the line joining the heels). In terms of stability and muscular response, squat lifting {{may not be the most}} appropriate strategy if a sudden release of loads greater than approximately 50 N is likely.

Using the "forested graph complex" introduced in [Algebr. Geom.

(Morita has independently found similar generalizations of these cycles.) The description of Morita's original cycles becomes quite simple in this interpretation, and we are able to show that the second Morita cycle also gives a nontrivial homology class. Finally, we view things {{from the point of view}} of a different chain complex, one which is associated to Bestvina and Feighn's bordification of outer space. We construct cycles which appear to be the same as the Morita cycles constructed in the first part of the paper. In this setting, a further generalization becomes apparent, giving cycles for objects more general than odd-valent graphs. Some of these cycles lie in the stable range.

40|$|In {{erection}} equipment {{of space}} launch complexes the hydraulic lifting mechanisms (HLM) are solely and exclusively used to accomplish changing the space-mission vehicle (SMV) position from horizontal to the vertical one. Existing designs of lifting mechanisms are diverse, {{but all of}} them basically contain a basic mechanism comprising one hydro-cylinder. With increasing SMV size and weight a task to design the more complicated lifting mechanisms, comprising more kinematic links and using several hydro-cylinders becomes urgent. The article conducts a detailed analysis of the basic HLM schemes and defines the features of their arrangement in erection equipment. Gives basic calculation relationships, allowing us to determine design parameters of mechanisms for stationary and transport units. Via examples of available erection equipment shows the embodiment of lifting mechanisms using basic schemes. The ways for development of HLM schemes to erect a SMV of the large size and weight are shown. Two options of the double-cylinder HLM are described. Both schemes are based on dividing a <b>lift</b> <b>cycle</b> into two parts, in each of which only one of the cylinders is in operation. The first option contains an additional, intermediate boom, with respect to which the main boom is erected. In such a mechanism the cylinders start running sequentially: at first, one of the cylinders erects the intermediate boom, then the other cylinder does the main one. The second HLM embodiment comprises a single carrier boom with the swing arm, which allows to swing the boom at a certain angle of less than 90 ° using one of the cylinders, also sequentially operating. The second cylinder allows the boom to fall into vertical position. Such schemes can reduce a stroke length of used hydraulic cylinders, which are the most expensive devices of the lifting mechanism. The analysis results are of interest to designers of erection equipment for the space launch complexes. </p...|$|R

This paper presents a study on a combination lift and lower manual handling task and was designed to simulate the loading of grocery bags into a car trunk. Twelve male subjects performed an externally paced task of lifting grocery bags loaded with weights from 15 cm above the floor and over a wooden sill. There were two different sill heights of 70 cm and 90 cm, and for each of these heights there were two frequencies of 3 and 6 <b>lifts</b> per <b>cycle.</b> The dependent variables were maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWOL). A unique lifting sequence and {{a modified version of the}} psychophysical methodology were used to determine MAWOL. There was a significant difference in the MAWOL across the two sill heights as well as the MAWOL at the two different frequencies. Plastic bags were determined to increase the average load lifted by 27 % as compared to paper bags. At normal grocery bag weights, the increased load carrying capacity represents an increase in the safety factor. Not only can the risk of lower back injuries be decreased by using plastic bags with handles but the risk of developing a cumulative trauma disorder could also be decreased. peer reviewe...|$|R

The intensification and evolution of midlatitude upper-tropospheric mobile troughs may be viewed in terms of the isentropic advection and deformation of the tropopause potential vorticity gradient. The potential vorticity viewpoint allows one to qualitatively assess observed events in the context of existing theories of mobile trough genesis, such as baroclinic instability or downstream development. In order to quantitatively determine the role of distinct dynamical process, the method of piecewise tendency diagnosis, or PTD, is developed. PTD is an extension of piecewise potential vorticity inversion applied to height tendencies, with the forcing terms in the quasigeostrophic height tendency equation partitioned into potential vorticity advection associated with distinct dynamical processes. A particular case of mobile trough genesis, which occurred during 1 ? 4 December 1980 over North America is diagnosed using PTD. Although about 20 % of the intensification of the trough was due to superposition and amplification of the low-level cyclone during surface cyclogenesis, the diagnosis focuses on the height perturbation induced by the upper-level PV anomaly. The trough is found to have formed primarily through down-stream propagation of Rossby wave energy from disturbances over the, northwest Pacific. As the trough amplified, it interacted with an existing surface temperature gradient over the central United States and produced a front wave. As the frontal wave intensified, the favorable vertical tilt allowed mutual baroclinic amplification of the upper and lower systems. Eventually, the upper-level trough grew to sufficient amplitude that it began to lose energy downstream through wave propagation and the trough began to weaken even though a favorable tilt remained between the upper and lower systems. Horizontal deformation and small-scale vortex interaction were less important to the overall development of the mobile trough, but contributed significantly to intensification at various times in its <b>lift</b> <b>cycle.</b> The direct effects of the remaining dynamical processes excluding latent heating and friction, which were not diagnosed) were insignificant.

The first one relies on bitangent lines of X and Tsen-Lang theorem. It allows {{to prove that}} CH 2 (X) is generated, via {{the action of the}} universal P 1 -bundle over F (X), by CH 1 (F (X)). When the characteristic of the base field is 0, we use that result to prove that if dim(X) ≥ 7, then CH 2 (X) is generated by classes of planes contained in X and if dim(X) ≥ 9, then CH 2 (X) Z. Similar results, with slightly weaker bounds, had already been obtained by Pan([27]).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{flow control}} and the potentially favorable effects of feedback, associated with unsteady actuation in separated flows over airfoils. The objective of the flow control is to enhance lift at post-stall angles of attack by changing {{the dynamics of the}} wake vortices. We present results from a numerical study of unsteady actuation on a two-dimensional flat plate at post-stall angles of attack at Reynolds number (Re) of 300 and 3000. At Re= 300, the control waveform is optimized and a feedback strategy is developed to optimize the phase of the control relative to the lift with either a sinusoidal or the optimized waveform, resulting in a high-lift limit cycle of vortex shedding. Also at Re= 3000, we show that certain frequencies and actuator waveforms lead to stabl(high-lift) limit cycles, in which the flow is phase locked to the actuation. First, a two-dimensional flat plate model at a high angle of attack at a Re of 300 is considered. We design the feedback to slightly adjust the frequency and/or phase of actuation to lock it to a particular phase of the lift, thus achieving a phase-locked flow with the maximal period-averaged <b>lift</b> over every <b>cycle</b> of acutation. With the sinusoidal forcing and feedback, we show {{that it is possible to}} optimize the phase of the control relative to the lift in order to achieve the highest possible period-averaged lift in a consistent fashion. However, continuous sinusoidal forcing could be adding circulation when it is unnecessary, or undesirable. Thus we employ an adjoint-based optimization in order to find the waveform (time history of the jet velocty) that maximizes the lift for a given actuation amplitude. The adjoint of the linearized perturbed equations is solved backwards in time to obtain the gradient of the lift to changes in actuation (the jet velocity), and this information is used to iteratively improve the controls. Optimal control provides a periodic control waveform, resulting in high <b>lift</b> shedding <b>cycle</b> with minimal control input. However, if applied in open loop, the flow fails to phase lock onto the optimal waveform, degrading the lift performance. Thus, the optimized waveform is also implemented in a closed-loop controller where the control signal is shifted or deformed periodically to adjust to the (instantaneous) frequency of the lift fluctuations. The feedback utilizes a narrowband filter and an Extended Kalman Filter to robustly estimate the phase of vortex shedding and achieve phase-locked, high lift flow states. Feedback control of the optimized waveform is able to reproduce the high-lift limit cycle from the optimization, but starting from an arbitrary phase of the baseline limit cycle. Finally, we apply the tools developed and knowledge gained at Re= 300 to a Re of 3000 on a thin airfoil with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 4...|$|R
40|$|Polyhedral {{combinatorics}} studies convex polytopes {{defined as}} convex hulls of certain combinatorial sets embedded in Rd. Important {{issues in the}} study of such polytopes are the determination of the facets, edges and automorphism group. We consider all partial orders on a given set of size n, represented in Rn(n- 1) by means of their characteristic vectors. The associated convex hull is the partial order polytope. A remarkable feature is that axioms for partial orders define facets of the partial order polytope. Unfortunately, most facets have no such nice interpretation. Finding them all turns out to be quite hard. With the help of the computer program porta, we obtained all facets of the partial order polytope up to n = 4, and a partial list of facets for n = 5. This list contains a total of 43244 facets {{and we were able to}} prove it is incomplete thanks to a personal algorithm testing whether a list of facets of a polytope contains all facets. For all n, the automorphism group of the partial order polytope is entirely determined and some edges are characterized. The results on the edges give rise to a conjecture stating a strikingly simple criterion for adjacency. A simple, undirected graph is a comparability graph if its edges can be transitively oriented, thus producing a partial order. Using characteristic vectors in Rn(n- 1) / 2, we encode all comparability graphs on a given set of size n. The comparability graph polytope is the convex hull of these vectors. The latter appears as the image of the partial order polytope under a canonical projection which maps the characteristic vector of a partial order to the characteristic vector of its comparability graph. This projection can be exploited to infer new facets of the partial order polytope from facets of the comparability graph polytope. Some of these facets, that we call <b>lifted</b> odd <b>cycle</b> facets, are literal translations of the characterization of comparability graphs due to Ghouilà-Houri in 1962 (independently obtained by Gilmore and Hoffman in 1964). © 2000.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{based on}} a silica gel loaded with CaCl 2 are of great interest for seasonal thermochemical heat storage. In order to improve the performance of these materials for this application, and to evaluate their multi-cycle stability, a new synthesis protocol is proposed, based on successive impregnation/drying steps by using a matrix with a broad pore size distribution. Through this method, a CaCl 2 content of 43 wt%, a high <b>cycle</b> loading <b>lift</b> of 0. 40 g/g and an unprecedented energy storage density {{for this type of}} material of 211 kW h/m 3 of packed bed composite, in conditions of a solar heat storage system (adsorption at 30 °C, desorption at 80 °C, and water vapor pressure of 12. 5 mbar) can be reached. Moreover, the distribution of the salt inside the pores and the absence of any salt crust outside the matrix prevent salt leakage, leading to an outstanding preservation of the <b>cycle</b> loading <b>lift</b> after 10 <b>cycles.</b> Based on Polanyi theory, it can be assumed that the energy storage density can exceed 350 kW h/m 3 for water sorption at 20 °C, desorption at 80 °C, with both steps at a water vapor pressure of 12. 5 mbar.

40|$|Casting is a {{metal forming}} process: Pouring the melt metal into a desired shaped mould wait it solidifies. It {{is often used}} to {{manufacture}} complex parts, which are too expensive or time consuming to produce by other methods. However, casting probably {{is one of the most}} challenging manufacturing process. It is a highly technical engineering process requiring deep scientific understanding. A typical modern casting process contains six different stages, which named as melting, alloying, moulding, pouring, solidification and finishing respectively. At each stage, high level and precision of process control is required. Casting process also is one of the most energy intensive manufacturing processes. The metal melting consumes over half of the energy in a casting process. Therefore, the expenses on the casting process has been a significant concern due to the rising of the energy prices. A new casting process, CRIMSON (Constrained Rapid Induction Melting Single Shot Up-casting), has been developed by teams from Cranfield University and the N-TEC Ltd. It can improve the energy efficiency of a casting process without reducing the quality. The process, firstly, uses the rapid induction furnace to melt just enough metal for one single casting; then transfer the molten charge to a computer controlled counter gravity casting platform. Finally, the highly controlled metal flow is pushed into the mould to finish the pouring and solidification. Such process reduces the defect generation and energy consumption by rapid melting, minimum holding and smooth filling of the mould. Since the CRIMSON process is a relatively new casting production process. The main objective of this dissertation is to validate the CRIMSON process by different approaches. Firstly, the concept of the sound casting running system design and the principle of the novel CRIMSON process has been introduced. Secondly, Flow 3 D (A comprehensive, general-purpose computational fluid dynamics software) has been used to investigate the filling patterns of the novel CRIMSON process and the gravity sand casting process. Thirdly, life cycle assessment (LCA) method has been used in this project to review the energy consumption of the conventional casting sector and the novel CRIMSON process. The inventory data was used to assess the environmental impacts of the both casting processes. Moreover, this project investigated the productivity of the CRIMSON process. The productivity of the CRIMSON process for certain range of the casting product has been investigated and compared with the conventional casting process. Finally, the cost of the CRIMSON process has been estimated. The total variable cost of the CRIMSON process was investigated and compared with the conventional casting process as well. Key conclusions can be addressed as below:  Because of the geometry requirement, the gravity poured running system cannot avoid generating double oxide film defect during the filling.  For the CRIMSON process, all the important parameters (such as temperature, time, and velocity) are under control. The piston only needs to move at low speed to guarantee the liquid metal is delivered smoothly and the double oxide films are not formed or entrapped.  The material flow and the embedded energy of the casting making can be evaluated by the <b>lift</b> <b>cycle</b> inventory data collection method. The embedded energy of the sand casting is about 55 MJ/kg. However, to consider the recycling and reusing the internal material, the energy burden of the CRIMSON and the conventional sand casting are 16 MJ/kg and 18 MJ/kg respectively. Considering the energy burden for saleable casting, the CRIMSON process consumes 230 MJ/kg to make saleable casting; the conventional process consumes 449 MJ/kg to make saleable casting.  By using the collected inventory data, the environmental impact assessment can be carried out for both the casting process. The results indicate that the CRIMSON process is environmental friendly compared with the conventional sand casting process.  A complete foundry model was developed in order to investigate the productivity of the CRIMSON process. The WITNESS simulation tool was used to assess the productivity investigation. For casting size less than 2 kg, the conventional sand casting process is productive. However, as the casting size increases, the CRIMSON process becomes more productive.  Cost estimation also carried out for the CRIMSON process. The total variable cost of the casting process was investigated. It was found that the most expensive variable cost is the raw material cost, which can be 80 % of the total variable cost. Furthermore, it is concluded that the CRIMSON process has less variable cost compared with the conventional sand casting process under most of the circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Dragonflies {{are capable}} of long-time hovering, fast forward flight and quick manoeuvres. Scientists have always been fascinated by their flight. Kinematic data such as stroke amplitude, {{inclination}} of the stroke-planes, wing beat frequency and phase-relation between the fore- and hindwings were measured by taking high-speed pictures of dragonflies in free-flight (e. g. Norberg, 1975; Wakeling and Ellington, 1997 b) and tethered dragonflies (e. g. Alexander, 1984). Using these data in quasi-steady analyses (not including the interaction effects between forewing and hindwing), it was shown that the lift coefficient required for flight was {{much greater than the}} steady-state values measured from dragonfly wings (Wakeling and Ellington, 1997 a). This suggested that unsteady wing motion and/or flow interaction between the fore- and hindwings must play important roles in the flight of dragonflies (Norberg, 1975; Wakeling and Ellington, 1997 c). Force measurement on a tethered dragonfly was conducted by Somps and Luttges (1985). It was shown that over some part of a stroke <b>cycle,</b> <b>lift</b> force was many times larger than that measured from dragonfly wings under steady-state conditions. This clearly showed that the effect of unsteady flow and/or wing interaction was important. Flow visualization studies on flapping model dragonfly wings were conducted by Saharon and Luttges (1988, 1989), and it was shown that constructive or destructive wing/flow interactions might occur, depending on the kinematic parameters of the flapping motion. In these studies, only the total force of the fore- and hindwings was measured and, moreover, force measurements and flow visualizations were conducted in separated works. In order to further understand the dragonfly aerodynamics, it was desirable to determine the aerodynamic force and flow structure simultaneously and also to know the force on the individual forewing and hindwing during their flapping motions. Freymuth (1990) conducted force measurement and flow visualization on an airfoil in hover modes. One of the hover modes was for hovering dragonflies. Only mean vertical force was measured. It was shown that large mean vertical force coefficient could be obtained and the force wa...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{challenges}} {{with regards}} to remote fields, reservoir conditions and deep water, forces the petroleum industry to adopt new technology. A large part of this technology {{comes in the form}} of subsea equipment. Larger and heavier subsea modules are manufactured and installed in order to meet the field and reservoir conditions. Inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) operations presents a key element in a subsea field life <b>cycle.</b> <b>Lifting</b> through moonpool is preferred when performing such an operation. A critical factor which has been identified for lifts through moonpool, is when equipment is to be docked onto the cursor frame. During the docking, relative motion between vessel and equipment can lead to large impulse loads. The structural strength of the cursor frame is seen as a limiting factor and a risk element. This is the main reason for Subsea 7 and Statoil to initiate this thesis. This thesis addresses the module handling system on Havila Subsea. Emphasize has been made on structural challenges of the cursor frame and the possibility of improvement. Both manual capacity calculations and Staad. Pro analysis has been conducted for both existing and alternative cursor frame. The loads have been applied as static loads acting on the tip of the prongs, this is to simulate a worst case scenario where the funnels are just docket at the prongs and the vessel experiences a large pitch or roll motion. The alternative cursor frame has been modeled with new and flexible prongs. The flexible prongs can deflect 5 degrees in any direction. Analysis shows that the existing cursor frame has a high structural capacity and the prongs are the cursor frame weakest members. The prongs have been proven to have a capacity of 11. 8 Te per prong. Effectively this gives a total static cursor frame capacity of 23. 6 Te. The flexible prongs have been shown to be beneficial {{with regards to}} impulse loads and fatigue. However, for a final recommendation, detailed dynamic analysis and full scale tests are recommended. Even though structural challenges have been emphasized in this thesis, operational aspects have been regarded and concluding remarks been made...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{major event}} {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries will give a major boost to {{development}} of geography and will take place in the United States. It is the work of the famous geographer William Morris Davis who not only made important contributions to the establishment of discipline in his country, but revolutionized the field to develop geographical cycle theory which he proposed as a paradigm for geography in general, although in actually served as a paradigm for physical geography. His theory explained that mountains and other landforms are shaped by the influence of a number of factors that are manifested in the geographical cycle. He explained that the cycle begins with the lifting of the relief by geological processes (faults, volcanism, tectonic upheaval, etc.). Geographical factors such as rivers and runoff begins to create the V-shaped valleys between the mountains (the stage called [...] "youth"). During this first stage, the terrain is steeper and more irregular. Over time, the currents can carve wider valleys ("maturity") and then start to wind, towering hills only ("senescence"). Finally, everything comes to what is a plain flat plain at the lowest elevation possible (called [...] "baseline") This plain was called by Davis' [...] "peneplain" [...] meaning [...] "almost plain" [...] Then the rejuvenation occurs and there is another mountain <b>lift</b> and the <b>cycle</b> continues. Although Davis's theory is not entirely accurate, it was absolutely revolutionary and unique in its time and helped to modernize and create geography subfield of geomorphology. Its implications prompted a myriad of research in various branches of physical geography. In the case of the Paleogeography this theory provided a model for understanding the evolution of the landscape. For hydrology, glaciology, and climatology as a boost investigated as studying geographic factors shape the landscape and affect the cycle. The bulk of the work of William Morris Davis led to the development of a new branch of physical geography: Geomorphology whose contents until then did not differ from the rest of geography. Shortly after this branch would present a major development. Some of his disciples made significant contributions to various branches of physical geography such as Curtis Marbut and his invaluable legacy for Pedology, Mark Jefferson, Isaiah Bowman, among others.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the work completed over a two and one half year effort {{sponsored by the}} US Department of Energy. The goal was to demonstrate the technology needed to produce a highly efficient engine enabled by several technologies which were to be developed {{in the course of}} the work. The technologies included: (1) A low-pressure direct injection system; (2) A mass air flow sensor which would measure the net airflow into the engine on a per cycle basis; (3) A feedback control system enabled by measuring ionization current signals from the spark plug gap; and (4) An infinitely variable cam actuation system based on a pneumatic-hydraulic valve actuation These developments were supplemented by the use of advanced large eddy simulations as well as evaluations of fuel air mixing using the KIVA and WAVE models. The simulations were accompanied by experimental verification when possible. In this effort a solid base has been established for continued development of the advanced engine concepts originally proposed. Due to problems with the valve actuation system a complete demonstration of the engine concept originally proposed was not possible. Some of the highlights that were accomplished during this effort are: (1) A forward-backward mass air flow sensor has been developed and a patent application for the device has been submitted. We are optimistic that this technology will have a particular application in variable valve timing direct injection systems for IC engines. (2) The biggest effort on this project has involved the development of the pneumatic-hydraulic valve actuation system. This system was originally purchased from Cargine, a Swedish supplier and is in the development stage. To date we have not been able to use the actuators to control the exhaust valves, although the actuators have been successfully employed to control the intake valves. The reason for this is the additional complication associated with variable back pressure on the exhaust valves when they are opened. As a result of this effort, we have devised a new design and have filed for a patent on a method of control which is believed to overcome this problem. The engine we have been working with originally had a single camshaft which controlled both the intake and exhaust valves. Single <b>cycle</b> <b>lift</b> and timing control was demonstrated with this system. (3) Large eddy simulations and KIVA based simulations were used in conjunction with flow visualizations in an optical engine to study fuel air mixing. During this effort we have devised a metric for quantifying fuel distribution and it is described in several of our papers. (4) A control system has been developed to enable us to test the benefits of the various technologies. This system used is based on Opal-RT hardware and is being used in a current DOE sponsored program...|$|R
40|$|Although {{much effort}} has been placed into the {{reduction}} of risks associated with manual materials handling, risk of musculoskeletal disorder development remains high. This {{may be due to}} the additional muscle activity necessary for the maintenance of postural equilibrium during work tasks. This research proposes that postural control and subsequent additional muscle activity is influenced by the magnitude of the external load and the degree of body movement. The objective of this research was to identify whether performing tasks with increased external load and with a greater degree of trunk motion places additional strain on the musculoskeletal system in excess of that imposed by task demands. Twenty-four male and twenty-four female subjects performed four load manipulation tasks under three loading conditions (0. 8 kg, 1. 6 kg, and 4 kg). Each task comprised of a static and dynamic condition. For the static condition, subjects maintained a stipulated posture for ten seconds. The dynamic condition required subjects to move and replace a box once every three seconds, such that a complete <b>lift</b> and lower <b>cycle</b> was performed in six seconds. Throughout task completion, muscle activity of six pairs of trunk muscles were analysed using surface electromyography. This was accompanied by data regarding ground reaction forces obtained through the use of a force platform. After the completion of each condition subjects were required to identify and rate body discomfort. Differential analysis was used to isolate the muscle activity and ground reaction forces attributed to increased external load and increased trunk movement. It was found that the heaviest loading conditions (4 kg) resulted in significantly greater (p< 0. 05) muscle activation in the majority of muscles during all tasks investigated. The trend of muscle activity attributed to load was similar in all significantly altered muscles and activation was greatest in the heaviest loading condition. A degree of movement efficiency occurred in some muscles when manipulating loads of 0. 8 kg and 1. 6 kg. At greater loads, this did not occur suggesting that heavier loading conditions result in additional strain on the body in excess of that imposed by task demands. In manipulated data, trend of vertical ground reaction forces increased with increased load in all tasks. Sagittal movement of the centre of pressure attributed to load was significantly affected in manipulated data in the second movement phase of the “hip shoulder” task and the second movement phase of the “hip twist” task. The “hip reach” task was most affected by increased load magnitude as muscle activity attributed to load was significantly different (p< 0. 05) under increased loading conditions in both movement phases in all muscles. Further, a significant interactional effect (p< 0. 05) between condition and data point was found in all muscles with the exception of the right and left lumbar erector spinae during the second movement phase of the “hip reach” task. Muscle activity associated with increased trunk motion resulted in additional strain on the trunk muscles in the “hip shoulder” and “hip reach” tasks as muscle activity associated with the static component of each of the above tasks was greater than that of the dynamic tasks. Trend of ground reaction forces attributed to increased trunk motion generally increased under increased loading conditions. Additionally, a significant interactional effect (p< 0. 05) between load and muscle activity pattern was found in all muscles during all tasks, with the exception of the right rectus abdominis in the first movement phase of the “hip shoulder’ task, the left rectus abdominis in the second movement phase of the “hip knee” task and the right latissimus dorsi during the first movement phase of the “hip twist” task. This was accompanied by a significant interactional effect (p< 0. 05) between load and sagittal centre of pressure movement attributed to load, in both movement phases of all tasks investigated. From this research it can be proposed that guidelines may underestimate risk and subsequently under predict the strain in tasks performed with greater external loads as well as tasks which require a greater degree of trunk motion. Therefore, this study illustrates the importance of the consideration of the muscle activity necessary to maintain postural equilibrium in overall load analyses...|$|R
