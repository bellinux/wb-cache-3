40|$|Introduction: There is {{evidence}} that certain measures of visual function show some type of relationship between right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> in the same individual.   Similarly, particular ocular maladies may be related, or be symmetric, in the right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of the same person. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} certain relationships do not exist between eyes in an individual. For example, diseases such as glaucoma are often asymmetric in their progression in the two eyes of an afflicted individual. Inter-ocular mirror symmetry between right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes,</b> when considering ocular wave-front aberrations (WAs), has been shown to exist by some authors. This study investigates whether mirror symmetry of high order aberrations (HOAs) exists between the right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> in a cohort of South African subjects. Method: Third to 5 th order Zernike coefficients (HOAs) were measured on both eyes of 66 subjects (132 eyes) using a Zywave aberrometer. A total of 15 Zernike coefficients for each eye were obtained. Mirror symmetry was investigated using correlation coefficients between the various measurements obtained from each eye. Results: Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients provide evidence {{that the majority of the}} 15 Zernike coefficients suggest the presence of mirror symmetry between right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of the 66 subjects. Examples of individual scatter plots comparing right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> are presented.   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that mirror symmetry exists in the HOAs obtained from the 132 eyes measured and thus care should be exercised when combining eyes of individuals for analysis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} results of {{scanning}} laser polarimetry of the retinal nerve fiber layer obtained by using the GDx Scanning Laser System® in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and nonglaucomatous Brazilian subjects over 40 years, also analyzing {{the differences between the}} data obtained from right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes.</b> METHODS: Forty-six POAG patients and 44 normal subjects were enrolled in this study. Retardation data were assessed by the GDx Scanning Laser System®. The medians of the parameters printed in the result were compared in these two groups, separately in the right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes,</b> using Mann-Whitney's test. Also the frequencies of outside normal parameters and quadrants of deviation from normal graph were compared in these two groups, using chi-square or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: All parameters obtained by GDx differed in a statistically significant way between the two groups, except symmetry for <b>left</b> <b>eyes.</b> The frequency of inferior quadrant with p< 5 % regarding deviation from normal graph was higher in the glaucomatous group. The most frequent outside normal limits parameters in the glaucomatous group were: maximal modulation, ellipse modulation, superior average and inferior average. All parameters except symmetry and superior/nasal differed between right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> in the nonglaucomatous group. CONCLUSION: The parameters obtained by GDx are different in normal and glaucomatous subjects of that population. There are some parameters that deviate from normal values with a greater frequency in glaucomatous patients. An evident difference between the data of right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of normal subjects in this group was also observed...|$|R

RESULTS [...] The mean of {{the first set of}} IOPs from both right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> was significantly higher than those from subsequent sets (p < 0. 0001 for right eyes and p = 0. 01 and < 0. 0002 for <b>left</b> <b>eyes).</b> This tendency increased significantly with increasing IOP. Second and third IOP sets were, however, similar indicating stabilisation of IOP measurements.

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the difference in}} visual acuity between the right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of patients and also {{determined the}} maximal level of acuity expected {{in a group of}} visually normal individuals. Visual acuity was measured in the right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of 72 subjects aged from 16 to 67 years using Bailey-Lovie type charts. The chart was read until fewer than three letters were read on a line and acuities were based on each letter correct contributing - 0. 02 to the overall score. For 1 2 of these subjects, visual acuity was measured a further four times. Average visual acuities for right and <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> were - 0. 137 and - 0. 126 log MAR, respectively. The signed visual acuity difference was normally distributed and had a standard deviation of 0. 050 log MAR. The mean visual acuity difference for the 12 subjects for whom the measures were repeated was 0. 033 log MAR (SD of the signed visual acuity difference: 0. 049 log MAR). We conclude that if a patient has a difference in visual acuity between the two eyes of more than 5 letters on a Bailey-Lovie style chart, further investigation is indicated.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the repeatability of measurement of central corneal thickness (CCT) by spectral domain optical coherence (SD-OCT) in premature infants {{and compare it}} to CCT measurement by ultrasonic pachymetry (USP). Methods. Three CCT measurements of the <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of 50 premature infants were obtained by SD-OCT using the iVue system. 10 CCT measurements of each 28 <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of 28 infants were obtained by USP using the Pacscan 300 P system. Bland-Altman plots were developed and the limit of agreement (LoA) was determined to compare {{the mean of the}} SD-OCT and USP measurements. Results. No statistically significant difference was found among the 3 CCT measurements by SD-OCT. Both USP and SD-OCT have been performed for only <b>left</b> <b>eyes</b> of 28 of the 50 babies. Those results have been compared with each other. A statistically significant difference was found between the mean CCT measurements by SD-OCT and USP (p< 0. 05). The LoA between the SD-OCT and USP measurements ranged from 11. 4 to − 64. 1. Conclusions. CCT can be measured using the iVue SD-OCT system {{with a high level of}} repeatability. Although measurement of CCT by SD-OCT and USP is highly correlated, the 2 systems cannot be used interchangeably in premature infants...|$|R
