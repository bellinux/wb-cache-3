5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five {{works from the}} 1660s have a, {{partially}} obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore been <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> detective work and speculation.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary {{falls under the}} authority of the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E

King Christian also founded the trading city of Kristiansand, naming it after himself.|$|E
5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs and Democrats by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was particularly significant because John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year of 1542, Calvin {{published}} Catéchisme de l'Eglise de Genève (Catechism of the Church of Geneva), which was inspired by Bucer's Kurze Schrifftliche Erklärung of 1534. Calvin had written an earlier catechism during his first stay in Geneva which was <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Martin Luther's Large Catechism. The first version was arranged pedagogically, describing Law, Faith, and Prayer. The 1542 version was rearranged for theological reasons, covering Faith first, then Law and Prayer.|$|E

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the five counties of Slavonia is worth 6,454million euro or 8,005euro per capita, 27.5% below national average.

5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders.

He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|E
