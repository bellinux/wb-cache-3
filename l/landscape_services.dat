40|$|Shifting {{societal}} needs {{drive and}} shape landscapes {{and the provision}} of their services. This paper presents a modelling approach to visualize the regional spatial and temporal dynamics in <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> supply as a function of changing landscapes and societal demand. This changing demand can result from different policy targets. In this paper we conceptualise the system in which these dynamics take place by explicitly addressing (i) the multifunctional character of a landscape, (ii) the different spatial levels at which interactions between <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> supply, demand, and land management occur, and (iii) trade-offs in service supply as a result of land management actions. Next, we translate the resulting conceptual framework into an operational model. As a demonstration, this model is applied to simulate changes in <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> supply driven by regional policies in a rural region of the Netherlands. This application demonstrates potential trade-offs, which emerge in a spatially explicit way in the region over time. It illustrates the potential relevance of modelling <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> dynamics for environmental management and decision makin...|$|R

50|$|As in {{any type}} of direct {{marketing}} system, potential customers must be identified. The means of doing this varies, from direct mailings to flyers or print advertising. The level of competition in the area can also dictate the types of crops and services producers provide. Owner-operators must identify the number of similar farmers {{in the area and}} the type of crops they produce and services offered, so as not to flood the market. One strategy to avoid this is by planting or harvesting crops at different times or extending the season in greenhouses or hoophouses to help prolong the harvest season and possibly increase the number of customers still looking for locally grown fresh produce. In addition, special services or products can be added to the business operation to gain market share. Some examples are baked and cooked foods, <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> plants, flowers, seeds, herbs, and homemade crafts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} joint {{production}} {{of milk and}} ‘wildlife and landscape services’ on Dutch dairy farms using a micro-econometric profit model of individual farm behaviour. Results show that milk, and wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> are substitutes. Moreover, there are economies of scope for only relatively few farms. Both results imply that most farms would prefer specialising instead of jointly producing milk and wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Lower transaction costs increase wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> production by existing providers, and {{increase the number of}} farms producing wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> The 2003 CAP reform has a negative effect on wildlife and landscape production because of the milk quota increase...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> e. g. food production, water quality, and recreation, necessitates {{the use of a}} wide range of data sources for their identification. Subsequently, an array of {{approaches}} is required to analyse and map differ different <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> which we have explored in this study. Approaches to identify and map four <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are illustrated for the municipalities Deurne and Asten in province Noord-Brabant, The Netherlands: wetland habitat, forest recreation, land-based animal husbandry, and recreation for hikers. The <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> were identified through ground observations at 389 locations. Spatial indicators were used to identify and map the <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Based on the ground observations, correlations between the <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and spatial characteristics (e. g. elevation, soil, road-type) were calculated within a neighbourhood with a radius of 0 m, 50 m, and 100 m. These correlations identified several site-specific indicators to map the <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> The accuracy of the landscape service maps created was assessed. The indicators proved to be adequately reliable for forest recreation and reasonably reliable for land-based animal husbandry and recreation for hikers. Only landscape service map forest recreation was shown to be highly accurate. The four <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> rarely coincide, but within a 1 km radius it is apparent that some occur closer together. The approach that we have used is applicable for a wide range of different services and establishes a fundamental basis for determining their spatial variation. As such, it should provide vital information for policy makers and spatial planner...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{a service}} {{economic}} analysis framework is developed and applied {{in order to}} define, understand, explain and improve <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Together with the ecosystem functions and externalities approach, <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are understood as intentionally provided targeted outcomes of agricultural production, with the objective to improve landscape quality. Based on this conceptualisation, a five-step analysis framework is developed and applied to analyse the supply chain of three different <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Empirical evidence was collected from two case studies located in France and Austria, whereas the French case study is the national grassland premium and the Austrian case study is on a local landscape scheme. It could be shown that a key strength of the utilised service economic perspective lies in its formalised structure which allowed the identification of involved actors, the organisation of their relation {{and the way they}} are acting within their institutional systems (i. e. how <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are organised). Moreover, the standardised analysis structure allows for comparisons of supply chains of <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and helps to identify scope for further improvements, independently from its geographic and administrative context. We conclude with potential risks and benefits of the service economics perspective for <b>landscape</b> <b>services...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical model is developed for analysing the decisions of individual farmers {{whether or not to}} produce wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> how much of these services to produce and form an environmental co-operative in order to reduce transaction costs or to build up bargaining power. The model is applied for Dutch dairy farmers as the main users of agricultural land in the Netherlands. Simulations show that the reduction of transaction costs makes it attractive for farmers to form an environmental cooperative in case of a fixed price for wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Therefore more wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are produced and more farmers are involved compared to a situation with individual supply. If demand is no longer perfectly elastic an increase in wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> production leads to lower prices offsetting part of the production and profit increase caused by lower transaction costs. However, if the environmental co-operative acts like a monopolist its bargaining position leads to a decrease in the production of wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and higher prices. wildlife and landscape management, micro-econometrics, transaction costs, co-operation, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|The <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> concept {{provides}} a lens to study relations within the social-ecological networks that landscapes are, {{and to identify}} stakeholders as either providers or beneficiaries.

Here, a collaborative landscape governance process started off with low levels of trust between farmers and regional governments, as a result of previous processes. The introduction of the <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> concept helped to bridge social boundaries, which eventually resulted in collective action: farmers and governments reached an agreement on adapted management of ditches and shores to improve water quality and biodiversity. However, we propose that bridging the social boundaries was achieved not merely due to the <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> concept, but also {{due to the fact that}} multiple boundaries were managed simultaneously, and additional arrangements were used in boundary management...|$|E
