2500|$|The larvae cause {{significant}} damage to foliage and fruit. [...] Early instars feed on tissue beneath the upper epidermis (surface layer) of leaves, while protected under self-constructed silken webs on the undersurface of leaves. Larger larvae migrate from these positions to construct feeding niches between adjacent leaves, between a leaf and a fruit, {{in the developing}} bud, or on a single leaf, where the <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> develops. The late stage larvae feed on all leaf tissue except main veins, and can often be found tunneling into berry fruits such as strawberries and caneberries.|$|E
2500|$|Pinot noir is a grape variety whose [...] "importance" [...] in New Zealand is {{extremely}} high. However, initial results were not promising for several reasons, including {{high levels of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> virus in older plantings, and, during the 1960s and 1970s, the limited number and indifferent quality of Pinot noir clones available for planting. However, since this time importation of high quality clones and much-improved viticulture and winemaking has seen pinot noir, from Martinborough in the north to Central Otago in the south, win international awards and accolades. As the industry has matured, many of the country's top producers have made the decision no longer to submit their wines to reviews or shows.|$|E
40|$|In 2012 and 2013, was {{studied the}} occurrence, biology and {{harmfulness}} of Byctiscus betulae (L.) (Rhynchitidae) on forest woody {{plants in the}} Brno region. <b>Leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> were found on 13 species (and 10 genera) of woody plants. Most frequently, they occurred on Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp. (namely on T. cordata), Salix caprea and Populus tremula. The beetles hibernate in ground pupal chambers and appear on woody plants {{in the last decade}} of April. After hibernation, females live on average seven (males five) weeks, and damage on average 40 (males 25) cm 2 of leaves. The females create <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> on annual shoots they have gnawed, exceptionally (in 2 %) on leaves with damaged petioles. In the rolls on F. sylvatica, they roll on average 5. 6 leaves whose total average area is 49. 5 cm 2 and lay on average 5. 1 eggs. In the rolls on Tilia spp., they roll on average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 63. 2 cm 2 and lay on average 4. 9 eggs. In the rolls on S. caprea, they roll on average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 38. 3 cm 2 and lay on average 3. 5 eggs. The maximum number of laid eggs (on average 8. 0) was observed in the <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> on Vitis vinifera. The average number of eggs in the <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> was decreasing from May to July. The number of eggs was increasing with the increasing total <b>leaf</b> area <b>rolled.</b> The females lay on average 50 eggs. On P. tremula, S. caprea and Pyrus pyraster they create about 15 <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls,</b> on F. sylvatica and Tilia spp. about 10 <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> and on V. vinifera ca. 8 <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls.</b> Embryogenesis lasts from 8 to 9 days. Larvae develop over 3 instars and damage ca. 300 mm 2 of leaves. Coming of age within 4 − 7 weeks, they leave the <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> from mid-June to the beginning of September...|$|R

2500|$|The {{leaves of}} Pinot Noir are {{generally}} smaller {{than those of}} Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah. The Pinot vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical; shaped like a pine cone. Some viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may {{have given rise to}} the name. In the vineyard Pinot Noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels (it must be low yielding for production of quality wines), soil types and pruning techniques. In the winery it is sensitive to fermentation methods, yeast strains and is highly reflective of its terroir with different regions sometimes producing very different wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible to bunch rot and similar fungal diseases. The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy infection by <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> and fanleaf viruses causes significant vine health problems. These complications have given the grape a reputation for being difficult to grow: Jancis Robinson calls Pinot a [...] "minx of a vine" [...] and André Tchelistcheff declared that [...] "God made Cabernet Sauvignon whereas the devil made Pinot Noir." [...] It is much less tolerant of harsh vineyard conditions than the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot or Grenache.|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the biology of Attelabus nitens (Scop.) in the Brno region. In the growing season of 2014, 35 field {{inspections}} were made at 10 sites in the intervals of three‑to‑seven days. <b>Leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> were found on Quercus petraea, Q. dalechampii, Q. robur, Q. pubescens and Q. cerris, rarely on Castanea sativa. Hibernating in the shed <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> are larvae of the second instar. These pupate in the rolls {{during the second half}} of April and beginning of May. At the turn of April and May, beetles fly onto host woody plants of the 1 st age class. They damage about 30 cm 2 of leaves in two months. Females create about 30 <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> into which they lay 1 to 5 (on average 1. 1) eggs. The species develops through two larval instars, which damage 1. 7 to 2. 3 cm 2 of leaves and come of age towards the end of the growing season. On the primary shoots of oaks (with relatively large leaves), the females rolled below‑average sized leaves. On the secondary shoots (with relatively small leaves), they rolled leaves of average to above‑average size. The female gnaws a deep mine into the main vein (in a third of its length) from the adaxial side first. Then she makes a cross cut into the blade from both sides up to the main vein, which is damaged only on the surface. Into thicker sections of veins she bites out (mainly from the abaxial side) on average 350 cross cuts. Only then, the female folds the wilted leaf part adaxially along the main vein and after having laid an egg (eggs), she rolls the blade from the end into a transversal cylindrical roll. On the leaves of Quercus spp. with an average area of 14. 3 cm 2, the females roll on average 11. 9 cm 2 (83. 2 %). During the growing period, 36 % of individuals died in the <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> on primary shoots and 28 % of individuals died in the <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> on secondary shoots...|$|R
