5|$|Detective Mode, {{allowing}} {{the investigation of}} crimes, was not considered an improvement by Kotaku and GameSpot; while they considered it a good idea, its execution was minimal since a player simply <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next highlighted piece of evidence rather than solving a puzzle. Game Informer liked it, {{saying that they were}} complicated and showed how Batman analyzes a crime scene. The combat system received mixed reviews. The shock gloves were criticized as overpowered and making fights too easy, allowing Batman unblockable attacks (instantly disabling most opponents) and removing the need for tactics. Reviewers said that changes to combat punished more than challenged; greater enemy numbers and variety made sustaining an attack difficult, and (combined with an array of gadgets which hindered—rather than damaged—enemies) made encounters long and repetitive. Joystiq noted that the game emphasized combat over stealth. Kotaku called the combat rating system distracting screen clutter which broke the player's concentration, but GameFront said that the system was positive reinforcement for successful fights. The stealth sections were considered of similar quality to previous installments; their unchanged function left the methods of obtaining victory the same, making for a rote experience. The Remote Claw was criticized for making stealth sections too easy, allowing multiple enemies to be disabled without moving from the player's starting position.|$|E

She follows the trail of clues underneath the mansion of , where she finds a map detailing the locations of all of the Assassin vaults hidden in London. Her search leads her to famous landmarks such as the Monument to the Great Fire of London and St. Paul's Cathedral. She obtains the key needed to access the Shroud's vault, but it is stolen by Thorne. Evie then heads to the Tower of London, where the vault is located and assassinates Thorne. Thorne explains the Shroud is not in the Tower and claims that the Assassins have no idea of the true power of the Shroud before dying. Green believes the real vault is hidden in Buckingham Palace, and enlists the aid of the Maharajah Duleep Singh to find the schematics for the building. Unfortunately, the Templars manage to seize the schematics first. In addition to her hunt for the Shroud, Evie also helps correct the unintended consequences Jacob's assassinations have caused such as medicine shortages and currency inflation.|$|E

So beauty would get more importance. But by taking one girl to play all twelve roles, the importance shifts to the characters." [...] Gowariker decided not to use prosthetics or makeup to create different <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> characters but to make them distinctive using hair and costumes. He wanted to differentiate the characters through their mannerisms and traits.|$|E

Gaga was inspired by silent film and early horror films and explained that the concept behind the video is that of her passion for shape-shifting and transforming. She described it as [...] "Iconography in motion, as magic." [...] Gaga and her team decided to use several different <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> video, with each being representative of different facets of her as a performer. Attires worn in the video included designs by Gareth Pugh, vintage John Galliano, as well as outfits crafted by the Haus of Gaga.|$|E
500|$|In {{straightforward}} cases, {{a diagnosis}} {{may be made}} and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation. In complicated or questionable cases, {{it may be useful}} to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase. [...] Another test, urine microscopy, <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of {{greater than or equal to}} 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment. However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment. As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.|$|E

The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice.

He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who always <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> positive in people." [...] In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95. He was the last surviving Invincible to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death leaves only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.|$|E

500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not doing things that would damage the make-up". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother’s photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contained}} several elaborate effects, which were achieved via makeup and CGI. Makeup artist Laverne Basham and hairstylist Anji Bemben {{were given the}} task of creating four distinct <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> quadruplets, all played by Emily Perkins. In addition, they were also responsible for making Jody Racicot appear older. This task proved particularly difficult because Racicot {{did not have any}} hair to dye grey and had [...] "the tightest skin of any thirtysomething guy [...] ever seen." [...] The visual effects to create the shifting heads of the Seraphim were created by means of CGI and took visual effects supervisor Lauri Kailsen-George a long time to complete; she did not finish until [...] "hours before airtime." [...] The scene was created by having actor Tracy Elofson wear a lion mask to track the scene. Then, the different heads were filmed against a green screen and added in. Various light effects were then interlayed to [...] "make it look scary" [...] and more [...] "angelic".|$|E
500|$|Carpenter was {{interested}} in creating two distinct <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movie. [...] "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England". Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, {{who was at the}} time a special effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures. Cameron {{was also one of the}} directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a 3D wireframe animation.|$|E
