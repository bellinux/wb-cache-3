50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints. Specifically, the original design had the ball joints under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|E
50|$|The kingpin axis is {{the line}} between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints of the hub. On a MacPherson strut, the top pivot point is the strut bearing, and the bottom point is the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joint. The {{inclination}} of the steering axis is measured as the angle between the steering axis and the centerline of the wheel. This means that if the camber angle is adjustable within the pivot points the scrub radius can be changed, this alters the width and offset of the tires on a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} the Ford Focus, which uses MacPherson struts, and the {{anti-roll}} bar is connected directly to the strut, so the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joint is only carrying fore and aft traction/braking and lateral cornering loads.|$|E
50|$|Another option, as {{seen for}} example in higher-end cell phones, is package on package {{stacking}} during board assembly. The SoC includes processors and numerous digital peripherals, and comes in a ball grid package with lower and upper connections. The <b>lower</b> <b>balls</b> connect to the board and various peripherals, with the upper balls in a ring holding the memory buses used to access NAND flash and DDR2 RAM. Memory packages could come from multiple vendors.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the changes}} made through 10 and Under Tennis, {{not only are}} court {{dimensions}} smaller, racket shorter, and tennis nets <b>lower</b> but the <b>balls</b> used are larger and have less compression. With a <b>lower</b> compression, <b>balls</b> don’t bounce as high. This keeps them within a younger players strike zone creating more chances {{to make contact with}} the ball.|$|R
50|$|The Semi-Western grip is {{obtained}} {{by placing the}} hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger is right on bevel #4. This racquet grip is popular with baseliners who like to hit with much topspin and a ferocious amount of power. It gets more hand behind the grip, causing shots to result with more ferocity, and provides a contact point much farther out front. On the other hand, it poses problems with <b>lower</b> <b>balls,</b> which are hard to catch with the (extreme) down-up movement required for the Semi-Western grip.|$|R
50|$|Other {{vehicles}} of the 1960s era, including some Vauxhalls, had <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints with considerable end float, because the joint {{was always in}} tension as the spring and damper loads were applied via the lower control arm and were always non-zero.|$|E
50|$|The first Styluses used a {{modified}} Fury chassis, afterwards a purpose built chassis {{was made to}} accommodate the lowered doors. The front rocker arms were upgraded with needle bearings and the front lower arms got redesigned to prevent the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints being damaged. As with most Sylva models, various engines can be fitted.|$|E

The paper presents the results of standard tests carried out on four ball machine. This tribometer is used to analyze the load-carrying properties of cutting fluids. The results are compared with the standard requirements, related to the measured wear scar on the three <b>lower</b> <b>balls</b> of the four ball device. An optimum of sulphur additive content into the base oil was found around 10 %.

50|$|A Galilean cannon is {{a device}} that {{demonstrates}} conservation of linear momentum. It comprises a stack of balls, starting with a large, heavy ball {{at the base of}} the stack and progresses up to a small, lightweight ball at the top. The basic idea is that this stack of balls can be dropped to the ground and almost all of the kinetic energy in the <b>lower</b> <b>balls</b> will be transferred to the topmost ball - which will rebound to many times the height from which it was dropped. At first sight, the behavior seems highly counter-intuitive, but in fact is precisely what conservation of momentum predicts. The principal difficulty is in keeping the configuration of the balls stable during the initial drop. Early descriptions involve some sort of glue/tape, tube, or net to align the balls.|$|R

50|$|The {{caster angle}} or castor angle is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the upper ball joint to the centre of the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joint) and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust caster angle to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|E
50|$|Much {{like the}} second-generation GM F-body 1970-1981 and X-body vehicles, the GM M-van (Astro/Safari) had a bolt-on subframe. For the M-van, the front {{suspension}} shares most components with the GM B-body station wagon (Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser) with a leaf-spring rear suspension. The <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints were larger than their B-body counterparts (similar to 1977-96 Cadillac D platform vehicles, e.g., Fleetwood limousines). These ball joints were later {{used in the}} final Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (police package) cars manufactured in 1995 and 1996. They also shared many mechanical similarities to the GMT 325/330 midsize S/T pickups and utility vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Crazy Tennis is one arcade-ish mode where players get {{points from}} simply hitting the ball. There is one overall sense of wackiness in this mode, as some <b>lower</b> <b>balls</b> are {{blocked by a}} popup racket on the net, some powerups {{increase}} the size of the ball or allow direct control of its path, and there is even a cameo from Dizzy, who walks on the net and works as a piñata. After five hits Dizzy breaks, giving several points to the last player who hit the ball. Players can get points from hitting the ball, breaking Dizzy and winning the point, which aggregates all the points played since the last service (which is done automatically by a machine, instead of a player). The game is timed, and both players must achieve the target score - if one of them reaches the timer without the required score, the game ends and the player with the higher score is declared winner.|$|R

5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two {{ball joints}} {{are called the}} [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower ball joint". <b>Lower</b> <b>ball</b> joints are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom ball joint. (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top ball joint, or entirely by the bottom ball joint. The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} spring load) is usually, but not always, taken on the same ball joint as the spring load. The anti-roll bar loading is often, but not always, taken on the bottom ball joint. It may be taken by the top ball joint, or directly from the steering knuckle by ball-jointed drop links.|$|E
5000|$|The {{style of}} play on a links golf course is {{considerably}} different from the {{style of play}} on other types of courses. The challenges of links golf fall into two categories: Firstly, {{the nature of the}} courses themselves, which tend to be characterised by uneven fairways, thick rough, and small, deep bunkers known as [...] "pot bunkers"; and secondly, due to their coastal location and lack of trees, many links courses are frequently windy. This affects the style of play required, favouring players who are able to play low accurate shots. As many links courses consist of an [...] "outward" [...] nine in one direction along the coast, and an [...] "inward" [...] nine which returns in the opposite direction, players often have to cope with opposite wind patterns in each half of their round. As a result, successful links golfers learn to control the trajectory of their shots by playing a <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> flight. Greens on links courses tend to be free of fronting hazards, allowing golfers to bounce the golf ball into the green, rather than hitting high approach shots with strong backspin.|$|E

In the tail, up to four crew could be located in the waist, operating waist guns, a retractable <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> turret and a tail gun turret matching the nose turret. The waist gun hatches were provided with doors, with the ball turret required to be retractable for ground clearance when preparing to land, as well as for greater aerodynamic efficiency.

50|$|The <b>lower</b> the <b>ball</b> {{comes at}} the volleyer, {{the harder it is}} to hit an {{effective}} volley. In some cases, a player is better off to let the ball bounce rather than attempt to volley it, then hit it on the rise right after the bounce. This is called a half volley (although technically it is not a volley) {{and is one of the}} most difficult shots in tennis; John McEnroe, Patrick Rafter and Leander Paes were considered masters of it.|$|R
50|$|The mast is hollow, {{partly to}} reduce weight (up to 4.5% of a keelboat's displacement), and partly {{so that the}} halyard can run inside the mast, and {{therefore}} manufactured in two halves. At the top is a metal bracket with pulley for the halyard which then runs inside the mast and comes out below deck, where a pulley is located under the mast root. The mast foot is tapered so the mast stands firmly in the <b>lower</b> tapered <b>ball</b> bearing.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{there being}} many {{different}} variations and styles, in general {{there are three}} different techniques to hit the one-handed backhand. The first is the slice, the oldest version of the single-handed backhand, which was popularised by many classic players such as Ken Rosewall and was still used up until the 1980s even in the women's tour, with many great women champions such as Steffi Graf {{having one of the}} lowest, most effective slice backhands. The slice backhand is considered the most simple and is the easiest to learn technique-wise. However, it is much harder to master. Unlike the slice on its own, the slice backhand refers to a player continuously using slice on their backhand as an ordinary shot, instead of for variety. Most slice backhands are executed with a continental grip, identical to that of the backhand volley. The motion is also simple, and involves a cut at about 45 degrees {{to the bottom of the}} ball. The slice action closer to the bottom results in a higher and slower ball, typically used for lobs while a cut closer to the side of the ball results in a faster and <b>lower</b> <b>ball.</b> It is considered hard to be able to consistently pull off deep, low yet quick backhand slices and requires lots of practice and finesse. Such slice backhands often prevent opponents from getting under the ball easily and hitting easy winners. It also slows down the pace of the ball due to the back-spin on it, giving time for the player to anticipate and set up shots. For example, Steffi Graf often used her slice backhand to buy time for her to move around and hit inside-out forehands, her signature shot. It can also act as a good bluff to hit drop-shots or even fake drop-shots.|$|E
40|$|A small ball {{is placed}} {{on top of a}} larger ball, and they are dropped from that initial orientation, as {{illustrated}} in Figure 1. For elastic collisions where the mass ratio is approximately 3 - 1, after the collision with the floor the larger ball will remain on the floor and all the kinetic energy of the two balls will be transferred to the lighter ball. The lighter ball on top then flies off very rapidly, as shown in the video. A brief analysis is shown in Figure 2 at three times- (a) just before the impact of the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> with the floor, (b) just after the impact of the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> with the floor but before the impact between the two balls, and (c) just after the collision between the two balls.

40|$|The Lower Control arm is {{the most}} vital {{component}} in a suspension system. It is usually a steel bracket that pivots on rubber bushings mounted to the chassis. The other end supports the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joint. Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the control arm while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the control arm using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> joint bush. Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the control arm was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC. NASTRAN and ABAQUS analysis. Multi-axial Fatigue analysis using NEiNASTRAN and WINLIFE is discussed. ...|$|E
