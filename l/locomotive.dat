5|$|Rogers was {{not working}} {{completely}} alone in American <b>locomotive</b> manufacturing. In 1837, in addition to building the company's first <b>locomotive,</b> Rogers also filled orders from fellow <b>locomotive</b> builders Matthias W. Baldwin (founder of Baldwin <b>Locomotive</b> Works) and William Norris (founder of Norris <b>Locomotive</b> Works) for <b>locomotive</b> tires of various sizes. Once Rogers started working on his own locomotives, however, no further orders from either Baldwin or Norris were forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Arguably, {{the most}} famous <b>locomotive</b> {{to come out of}} the Rogers shops was built in 1855. Rogers built a 4-4-0, serial number 631, in December of that year for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. The {{railroad}} named the <b>locomotive</b> The General. This <b>locomotive,</b> best known for being at the heart of an American Civil War incident, is now on display at the Southern Museum of Civil War and <b>Locomotive</b> History (the Big Shanty Museum) in Kennesaw, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time that the No. 3 <b>locomotive</b> was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth <b>locomotive</b> was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam <b>locomotive</b> to {{purchase}} and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable <b>locomotive</b> for sale in New Jersey, and after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the <b>locomotive.</b> Best was able to determine that the <b>locomotive</b> had been built by Baldwin <b>Locomotive</b> Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad in New Jersey, and that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the <b>locomotive</b> was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel fuel. This <b>locomotive</b> became the DRR's No. 4 <b>locomotive</b> and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E

50|$|The British {{produced}} <b>locomotives</b> {{were built}} in 1869 while the first Finnish <b>Locomotives</b> were constructed in 1874 and 1875. The British <b>locomotives</b> set the design characteristics of the Finnish A3, A5 <b>locomotives.</b> The price of the domestically produced Finnish <b>locomotives</b> was almost 50% higher than the imported <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1959, with {{electrification}} of {{the main}} line of the Trans-Siberian Railway, <b>locomotives</b> operating on that line out of Kartali Depot were transferred to the Tselinnoe, Northern, Kemerovo and South Urals railway lines. As of 1976 there were still 521 <b>locomotives</b> of the class in operation on the Northern (168 <b>locomotives),</b> Kazakh (209 <b>locomotives),</b> Sverdlovsk (35 <b>locomotives),</b> South Urals (34 <b>locomotives),</b> and West Siberian (75 <b>locomotives)</b> lines. However retirement of steam <b>locomotives</b> began in earnest in the late 1960s and eventually all <b>locomotives</b> of this type were retired.|$|R
5|$|As {{the train}} {{travelled}} through the Netherlands from Emmerich am Rhein to Hook of Holland, it was hauled by <b>Locomotive</b> No. 01 1075. No. 01 1075 is a preserved steam <b>locomotive</b> built in 1940 and {{based at the}} Stoom Stichting Nederland (SSN) railway museum in Rotterdam. It {{is one of the}} <b>locomotive</b> class DRG Class 01.10.|$|E
5|$|As well as hauling enthusiast {{specials}} in the United Kingdom, the <b>locomotive</b> toured {{extensively in}} the United States and Canada from 1969 until 1973 and Australia in 1988/89.

5|$|By 1957, the DRR was {{becoming}} overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney {{determined that a}} third train was needed. Instead of having another <b>locomotive</b> built from scratch to pull the train, Disney believed that costs could be saved by purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam <b>locomotive,</b> and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable <b>locomotive</b> was found in Louisiana; it had been built by Baldwin <b>Locomotive</b> Works in 1894, had previously {{been used as a}} switcher at a sugar cane mill in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the <b>locomotive</b> was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to burn diesel oil for fuel to generate steam. This <b>locomotive</b> became the DRR's No. 3 <b>locomotive</b> and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 <b>locomotive</b> when it went into service were five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the Excursion Train, which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.|$|E

5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric <b>locomotive</b> capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the <b>locomotive</b> was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The <b>locomotive</b> and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the <b>locomotive</b> from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric <b>locomotive</b> in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} appeal run by Steam Railway magazine, {{it was decided}} to re-streamline No. 46229. The <b>locomotive</b> was moved to Tyseley <b>Locomotive</b> Works, for the work to be carried out.

These <b>locomotives</b> can be considered the ancestors of diesel-electric <b>locomotives,</b> and other self powered <b>locomotives</b> which use an electric transmission.|$|R
50|$|These <b>locomotives,</b> {{together}} with the CGR's 6th Class <b>locomotives</b> and the CSAR Classes 6-L1 and 6-L3 <b>locomotives</b> which had been inherited from the OVGS via the IMR, were grouped into altogether fourteen sub-classes by the SAR. The 4-6-0 <b>locomotives</b> became SAR Classes 6, 6A, 6B, 6D to 6H and 6J to 6L, the 2-6-2 <b>locomotives</b> became Class 6Y and the 2-6-4 <b>locomotives</b> became Class 6Z.|$|R

In 1998, funded by public donation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the third party purchaser was paid off and the money was now available to restore the <b>locomotive.</b> The work was carried out at the railway workshops at Swanwick Junction and in July 2001 the restored <b>locomotive</b> was allowed a trial run on the national rail network, where it promptly broke down and had to be towed home. With the fault fixed, No. 46233 now started to generate income by hauling enthusiasts' trains, as well as the Royal Train on two occasions. Following another overhaul commencing in 2010, the <b>locomotive</b> resumed its steaming duties in 2012.

5|$|Out of {{a desire}} to have four trains {{regularly}} running at once each day on the DRR, in the mid-1990s the Disneyland park began to search for an additional narrow-gauge steam <b>locomotive</b> to add to the railroad's rolling stock. One such <b>locomotive</b> was acquired from Bill Norred in 1996 in exchange for the combine car and four coaches from the DRR's retired Retlaw 1 passenger train set, but after the park received it, the new <b>locomotive</b> was deemed to be too large for the DRR's operations. It was then sent to the Walt Disney World Railroad in the Magic Kingdom park of Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, where the <b>locomotive</b> was dedicated, despite being too small for the railroad's operations, and named after Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ward Kimball. Still needing a fifth <b>locomotive</b> for the DRR, the park traded the Ward Kimball <b>locomotive</b> in 1999 to the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad in the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, for a new <b>locomotive</b> suitable for the railroad. Named Maud L., the <b>locomotive</b> was built by Baldwin <b>Locomotive</b> Works in 1902 and was originally used to haul sugar cane at the Laurel Valley Sugar Plantation in Louisiana owned by the Barker and Lepine Company. After arriving in Disneyland, the Maud L., later renamed Ward Kimball like the <b>locomotive</b> for which it was traded, was given a new cab built by Disney and a new boiler built by Hercules Power, which was subcontracted by Superior Boiler Works. Due to budget issues, the restoration of the <b>locomotive</b> was suspended not long after its arrival, and its parts were planned to be placed in long-term storage in late 2003. The Ward Kimball locomotive's restoration efforts were resurrected soon after, when it was decided that its addition to the DRR would be incorporated into the celebration of Disneyland's fiftieth anniversary in July 2005. In late 2004, Boschan Boiler and Restorations led by Paul Boschan, a former roundhouse manager and engineer at the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad in Felton, California, was awarded the contract to complete the restoration of the Ward Kimball. The restoration work performed included installing new driving wheels, attaching a new smokebox door, and applying gold-leaf silhouettes of Kimball's Jiminy Cricket character {{on the sides of the}} headlamp. The Ward Kimball <b>locomotive,</b> which entered service on June 25, 2005, became the DRR's No. 5 <b>locomotive,</b> and on February 15 the following year, John Kimball, the son of Ward Kimball, who died in 2002, christened the <b>locomotive</b> during its dedication ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Rogers <b>Locomotive</b> and Machine Works was a 19th-century {{manufacturer}} of railroad steam locomotives based in Paterson, in Passaic County, New Jersey, in the United States. It built {{more than six}} thousand steam locomotives for railroads around the world. Most railroads in 19th-century United States rostered at least one Rogers-built <b>locomotive.</b> The company's most famous product was a <b>locomotive</b> named The General, built in December 1855, {{which was one of}} the principals of the Great <b>Locomotive</b> Chase of the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western.

This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built <b>locomotive</b> in the same class was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class <b>locomotive,</b> number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR <b>locomotive</b> to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E
