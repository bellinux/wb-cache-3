An archaeologist, art historian, <b>linguist,</b> museum curator, <b>administrator,</b> and celebrated teacher, Millet {{was able to make}} great strides in the daunting task of translating the lost language of the ancient Sudan, Meroitic. His careful study of the unusual script led to the decipherment of a number of Meroitic words, phrases, and verb formations, and helped shed some light on the social and political constructs of this mysterious civilization. No one else has approached his level of contribution to knowledge of this important ancient African empire. Millet's final word on the Meroitic language was published posthumously in [...] "The Meroitic Inscriptions from Gebel Adda", The Journal of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities in 2005.|$|R
40|$|Graffiti have {{received}} a great attention from scholars {{as they have been}} considered a vital cultural phenomenon for many years (Trahan, 2011; Divsalar & Nemati, 2012; Zakareviciute, 2014; Farnia, 2014; El-Nashar & Nayef; 2016). Although there are extensive contemporary researches on graffiti in many disciplines, such as linguistics, cultural studies, politics, art, and communication (Pietrosanti, 2010;  Farnia, 2014; Oganda, 2015), there are few studies exploring graffiti on classrooms’ walls in higher education milieus (Farnia, 2014). To the best knowledge of the researchers, very few studies were done on the Jordanian context (e. g. Al-Haj Eid, 2008; Abu-Jaber, et al., 2012) and none was done on the Jordanian universities. Therefore, this study aims at analysing the content and communicative features of writings found on universities’ classrooms’ walls, corridors, and washrooms and their relation to the socio-cultural values of the society in order to explore how universities help students voice their attitudes and thoughts. The linguistic features that characterise these writings were also examined. Graffiti-writings, which were collected from the University of Jordan and the Hashemite University, were coded and analysed using the thematic content analysis technique (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 1995). The analysis of the data has shown that graffiti serve different communicative language functions related to personal, social, national, religious, political, and taboo matters. The most salient linguistic features of these graffiti are simplicity and variation. It can be concluded that graffiti are distinctive and silent ways of communication, particularly in students’ society. The study will be of great importance to <b>linguists,</b> sociologists, educators, <b>administrators,</b> teachers and parents. It is enrichment to the available literature on linguistic studies...|$|R

Hailing from the Mising community, a small indigenous tribe of Assam, India, and from an economically challenged and geographically remote village 'Ghunasuti Ayengia', the challenges and obstacles to his formal education were many, but he pursued education single-mindedly nonetheless and eventually earned a Post Graduate degree from Delhi University, which was quite uncommon in his community at that time.Starting {{his career as a}} lecturer of English language in Cotton College, Guwahati, he further proceeded to obtain a Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Linguistics from the University of Reading, UK, and also successfully completed a course in Distance Teaching at University of London Institute of Education, UK. He served in various senior level posts in various educational arms of the Government of Assam. He was the founder President of the Mising Agom Kebang (Linguistic Society of the Mising, also known as Mising Sahitya Sabha), the apex body of the Mising community aiming for the preservation and development of the Mising language. His body of work includes the 'Mising Gompir Kumsung' (a 900-page dictionary of the Mising language with an introduction to Mising grammar), 'EkuNki nibondho', a collection of selected articles written in Assamese, 'Glimpses', a collection of articles written in English, research work on the Mising and Assamese language, editorial work on traditional Mising literary artifacts like folk songs, along with lexicographical works like dictionary, grammar and phonology of the Mising language.His work on his mother tongue, Mising, is his invaluable contribution to the Mising community and also to the Assamese people and culture at large.|$|R
