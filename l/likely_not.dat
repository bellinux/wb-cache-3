5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court said that his speech was {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> be appealed.|$|E
5|$|A July 1966 {{report by}} the New York Academy of Medicine Committee on Public Health cautioned that New York City's air-pollution problem made it {{susceptible}} to acute and lethal episodes and recommended a reduction of air pollution.

5|$|Applewhite {{moved to}} New York City in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to launch a}} professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado. He then taught at the University of Alabama. He lost his position there after pursuing {{a sexual relationship with}} a male student; his religious education was <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante {{and then}} Peter Jackson were offered the {{opportunity}} to direct the film. Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, and a screening of The Frighteners was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson. Jackson, a lifelong Bond fan, remarked that as Eon tended to go for less famous directors, he would <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> get another chance to direct a Bond film after The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

Ian asks Susan on a date, which forces her to face the unlikeliness of Mike recovering.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled {{backward into}} the Woodley Park â€“ Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> alert as the train rolled backward into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E

5|$|The regulars found {{themselves}} {{trapped in a}} situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some {{attention from the}} media. The two players grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina together, where {{they went to the}} same church and competed in high school against each other. Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd's. It was noted that the two would <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} from that expedition eight days later, Brigadier General Richard Montgomery had assumed command of the invasion due to Schuyler's illness. Montgomery, <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> wanting the troublemaker in his camp, again sent him out, this time to raise a regiment of French-speaking Canadiens. Accompanied by {{a small number of}} Americans, he again set out, traveling through the countryside to Sorel, before turning to follow the Saint Lawrence River up toward Montreal, recruiting upwards of 200 men.|$|E

5|$|With Jacksonville's {{future as}} host in doubt, representatives from Charlotte, North Carolina, Tampa, Florida, and Jacksonville visited the ACC offices to lobby {{to host the}} 2008 game. Orlando, Florida, which had been an early {{contender}} to host the 2008 game, was eliminated from consideration before the meetings took place. As kickoff drew closer, the Gator Bowl Association expressed displeasure with the poor ticket sales, saying that nearly 20,000tickets remained unsold as of {{the week of the}} game and that if it was not a sellout, the game would <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> remain in Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> related to any real change in the climate in which they develop.|$|E
5|$|Following a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army {{under the}} command of Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the {{vicinity}} of Gibraltar (though most <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> in the bay or at the Rock itself). Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula, he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general Musa bin Nusayr. His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: Mons Calpe was renamed Jebel Tariq, the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into Gibraltar.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} {{involved}} in ant keeping is capturing a fertilized queen ant. Ants engage in nuptial flights during spring and summer, and after these flights a fertilized queen ant will land and remove her wings before locating a spot to found her new colony. If a queen has already chewed her wings off, she is <b>likely</b> (but <b>not</b> certainly) fertilized. If a queen ant {{on the ground}} still has her wings, she is <b>likely</b> (but <b>not</b> certainly) unfertilized.|$|R
5|$|Following the Draft, the 1994â€“95 NHL {{season was}} {{suspended}} for three-and-a-half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior {{for the beginning of}} the 1994â€“95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call him up to the NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would <b>likely</b> <b>not</b> occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E
