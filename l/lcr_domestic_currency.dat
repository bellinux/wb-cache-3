50|$|Under {{the fixed}} {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank operates in the foreign exchange market to maintain a specific exchange rate. If there is pressure to depreciate the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency's</b> exchange rate because the supply of <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> exceeds its demand in foreign exchange markets, the local authority buys <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> with foreign currency to decrease the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency's</b> supply in the foreign exchange market. This keeps the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency's</b> exchange rate at its targeted level. If there is pressure to appreciate the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency's</b> exchange rate because the currency's demand exceeds its supply in the foreign exchange market, the local authority buys foreign <b>currency</b> with <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> to increase the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency's</b> supply in the foreign exchange market. Again,this keeps the exchange rate at its targeted level.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{aiming at}} {{decreasing}} {{the exchange rate}}/price of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency,</b> authorities could purchase foreign currency bonds. During this transaction, extra supply of <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> will drag down <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> price, and extra demand of foreign currency will push up foreign currency price. As a result, the exchange rate drops.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{a search}} model of currency interdependence, and {{uses it to}} examine how in dollarized economies the foreign currency reacts to various shocks to the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency.</b> Currency interdependence is generated by allowing sellers {{to take into account}} their outside option of trading with the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> while bargaining with buyers holding the foreign currency. The shocks consist in movements in the domestic interest rate, domestic inflation and the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency’s</b> market power. We show that if the purchasing power of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> is low, any shock that increases its value, such as a higher domestic interest rate, translates into a depreciation of the foreign currency. However, the result is opposite when the purchasing power of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> is high. We show that when money is indivisible these shocks can drive in or out the foreign currency. When money is divisible, this currency substitution effect is more limited. We use our results to discuss the opportunity of various de-dollarization policies and show that some can be counterproductive...|$|R
50|$|Conversely, if the {{exchange}} rate of borrowers <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> were to weaken against the currency in which the mortgage is denominated, then it would cost the borrower more in their <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> to repay the mortgage.

40|$|Most {{emerging}} markets do not borrow much internationally {{in their own}} currency, although doing that has been argued as an attractive insurance mechanism. This phenomenon, commonly labeled"the original sin", has mostly been interpreted {{as evidence of the}} countries'inability to borrow in <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> from abroad. This paper provides a novel explanation for that phenomenon: not that countries are unable to borrow abroad in their currency, they might not need to do so. In the model, the small prevalence of external borrowing in <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> arises as an equilibrium outcome, despite the absence of exogenous frictions or limits on market participation. The equilibrium outcome is driven by the fact that domestic and foreign lenders have differential consumption baskets. In particular, a large part of domestic lenders'consumption basket is denominated in <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> whereas all of foreign lenders'is in dollars. A depreciation of <b>domestic</b> <b>currency,</b> which tends to occur in bad times, is therefore less harmful to domestic savers than to foreign investors. This makes domestic lenders require a lower premium than foreign lenders on <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> debt. For plausible calibrations, this consumption basket effect can induce foreign investors {{to pull out of the}} <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> debt market.

5000|$|High and unanticipated {{inflation}} rates {{decrease the}} demand for domestic money and raise {{the demand for}} alternative assets, including foreign currency and assets dominated by foreign currency. This phenomenon is called the [...] "flight from domestic money". It results in a rapid and sizable process of currency substitution. In countries with high inflation rates, the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> tends to be gradually displaced by a stable currency. At {{the beginning of this}} process, the store-of-value function of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> is replaced by the foreign currency. Then, the unit-of-account function of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> is displaced when many prices are quoted in a foreign currency. A prolonged period of high inflation will induce the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> to lose its function as medium of exchange when the public carries out many transactions in foreign currency.|$|R
40|$|The {{inability}} of emerging market economies to borrow in <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> in international financial markets {{has been extensively}} studied in the literature, while {{it has not been}} analyzed within the context of sovereign default risk models. This paper develops a two-sector small open economy model to analyze the effects of debt denomination on default risk and interest rates in emerging markets. Default risk is determined endogenously and depends on the incentives for repayment. The economy can borrow using tradable denominated non-indexed bonds or bonds whose return is indexed to the domestic price index, which are used as proxies for foreign <b>currency</b> and <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> debt, respectively. The model predicts that foreign currency debt leads to lower default risk for high output levels and <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> debt reduces the default risk for low output levels. Although the effect of debt denomination on default risk changes with the output level, the default rate of the economy and average interest rates decline as <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing increases.

50|$|Mainly in export-oriented economies, {{the effects}} of {{monetary}} policy transmission operating through exchange rate effects {{has been a major}} concern of their central banks. Expansionary monetary policy will cause the interest rate in a country to fall and deposits that are denominated in that <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> become less attractive than their foreign equivalents. As a result, the value of domestic deposits will fall compared to foreign deposits, which leads to a depreciation of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency.</b> Since the value of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> is falling compared to foreign currencies, it now takes more of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> to buy a same amount in the foreign currency, and thus a depreciation of a currency is denoted be ↑e.

50|$|Fixed {{exchange}} rates are usually maintained {{by a combination}} of legally enforced capital controls and the central bank standing ready to purchase or sell <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> in exchange for foreign currency. Under fixed {{exchange rates}}, persistent capital outflows or trade deficits will involve the central bank using its foreign exchange reserves to buy <b>domestic</b> <b>currency,</b> to prop up demand for the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> and thus to prop up its value. However, this activity is limited by the amount of foreign currency reserves the central bank owns; the prospect of running out of these reserves and having to abandon this process may lead a central bank to devalue its currency in order to stop the foreign currency outflows.|$|R
50|$|A {{currency}} board (also known as 'linked exchange rate system") effectively replaces {{the central bank}} through a legislation to fix the currency to that of another country. The <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> remains perpetually exchangeable for the reserve currency at the fixed exchange rate. As the anchor currency is now the basis for movements of the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency,</b> the interest rates and inflation in the domestic economy would be greatly influenced by those of the foreign economy to which the <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> is tied.

40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on a puzzling pattern in foreign {{exchange}} markets: <b>Domestic</b> <b>currencies</b> appreciate (depreciate) systematically during foreign (domestic) working hours. These time-of-day patterns are statistically and economically highly significant. They pervasively persist across many years, even after accounting for calendar effects. This phenomenon is difficult to reconcile with the random walk and market efficiency hypothesis. Microstructural and behavioural explanations suggest that the main raison d'etre is a <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> bias coupled with market segmentation. The prevalence of domestic (foreign) traders demanding the counterpart <b>currency</b> during <b>domestic</b> (foreign) working hours implies a cyclical net positive (negative) imbalance in dealers' inventory.

30|$|In general, {{the fear}} of {{floating}} comes from three dimensions. First, currency depreciation could increase the real burden of external debt. Many enterprises and financial institutions in developing countries have substantial amount of liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, while most their assets are denominated in <b>domestic</b> <b>currencies,</b> namely <b>currency</b> mismatch. When <b>domestic</b> <b>currencies</b> depreciate, the balance sheets of corporate sector and financial sector will deteriorate, making it even hard to get financed on the international financial market. Second, currency depreciation could lead to capital flight, which exerts downward pressure on domestic investment and output, especially when the central bank raises interest rates to stop the currency depreciation, in which case, even more contraction. Third, currency depreciation could cause inflation, threatening domestic economic stability. To some extent, pegging its <b>domestic</b> <b>currency</b> to the US dollar or any other inflation-proof currency could be deemed as an institutional arrangement or commitment of a developing country to contain inflation. However, currency depreciation violates the commitment and could trigger a credibility crisis.|$|R
