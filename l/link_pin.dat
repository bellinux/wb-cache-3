A 900 round trial resulted in only two failures, both misfires due to defective primers. Additional ammunition was procured, and testing continued. During this testing, a number of link pins were also broken, and in one case continued firing with a broken rear link caused the barrel to separate just behind the front <b>link</b> <b>pin.</b> After firing a total of 5,800 rounds through the pistol, the only significant problem found was the weakness of the link pins, which was considered readily fixed by the ordnance board. The board recommended purchasing a number of the Model 1900 Colt pistols for use in field trials.|$|E
50|$|The better-known J. T. Marshall gear was a {{modified}} Walschaerts valve gear which was first {{applied to a}} Great Northern Railway mineral locomotive, no. 743, in 1901 and received a glowing report. Next, it was tried on GNR Class C2 No. 1520 in March 1903. There was no external change visible on the locomotive {{as a result of}} this modification. When the valve gear was in use, the motion was derived from two eccentrics, one of which gave lap and lead movement by swinging the link backwards and forwards on its suspension bracket. The other eccentric was set at 90 degrees to the crank and rocked the link by means of a bell crank on the hanging <b>link</b> <b>pin.</b> The position of the radius rod die pin in the link determined the direction of movement and the cutoff. Showing little advantage over the normal Stephenson link valve gear, it was removed from the C2 'Atlantic' in April 1907 to ease maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Construction of PRR 5550 {{was officially}} started on May 31, 2014 with the {{completion}} of the locomotive's bronze keystone shaped number plate, following a successful conclusion to the initial Kickstarter campaign launched by the Trust. The number plate was forged by traditional methods {{by a member of the}} T1 Trust, Chuck Blardone, at an Amish forge within Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This was followed by the construction of the first driving <b>link</b> <b>pin</b> in October 2014. On May 2, 2014, the T1 Trust began meetings and discussions with the Federal Railroad Administration to help ensure that PRR 5550 is constructed to FRA standards. The T1 Trust's application to the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to operate as a federally approved tax-exempt 501(3)(c) charity was approved in July 2014. By March 2015, Steamtown National Historic Site, the Steam Railroading Institute and the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad expressed interest to the T1 Trust to have the locomotive run on their premises. A part sponsor named Gary Bensman constructed the headlight of PRR 5550 in May 2015 and donated it to the T1 Trust. As a sign of gratitude, Bensman's name was engraved into the headlight by the Trust.|$|E
50|$|A {{non-profit}} {{group known}} as the The T1 Trust plans to build an all-new, fully operational T1 using the original plans with subtle performance improvements where necessary. The T1 Trust's goal is to provide mainline excursion service and to set the world speed record for a steam locomotive currently held by the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard at 126 mph. It is worth mentioning the original T1s {{were reported to have}} broken Mallard's speed record as far back as 1948, but these claims have never been officially confirmed. The T1 Trust's cost estimate to build T1 number 5550 is $10 million with an expected completion date of 2030. The construction of 5550 is also following construction and financing methods pioneered by the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado project. The first piece of the locomotive, the keystone shaped number plate, was cast in April 2014, followed by the first minor component, a driving spring <b>link</b> <b>pin,</b> in October 2014. The headlamp was constructed and given to The T1 Trust by a donor in mid 2015. On February 26, 2016 the first driving wheel for 5550 was cast. The massive and complex Boxpok driver weighs 2,500 pounds. In October 2016, construction began on the iconic prow of the locomotive using aircraft grade aluminum framework and plating. On January 18, 2017, the first frames for the cab of 5550 were cut and prepared for assembly. Similar to the prow, the cab frames are made of aircraft grade aluminum. The second Boxpok driver, originally ordered on December 9, 2016, was delivered to the Trust on March 15, 2017.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{upgrades}} {{available for the}} ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, {{the most popular of}} these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster-style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new cylinder and ram unit as well as a Quick Exhaust Valve, or QEV and hose barb. The low pressure regulator pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed {{out of the back of}} the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt <b>link</b> <b>pin,</b> which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com ...|$|E

40|$|Auxin efflux carrier PIN {{proteins}} {{have been}} intensively investigated {{as they are}} the first polar cargos to be identified in plants with a direct relevance for plant patterning. Based on their polar localization; PIN proteins direct the intercellular flow of signaling molecule auxin and thus bear a rate limiting effect on the formation of auxin activity gradients. With this influence on directionality and extent of auxin transport PINs play crucial roles in plant body organization. Many factors such as vesicle trafficking regulator ARF-GEF GNOM, a kinase PINOID, a retromer complex and membrane sterol composition influence polar PIN localization. Recent work uncovers the mechanism that generates default PIN polarity. Real time PIN tracking reveals that PIN polarity is generated from initially non-polar secretion via endocytosis and subsequent polar recycling. In addition, the Rab 5 endocytic pathway emerges to be important for polar PIN localization as Rab 5 interference causes non-polar distribution of PINs. This non-polar distribution of PINs during embryogenesis transiently alters auxin activity gradients and changes organ identity by transforming embryonic leaf cells to root fates. These findings for the first time <b>link</b> <b>PIN</b> polarity-based auxin activity gradient to cell fate decisions and thus demonstrate morphogen (a substance influencing cell fates on its concentration gradient) characters of auxin. They also suggest an auxin activity distribution-dependent sensing module that executes differential apical and basal developmental program during plant embryogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} (CMs) {{take advantage}} of the deformation of their flexible members to transfer motion, force, or energy, offering attractive advantages in terms of manufacturing and performance over traditional rigid-body mechanisms (RBMs). This dissertation aims to advance the topology optimization (TO) technique (1) to design CMs that are more effective in performing their functions while being sufficiently strong to resist yield or fatigue failure; and (2) to design CMs from the perspective of mechanisms rather than that of structures, particularly with the insight into the concepts of joints, actuations, and functions of mechanisms. The existing TO frameworks generally result in CMs that are much like load-bearing structures, limiting the applications of CMs. These CMs (1) do not have joints, (2) are actuated by a translational force, and (3) can only do simple work such as amplifying motion or gripping. Three TO frameworks for the synthesis of CMs are proposed in this dissertation and they are summarized below. First, a framework was developed for the design of efficient and strong CMs. The widely used stiffness-flexibility criterion for CM design with TO results in lumped CMs that are intrinsically efficient in transferring motion, force, or energy but are prone to high localized stress and thus weak to resist yield or fatigue failure. Indeed, distributed CMs may have a better stress distribution than lumped CMs but have the weakness of being less efficient in motion, force, or energy transfer than lumped CMs. Based on this observation, the proposed framework rendered the concept of hybrid systems, hybrid CMs in this case. Further, the hybridization was achieved by a proposed super flexure hinge element and a design criterion called input stroke criterion in addition to the traditional stiffness-flexibility criterion. Both theoretical exploration and CM design examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed framework has two main contributions to the field of CMs: (1) a new design philosophy, i. e., hybrid CMs through TO techniques and (2) a new design criterion—input stroke. Second, a systematic framework was developed for the integrated design of CMs and actuators for the motion generation task. Both rotary actuators and bending actuators were considered. The approach can simultaneously synthesize the optimal structural topology and actuator placement for the desired position, orientation, and shape of the target link in the system while satisfying the constraints such as buckling constraint, yield stress constraint and valid connectivity constraint. A geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis was performed for CMs driven by a bending actuator and CMs driven by a rotary actuator. Novel parameterization schemes were developed to represent the placements of both types of actuators. A new valid connectivity scheme was also developed to check whether a design has valid connectivity among regions of interest based on the concept of directed graphs. Three design examples were constructed and a compliant finger was designed and fabricated. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to simultaneously determine the structure of a CM and the optimal locations of actuators, either a bending actuator or a rotary actuator, to guide a flexible link into desired configurations. Third, the concept of a module view of mechanisms was proposed to represent RBMs and CMs in a general way, particularly using five basic modules: compliant link, rigid <b>link,</b> <b>pin</b> joint, compliant joint, and rigid joint; this concept was further developed for the unified synthesis of the two types of mechanisms, and the synthesis approach was thus coined as module optimization technique—a generalization of TO. Based on the hinge element in the finite element approach developed at TU Delft (Netherlands in early 1970), a beam-hinge model was proposed to describe the connection among modules, which result in a finite element model for both RBMs and CMs. Then, the concept of TO was borrowed to module optimization, particularly to determine the “stay” or “leave” of modules that mesh a design domain. The salient merits with the hinge element include (1) a natural way to describe various types of connections between two elements or modules and (2) a provision of the possibility to specify the rotational input and output motion as a design problem. Several examples were constructed to demonstrate that one may obtain a RBM, or a partially CM, or a fully CM for a given mechanical task using the module optimization approach...|$|E
