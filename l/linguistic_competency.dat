50|$|Pre-theoretical belief {{has been}} an {{important}} notion in some areas of linguistics and philosophy, especially phenomenology and older versions of “ordinary language” philosophy. It is often assumed, rightly or wrongly, that language depends on mental concepts, and that certain concepts are innate. These innate concepts provide sources of very basic <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency,</b> available to any natural language speaker that enables more complex forms of language use, including philosophical, scientific, or other types of technical language. These basic concepts, in combination, may form basic propositional attitudes about things and events. Often “pre-theoretical belief” refers to these basic propositional attitudes. Also, “pre-theoretical beliefs” may refer to simple intuitions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} gaining new {{insights}} into the relationship between language and mathematics skills. The focus was on students whose families do not speak German at home, since it is believed that language difficulties are a major factor in explaining the lower average mathematical competencies of these adolescents. In the context of this study, three sub-studies were conducted in which the relationships between different <b>linguistic</b> <b>competencies</b> and mathematical skills were analyzed. In addition, the disparities between children of families who do not speak German and children of German-speaking families were analyzed. The objective of sub-study 1 was to analyze the impact of reading skills on the development of mathematics skills using a longitudinal study. Furthermore, the sub-study investigated whether children of non-German speakers, taking into account the socio-economic status (SES) and their general cognitive skills, made less progress in mathematics than children of German-speaking families. As expected, the study showed that reading skills, even when controlling for SES and general cognitive skills, not only showed a significant correlation with the mathematical base skills, but also made a significant contribution to predicting the learning gains in mathematics. Although the existing differences in mathematical skills between children of families who do not speak German and those of German-speaking families could be partly explained by their reading skills, the disparities did not increase after controlling for SES and general cognitive skills. Sub-study 2 tried to answer the question, which particular <b>linguistic</b> <b>competencies</b> correlate with the mathematical achievement of children of families who do not speak German. Taking the general cognitive skills into account, it turned out that reading comprehension and vocabulary, but not grammar skills were related to mathematical achievement. Mathematical vocabulary skills were positively associated with all three <b>linguistic</b> <b>competencies</b> under examination. Moreover, the results show that not only the competencies in linguistically demanding, but also the competencies in linguistically less demanding math tasks were related to the linguistic skills of learners. Sub-study 3 applied latent change modeling to investigate the longitudinal relationship between language skills and solving word problems of second language learners. A correlation with solving word problems was not only shown for reading comprehension, but also for grammar skills. While the language skills {{at the beginning of the}} study made no significant contribution in explaining the development of solving word problems in the course of the third grade, the changes in reading comprehension and changes in grammar skills were positively associated with the development of solving word problems. The results of this study support the notion that competencies in the language of instruction are important for acquiring mathematical skills. New insights could be gained regarding the relationship between different <b>linguistic</b> <b>competencies</b> and different mathematical content areas for children of families who do not speak German. Furthermore, it was shown that the language skills of students are a significant predictor of learning gains in mathematics. The study provides clues for possible activities to help students who are facing difficulties in acquiring mathematical skills due to less well-developed language skills...|$|R

QUICK PRIMER What is cultural competency? Cultural competency in healthcare refers to the ability to communicate successfully across social boundaries, to build understanding and trust between provider and patient, and to work with patients to develop treatment plans that are effective, culturally relevant, and financially and logistically manageable for the patient. Why is cultural competency important? Racial/ethnic minority populations are growing steadily in the United States. According to the US Census Bureau, more than half the new babies born in the US are now born to minority families. Already, racial/ethnic minority people outnumber whites in four states (Hawaii, California, New Mexico, and Texas), as well as the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Over the next few decades, the numbers of minority people enrolled in Medicare will increase as the population ages, and the need for culturally relevant healthcare will increase accordingly (Demographic information from the US Census Bureau...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of research into EFL writing {{was on the}} area of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency</b> (i. e. mastery of gram-mar and lexis). However, {{there is a need}} for investigating other pragmatic aspects of writing such as hedges and boosters which have not received the attention they deserve in the learners' written discourse. The key reason for investigating these two markers stemmed from the assumption that <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency</b> does not ensure that a piece of writing is satisfactory. This paper attempts to examine the role of explicit instruction on the learners’ use of hedges and boosters. The instrument selected for this study consists of a persuasive writing task written by forty third-year undergraduate students majoring in English at Sana’a University. The writing persuasive task was recommended as an appropriate instrument to collect such type of data. The findings revealed that prior instruction had a positive impact on the learners’ use of hedges and boosters. The subjects of the experimental group had a significant improvement while the subjects of the control group did not. Based on the findings of the study, it is strongly recommended that teaching hedges and boosters is a useful way for EFL learners...|$|E

40|$|Language {{learning}} strategies (LLS) employed by students learning {{a second language}} are evaluated for frequency of use and relationship to measures of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency</b> and grades. LLS are measured here by use of the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL), version 5. 1 for native English speakers learning a second language. This thesis evaluates {{the usefulness of the}} SILL at predicting LLS usage and second language performance. It also provides statistical analyses of the SILL to evaluate construct validity of the subscales designated within the SILL. Overall and subscale reliability of the SILL were confirmed to be consistent with previous findings, and factor analyses of validity were also confirmed to be consistent with previous findings. Two versions of the SILL exist, and the research presented in this thesis explores the version less commonly studied. Version 5. 1 is used for native English speakers learning a foreign language, and version 7. 0 is used by non-English speakers who are learning English (ESL or EFL students). The extant body of research employing the SILL directly or indirectly is extensive and has produced a variety of evaluative techniques by which to understand the relationship between LLS and other factors associated with second language learning. These factors include grade level, gender, nationality, and participant <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency</b> assessments. The vast majority of research conducted using the SILL employs version 7. 0 (EFL/ESL) in which a heterogeneous group (participants whose native language are Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, or Korean) are measured on LLS usage in learning English. By employing some of the techniques and approaches used in prior EFL SILL research, the benefits of the SILL can be explored as a more homogenous group (native English speakers) branches out into heterogeneous language studies...|$|E
40|$|Many {{minority}} language communities in Southeast Asia use the segment-based Latin alphabet.

Use of the mother tongue for early literacy also supports successful learning through strong home-school relationships.

One role involves compensatory actions to sustain fluency. However, these actions are themselves context-sensitive, so the balance of types of formulaic sequence will vary according to situation.

S. with heavy concentrations of residents with limited English proficiency. A multilingual research team consisting of seven sub-teams in the seven primary languages (Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese) was commissioned to carry out the research in the 2010 Census. The objectives of this research were to identify: (1) how language and socio-cultural factors affect the enumeration of non-English-speaking populations during the Nonresponse Followup interview process; (2) what measures were taken by enumerators to negotiate and maintain access to non-English-speaking households and to collect the required census data from these households; (3) how in-language census materials were used in the field; (4) how non-English speaking immigrant populations perceived and reacted to the census and its public messaging; and (5) what changes, if any, are needed to improve the enumeration process with households that have limited or no English proficiency. Findings from this study will help develop recommendations for planning the 2020 Census, including the Decennial Language Program, questionnaire development, translation of census questions, use of interpreters in enumeration interviews, and interviewer training. This report presents findings from the Spanish research team of bilingual ethnographers who studied the Spanish community to highlight the issues observed in the research. While the findings clearly draw attention to the importance of <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency</b> among NRFU enumerators, they also demonstrate that we need more than <b>linguistic</b> <b>competency,</b> language aids, and minority language media campaigns in order to increase successful census participation among linguistic minorities. The negotiation of interview access, effective communication about the census’ objectives, the translation of concepts that do not carry conceptual equivalence, the ability to successfully sustain the interview as a communicative event, and ultimately the ability to elicit the information that the census is designed to obtain —are all demonstrated to require robust understandings of the highly differentiated social and cultural contexts of particular immigrant communities.
