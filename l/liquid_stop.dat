The behaviour {{was marked by}} an initially steady rate of drainage in which an air slug descended the tube, followed by slower drainage from an annular film remaining on the wall. Eventually the <b>liquid</b> <b>stopped</b> draining as a filament and entered a dripping regime.

Quantitative models are presented for the rate and extent of the initial drainage stage, the rate in a second linear stage (where it existed), {{and the rate of}} drainage in the third, falling rate stage. The fourth and final stage, characterised by drop formation, was not modelled.

40|$|A novel {{microfluidic}} component for discrete drop mixing in microchannels is presented.

The resulting drop mixing occurs in three different regimes (diffusion-dominated, dispersion-dominated, and convection-dominated), depending on the Péclet number (Pe) and the drop dimensions. The time required to achieve sufficient mixing is controllable by changing the drop velocity, an operational parameter in the Péclet number.
