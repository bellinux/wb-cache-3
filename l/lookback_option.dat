40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} early {{exercise}} policies and pricing behaviors of one-asset American <b>options</b> with <b>lookback</b> payoff structures. The classes of option models considered include floating strike <b>lookback</b> <b>options,</b> Russian <b>options,</b> fixed strike <b>lookback</b> <b>options</b> and pricing model of dynamic protection fund. For each {{class of the}} American <b>lookback</b> <b>options,</b> we analyze the optimal stopping region, in particular the asymptotic behavior at times close to expiration and at infinite time to expiration. The inter-relations between the price functions of these American <b>lookback</b> <b>options</b> are explored. The mathematical technique of analyzing the exercise boundary curves of <b>lookback</b> <b>options</b> at infinitesimally small asset value is also applied to the American two-asset minimum put option model.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to find bounds on the prices of exotic derivatives, and in {{particular}} the <b>lookback</b> <b>option,</b> in terms of the (market) prices of call options. This is achieved without making explicit assumptions about the dynamics of the price process of the underlying asset, but rather by inferring information about the potential distribution of asset prices from the call prices. Thus the bounds we obtain and the associated hedging strategies are model independent. The appeal and significance of the hedging strategies arises from their universality and robustness to model mis-specification. <b>Lookback</b> <b>option,</b> super-replication, martingale, barycentre...|$|E
40|$|We {{continue}} {{research of}} the new type of options called ‘British ’ that was introduced in [11] and [12] by presenting the British <b>lookback</b> <b>option</b> with fixed strike. This paper generalises the work about the British Russian op-tion [4] and provides financial analysis of lookback options with fixed non-zero strike. The British holder enjoys the early exercise feature of American op-tions whereupon his payoff (deliverable immediately) is the ‘best prediction’ of the European lookback payoff under {{the hypothesis that the}} true drift of the stock price equals a contract drift. We derive a closed form expression for the arbitrage-free price in terms of the optimal stopping boundary of two-dimensional optimal stopping problem with a scaling strike and show that the rational exercise boundary of the option can be characterised via the unique solution to a nonlinear integral equation. We also show the remarkable nu-merical example where the rational exercise boundary exhibits a discontinu-ity. Using these results we perform a financial analysis of the British <b>lookback</b> <b>option</b> with fixed strike which shows that with the contract drift properly se-lected this instrument provides not only an effective protection mechanism, but becomes a very attractive alternative to the classic European/American <b>lookback</b> <b>option</b> from speculator’s point of view and gives high returns when stock movements are favourable. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{fast and}} accurate algorithms for computing {{the prices of}} discretely sampled lookback options. Under the Black-Scholes framework, the pricing of a discrete <b>lookback</b> <b>option</b> {{can be reduced to}} a series of convolutions of a function with the Gaussian distribution. Using this fact, an efficient algorithm, which computes these convolutions by a combination of the double-exponential integration formula and the fast Gauss transform, has been proposed recently. We extend this algorithm to lookback options under Merton’s jump-diffusion model and American lookback options. Numerical experiments show that our method is much faster and more accurate than conventional methods for lookback options under Merton’s model. For American lookback options, our method outperforms conventional methods when required accuracy is relatively high.

However, unlike their continuous counterparts, discrete barrier and <b>lookback</b> <b>options</b> essentially have no analytical solution. For a broad class of models, including the classical Brownian model and jump-diffusion models, {{we show that}} the Laplace transforms of discrete barrier and <b>lookback</b> <b>options</b> can be obtained via a recursion involving only analytical formulae of stand-ard European call and put options, thanks to Spitzer’s formula. The Laplace transforms can be numerically inverted to get option prices fast and accurately. Furthermore, the same method {{can be used to}} compute the hedging parameters (the greeks) of these products. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{high value}} of the {{implicit}} option to choose a retirement date at which interest rates are particularly high and life annuities relatively cheap, leads to the possibility to introduce regret aversion in the retirement investment decision of defined contribution plan participants. As a remedy for regret aversion in retirement investment decisions, this paper develops and prices a <b>lookback</b> <b>option</b> on a life annuity contract. We determine a closed-form option value under the restriction that the option holder invests risklessly during the time to maturity of the option and without the guarantee that the exact amount of retirement wealth is converted into a life annuity at retirement. Thereafter the investment restriction is relaxed and the guarantee of exact conversion is imposed and the option is priced via Monte Carlo simulations in an economic environment with a stochastic discount factor. Option price sensitivities are determined via the pricing of alternative options. We find {{that the price of}} a <b>lookback</b> <b>option,</b> with a maturity of three years, amounts to 8 %- 9 % of the wealth at the option issuance date. The option price is highly sensitive to the exercise price of the option, i. e. Â pricing alternative options (e. g. Â Asian) substantially lowers the price. Time to maturity and interest rate volatility are other important option price drivers. Asset allocation decisions and initial interest rates hardly affect the option price. ...|$|E
