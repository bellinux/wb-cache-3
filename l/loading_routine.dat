40|$|In {{support of}} the National Transportation Safety Board {{investigation}} of the TWA Flight 800 accident, a combined experimental/computational effort was conducted that focused on quarter-scale testing and simulation of the fuel-air explosion in the Boeing 747 center wing fuel tank. This report summarizes the modeling approach used at Sandia National Laboratories. In this approach approximations are introduced that capture the essential physics associated with turbulent flame propagation in multiple compartment fuel tanks. This model efficiently defines the pressure loading conditions during a jet-fuel air explosion in a fuel tank confinement. Modeling calculations compare favorably {{with a variety of}} experimental quarter-scale tests conducted in rigid confinement. The modeling describes well the overpressure history in several geometry configurations. Upon demonstrating a reasonable comparison to experimental observations, a parametric study of eight possible ignition sources is then discussed. Model calculations demonstrate that different loading conditions arise as the location of the ignition event is varied. By comparing the inferred damage and calculated impulses to that seen in the recovered tank, {{it may be possible to}} reduce the number of likely sources. A possible extension of this work to better define tank damage includes coupling the combustion model as a pressure <b>loading</b> <b>routine</b> for structural failure analysis...|$|E

This is used, for example, to provide a visual cue that the computer is busy with a task. After their introduction, many animated pointers became available for download from third party suppliers. Unfortunately, animated pointers are not without their problems. In addition to imposing a small additional load on the CPU, the animated pointer routines did introduce a security vulnerability.

50|$|Creative Micro Designs (CMD) was the longest-running {{third-party}} hardware vendor for the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128, {{hailed by}} some enthusiasts as being better at supporting the Commodore 64 than Commodore themselves.

It {{was not the}} first KERNAL-based enhancement for the C64 (SpeedDOS and DolphinDOS also existed), but was perhaps the best implemented. The benefits of a KERNAL upgrade meant that the cartridge port was free for use (which would have normally been taken up by an Epyx FastLoad cartridge or an Action Replay), however the downside meant that one had to manually remove computer chips from the C64's motherboard and associated floppy drives to install it.

40|$|Vehicle {{emission}} control systems {{have been found to}} degrade with use resulting in increasing emission rates with vehicle age. Standard European data for deterioration factors have only been based on a sample of vehicles with limited high mileage ranges, with only few Euro 3 and Euro 4 vehicles, and on laboratory tests only. Here we present deterioration rates derived from more than 110, 000 records collected over the past thirteen years from on-road emission remote sensing in Zurich/Switzerland. Deterioration rates for hot NOx and CO emissions of older gasoline vehicles are much lower than assumed so far, but significantly higher for Euro 3 and Euro 4 cars. There is no evidence of high emitters but equipment gradually degrades across the fleet. Deterioration rates do not seem to depend on engine <b>load.</b> <b>Routine</b> idle emission tests have not resulted in measurable emission reductions of the inspected vehicles.

40|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{are known}} to promote the transmission of HIV. Diagnosing these infections can identify patients engaging in high-risk behaviors and {{provides an opportunity for}} intervention and education. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends STI screening as part of routine HIV care. Ninety HIV-infected inpatients admitted to the University of Maryland Hospital were screened for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. None of the nucleic acid amplification probes were positive for gonorrhea, and 1 was positive for chlamydia. A total of 8 rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests were positive, 2 of which are believed to be associated with new infection or treatment failure.

40|$|An {{advanced}} seismic {{compression technique}} is proposed to manage seismic {{data in a}} world of ever increasing data volumes in order to maintain productivity without compromising interpretation results. A separable 3 -D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using long biorthogonal filters is used. The computation efficiency of the DWT is improved by factoring the wavelet filters using the lifting scheme. In addition, the lifting scheme offers: 1) a dramatic reduction of the required auxiliary memory, 2) an efficient combination with parallel rendering algorithms to perform arbitrary surface and volume rendering for interactive visualization, and 3) an easy integration in the parallel I/O seismic data <b>loading</b> <b>routines.</b> The proposed technique is tested on a seismic volume from the Stratton field in South Texas. The resulting 3 -level multiresolution decomposition yields 21 detail sub-volumes and a unique low-resolution sub-volume. The detail wavelet coefficients are quantized with an adaptive threshold uniform scalar quantizer (TUSQ). The scale-dependent thresholds are determined with the Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE) principle.

WBANs applications consist of heterogeneous and dynamic traffic <b>loads.</b> <b>Routine</b> patient’s observation is described as low-load traffic while an alarming situation that is unpredictable by nature is referred to as high-load traffic. This paper offers a thematic review of traffic adaptive Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols in WBANs. First, we have categorized them based on their goals, methods, and metrics of evaluation. The Zigbee standard IEEE 802. 15. 4 and the baseline MAC IEEE 802. 15. 6 are also reviewed in terms of traffic adaptive approaches. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the protocols is made and their performances are analyzed in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and energy consumption. The literature shows that no review work has been done on traffic adaptive MAC protocols in WBANs. This review work, therefore, could add enhancement to traffic adaptive MAC protocols and will stimulate a better way of solving the traffic adaptivity problem...|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} C64's release, some astute programmers {{realized}} that Commodore's bit-banging serial KERNAL routines were unnecessarily sluggish. Since the CPU in the C64 ran at {{approximately the same}} speed as that in the 1541 disk drive, it was sufficient to synchronize only {{at the beginning of}} each byte, rather than at each individual bit. Moreover, this transfer method allowed two bits to be sent simultaneously, one over the standard DATA line and one over the CLK line (which was normally used to perform the handshaking). On the C64, this required very careful timing to avoid interference from interrupts and from the VIC-II graphics chip, which could [...] "steal" [...] CPU cycles. Some fast loaders disabled interrupts and blanked the screen for this reason. A fast loader would generally [...] "wedge" [...] itself into the LOAD vector at $0330, thus intercepting any calls to the KERNAL <b>LOAD</b> <b>routine.</b> Next, the fast loader would transfer the necessary code into the drive RAM and order its execution, then receive the file sent by the altered transfer code. Depending on the exact nature of the <b>routines</b> used, the <b>loading</b> speed could be improved by as much as a factor of five.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} prevalence of intestinal parasites from different groups of mammals housed in a zoological garden in Malaysia.

It was discovered that 89. 3 of feline, 54. 5 of primates and 45. 7 of hoofed mammals were infected with intestinal parasites. Intestinal parasites found in primates were Balantidium coli (19. 2), Cryptosporidium spp. (14. 1), hookworm (10. 1), Trichuris spp. (5. 1), Ascaris (4. 0) and Blastocystis spp. (2. 0). For hoofed mammals, hookworm had the highest prevalence (34. 3) followed by Trichuris spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. (5. 7).
