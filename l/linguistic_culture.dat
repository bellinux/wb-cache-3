40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the concept of hate/hatred in English, Russian and French. It is not usual to {{consider}} this concept separately from the concept of love, with which it is so closely interconnected that they are as a rule investigated as binary concepts. The concept of hate/hatred is universal {{and one of the most}} ancient and important concepts in human culture. As it corresponds to one of the basic human emotions, it has been object of attention of many scholars, thinkers and writers since time immemorial. The concept of hate/hatred may be considered as one of the commonest and most claimed in English, Russian and French <b>linguistic</b> <b>cultures.</b> Usually it is believed to belong to the field of negative emotions though exceptions are rather frequent. Lexical means of verbalizing this concept appear to be the richest in English, somewhat less rich in French, and the least rich in Russian, though all of these tongues possess a well-provided stock of words and word combinations to word the concept under investigation...|$|R
40|$|Sexual desire, and the {{possible}} dangers associated with its more extreme manifestations, provokes strong, albeit often contradictory reactions. Such reactions are a well-known stimulant of creative, juridical and scholarly activity, and the texts of law, literature and academic criticism respond to it in ways that suggest both of revulsion and fascination. But {{how are we to}} understand such responses, and what can they tell us about the relationship between law and its‘others’? Exploring these questions in the context of HIV transmission, on-street sexual exploitation and erotic asphyxiation, this book draws on psychoanalytic theory {{in order to understand the}} motivations behind legal, literary and cultural constructions of sexual offences, their perpetrators and victims. Its analysis of these constructions in a diverse range of sources - including appeal judgments in England & Wales and North America, criminal trials and their reporting, visual and <b>linguistic</b> <b>cultures</b> and both modern and ‘classical’ literature – will be of great interest to legal theorists and socio-legal scholars, as well as those with relevant concerns in the fields of literature and cultural studies...|$|R

[...] This provided the shared <b>linguistic</b> <b>culture</b> of Christendom, expressed in homilies expounding the Song of Songs as allegory where the image of King Solomon's nuptial song to his bride was reinterpreted as the love and union between Christ and the Church, the mystical marriage with the Church as the Bride of Christ. The verse [...] "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee" [...] (4.7) from the Song was also regarded as a scriptural confirmation of the developing and still controversial doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception - being born without Original Sin ("macula" [...] is Latin for spot).|$|E
