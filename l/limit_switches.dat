50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot air furnace that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or <b>limit</b> <b>switch)</b> opens the stoker circuit when {{the air in the}} furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that the}} room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan <b>switch</b> and the <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It must be {{held that}} Minneapolis-Honeywell has been so using its patent as to tend to create a {{monopoly}} in an unpatented device. Minneapolis-Honeywell has been licensing others and has offered to license Mercoid to manufacture, use and sell a single device which embodies within itself two elements of the Freeman patent, namely, the two thermostats which are placed in the furnace hood, one being the fan switch and the other being the <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> This device, embodying these two elements, is [...] [...] [...] an unpatented device. The Freeman patent is not a patent on either the fan <b>switch</b> or the <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> or both of them. It is a patent on a system of furnace control, which requires three thermostats for its operation. It happens that two of those thermostats are a fan <b>switch</b> and a <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> The court is {{of the opinion that}} it follows, from what has been said, that both complaints, that of Mercoid and that of Minneapolis-Honeywell, must be dismissed for want of equity.|$|R
50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a float switch), the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (a <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> or microswitch), or presence of a magnetic field (the reed switch). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|R

25|$|In May 2009, four {{children}} became ill when the attraction failed {{to stop at}} the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency stop switch due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> were to fail.|$|R
