50|$|Some RF {{models have}} black knobs {{and some have}} black {{rangefinder}} protrusion next to the lens, but the majority have plated metal knobs. There was no civil production between 1942 and 1945. The post-war viewfinder and the rangefinder models were also black with bright-chromed metal features, and an accessory shoe {{was added to the}} viewfinder model next to the rewind knob. However, for a while during the period from 1947 to 1949, the knobs were also made of white plastic instead of metal.

50|$|The basic C3 model {{underwent}} {{only minor}} revisions from its introduction {{until it was}} discontinued in 1966.

There was a variant featuring color-coded exposure controls known as the Colormatic. A second-generation C3 with an improved lens and more comfortable controls, the Standard C3, came out in 1958, though it was otherwise nearly identical to its predecessor.|$|R

40|$|The present {{experimental}} analogue {{study used}} computerised attention training {{to investigate the}} role of attention bias in the prediction of intrusive memories. After exposure to a trauma film, participants in a training group (n = 22) were presented with {{a variant of the}} exogenic cueing task (ECT) in which visual <b>film</b> <b>reminders</b> (i. e., stills from the trauma film) were always presented during invalid and neutral control stimuli always during valid trials. The purpose of this cue-ocation contingency was reinforcing the direction of attention away from <b>film</b> <b>reminders.</b> Control participants (n = 23) performed a similar training without such a contingency. Post-training processing bias was assessed with a single target Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task, in which trauma-film reminders served as task-irrelevant distracters appearing shortly before a neutral target. The frequency of film-related intrusions was recorded in a take-home diary and at a follow-up session three days after film viewing. Participants who underwent attention training reported fewer film-related intrusions and showed less interference by visual film distracters than controls. Implications for research on attention bias after real-life trauma are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Chlorhexidine {{gluconate}} (CHX) has a bactericidal {{effect to}} Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) which causes periodontal disease. Therefore the controlled loading and release of CHX from multilayer thin film is beneficial {{for the local}} treatment of periodontitis. This study used ten bilayers of PDADMAC/PSSMA and PDADMAC/AL and loaded CHX into each film. Both un-loaded and <b>loaded</b> thin <b>films</b> were analysed using UV-Vis spectroscopy and AFM. The <b>loaded</b> <b>film</b> was thicker and rougher than the un-loaded film for both PDADMAC/PSSMA and PDADMAC/AL <b>film.</b> The <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> were released in H 2 O 2 for 24 h, and UV-Vis spectroscopy was measured and compared with the standard calibration curve of CHX. Results indicated that PDADMAC/PSSMA released 0. 00052 M and PDADMAC/AL released 0. 00071 M respectively. Both the <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> were tested for toxicity to Aa.

40|$|Tetracycline, an {{antibiotic}} used against {{a broad range}} of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria was encapsulated in microspheres made of poly(3 -hydroxybutyric acid) P(3 HB), a microbial biodegradable polymer isolated from Bacillus cereus SPV. The drug loaded microspheres were prepared using an oil emulsion technique and compressed uniaxially to produce films. Although the same fabrication conditions were used for preparing the drug loaded and unloaded microspheres, the presence of the drug changed the surface morphology and roughness of the films. The surface morphology of the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> appeared uneven and coarser and the roughness, with an average root mean square value of 5. 89 ?µm, was significantly higher than that of the unloaded film. The in vitro biocompatibility of the films was investigated using a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by comparing cell viability on the films to that on conventional tissue culture plastics. Both films appear to support cell growth but cell attachment and percentage cell viability were greater on the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> (32 % of control) compared to the unloaded film (10 % of control), possibly {{as a result of the}} non-uniform surface morphology and increased roughness of the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>film.</b> Thus, the above results illustrate that the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films,</b> in addition to being a suitable matrix for drug delivery, represent an improved substrate for keratinocyte cell attachment...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{polymers}} {{are used}} as compounds for the designing of drugs {{in the treatment of}} different ailments. Chitosan and silver nanoparticle have proven wound healing properties individually. As both have wound healing property, the combination of these two may show improvement in wound healing activity. Thus, the composite were evaluated for various in vitro evaluation tests to ascertain the applicability of prepared combination for wound healing activity. These films were evaluated for water absorption capacity, antibacterial activity, tensile strength and in vivo wound healing studies by excision wound model using albino rats. The drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> have shown significant difference in water absorption capacity and antibacterial activity when compared to optimized blank composite film. There {{was no significant difference in}} tensile strength of drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> when compared to blank composite films. Percentage of wound contraction was better for wounds treated with gentamycin <b>loaded</b> composite <b>film</b> than blank composite film.

40|$|This {{study used}} an {{analogue}} design {{to test the}} hypothesis that preferential processing of visual trauma reminders {{in the aftermath of a}} stressful or traumatic event gives rise to subsequent intrusive memories. Shortly after the presentation of a stressful film fragment, participants (n= 36) were asked to detect neutral targets (rotated buildings or nature scenes) in a single target rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. During half of the streams, the target was preceded by a distracter. The distracters consisted of visual images extracted from an earlier presented stressful film (e. g., persons and objects that figured in the film). The degree of interference by these <b>film</b> <b>reminders</b> predicted subsequent intrusions recorded in a one-week diary. The results provide evidence that a deficient ability to obtain attentional control over perceptual otraumao reminders during goal-directed behaviour may set people at risk for persistent intrusive memories.
