Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some <b>large</b> <b>cities</b> of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E
