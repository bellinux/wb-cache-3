40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} total debts, short-term <b>debts</b> and <b>long-term</b> <b>debts</b> on the output, gross investments and technology-upgrading strategies of the firms in certain oligopolistic industries in India. We first develop a simple theoretical model to motivate the analysis. The empirical analysis shows that debt as a whole may {{have a negative impact}} on the choice of output and investment levels of the firms. However, the short-term debts make firms behave in a conservative fashion while the <b>long-term</b> <b>debts</b> make firms behave more aggressively in this respect. Debt, irrespective of its structure, forces the firms to upgrade their technology. Total debt has a negative impact on profitability, however, firms with higher <b>long-term</b> <b>debts</b> have higher profitability...|$|R

The results demonstrate that the mean proportion of bank debt is higher than that of non-bank debt, but lower than that of public debt. The results also suggest negative relationship between bank debts with firm characteristics such as total assets, market to book value, and age of the firms. There is no significant relationship between characteristics of the firms, and the <b>long-term</b> non-bank <b>debts</b> and public debts...|$|R

Nearly 84 percent of its merchandise that year was imported, primarily from China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand. Tonic Electronics (32 percent), Daewoo (22 percent), and Imarflex (12 percent) were its main suppliers. The company depended heavily on Wal-Mart Stores, which took about 52 percent of its goods in fiscal 1999, and Target Stores, Inc., which took about 24 percent.|$|E

Shares of stock fell as low as $2, compared to the high of $12.75 in 1987. Several shareholder lawsuits charged some Emerson directors and officials with breach of fiduciary duty and self-dealing. Emerson also fell into technical default on its <b>long-term</b> <b>debt</b> of $55.4 million {{at the end of}} the year. In 1988, Emerson Radio was sold to Panasonic.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{operating}} SkyTrain in 2008, {{with an estimated}} 73.5 million boardings, was $83 million. To cover this, TransLink draws mostly from transit fares, advertising ($360 million in 2008) and tax ($262 million from fuel taxes and $298 million from property taxes in 2008), funds which are also shared with bus services, roads and bridge maintenance, and other infrastructure and services. The capital costs of building the system are shared with other government agencies. Capital expenses were $216 million in 2008. For example, {{the cost of building}} the Canada Line was shared between TransLink ($335 million or 22 percent), the federal government (29 percent), the provincial government (28 percent), the airport authority (19 percent), and the City of Vancouver (2 percent). While TransLink has run surpluses for operating costs since 2001, it incurs debt to cover these capital costs. As a whole, TransLink had $1.1 billion in <b>long-term</b> <b>debt,</b> in 2006, of which $508 million was transferred from the province in 1999 when responsibility for SkyTrain was given to TransLink. The province retained ownership of the causeway, bridge, certain services, and a portion of SkyTrain's debt.|$|E
25|$|A self-inflicted {{wound was}} the VOC's {{dividend}} policy. The dividends {{distributed by the}} company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade but one (1710–1720) from 1690 to 1760. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia {{to build up the}} trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of <b>long-term</b> <b>debt.</b> The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the bewindhebbers only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the liquid capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, Governor Rick Snyder {{declared}} a financial emergency in the city, {{stating that the}} city has a $327 million budget deficit and faces more than $14 billion in <b>long-term</b> <b>debt.</b> It has been making ends meet on a month-to-month basis {{with the help of}} bond money held in a state escrow account and has instituted mandatory unpaid days off for many city workers. Those troubles, along with underfunded city services, such as police and fire departments, and ineffective turnaround plans from Bing and the City Council led the state of Michigan to appoint an emergency manager for Detroit on March 14, 2013. On June 14, 2013 Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion of debt by withholding $39.7 million in interest payments, while Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr met with bondholders and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the city's $18.5 billion debt and avoid bankruptcy. On July 18, 2013, the City of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. It was declared bankrupt by U.S. judge Stephen Rhodes on December 3, with its $18.5 billion debt he said in accepting the city's contention that it is broke and that negotiations with its thousands of creditors were infeasible. The city levies an income tax of 2.4 percent on residents and 1.2 percent on nonresidents.|$|E
