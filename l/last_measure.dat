5|$|Soon after {{assuming}} the throne, Edward set about restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father. To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The {{most important of}} these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as chancellor, a man who would remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King's closest associates. Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs. This <b>last</b> <b>measure</b> was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.|$|E

There, however, they are enslaved by their own Atlantean ancestors, led by a powerful sorceress named Gamemnae, and Aquaman himself is transformed into living water and imprisoned in an ornamental pool. Over time, this civilization had collapsed until only Gamemnae herself, now immensely powerful, inhabited the ruins.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{his call}} for an election, Charest {{revealed}} his platform which included income tax cuts of about $250 million. In {{the last week of}} the campaign, Charest promised an additional $700 million in tax cuts—some of it coming for the additional equalization money from the 2007 federal budget; reduction of hospital wait times; improvement and increase of French courses at school; an increase of the number of daycare spaces; and an increase in tuition fees for university students ($50 per semester until 2012). The <b>last</b> <b>measure</b> was met with criticism from students' associations, and a more-radical student association, the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (formerly known as the CASSEE) had also considered a strike.|$|E
25|$|The Sicilian Expedition was an Athenian {{military}} {{expedition to}} Sicily, {{which took place}} during the period from 415 BC to 413 BC (during the Peloponnesian War). The expedition was hampered from the outset by uncertainty in its purpose and command structure—political maneuvering in Athens swelled a lightweight force of twenty ships into a massive armada, and the expedition's primary proponent, Alcibiades, was recalled from command to stand trial before the fleet even reached Sicily—but still achieved early successes. Syracuse, the most powerful state on Sicily, responded exceptionally slowly to the Athenian threat and, as a result, was almost completely invested before the arrival of a Spartan general, Gylippus, galvanized its inhabitants into action. From that point forward, however, as the Athenians ceded the initiative to their newly energized opponents, the tide of the conflict shifted. A massive reinforcing armada from Athens briefly gave the Athenians the upper hand once more, but a disastrous failed assault on a strategic high point and several crippling naval defeats damaged the besiegers' fighting capacity and morale, and the Athenians were eventually forced to attempt a desperate overland escape from the city they had hoped to conquer. That <b>last</b> <b>measure,</b> too, failed, and nearly the entire expedition surrendered or was destroyed in the Sicilian interior.|$|E
25|$|After the breakstrain, {{the trio}} is heard again, either {{for one last}} time or and the 2nd (or third) time. If the trio after the breakstrain is the last, it is usually played in the same style as the first trio. Sometimes this trio has added counter-melodies or obbligatos. After this trio, the breakstrain is played again, then moves on to the final trio. The final trio {{is known as the}} grandioso. It is {{typically}} much louder than the previous playing(s) of the trio and utilizes all sections of the band, bringing everything to a close. The grandioso is considered the most exciting section of the march and serves the purpose of instilling the trio melody into the mind of the listener. The grandioso sometimes adds yet another counter-melody or obbligato, such as the one in Stars and Stripes Forever. The <b>last</b> <b>measure</b> of the march sometimes contains a stinger, a I chord played in unison on the upbeat after a quarter rest. Most, but not all, marches carry a stinger; the Semper Fidelis march is a famous march not to have an ending stinger (when not recapitulated {{back to the beginning of}} the march – see below). Most marches end at the volume forte (loud), but an example that doesn't is Sousa's Manhattan Beach, which ends fading away.|$|E

2500|$|Although the CPE is {{the primary}} target of the student {{movement}} against the law, other measures of the [...] "Statute on the Equality of Opportunities" [...] have also been contested. Among them, allowing apprenticeships from as young as 14 years old (allowing a youth to leave the standard public education system), night work {{from the age of}} 15 (instead of 16 now) and suspension of certain type of welfare measures (families with more than three children have the right to some governmental financial support in France) when students skip school. This <b>last</b> <b>measure</b> has been {{for a long time in}} the program of the far-right movement Front National, thus also explaining part of the popular protests. The most controversial part of this new law lies in the way it brings flexibility to employers: this contract allows French employers to fire workers under the age of 26 without juridical motive during the first two years of the contract, among other things.|$|E
2500|$|The 1989 {{motion picture}} Glory portrayed {{an act of}} the Confederate States Congress to execute black troops as well as white {{officers}} captured in command of them. [...] This was loosely based on General Order 111 by Jefferson Davis calling {{for the return of}} any African Americans caught bearing arms be delivered to respective state governments where they were to be treated as [...] "armed slaves in insurrection against the authorities of the different States of this Confederacy" [...] instead of being treated as prisoners of war. The same statement also called for similar penalties for white officers in command of black troops as well as execution of white officers serving under the command of Benjamin Butler [...] "as robbers and criminals deserving death." [...] The <b>last</b> <b>measure</b> was due in part to Butler's General Order No. 28. The Confederate States Congress fully endorsed Jefferson Davis' order in 1863, declaring [...] "That every white person, being a commissioned officer, or acting as such, who, during the present war, shall command negroes or mulattoes in arms against the Confederate States, or who shall arm, train, or organize, or prepare negroes or mulattoes for military service against the Confederate States, or who shall voluntarily aid negroes or mulattoes in any military enterprise, attack, or conflict in such service, shall be deemed as inciting servile insurrection, and shall, if captured, be put to death, or be otherwise punished at the discretion of the court." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{consequence}} of this <b>last</b> <b>measure</b> mainly, diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Portugal were broken off. The Sacred Congregation de Propaganda Fide deemed the moment opportune to extend {{the jurisdiction of the}} Vicar Apostolic of Madras to Saint Thomas of Mylapur and its missions southwards to the River Palar (those south of the Palar being assigned to the Vicar Apostolic of Pondicherry), to declare Burma to be an independent vicariate and to create {{in the northern part of}} the diocese (Bengal and the adjoining countries) an independent vicariate Apostolic under Dr. St. Leger, with a staff of British priests. From a certain point of view this action was unfortunate, as it caused the loyalist Portuguese to regard these measures as retaliatory and not as prompted by a desire for the spiritual welfare of the regions concerned. And, indeed there was nothing up to this to show that Portugal had shirked her responsibilities in regard to the diocese, or that the successive ordinaries of the diocese had been found wanting, beyond the mere accusation of those missionaries Apostolic who were sent into their territories and, failing to recognize their authority, had received scant courtesy. Howbeit, when called upon by the Vicar Apostolic of Madras to surrender his churches and submit to him, the administrator replied that he would gladly do so when instructed by the authority that placed him there. The vicar Apostolic then called upon the priests and the subjects of the Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur to submit to him, but they all replied in much the same terms. The same thing happened in the parts of the diocese between the Rivers Palar and Cauvery, and in Bengal; whereupon the vicar Apostolic declared the administrator, priests and people of the Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur schismatics, and from the fact that a large number of the priests in the diocese were from Goa, defined their action as the [...] "Goan schism". However the Holy See seems not to have taken much notice of the [...] "schism" [...] and diplomatic relations were resumed with Portugal in 1841. Then followed a series of acts unworthy of the Church, when both sides strove to (re)capture churches that they claimed, church was built against church, altar raised against altar, and violence and police-courts were a common resort.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: serum elastin {{peptides}} (SEP) {{have been}} reported {{to be associated with the}} expansion of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Consequently, SEP-measurements may predict future rupture, and allow further selection for surgery in cases referred for surgery due to size. Material and methods: SEP was measured in 90 men and 10 women with AAA, who were considered for surgery as part of the Chichester aneurysm screening programme. Sixty-one patients were electively operated and four because of symptoms. The rest were followed up further. Twelve of these experienced ruptured AAA later. Results: no correlation between <b>last</b> <b>measured</b> AAA-diameter, annual expansion rate and SEP was noticed. However, SEP levels were significantly higher in cases rupturing later, persisting after adjustment for age, sex, and <b>last</b> <b>measured</b> AAA-size. ROC curve analysis concerning SEP as a predictor of rupture later showed an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 67 % and 60 %, respectively, similar with <b>last</b> <b>measured</b> AAA-size. By combining AAA-size and SEP, the optimal sensitivity and specificity reached 83 % and 66 %, respectively. Conclusion: one sampling of SEP combined with AAA-size in patients referred for AAA surgery may be a clinical useful indicator of high rupture risk...|$|R
