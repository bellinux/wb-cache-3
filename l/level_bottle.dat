40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} effects of cross-border policy dynamics, specifically state <b>level</b> <b>bottle</b> deposit-redemption systems and international corporate income taxation. As governments can only enact policies within their own jurisdictions, borders often become areas with policy discontinuities. Mobility of economic factors allows firms and consumers to take advantage/arbitrage across such divides. The presence of borders therefore carries important positive and normative policy implications. Chapter 1 analyzes the effect of Michigan's deposit-redemption system on Michigan as well as Indiana and Ohio, two bordering states with no such policy. In conjunction with a sales tax differential between the three states, households are theoretically able to fraudulently redeem out-of-state bottles and evade use taxes via cross-border shopping. I hypothesize that evidence of this behavior should {{be reflected in the}} patterns of retail prices for deposit eligible goods near these borders. Results from a simulated model of imperfect competition and mobile households suggest that the main determinant of prices is travel costs. I then empirically analyze an original dataset and find that retail prices are increasing and decreasing with distance from the border in Indiana/Ohio and Michigan, respectively. At the border, prices are generally higher on the Michigan side. Chapters 2 and 3 analyze the strategic interactions between corporate income taxes of countries that compete to attract mobile firms and capital. Specifically, I analyze the equilibrium revenue implications when competing countries offer preferential tax rates for targeted tax bases. Chapter 2 uses numerical methods to generalize existing theoretical literature in analyzing a less restrictive model of international tax competition. In the context of bilateral tax agreements, I find that countries with greater productivity and population asymmetry generate greater equilibrium revenues by allowing for preferential policies. Conversely, more symmetric countries would do better by banning such policies. Chapter 3 focuses specifically on the equilibrium revenue effect of cross-country profit correlation, i. e., the degree to which firms generate the same profits across different countries. As profit correlation decreases, preferential regimes become more revenue-dominant...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFluoride {{is needed}} for better health, yet if {{ingested}} at higher levels it may lead to health problems. Fluoride {{can be obtained from}} different sources, with drinking water being a major contributor. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), bottled water is the major source for drinking. The aim of this research is to measure fluoride <b>levels</b> in different <b>bottled</b> water brands sold in UAE, to determine whether fluoride contributes to better health or health problems. The results were compared to international and local standards. Fluoride was present in seven out of 23 brands. One brand exhibited high fluoride levels, which exceeded all standards, suggesting it may pose health problems. Other brands were either below or above standards, suggesting either contribution to better health or health problems, depending on ingested amount. A risk assessment suggested a potential for non-cancer effects from some brands. The results were compared to fluoride <b>levels</b> in <b>bottled</b> water sold in UAE and neighboring countries (e. g. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain), over 24 years, to reflect on changes in fluoride <b>levels</b> in <b>bottled</b> water in this region. The research presents the need for creating, stricter regulations that require careful fluoride monitoring and new regulations that require listing fluoride <b>level</b> on the <b>bottled</b> water label, internationally and regionally. The research will have local and global health impact, as bottled water sold in UAE and neighboring countries, is produced locally and imported from international countries, e. g. Switzerland, the USA, France, Italy, New Zealand, and Fiji...|$|R

50|$|Sulfur dioxide has {{two primary}} actions, firstly {{it is an}} anti {{microbial}} agent and secondly an anti oxidant. In the making of white wine it can be added prior to fermentation and immediately after alcoholic fermentation is complete. If added after alcoholic ferment it will {{have the effect of}} preventing or stopping malolactic fermentation, bacterial spoilage and help protect against the damaging effects of oxygen. Additions of up to 100 mg per liter (of sulfur dioxide) can be added, but the available or free sulfur dioxide should be measured by the aspiration method and adjusted to 30 mg per liter. Available sulfur dioxide should be maintained at this <b>level</b> until <b>bottling.</b> For rose wines smaller additions should be made and the available level should be no more than 30 mg per liter.|$|R

In February 2005, we {{conducted}} a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and the risk factors of giardiasis in 531 primary schoolchildren of a rural community, Chacheongsao province, Thailand. Using both sedi-mentation and flotation techniques to detect Giardia duodenalis, the prevalence of giardiasis was 6. 2 %. Assemblage A, subgenotype II and assemblage B, subgenotype IV were identified by PCR-RFLP of glutamate dehydrogenase gene. Our data might indicate that, in this population, only assemblage A, subgenotype II of G. duodenalis was transmitted via water. Using multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for giardiasis were children of age 5 â€“ 9 years, households with 3 {{children under the age}} of 12 years, low parental educational <b>level,</b> drinking <b>bottled</b> water, and living in close contact with dogs.

40|$|Objective: Evaluate {{fluoride}} {{concentration in}} 500 ml commercial brands {{of bottled water}} and {{compare it to the}} amount &# 8203;&# 8203;printed on the label. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted. Samples of nine different commercial brands of 500 ml bottled water were collected at authorized distribution points in the city of Fortaleza, CE, Brazil, in 2013. Fluoride concentration was determined in duplicate using a fluoride ion-selective electrode. The results were obtained from linear regression of the calibration curve. Results: Fluoride concentrations ranged between 0. 07 and 0. 63 ppm F- or mg F/L. There were significant differences between the values &# 8203;&# 8203;&# 8203;&# 8203;printed on the labels and those found in the analysis.
