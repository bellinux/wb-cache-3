The heath is deeply incised {{by all the}} rivers that drain northwards to the Elbe; rivers such as the Seeve, Aue, Luhe (Ilmenau). The ridges between them are wooded and sparsely populated. Settlements are crowded {{together}} in the valleys. There is hardly any heathland <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area, it has been largely reforested by pines.|$|E
25|$|With Mack Brown's squad {{poised to}} clinch {{a spot in}} the Bowl Alliance, UVA trailed North Carolina 17–3 in the fourth quarter and the Tar Heels were driving for the {{knockout}} blow when Antwan Harris picked off a third-down pass and returned it 95yards for a touchdown. Following quarterback Tim Sherman's touchdown scramble on the Hoos' next drive, kicker Rafael Garcia hit the game-winning 32-yard field goal with 0:39 <b>left.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> installment of the South's Oldest Rivalry, Virginia extended North Carolina's winless drought in Scott Stadium to 15 years with the 20–17 upset.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} this building, which {{lies on the}} {{southern}} slope of the seventh hill of Constantinople and overlooks the Sea of Marmara, is not certain. The tradition says that in year 325 Helena, the mother of Constantine I, coming back from Jerusalem with the True Cross and entering the City through the Port tou Psomatheou, <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> place some vases ("Gastria") containing aromatic herbs collected on Calvary. Then she founded there a nunnery. In reality, no monastery was established in Constantinople before {{the last quarter of}} the fourth century, so this has to be considered only a legend.|$|E

Warnscale Beck, one of the feeder streams of Buttermere, runs down beneath Green Crag from its source near Great Round How. There are the remains of extensive quarries on the upper slopes of Warnscale, including Dubs, once served by a tramway from the summit of Honister Pass. Across Warnscale is Fleetwith Pike, a satellite of Grey Knotts.|$|E
25|$|The {{radar beam}} has a width of about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as the scanner rotated, causing a short arc about 10 degrees wide to show on the display. A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the radar scan. Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it no matter where the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when the scanner is pointed five degrees to the <b>left.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring on the display instead of a short arc. Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring on the display will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle on the display.|$|E

500|$|Through the 2012 draft, {{free agents}} were {{evaluated}} by the Elias Sports Bureau and rated [...] "Type A", [...] "Type B", or not compensation-eligible. If a team offered arbitration to a player but that player refused and subsequently signed with another team, the original team was able to receive additional draft picks.

Since the 2013 draft, free agents are no longer classified by type; instead, compensatory picks are only awarded if the team offered its free agent a contract worth at least {{the average of the}} 125 current richest MLB contracts. However, if the free agent's last team acquired the player in a trade during {{the last year of his}} contract, it is ineligible to receive compensatory picks for that player.|$|E
500|$|After {{the arrival}} of the Emperor with {{significant}} reinforcements, the time was right for a general counterattack. The Emperor planned his main attack against the Russian left and he wanted to prevent the enemy from transferring reinforcements from their right wing to their battered left. To that effect, Grouchy received orders to incessantly harass the enemy before him, in order to prevent Bennigsen from redeploying them on the left wing. Orders also required Grouchy to silence the enemy guns pounding the French <b>left.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> difficult task, Grouchy was perfectly seconded by Nansouty, and together they ended to the Russian cannonade in this sector. Later, Grouchy's report expressed admiration for Nansouty's actions, adding that the latter had [...] "gloriously repaired" [...] his earlier error. Nansouty was also mentioned in the 79th Bulletin of the Grande Armée. After the battle, the 1st heavy cavalry division joined in the pursuit of the Russian army to the Nieman river, but the Treaties of Tilsit in July soon ended hostilities.|$|E
500|$|The next bombing raid on Singapore {{took place}} on 24February. On that day, 116 B-29s were {{dispatched}} to bomb the Empire Dock area at Singapore's southern tip. This was a commercial dock, and was considered by XXBomber Command planners to be [...] "the only suitable primary target free of stipulations <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> theatre". The bombers were armed with incendiary bombs, and the 105 B-29s which reached Singapore succeeded in burning out 39 percent of the warehouse area near the dock. As {{a result of the}} target being obscured by smoke, 26 of the B-29s used blind rather than visual bombing, resulting in poor accuracy and damage to civilian residential and commercial areas near the dock area. The Syonan Shimbun newspaper subsequently reported that 396 people had been made homeless by the raid. USAAF losses from the raid were limited to a single B-29 which crashed after running out of fuel on its way back to India.|$|E
