The Beast dies before the <b>last</b> petal <b>falls.</b> <b>When</b> Belle tearfully professes her love to him, the curse is broken, repairing the castle and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.|$|R

All of the governor's men are killed as Ittō first takes out half of them with the baby cart's machine gun, and then takes out the rest with his sword and other weapons from the baby cart.

That's the Secretary of War's doings. Ever tell you what Cameron did, Brinsmade? He and his party were in Louisville <b>last</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>when</b> I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my room in the Galt House. Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine, After lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over. He asked me what I thought about things in Kentucky. I told him. I got a map. I said, 'Now, Mr. Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the Potomac to Kansas. Here's McClellan in the East with one hundred miles of front. Here's Fremont in the West with one hundred miles. Here we are in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend. McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand. You give us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.' 'How many do you want?' says Cameron, still on the bed. 'Two hundred thousand before we get through,' said I. Cameron pitched up {{his hands in the}} air. 'Great God?' says he, 'where are they to come from?' 'The northwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won't accept,' said I. 'Mark my words, Mr. Secretary, you'll need 'em all and more before we get done with this Rebellion.' Well, sir, he was very friendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed out. No, sir! he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I'm crazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky. Then I am ordered to report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia because he believes the lies." ...|$|E

Between October 1993 and January 1994 it experienced a bank run, and was then {{taken over by the}} government; its operations were ultimately acquired by Interbank. Within weeks of the government takeover, arrest warrants had been issued for 82 of its directors and managers. Four months later, only 6 had been apprehended, with the rest believed to have escaped abroad. These included Bank Conglomerates, Gustavo Cisneros, Edwin Acosta-Rubio and Gustavo Gomez Lopez who were the bank top executives. The New York Times reported in 1994 thatLate <b>last</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>when</b> Banco Latino officials began to realize that their house of cards was collapsing, they started transferring hundreds of million of dollars overseas. In the final frenetic days, one bank director foresaw judicial orders on freezing assets and sold his million-dollar mansion, Another officer, Folco Falchi, the bank's coordinator for international investments, was reportedly seen loading suitcases stuffed with dollars into his corporate jet on the Caribbean island of Curacao.After the authorities padlocked Banco Latino on Jan. 14, bank officers, operating from offshore refuges, entered the bank's computer electronically with a modem and erased and altered thousands of records.|$|E

40|$|Europe’s press barons thought they’d {{scored a}} major victory <b>last</b> <b>fall</b> <b>when</b> the European Commission threw its weight behind their idea to create a special {{protection}} for digital journalism, the linchpin of their strategy for long-term survival. But now the plan threatens to come undone. Advocates of the reform say it would force the globe-spanning fat cats of the internet — platforms like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn, which use outside news content to attract eyeballs without paying a single cent — to compensate Europe’s publishers for use of their content. Much as radio stations pay fees to music publishers to play their songs, the companies would compensate news outlets for carrying their content. If the reform goes through, the victory would reverberate around the world, with publishers in other regions likely to demand similar treatment. Less than {{six months after the}} Commission unveiled its proposal, however, the prospects for a so-called publisher’s right are murkier than ever amid growing doubts the plan can win enough support in the European Parliament.

40|$|<b>Last</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>when</b> the 2015 Nebraska Crop Budgets {{were being}} developed, {{the cost of}} fuel for 2015 was {{estimated}} to be $ 3. 25 per gallon. A farm sup-plier reported on March 10, 2015 that the price of fuel delivered to the farm is around $ 2. 40. How much affect does that price change have on cost of production? The 2015 Nebraska Crop Budgets were used to answer that question. The answer is, it depends on the crop and the production system. The 2015 Nebraska Crop Budgets contain 69 dif-ferent crop budgets including 14 corn budgets, 8 soybean budgets, and 7 wheat budgets. The rea-son for different budgets for the same crop is the different production systems. A crop may be pro-duced using conventional tillage, no tillage, or another system such as ridge tillage. In addition, some crops are watered only by rainfall while others are irrigated. Irrigated crops may either use a pivot or gravity system for water distribution. Each system uses a different amount of fuel...|$|E

The ongoing economic expansion has moved into a near-record ninth year, with real output expanding vigorously, the unemployment rate hovering around lows last seen in 1970, and the underlying trends in inflation remaining subdued. Productivity-enhancing investments by businesses, spurred by the availability of new technologies at increasingly attractive prices, have held down the rise in costs and prices and have boosted living standards. Two of the major threats faced by the economy in late 1998 [...] economic downturns in many foreign nations and turmoil in financial markets around the world [...] receded over {{the first half of}} this year. The Federal Open Market Committee was concerned that as economic activity abroad strengthened, the firming of commodity and other prices might foster a less favorable inflation environment.
