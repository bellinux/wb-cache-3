Falle later said of herself and the other women in {{prostitution}} she knew, [...] "I couldn't admit that I was not there by choice. We couldn't <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own skin if we admitted that. We needed {{to believe that it}} was our choice." [...] Falle's pimp told her he would marry her if she made enough money for him through prostitution. When she had made the amount of money her pimp required, she was 17 years old. The two got married that year.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} after the shootout, several people carried out a peace march in Apatzingán expressing their support for the cartel with banners that read [...] "Nazario will always <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts," [...] among others. Others protested against the {{presence}} of the federal forces in the state, and argued that the federal government—not the cartels—were responsible for increasing the violence in the country. Through several banners hung on bridges throughout the state of Michoacán, La Familia Michoacana publicly announced that they were open to the possibility of creating a [...] "truce" [...] (ceasefire) with the Mexican government throughout December 2010 and January 2011 to prove that they were not the source of the violence. The Mexican authorities [...] "summarily rejected" [...] the agreement.|$|E

I {{tried to be}} his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> district and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> world. And that's what the song is about. And it felt like we had to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2012, a song {{entitled}} [...] "Enough Said" [...] {{was released}} online. The song {{was produced by}} Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib and features Canadian rapper Drake. Four days later, Jomo Hankerson confirmed a posthumous album is being produced {{and that it was}} scheduled to be released by the end of 2012 by Blackground Records. The album was reported to include 16 unreleased songs and have contributions from Aaliyah's longtime collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott, among others. On August 13, Timbaland and Missy Elliott dismissed rumors about being contacted or participating for the project. Elliott's manager Mona Scott-Young said in a statement to XXL, [...] "Although Missy and Timbaland always strive to keep the memory of their close friend alive, we have not been contacted about the project nor are there any plans at this time to participate. We've seen the reports surfacing that they have been confirmed to participate {{but that is not the}} case. Both Missy and Timbaland are very sensitive to the loss still being felt by the family so we wanted to clear up any misinformation being circulated." [...] Elliott herself said, [...] "Tim and I carry Aaliyah with us everyday, like so many of the people who love her. She will always <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts. We have nothing but love and respect for her memory and for her loved ones left behind still grieving her loss. They are always in our prayers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mount Laurel was a small, poor rural farming {{community}} {{until it was}} hit with massive suburban growth from Philadelphia in the later 1900s. Poor families, whose history had resided there for centuries, were suddenly priced out of buying additional property. [...] In 1970, at a meeting about a proposal for affordable housing, held at an all black church in Mount Laurel, Mayor Bill Haines summed up the newcomers' perspective by saying: [...] "If you people can't afford to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> town, then you'll just have to leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2006, {{president}} Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan requested the Ministry of Education and Science to examine the experiences of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, which had all switched to Latin letters in the 20th century. The ministry reported {{in the summer of}} 2007 that a six-step plan, based primarily on the Uzbekistan model, should be implemented over a 12-to-15-year period at the cost of about $300 million. Aside from integrating Kazakhstan into the global economy, officials have also argued it would help the development of a Kazakh national identity separate from Russia. On 13 December 2007, Nazarbayev said the transformation of the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin should not be rushed, as he noted: [...] "For 70 years, the Kazakhstanis read and wrote in Cyrillic. More than 100 nationalities <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> state. Thus we need stability and peace. We should be in no hurry in the issue of alphabet transformation".|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of a}} {{modernization}} program, Decree 569 from Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev {{ordered the}} replacement of the Cyrillic script with a Latin script by 2025. In 2007, Nazarbayev had opposed such a change, stating: [...] "For 70 years, the Kazakhstanis read and wrote in Cyrillic. More than 100 nationalities <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> state. Thus we need stability and peace. We should be in no hurry in the issue of alphabet transformation". [...] But in 2015, the Minister of Culture and Sports Arystanbek Mukhamediuly announced that a transition plan was underway, with specialists working on the orthography to accommodate the phonological aspects of the language. On April 12, 2017, President Nazarbayev published an article in state newspaper Egemen Qazaqstan announcing a switchover to the Latin alphabet by 2025, a decision implemented by decree. [...] Nazarbayev argued that [...] "Kazakh language and culture have been devastated" [...] during the period of Soviet rule, and that ending the use of Cyrillic is useful in re-asserting national identity.|$|E

Cross said work on the documentary was difficult: [...] "It was long, and it was tedious. I swear on my grave that I'm not doing another documentary. It took two years to finish."
