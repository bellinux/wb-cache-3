5|$|Vanbiesbrouck {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan to a Belgian {{immigrant}} bricklayer, Robert Vanbiesbrouck, and an Italian immigrant Sara. He grew-up with two brothers; the oldest, Frank, {{who was also a}} goaltender in youth hockey. He inspired Vanbiesbrouck to play goaltender. John later noted that he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> goaltending just from watching Frank than any coaching could, adding that no one ever helped him more to become the player he was.|$|E
5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also {{felt that he was}} defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis felt that there was nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Macartney and {{his family}} moved from Maitland to Sydney. In his school cricketing career Macartney {{distinguished}} himself as an all-rounder at Woollahra Superior and Chatswood public schools, before briefly attending Fort Street High School. Macartney asserted that school cricket was insignificant in his development, believing that he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park, with their dog acting as a fielder. It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain Monty Noble, who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article.|$|E

40|$|This study {{described}} {{the level of}} skills, and interests in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about,</b> selected teaching activities and educational technologies among faculty with teaching appointments in the College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas. As part of a United States Department of Agriculture grant, the study served as a needs assessmentfor designingfaculty development activities. Teaching faculty perceived that they had relatively high levels of skills in traditional classroom teaching areas such as lecture and discussion methods. However, they had high levels of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> these skills. Their self-perceived levels of skills were low in such non-traditional areas as case studies, discovery learning, and peer observation, and they expressed little interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> these topics. There was little relationship between their level of skill and level of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> teaching methods. These faculty rated their levels of skill in educational technologies lower than for the teaching methods. However, they expressedgenerally high levels of interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the technologies. A substantial positive relationship was found between level of skill and interest in <b>learning</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> educational technologies...|$|R
50|$|Alameddine {{appears to}} have written Koolaids as a {{reference}} for readers to <b>learn</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> many taboo topics, especially HIV/AIDS. This novel is a good resource for a unique perspective on HIV/AIDS, and also creates intrigue for the reader to <b>learn</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the topics in the novel.|$|R
5|$|The plot of Carnivàle {{takes place}} in the 1930s Dust Bowl and {{revolves}} around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions. The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but were not part of the show's visible structure. The audience therefore only <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the characters as a natural aspect in the story.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|In 1923–24, Himmler, while {{searching for}} a world view, came to abandon Catholicism {{and focused on the}} occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, {{reinforced}} by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of Führer worship. However, as he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the NSDAP, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest {{in the wake of the}} Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the NSDAP under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.|$|E

5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E
25|$|In 1525 Francisco de Hoces was {{the first}} to {{speculate}} that Tierra del Fuego was one or more islands rather than part of what was then called Terra Australis.

25|$|Hopewell is the {{location}} of several large chemical plants owned by the Honeywell Corporation, Ashland, Evonik Industries, {{as well as a}} paper mill owned by WestRock. Such industries have required the city and residents to deal with many environmental issues over the years, particularly as they <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the effects of the industries. The Kepone debacle of the 1970s received the most national attention.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1903, Hillman {{passed from}} the {{training}} grounds of the Marxist study circle to fully fledged membership in the Bund, a revolutionary socialist union of Jewish workers within the Pale {{in conflict with the}} Tsarist authorities. Hillman became a leading activist in the Bund, leading the first May Day march ever conducted by the organization through the streets of Kovno in 1904. Hillman was arrested shortly thereafter for his revolutionary activities and sat in prison for several months, where he <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> revolutionary social theory from fellow prisoners.|$|E

25|$|By 1991, the Zabok {{police had}} set up a team {{dedicated}} to locating and capturing Pintarić. Over time, they <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> his habits. He was getting increasingly careless, partly due to alcohol abuse. In May 1991 they received an information that Pintarić was visiting his lover Ankica Buhiniček and decided to set up a stakeout on her house near Veliko Trgovišće. On the third night, the policemen saw a man coming from the woods and approaching the house. After they radioed for backup, they were joined by a special forces team from Kumrovec, and the compound was quickly surrounded.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, nearly 70 killer whales {{were taken from}} Pacific waters for exhibition. The Southern Resident {{community}} of the Northeast Pacific lost 48 of its members to captivity. By 1976, only 80 killer whales were left in the community, which remains endangered. With subsequent captures, the theme parks <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> avoiding injury during capture and subsequent care of killer whales, and discovered {{that they could be}} trained to perform tricks, making them a great attraction to visitors. As commercial demand increased, growing numbers of Pacific orcas were captured, peaking in 1970.|$|E

25|$|At about 6:30p.m., when Meade <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the {{location}} of Pickett's and Sheridan's forces, he ordered Warren to send his relief column down the Boydton Plank Road, but Bartlett had been gone too long to be easily recalled. Warren sent three regiments that Bartlett had detached to guard artillery and wagons down the Boydton Plank Road under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson and reported this to Meade. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been broken down by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan. Meade told Warren to have his entire force ready to move. By 9:17p.m., Warren was ordered {{to withdraw from the}} line and send a division to Sheridan at once.|$|E
25|$|William Harry Russell Andrews {{was born}} in Swindon the son of William and Betty Andrews. Betty's maiden name was Russell hence his third name. He had a younger brother Jack Andrews who played 7 matches as a wicket-keeper for Hampshire between 1937 and 1947, and also a sister known as Betty {{who was also a}} cricketer, being captain of a cricket team in Southern Rhodesia. In Swindon his father was a publican but the family moved to Weston-super-Mare in 1921 where Andrews saw the visiting Australians, sold {{scorecards}} and worked the scoreboard. Andrews left school at the age of fourteen and worked as an office boy in a solicitor's office where his fine handwriting was perhaps his greatest asset. There was tragedy for the family in 1925 when his mother died in childbirth. He played his cricket for the Weston club and <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> cricket when Arthur Wellard lodged with the Andrews family, having moved to the county in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and <b>learned</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
