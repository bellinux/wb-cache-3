2500|$|Hill {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "every film I've done has been a Western", and elaborated in another that [...] "the Western is ultimately a stripped down moral universe that is, whatever the dramatic problems are, beyond the normal avenues of social control and social alleviation of the problem, and I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> even within contemporary stories".|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew you'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> so I got {{everything}} ready beforehand," [...] announced his chum. [...] "We'll spend to-day in sightseeing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't buy any carpets or wallpaper, Rosie; I thought you'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> yourself," [...] John {{explained}} {{as she looked}} around the room.|$|E
6000|$|He {{got up to}} go indoors. [...] "Never {{mind about}} them," [...] he said, as his nephew was about to follow with the chair and his tobacco-jar; [...] "Mrs. Church <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> herself, and she’d be {{disappointed}} if anybody else did it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No thank you, sir. Archie <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> {{and never}} fails to call for all I write. He gets a peep at Phebe's in return and I cheer him up a bit, for, though he says nothing, he {{has a hard time}} of it, poor fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} {{the things}} that teach the {{futility}} of strikes," [...] the professor made haste to interpose, as if he had not quite <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> appear averse to the interests of the workman; no one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> [...] "If there were anything at all to be hoped from them, it would be another matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dave, {{you can run}} {{the car to the}} Hall, if you wish," [...] said Mr. Porter, feeling {{sure the}} youth would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> very thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> Mrs. Wetherford," [...] he replied, {{with greater}} respect {{than he had}} ever shown her before. [...] "They may attack me there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Vy, sir," [...] he replied, {{with some}} hesitation, [...] "I don't quite <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> He's such a pure breed, and--and he's so fond o' me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Saved waiting, for one thing," [...] Cliffe {{answered}} in a deprecatory tone. [...] "Then I'll confess that I felt I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>that</b> wasn't quite usual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a good boy. I shouldn't <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> You'll get {{a little}} bit of money when I pass away, but you mustn't look forward to it. It wouldn't profit you if you did." ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1980s saw Etheridge remain {{very active}} on the live front - {{including}} a reunion with Soft Machine for the band's final series of concerts at Ronnie Scott's club in 1984 - but much less productive in the studio. [...] "1981 {{was a sort}} of watershed year for me... there's sort of before and after 1981. Since then I've mostly played on my own or led bands, playing alongside other people but not in settled formations. That was partly because I <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and partly because, frankly, I didn't really know what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with myself at that point. I'd always enjoyed playing sort of jazz-type gigs, so I started doing it..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What can we do? I {{might tell}} him that I wouldn't have him here any more, but I shouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Perhaps she'll do your bidding." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mavering nodded. [...] "He's {{given me}} {{three weeks to}} decide whether I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> or go in for law. That's what I came up here for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But am I {{going out}} with you?" [...] Bob asked. [...] "Why, {{tomorrow}} is Christmas Day, and you sail two days after, don't you? And I shouldn't have time even {{to go up to}} town, and down to Putney, to say goodbye to the fellows. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and tell them that I am going abroad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would depend on what you wanted her to do," [...] he said at last. [...] "The Hall is a good service, though they don't like the mistresses, and of course {{none of them would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> might risk their place." ...|$|R
50|$|Westphal {{was born}} January 2, 1919 in Los Angeles, California to Emma and Leo Westphal. At age two, she began cutting, pasting and {{coloring}} and decided <b>that</b> she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> more than anything. She attended Los Angeles public, elementary, {{junior and senior}} high schools. In 1941 she earned an Associate of Arts degree from Los Angeles City College. She then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied painting and art history and received BA and MFA degrees in painting. In 1943 she was awarded the Phelan Traveling Scholarship for Practicing Artists, established by James Phelan, former U. S. Senator from California. The scholarship provided funds for travel to Mexico, where she visited the studios of muralists David Siqueiros and Diego Rivera.|$|R
6000|$|Blanche was {{a little}} embarrassed when Rivers replied: [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> agree <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Mebbe you'd better come over to make sure I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> 'cause you see p'rhaps {{the doctor}} {{might not be}} willin', an' we'd have dragged the poor feller 'round for nothin'. Besides, if we should happen to meet Skip while he was along, it would be kind er hard lines {{to take care of}} a lame boy an' fight at the same time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad to do a {{favor for}} that young man," [...] said the General, when Stephen {{had gone off}} with the slip of paper he had given him. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> kind of a favor for any officer, when I can. Did you notice how he flared up when I {{mentioned}} the girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, trust me,' {{said the}} master, 'I will {{keep it to}} myself; or, {{if you do not}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole. Then put back the earth and come away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> fight {{they must}} {{know how to}} fight," [...] he said, [...] "for no man <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the thing <b>that</b> he <b>does</b> not know how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Olive, [...] "he {{was in the}} {{merchant}} service, and has retired. It seems queer {{that he should be}} keeping a toll-gate, but my father has often told me <b>that</b> Uncle John <b>does</b> not care for appearances, and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things <b>that</b> please him. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> keep the tollhouse because it brings him in touch with the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|... by the {{triangle}} inequality, since each summand has absolute value 1. In applications one would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better. <b>That</b> involves proving some cancellation takes place, {{or in other}} words that this sum of complex numbers on the unit circle is not of numbers all with the same argument. The best that is reasonable to hope for is {{an estimate of the}} form ...|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{said she}} should not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> She should be afraid, she said. The sparks would fall down upon her and burn her. So the boys gave that plan up. Then James {{proposed}} that they should make believe that they were savages, going to set fire to a town. The wigwam {{was to be the}} town. They would take their torches, and all go and set it on fire in several places.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, look here, boy, you'd better tell me {{the whole}} story, and tell it true, or I shall have to send you up to judge Morris. I wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for he is a harsh sort of a man; so, if you haven't done any thing bad, you needn't be afraid to speak out, and I'll do what I can for you," [...] said Mrs. Moss, rather sternly, as she went {{and sat down in}} her rocking-chair, as if about to open the court.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{you need}} is a hearing," [...] she said. [...] "And you shall have that. Oh, but there is a {{wilderness}} of work before us! Can you design the scenes? I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> It's like playing with doll-houses. I'll show you how. We'll leave the financial side of it to you, Hugh," [...] she said, to her brother. [...] "Come, Mr. Playwright," [...] and they set to work with paste and card-board like a couple of children, and soon had models of all the sets. They seemed childish things indeed, but Helen was mistress of even the mechanical side of the stage, and these paste-pot sketches were of the greatest value to the scene-painter and the carpenter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{but what}} I was saying is," [...] {{continued}} the countess, [...] "that {{what would be}} thought strange a few years ago, isn't thought at all so now; and though I'm sure, Selina, I wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>that</b> looked unkind to Fanny, I really don't {{see how we can}} help it, as your father makes such a point of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, sir," [...] said George as he retired, [...] "that ain't the {{way that}} folks in these parts <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business, <b>that</b> ain't. Letter writing is all very well for Londoners and other furriners, but it don't do here. Besides, sir, I shall hear you well enough up there. Sarvant, sir!" [...] this to Edward Cossey, and he was gone.|$|R
30|$|In addition, and {{to promote}} usage and access to phones and the Internet, {{technology}} literacy sessions can be conducted in the safe spaces where women and girls are equipped with skills to use phones in a comfortable way. It is of importance to ask women and girls if this is something they are interested in, they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>that</b> they feel safe doing.|$|R
60|$|After much {{consideration}},--very much consideration, {{a consideration}} which took him {{the whole time}} that he was brushing his hair and washing his teeth,--he resolved that he would, in the first instance, speak to Mr. Amedroz. Not that he intended that the father should win the daughter for him. He had an idea that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> work for himself. But he thought that the old squire would be better pleased if his consent were asked in the first instance. The present day was Sunday, and he would not speak on the subject till Monday. This day he would devote to the work of securing his future father-in-law's good opinion; to that,--and to his prayers.|$|E
60|$|Jeff said {{he would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and he asked at the door whether Westover {{was going to the}} tea at Mrs. Bellingham's. He said he had to look in there, before he went out to Cambridge; and left Westover in mute amaze at the length he had {{apparently}} gone in a road that had once seemed no thoroughfare for him. Jeff's social acceptance, even after the Enderby ball, which was now some six or seven weeks past, had been slow; but of late, for no reason that he or any one else could have given, it had gained a sudden precipitance; and people who wondered why they met him at other houses began to ask him to their own.|$|E
6000|$|The {{architect}} {{began by}} {{asking for the}} site, and seemed a little discomposed to discover this had still to be found. [...] "I thought of building just anywhere," [...] said Kipps. [...] "I 'aven't {{made up my mind}} about that yet." [...] The architect remarked that he would have preferred to see the site in order to know where to put what he called his [...] "ugly side," [...] but it was quite possible of course to plan a house [...] "in the air," [...] on the level, [...] "simply with back and front assumed"--if they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Kipps flushed slightly, and secretly hoping it would make no great difference in the fees, said a little doubtfully that he thought that would be all right.|$|E
60|$|Now St. Paul {{wants us}} to {{restrain}} ourselves, not from fear of being punished, but because we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right. <b>That</b> is what he means {{when he says that}} we are to be led by the Spirit, instead of being under the law. It is better to be afraid of the law than <b>to</b> <b>do</b> wrong: but it is best of all <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right from the Spirit, and of our own free will.|$|R
5000|$|Ty took {{first place}} at the Santa Barbara Skateboard Championships with long nose wheelies, headstands, and 360s. He {{continued}} to push limits {{and went on to}} win many national competitions. He said, “One thing I’m into is I don’t <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>that’s</b> easy. In all the tricks <b>that</b> I <b>do,</b> I don’t <b>do</b> anything <b>that’s</b> easy. It’s just boring; it’s not a challenge. I’m just into the challenge of things.” ...|$|R
50|$|Kanae is {{a second}} year student though she does not act like it at times. She <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things <b>that</b> break norms, such as getting a tennis racket with strings made from her grandmother's hair or {{sleeping}} by standing up and with {{her head against the}} wall, and sometimes even breaks laws of physics, such as sinking into solid ground or splitting herself in two. She tends to freak out Yuri in the process.|$|R
