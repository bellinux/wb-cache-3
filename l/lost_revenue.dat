5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> from {{the sales tax}} by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but {{if they did not}} begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{prompted}} the closures {{of public and}} private schools, businesses, offices, and factories throughout the Northeast. In some areasmdash&such as the city of Boston and parts of New Jerseymdash&classes were canceled for the entire week following the snowstorm. In New York City, student attendance remained extremely low in the days after schools reopened. The New York Public Library was forced to close its main location and all of its 80 branches. Non-essential government offices in Washington, D.C. were also closed because of the storm. Air and ground transportation came to a halt, with multiple major airports closed and rail service suspended. At La Guardia and Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy International) airports alone, over 100 flights were canceled. Railroads reported {{tens of millions of dollars}} in <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> and storm-related expenses.|$|E
50|$|Other {{industries}} {{were affected}} {{directly by the}} fall of cotton prices. STT textile production slowed, as did the production of agricultural equipment by SIMAT, which made plowing equipment for use in cotton planting. Furthermore, the drop in revenues to farmers in the soudanian zone for their cotton and peanut production affected their ability to buy equipment. <b>Lost</b> <b>revenues</b> to farmers, along with the reduction in the numbers of workers needed in ginning operations, took a toll on cash earnings and therefore on buying power. By 1986 the ripple effect of these <b>lost</b> <b>revenues</b> in the cotton sector was widespread.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> for the state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day {{due to the}} closure of the lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the page count. The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in <b>lost</b> <b>revenue.</b> Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E

5|$|Glenda made {{landfall}} near Onslow, where sustained winds reached 117km/h (72mph). There, {{the storm}} produced a 24‑hour rainfall total of 206mm (8.11in), {{which is the}} sixth greatest daily precipitation on record in the town. Several other locations reported over 200mm (8in), though overall precipitation {{was less than a}} usual landfalling tropical cyclone. The rainfall flooded several roads. The winds downed several trees and power lines, which left about 2,000people in Karratha without electricity; the power outage was quickly repaired. Several windows at the hospital in Onslow were broken, resulting in some minor water damage. Overall damage was minor, and no deaths or injuries were reported, which was credited to the storm's weakening and preparations in the landfall area. In all, damages from the storm amounted to A$1.2million (US$965,000). The disruption to shipping companies resulted in economic losses of A$30million (US$24.1 million). Oil companies reported a loss of 500 tonnes during the economic quarter due to the cyclone. The Onslow Salt company reported upwards of A$20million (US$16 million) in <b>lost</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{impending}} cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and iron ore mining and exporting. The Port of Port Hedland, a highly important iron ore shipping terminal, was forced to close for about 52 hours, contributing to inflated iron ore prices and delayed shipments. Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region, cutting national oil production by 25% and iron ore exports by 4.7% versus the previous month. Overall, Lua is attributed to $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in <b>lost</b> <b>revenue.</b> Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land, but damage was limited {{by the lack of}} population in the storm's path. The Pardoo Roadhouse bore the brunt of the storm, and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads; at these sites, the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees. Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather. The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas, and Lua was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail {{ridership}} showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the <b>lost</b> <b>revenue,</b> WMATA {{said that it would}} run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E

5|$|A multi-sport athlete {{during his}} college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly {{considered}} {{a career in}} professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed {{on the issue of}} instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems.|$|E
5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{increased when}} he fought with then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin over a campaign promise Martin had made {{that would lead}} to a revised Atlantic Accord. Martin proposed an eight-year deal that the province would keep 100 percent of offshore oil revenues, but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario. Williams, supported by the other provincial leaders, walked out of talks with Martin, saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in <b>lost</b> <b>revenue</b> over the life of its three oil fields. Williams along with Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm, who also wanted the same deal as Newfoundland and Labrador, met with the Prime Minister on several occasions but a deal between Ottawa and the two provinces could not be reached. Williams raised the temperature on December 23, 2004, when he ordered the removal of all Canadian flags from provincial government buildings. On January 10, 2005, Canadian flags started flying once again in the province, and several weeks later Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia reached a deal with Ottawa.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{state legislatures}} grant local governments the {{authority}} to enact sales taxes on retail sales transactions that occur within local juris-dictions. Local government reliance on these local option sales tax (<b>LOST)</b> <b>revenues</b> is increasing. In many states, including Oklahoma, municipal governments are unrestricted as to the LOST rate that can be imposed. The ability to generate <b>LOST</b> <b>revenues,</b> however, may depend on many factors outside a local government’s domain, including prox-imity to large, urban retail centers, and tax competition from other locali-ties. This paper investigates aspects of LOST policy for municipal gov-ernments located on the urban fringe using all Oklahoma municipalities that imposed a LOST from 1990 to 2001. An important finding is that the revenue impact of increasing LOST rates (i. e., the LOST tax elasticity) depends on the urban influence measure. The implications are impor-tant for guiding nonmetropolitan municipal governments in the deter-mination of LOST polic...|$|R
