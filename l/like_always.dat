It will not trouble you; merely a word; but women have their fancies, and we <b>like</b> <b>always</b> to gratify her, because she is much alone and never complains.' ...|$|E

60|$|Monseigneur {{had been}} out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with {{fascinating}} company. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence {{with him in the}} tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance for France, as the <b>like</b> <b>always</b> is for all countries similarly favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the long}} and the short of it is, that Munseer Ferdinand Hyppolite Xavier Stanislas, Shevalier de L'Orge, was reglar cut out by Munseer Algernon Percy Deuceace, Exquire. Poar Ferdinand did not leave the house--he hadn't the heart to do that--nor had my lady the desire to dismiss him. He was usefle in a {{thousand}} different ways, gitting oppra-boxes, and invitations to French swarries, bying gloves, and O de Colong, writing French noats, and such <b>like.</b> <b>Always</b> let me recommend an English famly, going to Paris, {{to have at least}} one young man of the sort about them. Never mind how old your ladyship is, he will make love to you; never mind what errints you send him upon, he'll trot off and do them. Besides, he's always quite and well-dresst, and never drinx moar than a pint of wine at dinner, which (as I say) is a pint to consider. Such a conveniants of a man was Munseer de L'Orge--the greatest use and comfort to my lady posbill; if it was but to laff at his bad pronunciatium of English, it was somethink amusink; the fun was to pit him against poar Miss Kicksey, she speakin French, and he our naytif British tong.|$|E
6000|$|... "The authoresses {{are quite}} as inconsistent," [...] the {{professional}} heroine rejoined. [...] "They wouldn't {{speak to the}} kind of young men whom they expect a heroine to be passionately in love with. They must know how very oddly a girl feels about people who are outside of the world she's been brought up in. It isn't enough that a man should be very noble at heart and do grand things, or save your life every now and then, or be masterful and use his giant will to make you in love with him. I don't see why they can't let one have, now and then, the kind of husbands they get for themselves. For my part, I should <b>like</b> <b>always</b> to give my heart to a normal, sensible, well-bred, conscientious, agreeable man who could offer me a pleasant home--I wouldn't mind the suburbs; and I could work with him and work for him till I dropped--the kind of man that the real world seems to be so full of. I've never had a fair chance to show what was in me; I've always been placed in such a false position. Now I have no position at all, not even a false one!" ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Parkman looked {{along the}} line to select one that had a good horse. The {{distance}} was considerable {{that they had to}} go, and besides Mr. Parkman knew that his wife <b>liked</b> <b>always</b> to go fast.

6000|$|... "There {{would be}} a savor of greediness in that, though I know that the leg will go down,--and I shouldn't {{then be able to}} draw the comparison. I like to have them both, and I <b>like</b> <b>always</b> to be able to assert my opinion that the leg is the better joint. Now, how about the apple-pudding? You said I should have an apple-pudding." [...] From which it {{appeared}} that Mr. Grey was not superior to having the dinner discussed in his presence at the breakfast-table. The apple-pudding came, and was apparently enjoyed. A large portion of it was put between two plates. [...] "That's for Mrs. Grimes," [...] suggested Mr. Grey. [...] "I am not quite sure that Mrs. Grimes is worthy of it." [...] "If you knew what it was to be left without a shilling of your husband's wages you'd think yourself worthy." [...] When the conversation about the pudding was over Mr. Grey ate his cheese, and then sat quite still in his arm-chair over the fire while the things were being taken away. [...] "I declare I think he is the wickedest man the world has ever produced," [...] said Mr. Grey as soon as the door was shut, thus showing by the repetition of the words he had before used that his mind had been intent on Mr. Scarborough rather than on the pheasant.|$|E
6000|$|He {{described}} the process, but she--scarcely listened. She was striving to adjust {{herself to the}} elements of a new and revolutionary experience; to the waiters who came and went, softly, deferentially putting hot plates before her, helping her to strange and delicious things; a creamy soup, a fish with a yellow sauce whose ingredients were artfully disguised, a breast of guinea fowl, a salad, an ice, and a small cup of coffee. Instincts and tastes hitherto unsuspected and ungratified were aroused in her. What would it be <b>like</b> <b>always</b> to be daintily served, to eat one's meals in this leisurely and luxurious manner? As her physical hunger was satisfied by the dainty food, even as her starved senses drank in the caressing warmth and harmony of the room, the gleaming fire, the heavy scent of the flowers, the rose glow of the lights in contrast to the storm without,--so the storm flinging itself against the windows, powerless to reach her, seemed to typify a former existence of cold, black mornings and factory bells and harsh sirens, of toil and limitations. Had her existence been like that? or was it a dream, a nightmare from which she had awakened at last? From time to time, deep within her, she felt persisting a conviction that that was reality, this illusion, but she fought it down. She wanted--oh, how she wanted to believe in the illusion! ...|$|E
60|$|Isnâ€™t it {{favourable}} when I say Iâ€™ve had {{the most}} lovely time? Iâ€™ve never had so much liberty in my life, and Iâ€™ve been out alone, as you may say, {{every day of the}} voyage. If itâ€™s a foretaste of whatâ€™s to come I shall take very kindly to that. When I say Iâ€™ve been out alone I mean weâ€™ve always been two. But we two were alone, so to speak, and it wasnâ€™t <b>like</b> <b>always</b> having mamma or Madame Galopin, or some lady in the pension or the temporary cook. Mamma has been very poorly; sheâ€™s so very well on land that itâ€™s a wonder to see her at all taken down. She says, however, that it isnâ€™t the being at sea; itâ€™s on the contrary approaching the land. Sheâ€™s not in a hurry to arrive; she keeps well before her that great disillusions await us. I didnâ€™t know she had any illusionsâ€”she has too many opinions, I should think, for that: she discriminates, as sheâ€™s always saying, from morning till night. Where would the poor illusions find room? Sheâ€™s meanwhile very serious; she sits for hours in perfect silence, her eyes fixed on the horizon. I heard her say yesterday to an English gentlemanâ€”a very odd Mr. Antrobus, the only person with whom she conversesâ€”that she was afraid she shouldnâ€™t like her native land, and that she shouldnâ€™t like not liking it. But this is a mistake; sheâ€™ll like that immenselyâ€”I mean the not liking it. If it should prove at all agreeable sheâ€™ll be furious, for that will go against her system. You know all about mammaâ€™s system; Iâ€™ve explained it so often. It goes against her system that we should come back at all; that was my systemâ€”Iâ€™ve had at last to invent one! She consented to come only because she saw that, having no dot, I should never marry in Europe; and I pretended to be immensely preoccupied with this idea in order to make her start. In reality cela mâ€™est parfaitement Ã©gal. Iâ€™m only afraid I shall like it too muchâ€”I donâ€™t mean marriage, of course, but the sense of a native land. Say what you will, itâ€™s a charming thing to go out alone, and Iâ€™ve given notice that I mean to be always en course. When I tell mamma this she looks at me in the same silence; her eyes dilate and then she slowly closes them. Itâ€™s as if the sea were affecting her a little, though itâ€™s so beautifully calm. I ask her if sheâ€™ll try my bromide, which is there in my bag; but she motions me off and I begin to walk again, tapping my little boot-soles on the smooth clean deck. This allusion to my boot-soles, by the way, isnâ€™t prompted by vanity; but itâ€™s a fact that at sea oneâ€™s feet and oneâ€™s shoes assume the most extraordinary importance, so that one should take the precaution to have nice ones. Theyâ€™re all you seem to see as the people walk about the deck; you get to know them intimately and to dislike some of them so much. Iâ€™m afraid youâ€™ll think that Iâ€™ve already broken loose; and for aught I know Iâ€™m writing as a demoiselle bien-Ã©lÃ©vee shouldnâ€™t write. I donâ€™t know whether itâ€™s the American air; if it is, all I can say is that the American airâ€™s very charming. It makes me impatient and restless, and I sit scribbling here because Iâ€™m so eager to arrive and the time passes better if I occupy myself.|$|E
