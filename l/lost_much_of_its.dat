5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E

During the conflict, the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines, who were also {{at war with the}} Bulgarians, a continuous conflict since the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 971. This war had resulted in the Bulgarian Emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his Imperial title in Constantinople, and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule. The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria, but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the Comitopuli brothers David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, resistance against the Byzantines emerged.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work.

5|$|At first, Sélestat {{was a major}} {{strategic}} stronghold for the French. Located {{near the}} Rhine, it controlled the access to the Vosges mountains {{and the rest of}} France. Vauban, the foremost military architect at that time, rebuilt the town walls between 1675 and 1691. However, after the conquest of Strasbourg in 1681 Sélestat <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> strategic importance, as Strasbourg was better located. But it remained a garrison town, and the troops stationed there helped to improve the faltering local economy. Although Protestantism was not forbidden in Alsace, French authorities largely encouraged Catholicism and opened three new convents in Sélestat. Jews were expelled from the town in 1642. During the French Revolution the population was extremely conservative and opposed to change. The new territorial organisation confirmed the decline of the town, which did not become a prefecture and was not distinguished as a subprefecture until 1806, when it replaced Barr in that capacity. Sélestat suffered from the Napoleonic wars as it was besieged and bombed by the Bavarians in 1814 and blockaded by a German coalition in 1815.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks, and Russia became part of the new Soviet Union. As the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist–Leninist ideology, the Soviet government ordered many churches closed. The Peter and Paul parish was formally dissolved by the communist government in 1929, and celebrating Mass was forbidden. The church <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> surrounding gardens in 1935—a school was built there the following year—and the church was finally closed on 30 July 1938 (the St. Peter and Paul church had met the same fate nine days earlier). The church was plundered after its closure, and many items, including the main altar and the organ, were irretrievably lost. The church was used for several months as a vegetable store, and was then reconstructed as a hostel and its interior divided into four floors.|$|E
5|$|Once the 1976 Formula One World Championship season {{got under}} way Pryce {{instantly}} added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in Brazil.

Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at Kyalami and Long Beach. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their airboxes and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised Goodyear tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in Britain. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at Zandvoort, where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring finish of his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.|$|E
5000|$|President Servalan {{was seen}} using {{several kinds of}} ships {{throughout}} the series. In the third season she used an organic-looking black cruiser that looked nothing like the Federation pursuit ships, or anything built by humans, and appeared almost alien in design.

The craft appeared shortly after the fall of Star One and the intergalactic war with the Andromeda aliens. Because the Federation had reportedly <b>lost</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> fleet in that battle, the ship might have been a captured spoil from that war. The ship could land, as seen in the episode [...] "Moloch". In the episode, a renegade Federation commander planned to use alien technology to replicate copies of the ship to replace his lost fleet, suggesting it to be a valuable warship. The ship was later destroyed on Terminal when a creature native to that planet entered the landed ship and triggered a self-destruct device.|$|R

In 1871 Russia occupied the Kulja territory. There was talk of permanent annexation, but Saint Petersburg declared that it was occupying the territory until the Chinese could bring in an army and restore order. Chinese authority in Xinjiang was reestablished by 1877. Chung Hao was sent to Russia to negotiate. In September 1879 he concluded the Treaty of Lavadia. Russia would retain the Tekes valley at the southwest end of the Kulja territory and passes over {{the mountains to the}} Tarim Basin. China would pay 5 million rubles and various trade concessions were made. In January 1880 Chung Hao returned to Peking and was greeted with indignation. He was declared to have betrayed his country, was arrested and later sentenced to death. Zeng Jize, was appointed as the new ambassador. Russia refused to negotiate unless Chung Hao was released and this was backed by the other powers. In August 1880 Chung Hao was released and negotiations resumed. The Treaty of Saint Petersburg was concluded on February 12, 1881 and ratified within six months. Two years later (March 1883) Russia evacuated the province. There were some minor border problems and a final protocol was signed on October 19, 1883.|$|R
5000|$|After the goldfields in New South Wales and Victoria {{had been}} mined {{to the extent}} where there were few {{opportunities}} for the independent miner possessed of only basic equipment, many miners were seeking a new opportunity. On hearing that gold had been found at Canoona in about July 1858, it stimulated a gold rush and approximately 15000 miners descended on Canoona within the following months. However, relatively little gold was found at Canoona and there was great disappointment and Canoona became known as a [...] "duffer". Having spent everything to come to Canoona, many miners were then destitute. Having <b>lost</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> labour force, the Victorian Government sent a ship to enable destitute miners to return to Victoria and repay their fare by working in Melbourne on their return. While many returned to the southern states, others remained in Queensland providing a labour force that enabled {{the development of the}} newly established colony of Queensland. Some remained and would try their luck in Queensland's later gold rushes. For example, Hugo William Du Rietz was enticed to Australia by the gold rushes in Ballarat and then came to the Canoona gold rush and then to the Gympie gold rush. Although never particularly successful as a miner, he was successful as an architect and builder and took an active civic role in Brisbane and Gympie.|$|R

During the period of Venetian rule in the Peloponnese (1687–1715) after the Morean War, it served as the seat of a fiscal district. The reports of the Venetian governors at the time, however, dismiss Chlemoutsi as small in size and barely inhabited. In 1701 the provveditore generale Francesco Grimani proposed that it be destroyed, as it was {{too far from the}} sea—a vital concern for the maritime-minded Republic—and difficult to defend, and recommended that Glarentza, by then abandoned and ruined, be rebuilt instead. In 1715, the Morea returned to Ottoman control, and by the early 19th century, the fortress had been completely deserted. In 1825, during the Greek War of Independence, the forces of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt took the castle and dismantled a portion of its walls, so that it could not be used by the Greek rebels.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a close {{relative}} to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx. Günther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they {{were related to the}} genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume, the fact that the red rail <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.|$|E
5|$|Late on July17, Ma-on {{underwent}} another eyewall replacement {{cycle and}} weakened, despite developing improved outflow and convection {{in the northern}} quadrant. The typhoon's large size prevented re-intensification– gale force winds extended 370km (200mi) east of the center. In addition, the intrusion of dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery. By July18, Ma-on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan. The next day, it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore. At around 1400UTC on July19, Ma-on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon. Turning to the east, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over {{the southern tip of}} the Kii Peninsula early on July20. After emerging from the country, Ma-on turned to the southeast. Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east, although slight re-intensification was expected. However, the JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July21 after the storm <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> convection. The circulation became ill-defined, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July22, noting the system {{was in the process of}} dissipation. However, the JMA maintained Ma-on as a severe tropical storm until July23, by which time the storm had turned to the northeast. The storm became extratropical on July24 near the Kuril Islands, lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E

Eventually, he moved north to Chihuahua, where, as commander of the presidio of Terrenate, he {{played a role in}} the wars against the Yaqui and Apache. Plutarco Elías Calles's father, Plutarco Elías Lucero, lost his father in 1865, José Juan Elías Pérez, to battle wounds in the resistance to the French Intervention, leaving his widow with eight children, of which Plutarco was the oldest.

50|$|However, {{towards the}} end of the 1980s, Thatcher's {{increasing}} unpopularity and unwillingness to change policies perceived as vote-losing led to her being deposed in 1990 and replaced by John Major who won an unexpected election victory in 1992. Major's government suffered a political blow when the Pound Sterling was forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism later that year, which <b>lost</b> the party <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> reputation for good financial stewardship. Although the country's economy recovered in the mid-1990s, an effective opposition campaign by the Labour Party led to a landslide defeat in 1997.

The defeat caused the emperor to be deposed and replaced by the ineffectual Michael VII Doukas, who refused to honour the treaty that had been signed by Romanos. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073, meeting no opposition. Chaos reigned as the empire's resources were squandered {{in a series of}} disastrous civil wars. Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, an area of 78000 km2 had been lost to the empire.
