5|$|Shuffle! {{had much}} pre-sale hype as the {{development}} team was largely composed of {{former members of}} BasiL, including Hiro Suzuhira and Aoi Nishimata, the illustrators for Shuffle!. Shuffle! was released at {{around the same time}} as Fate/stay night, a highly anticipated visual novel by Type-Moon. The limited edition of Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of January 2004 the top 50 best-selling Bishōjo games semi-monthly sales chart in Japan, behind Fate/stay night.

5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive.

5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system.

But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E
5|$|The task {{of taking}} Aachen fell to General Charles H. Corlett's XIX Corps' 30th Infantry Division (along with the {{attached}} 743rd Tank Battalion) and Joseph Collins' VII Corps' 1st Infantry Division. General Leland Hobbs' 30th Infantry Division would be assisted by the 2nd Armored Division, which would exploit the 30th Division's {{penetration of the}} Siegfried Line, while their flanks were protected by the 29th Infantry Division. In the south, 1st Infantry Division {{was supported by the}} 9th Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Division. These divisions had used the brief respite in the fighting during the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of September to rest and refit, taking in a large number of replacements. By 1 October, over 70% of the men of General Clarence Huebner's 1st Infantry Division were replacements, and the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of September were spent giving these men village-fighting and weapons training. The impending offensive's plan called for both infantry divisions to avoid street fighting in Aachen; instead, the two divisions would link up and encircle the city, assigning a relatively small force to capture it while the bulk of US forces continued pushing east.|$|E

5|$|Under Hall's command, the Polaris {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871.

Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him.

5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed.

5|$|His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
