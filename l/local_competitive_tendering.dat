In {{the majority of cases}} these services have to be secured through <b>competitive</b> <b>tender.</b> The Service Subsidy Agreements (Tendering) Regulations provided local authorities with the scope to let any individual bus subsidy contract in any one year up to a certain maximum value without the need to competitively tender (the de minimis limits). There was also a maximum value that de minimis contracts could be let with any one operator in any one year." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> of <b>local</b> public {{transport}} services {{has been allowed}} in Norway since 1994. By 2005, 28 percent of all route production in Norway was procured {{on the basis of}} tendered contracts, covering around 40 percent of all passengers. The majority of the tendered contracts were gross cost contracts, whereas historically, most Norwegian contracts have been net cost contracts. This article analyses the effect of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> on operating cost and subsidies paid. It is found that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> reduces costs by 10 percent and that most of the cost reduction has been used to reduce subsidies for {{public transport}} by local authorities. The effects of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> in Norway are smaller compared to other countries. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the industry had improved efficiency over a long period before <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> was introduced...|$|R
40|$|Compulsory <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> (CCT) of blue-collar {{services}} such as refuse collection and street cleaning {{was introduced in the}} UK by the Local Government Act 1988. This law, imposed by central government, obliged elected local authorities to expose specific services to <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> at fixed intervals and subject to national guidelines. Whilst the issue of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> of public services has generated a substantial literature over recent years (see Domberger and Rimmer (1994) for a review), there have been relatively few studies of compulsory <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering.</b> 2 This paper uses a dataset on refuse collection costs and services for the 365 English local authorities over the period 1984 - 94.

Unlike previous studies, which have relied on cross-sectional data, a five-year balanced panel of 176 hospitals is used to estimate a series of fixed effects regression models. These panel estimates suggest that previous studies have likely over-estimated the cost-savings associated with <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering.</b> The findings also suggest that the lower costs associated with <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> {{have more to do}} with auction theory than with any intrinsic efficiency of the private sector...|$|R

40|$|A key {{attribute}} of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> for the periodic selection of operators of subsidised public transport services is {{to secure the}} provision of specified services at efficient cost levels. This has proved particularly effective where services were previously provided by an inefficient monopoly operator. The arguments for the adoption of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> in preference to negotiation with the incumbent operator may be less clear-cut in other cases. Consideration is given to both theoretical and practical insights into {{the relative merits of}} <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> and negotiation approaches in such situations. The limited literature on the topic is reviewed and insights and lessons identified. Influencing issues include prior conditions, the nature of the supplier market, features of contracts, negotiating and <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> strategies and practice, accountability and transparency, and long-term market implications. The evidence suggests that [`]one size does not fit all', and the choice will depend on specific circumstances. The relative merits of the two approaches for renewal of bus contracts are considered with regard to Adelaide, for contracts which have previously been awarded through <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering.</b> The paper draws out the main factors that could influence the authority's choice between the options, and discusses the relevance of the findings to other situations. <b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Negotiated contracts Bus service contracts Contracting model Transaction costs Efficient pricing Supplier market...|$|R
40|$|Workshop 1 was {{concerned}} {{to identify the}} real results of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering,</b> and experience {{on how to make}} it work better, using evidence from the rail and bus sectors in a large number of countries spread around the world. It was found that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> had generally been successful in terms of quality and costs, but problems had occurred in a number of cases, so careful attention must be paid to the design of tendering exercises, details of the contract, risk-sharing arrangements and the approach to any re-negotiation found to be necessary. As a result, an important conclusion is that the tendering authority needs a high degree of expertise in these issues; any thought that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> relieves the public authority of the need for expertise in public transport is mistaken. <b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Rail Bus Contracts Risk sharing Re-negotiation...|$|R

40|$|Most {{countries}} {{contemplating the}} introduction of competition-based organizational forms did not perceive the British deregulated bus regime {{to be the way}} forward. A deeper analysis of facts and an international coverage of the local successes of that regime remained marginal and, as a result, the reputation of deregulated regimes remained bad or - at best - a contentious issue. The rush for <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> was further stimulated by the European Commission's endeavour to enact a Regulation that put forward <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> of exclusive contracts as the preferred way to organise local public transport markets. Yet, as discussed in this workshop, deregulation in various guises may well play a growing role in local and regional transport. This is already visible in long-distance coach transport and in (international) European railway markets as from 2010. The workshop paper discusses whether such competition-based institutional alternatives to <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> can provide efficiency and service improvements, how such competition-based alternatives should be [`]regulated' and, alternatively, how a non-competitive direct award could perhaps still guarantee good performance. <b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Deregulation Market initiative Institutional design Open access Direct award...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{estimate}} the effect of contract renewal as well as <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> on public transport costs, subsidies, and ridership. More specifically, we examine to what extent (multiple) contract renewals and introduction of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> for long-term public transport contracts affect ridership, operational costs and subsidies in concession areas governed by public transportation authorities from 2001 until 2013 in the Netherlands. Our identification strategy improves on the literature as {{we are able to}} control for all time-invariant unobserved factors, such as network and area characteristics by using panel data. We show that when renewing long-term contracts, operational costs are reduced by at least 10 %, whereas subsidies fall even stronger. For contracts that are renewed at least twice, the reduction in costs is even more substantial and in the order of 16 %. We find that the effect of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> is completely absent, suggesting that the threat of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> is sufficient in a market where the majority of concessions is <b>competitive</b> <b>tendered.</b> Contract renewal not only reduces costs and subsidies, but simultaneously increases public transport ridership by 7. 7 %. Furthermore the vehicle-hours elasticity of operational costs is 0. 40, pointing to strong economies of density. The geographical scale elasticity of operational costs is around one, which indicates constant returns to scale with respect to the geographical size of the concession area. This suggest that the current size of the Dutch concession area is optimal with respect to costs...|$|R
30|$|Experience {{from the}} Norwegian taxi {{industry}} shows that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> is possible within entry-regulated markets. Still, {{there are issues}} that remain to be solved, in particular in rural areas. This is due to both interdependency between the purchaser and the service provider, {{and the size of}} the markets. For other sectors, the main lessons are that <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> can work, even with regulated entry, but that it needs to be adapted to suit the characteristics of each market. This research shows that there is significant variation within a sector. A tool such as <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> can be well suited in one area, but inappropriate in another. This research suggests that the outcome is related to both hard factors such as market size and number of entrants, but also to factors like interdependency and negotiation climate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} reasons that are responsible for the disappointment of authorities in their operators' efforts to develop public transport (PT) to the advantage of their travellers. The lessons drawn in this paper are based upon the <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> experience of the authors and upon the results of meetings organised with parties involved in <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> and aimed at exchanging lessons. There appears to be three main causes: (1) there is freedom for the operator, but the contract is bad; (2) there is freedom for the operator, there is a good contract, but there is no market; and (3) there is freedom for the operator, but the operator is not able to use it. The paper concludes with a few perspectives for improvement. Public transport <b>Competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Contracting Governance Service design...|$|R
