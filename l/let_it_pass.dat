25|$|The {{plain of}} Amik to the {{north-east}} {{of the city}} is fertile soil watered by the Orontes, the Karasu and the Afrin rivers; the lake in the plain was drained in 1980 by a French company. At the same time channels were built to widen the Orontes and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> neatly through the city centre. The Orontes is joined in Antakya by the Hacı Kürüş stream to the north-east of the city near the church of St Peter, and the Hamşen which runs down from Habib-i Neccar to the south-west, under Memekli Bridge near the army barracks. Flora includes the bay trees and myrtle. There is a Jewish community.|$|E
25|$|Captain Tracy {{and a small}} crew left Newburyport for Boston {{to take on a}} full crew for {{a six-month}} patrol. As the ship rounded Cape Ann, they spotted another sail. As the Yankee Hero was short-handed, Tracy decided to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass.</b> However, some local sailors rendezvoused with them at sea and told them that several {{transports}} had been seen close to the Cape that day. Supplemented with fourteen of the local men, bringing his crew to 40 (other accounts say 52), Tracy set after the distant ship. When they had approached to within six miles, they could see that it was a ship of war, the HMS Milford. Still short-handed and ill-prepared for a fight, the Captain changed his mind again and ordered the ship around. However, the Milford had spotted them by this time and gave chase. Heavily outgunned and outmanned, the Yankee Hero's crew was decimated and the ship disabled. At least four of the crew were killed and thirteen wounded, including Captain Tracy.|$|E

2500|$|His third {{stint in}} prison was after Pakistani President Iskandar Mirza was ousted in a {{military}} coup by General Ayub Khan. The new military regime sought to purge political opponents, which led to Khan {{and hundreds of other}} politicians being disqualified from participating in politics. Wali Khan commented about his imprisonment to Ayub Khan's Information secretary in 1969 shortly after the Democratic Action Committee's conference with Ayub Khan had finished. Gauhar writes that, [...] "Wali Khan narrated how Khawaja Shahabuddin asked him on three occasions during the conference, 'how is it that I never met a bright and able person like you when I was Governor of NWFP for three years.' Wali Khan <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> on the first two occasions but on the third occasion he could not restrain himself and rejoined, 'Because all those three years you kept me in prison!'" [...] This was followed by another brief arrest in 1969 after another military ruler, Yahya Khan, assumed power after Ayub Khan resigned.|$|E
2500|$|Solicitors {{were more}} scared by the {{proposal}} that banks {{would be allowed}} to offer conveyancing services, but this suggestion eventually came to nothing. The government introduced a consultation paper on the subject in April 1984, but in December 1985 announced that it [...] "was not satisfied that lending institutions could safely be permitted to offer both conveyancing and a loan in the same transaction. It is therefore proposed to prohibit the institutions from providing conveyancing, either directly or through a subsidiary company in which they hold a majority stake, to those who are also borrowing from them". This essentially killed the proposal (a framework which would allow banks to undertake conveyancing work was included in the Building Societies Act 1986 but never implemented) because the banks had no interest in lending only to people who were not also engaged in a loan agreement with them. It was well known at the time that many members of the cabinet were happy with the initial proposal, but that Lord Hailsham was determined not to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> and forced the government to go against its earlier suggestion.|$|E

Ruth is furious and announces that if he does so, she'll reveal the evidence of his past fraud. Smailey tries to weasel out of it, saying that [...] "Mrs. Van Brugh would admit the justice of his claim", and he gets Ruth to agree that if Mrs. Van Brugh makes a statement of her own free will, Ruth will <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass.</b> As Ruth leaves, Smailey rants about the injustice of his past sin being held over his head, whilst planning to condemn Mrs. Van Brugh for her past.|$|E

[...] Would it be possible to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up to that moment, would the beam splitter <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? Or, would it behave as though the second beam-splitter had always been there? Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it must have gone back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave. Note that Wheeler wanted to investigate several hypothetical statements by obtaining objective data.|$|E
2500|$|Once a bill passes, the {{governor}} has five days {{to make a decision}} to sign, veto, or <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> unsigned. [...] The question then became whether or not Governor Brewer would sign the bill into law, as she had remained silent on the measure while weighing the consequences. [...] Immigration had not been a prime focus of her political career up to this point, although as secretary of state she had supported Arizona Proposition 200 (2004). [...] As governor, she had made another push for Arizona Proposition 100 (2010), a one percent increase in the state sales tax to prevent cuts in education, health and human services, and public safety, despite opposition from within her own party. [...] These preceding [...] political moves, along with an upcoming tough Republican Party primary in the 2010 Arizona gubernatorial election from other conservative opponents supporting the bill, were all considered major factors in her decision. [...] During the bill's development, her staff had gone over its language line by line with State Senator Pearce, but she had also said she had concerns about several of its provisions. [...] The Mexican Senate urged {{the governor}} to veto the measure and the Mexican Embassy to the U.S. raised concerns about potential racial profiling that may result. Citizen messages to Brewer, however, were 3–1 in favor of the law. [...] A Rasmussen Reports poll taken between the House and Senate votes showed wide support for the bill among likely voters in the state, with 70percent in favor and 23percent opposed. [...] Of those same voters, 53percent were at least somewhat concerned that actions taken due to the measures in the bill would violate the civil rights of some American citizens. [...] Brewer's staff said that she was considering the legal issues, the impact on the state's business, and the feelings of the citizens in coming to her decision. [...] They added that [...] "she agonizes over these things," [...] and the governor also prayed over the matter. [...] Brewer's political allies said her decision would cause her political trouble no matter which way she decided. [...] Most observers expected that in the end, she would sign the bill, and on April 23 she did.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of phase singularities and coherence singularities in a Laguerre-Gauss beam that is rendered partially coherent by <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> through a spatial light modulator. The original beam has an onaxis minumum of intensity-a phase singularity-that transforms into a maximum of the far-field intensity. In contrast, although the original beam has no coherence singularities, such singularities are found to develop as the beam propagates. This disappearance of one kind of singularity and the gradual appearance of another is illustrated with numerical examples. © 2009 Optical Society of America...|$|R

50|$|Radiant {{barriers}} work {{in conjunction}} with an air space to reduce radiant heat transfer across the air space. Radiant or reflective insulation reflects heat instead of either absorbing <b>it</b> or <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> through. Radiant barriers are often seen used in reducing downward heat flow, because upward heat flow tends {{to be dominated by}} convection. This means that for attics, ceilings, and roofs, they are most effective in hot climates.They also have a role in reducing heat losses in cool climates. However, much greater insulation can be achieved through the addition of bulk insulators (see above).|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from the new {{electron}} bunch diagnostic tool, Optical Replica Synthesizer ORS, installed at FLASH. The ORS produces an optical replica of the electron bunch profile, which is analyzed with a GRENOUILLE, a device based on the Frequency Resolved Optical Gating FROG technique. This optical replica is generated by inducing a microbunching in the electron bunch and <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>pass</b> through an undulator, called a radiator. The radiator emits coherently at the wavelength of microbunching, 775 nm. In order to create the microbunching a laser pulse is spatially and temporally overlapped with the electron bunch in another undulator, placed before the radiator. This introduces an electron energy modulation which {{is transformed into a}} density modulation in a chicane before the microbunched electron bunch is sent into the radiator. We observed an optical replica pulse of approximately 5 amp; 956;J corresponding to an electron bunch spike of about 150 fs FWHM when the accelerator was set at optimal FEL conditions. We also showed that the ORS can run parasitically while maintaining SASE by steering the electron beam around the outcoupling mirror for the ORS pulse...|$|R
