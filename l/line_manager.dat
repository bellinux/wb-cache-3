Tomlinson's probationary period had been extended over the standard six-month duration due to his senior line manager's doubts about his personality. Tomlinson claimed that he had become suicidally depressed following the death of his long-term girlfriend from cancer and that he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress after witnessing violence against a civilian during the Siege of Sarajevo, and that MI6 had been ill-equipped to handle his condition. MI6 argued that he was dismissed for [...] "not being a team player, lacking motivation and having a short-term interest in the service", but later conceded that he had experienced a [...] "personality clash" [...] with his senior <b>line</b> <b>manager.</b> Another reason given for his dismissal was for [...] "going on frolics on his own". Tomlinson claims that no formal reason for his dismissal was ever given, and that he was mid-assignment when he suddenly found himself barred from entering MI6 headquarters. Friends suggested that he was sacked after he complained about MI6's [...] "unethical" [...] tactics. Tomlinson argued that his supervisors had unfairly disregarded his personal circumstances. Tomlinson disputed the reasons for and legality of his dismissal and attempted to take MI6 before an employment tribunal. However, MI6 obtained a public-interest immunity certificate from the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind. Having no further legal recourse to appeal against his dismissal, Tomlinson left the United Kingdom, and pursued his arguments against MI6 by publishing articles in the international press protesting his treatment, whilst working on a book detailing his career in the Service.|$|E

40|$|Under {{successive}} regimes {{since the}} early 1980 s, UK governments have called upon <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> to play {{a pivotal role in}} the development and enactment of public service reform. However, there is little empirical evidence from <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> themselves showing how the tensions and complexities inherent within modern public service reform agendas are experienced in practice. Drawing upon qualitative research involving <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> in three case study organizations, we suggest that rather than a wholesale shift towards an undifferentiated change agent role, <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> are in practice balancing three predominant, and often conflicting, roles as ‘entrepreneurial leader’, ‘government agent’ and ‘diplomat administrator’. Isomorphic pressures and persistent bureaucratic forms serve to limit the scope for <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> to contribute to service reform at much more than an operational level...|$|R
40|$|As {{managers}} {{with direct}} contact with workers on the floor, <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> are responsible for implementation of the performance appraisal system at Kansanshi Mining plc. Commonly, implementation of performance appraisal is affected by how <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> interact with their subordinates before, during and after an appraisal interview. Notably, no study has been conducted at Kansanshi mine to understand how <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> conduct performance appraisals since their introduction. This qualitative study aims to build {{an understanding of how}} <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> at Kansanshi conduct performance appraisal interviews and what enablers and barriers they face in this process. In pursuit of the research aim, <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> from all the ten departments of the mine were considered as eligible for the study. Using stratified random sampling, ten of the 30 <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> from all ten departments across the mine site were selected. A total of fifteen semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with ten <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> to gather data. These individual interviews were conducted on the mine site in the interviewees' offices as well as other convenient places such as the Kansanshi main boardroom. On average, each interview took between 45 to 60 minutes. All these interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and thereafter analyzed using open coding and constant comparison technique to induce themes. Findings of the study show a variety of barriers and enablers of <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> in their conduct of performance appraisal interviews at Kansanshi mine in Zambia. All ten <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> unanimously highlighted that (a) lack of clear job descriptions and set of individual targets as well as (b) lack of adequate refresher training on how to conduct performance appraisals affected how they conducted performance appraisals. Eight of the ten <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> highlighted that (c) perceived subjectivity of the system while seven of the ten highlighted that (d) predominant production focus and priority were barriers to them in how they conducted performance appraisals. On the other hand, ten <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> highlighted that (a) top management commitment to the implementation of a performance appraisal system, seven highlighted that (b) employees' hope for rewards and five <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> highlighted that (c) spring for career development and progression were perceived as enablers in their implementation of performance appraisals.

2500|$|While Jim Neidhart, Davey Boy Smith, and Owen Hart {{had flown}} out of Montreal with Bret, McMahon faced a major revolt in the WWF locker room. Most wrestlers were outraged {{at him and}} {{threatened}} to boycott Raw or leave the company altogether. McMahon addressed a meeting {{in an effort to}} mollify the wrestlers who had been outraged that a WWF veteran had been double-crossed by McMahon—many feared for their own future and were suspicious of McMahon. McMahon sought to explain that Hart had been disregarding the company's interests. By refusing to drop the title in Montreal, McMahon claimed Hart was jeopardizing the company's future by creating a potentially embarrassing situation that could affect its fortunes. The potential revolt was also quelled by Hart's counsel to wrestlers who asked him about boycotting Raw or leaving the company altogether. Hart advised them to fulfill their contractual obligations and not risk their own future over the episode. Both Sunny and Mick Foley did not attend the next night's Raw show, but returned to work after that due to their contract stipulations. Hart later commented in his autobiography that if Foley returned to WCW, he'd be committing career-suicide. Rick Rude, who was working there briefly as a story <b>line</b> <b>manager</b> for Michaels and was a real life friend of Hart's, called WCW and informed Eric Bischoff of what had transpired, and also returned to WCW two days after the events in Montreal mostly due to his disgust over Hart's treatment.

40|$|Based {{on social}} {{exchange}} theory, we investigate {{the impact of}} HRM investments made by two important HR actors, i. e. <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> and the HR department, on employees’ affective commitment. More specifically, we examine the independent and joint impact of three different independent variables: the <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> enactment of HR practices, the <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> relationsoriented leadership behaviour and the HR department’s service quality. We contribute to existing literature in two ways. First, we {{pay attention to the}} HRM role of <b>line</b> <b>managers,</b> a topic largely neglected in SHRM research. Second, we focus on perceived HRM rather than intended HRM, because this is seen as the driver of employees’ attitudinal and behavioural reactions.

The results of a moderated regression analysis indicate that <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> can enhance employee affective commitment by both the effective enactment of HR practices and good relations-oriented leadership behaviour.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the quality of the {{implemented}} HRM is crucial for the success of an organization’s HRM policy rather than the intended HRM or the mere presence of HR practices, (Boxall & Macky, 2009). As one of the key implementers of HRM in today’s organizations, line managers’ effectiveness in executing HR practices is indispensible to achieve an effective HRM implementation in the organization (Purcell & Hutchinson, 2007). However, few empirical studies have focused on this issue. We want to narrow this research gap by identifying antecedents of line managers’ HRM implementation effectiveness. More specifically, we investigate whether a strong HRM system characterized by distinct, consistent and consensual messages – as described by Bowen and Ostroff (2004) – enhances line managers’ ability, motivation and opportunity to implement HR practices, and whether this will in turn improve their effectiveness in HRM implementation. We collected data from 148 <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> and 1147 non-managerial employees in 4 Belgian organizations. The distinctiveness, consistency and consensus of the HRM system, as well as the <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> ability, motivation and opportunity to perform HR practices are judged by the <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> in our sample. The <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> effectiveness in HRM implementation is assessed by the <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> subordinates. Preliminary results from a multilevel path model show that ability, motivation and opportunity have to be present simultaneously to positively impact on line managers’ HRM implementation effectiveness. Furthermore, the distinctiveness, consistency and consensus of the HRM system are related to the <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> ability, motivation and opportunity. Considering these results, we argue that appropriate attention should be paid to create strong HRM systems that can subsequently support <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> in implementing strong people management systems. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The HR role of <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> {{is highly}} {{discussed}} and criticized but little empirically researched. It {{is argued that}} <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> {{are not able to}} effectively implement HR practices because {{they do not have the}} desire, capacity and competences needed to perform well and lack support and policies & procedures to effectively implement HRM on the work floor. This thesis did measure the effect of these five constraints on line managers’ HR implementation effectiveness by first identifying the relevant HR constraints for the line management by interviews, then developing a research instrument to measure the five constraints and finally to measure the effect of these constraints on line managers’ HR implementation effectiveness, taking organisational differences into consideration. Subordinates evaluated their <b>line</b> <b>manager’s</b> HR implementation as effective. However, the more motivated <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> are to perform HR practices, the worse they are perceived in performing such tasks on the work floor. When being motivated to execute HR the way they should, <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> stick to HR guidelines and rules and hence lack the necessary room for maneuver and freedom in applying HR practices according to their own benefits. Somewhat surprisingly, only line managers’ HR-related competences increased the effectiveness of HR implementation, while their capacity, support and policy & procedures did not significantly affect HR implementation effectiveness. Although case studies have identified five factors that can contribute to explaining the ineffectiveness of <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> when it comes to HR implementation, in fact these factors, with the exception of the line managers’ self-perceived competences, by and large do not explain or predict line management effectiveness.

40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> {{accepting}} {{a degree of}} people management responsibility {{is not a new}} phenomenon. However, a key trend in the contemporary management literature has been to increasingly assign formal responsibility for people management to the line management function (Harris et al., 2002; Whittaker and Marchington, 2003; Mesner Andolsek and Stebe 2005 and Cascon-Periera et al., 2005). The rationale for involving <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> in HRM is derived from a strategic approach to align HR strategies with the business needs and to address factors from both the internal and external environments which impact on HRM requirements. The practice of devolution has increasingly received recognition in the management literature, to the degree that it “is now received wisdom” (Holt Larsen and Brewster, 2003 : 228).

This includes identifying what role <b>line</b> <b>managers</b> play in the execution of HR strategy and exploring how, and to what degree, devolvement of HRM is occurring.
