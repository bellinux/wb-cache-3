5|$|A {{vote was}} taken after a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered {{from two to}} seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations {{voted in favor of}} independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

25|$|Just after 01:00, 3 April, the Japanese {{commenced}} a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> aerial resistance. At 01:42, Prichett, having beaten off several attacks, {{was closed}} by two bogies. The first veered off, {{but the second}} pressed on and dropped a 500-pound bomb on the fantail. Exploding close under the counter, it holed the destroyer below the waterline, causing flooding aft and {{a fire in the}} 20 mm. clipping room. The crippled destroyer, maintaining a speed in excess of 28knots to minimize flooding and bringing the fire under control, remained in the area and continued to ward off enemy planes until relieved shortly before noon. She then retired to Kerama Retto for emergency repairs. On the 7th, she got underway for Guam where repairs were completed, and on 7 May she returned to Okinawa and radar picket duties. For almost 3 months she escaped further serious damage. However, on 29 July, while standing by a kamikaze victimshe became the target of a second suicide-minded Japanese pilot. Prichett took him under fire at 5,000 yards, but he bore on. Splashed into the sea approximately 6feet off the destroyer's port side, his mission was partially accomplished as his lethal cargo exploded on impact, bowing in the ship's hull and causing extensive damage to her superstructure, port depth charge racks, and radio and power leads. Prichett, despite her damage, remained in the area and for another two hours continued to pick up survivors from Callaghan.|$|E

Rogen said: [...] "I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have {{to see if that}} is uplifting for women." [...] Apatow attempted to discredit Heigl's criticisms, chalking up her harsh words to exhaustion {{at the end of a}} <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> interviews and stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl. [...] "You would think at some point I'd get a call saying she was sorry, that she was tired, and then the call never comes." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 13:20, {{ten minutes}} before the agreed to ending of the bombardment, Deyo, seeing that the mission was not accomplished, {{signaled}} VII Corps, [...] "Do you wish more gunfire? Several enemy batteries still active." [...] The Querqueville battery had come to life again and taken Murphy under fire, straddling the destroyer four times in twenty minutes. Tuscaloosa came to her aid, scoring a direct hit bringing flames. With her deck covered with splinters and splashes from near misses, Murphy dodged behind a smoke screen. Ellyson and Gherardi joined in. Quincy fired for half an hour, then Nevada silenced the battery again. Later, as the task force withdrew, the battery opened fire again. More than its endurance, the task force upper decks noted its <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> near-misses. The battery near Gruchy came to life again. HMS Glasgow and Rodman returned fire. The batteries in and around Cherbourg seemed able to fire accurately at any ship within [...] Rodman pulled out of range.|$|E
