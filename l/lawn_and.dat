5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt by Marge {{to win the}} money on the game show Jeopardy!, the Simpsons arrive home to find {{everyone}} in Springfield gathered on their <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> Marge thinks they have forgiven them.

5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the <b>Lawn</b> <b>and</b> the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West <b>Lawn,</b> <b>and</b> Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house faces an area of <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> ornamental shrubbery. To the south east is a pathway to a pergola, {{in front of a}} terrace garden, with a paved walkway through topiary.

5|$|A local {{department}} store announces {{the formation of}} a new August holiday called Love Day intended to boost sales. The Simpsons celebrate it, but the vast amount of packaging it produces causes the garbage to build up. When Homer takes it out, he fails {{to make it to the}} curb in time. As the garbage men drive away without collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's garbage service being cut off. Garbage gradually piles up on their front <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the garbage men.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Pastafarians in Crossville, Tennessee, were {{permitted}} to place a Flying Spaghetti Monster statue in a free speech zone on the courthouse <b>lawn,</b> <b>and</b> proceeded to do so. The display gained national interest on blogs and online news sites and was even covered by Rolling Stone magazine. It was later removed from the premises, {{along with all the}} other long-term statues, {{as a result of the}} controversy over the statue. In December 2011, Pastafarianism was one of the multiple denominations given equal access to placing holiday displays on the Loudoun County courthouse lawn, in Leesburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, {{enclosing}} the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.|$|E

The bridge design by Renzo Piano, the architect of the Modern Wing, was inspired by the hull of a boat.|$|E
5|$|Wrigley Square is {{a public}} square located in the {{northwest}} section of Millennium Park in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District of the Loop area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The square {{is located at the}} southeast corner of the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan Avenue. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Roman Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park, near Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street, between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> a public fountain.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during this}} time fraternities began to {{purchase}} and construct houses. During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses; instead, they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds, such as Dawson's Row near the <b>Lawn</b> <b>and</b> boarding houses north of the university. In 1908, the university's Board of Visitors first offered a land lease and a $12,000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house, and many other fraternities followed. Most of these were located {{just north of the}} Rotunda, on Rugby Road, Madison Lane, University Place, and the surrounding streets. Some of these houses cost up to $20,000 to build, and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences of the Old South, using elements of Jeffersonian architecture. Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area, with Zeta Psi's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington, and Phi Kappa Psi's house modeled after Carr's Hill. By 1916 most fraternities had built, purchased, or rented a house for their members.|$|E

5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
5|$|The {{gardens are}} Grade II* {{listed on the}} Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The gardens of the house were also created {{in line with the}} Arts and Crafts movement, {{providing}} food for the house. Influenced strongly by Margaret Bidulph, who had studied at Studley Horticultural College, where she had met her future head gardener William Scrubey. Scrubey and Margaret Biddulph would go on to plant the gardens together. The terrace and gardens south to the south of the house include yew hedges to create specific spaces, mixed with Portuguese laurels and roses, giving the impression of exterior rooms next to the house. Nearby is an area of topiary, clipped in domes and tiers. At {{the far end of the}} south terrace is a ha-ha, leading to a cherry orchard and tennis courts, although only one tennis court remains, the others have been converted in a croquet <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|The {{temple and}} villa {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} Garrick's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98. It was subsequently bought by her solicitor, Thomas Carr, who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare. It changed hands several more times until, in 1923, the villa was converted into apartments. The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize, who built a three-storey house alongside the temple. This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize's Temple House could be demolished. The <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> temple were subsequently opened to the public. They have remained in public ownership ever since.|$|E

5|$|Wrigley Square is {{a public}} square located in the {{northwest}} corner of Millennium Park near the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan, across from the Historic Michigan Boulevard District. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Greek Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large <b>lawn</b> <b>and</b> a public fountain. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed $5million for the monument and square, which was named in its honor. The pedestal of the Millennium Monument's peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors who made the 91 contributions of at least $1million each to help pay for Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|Route 4 {{had several}} former spur routes that existed {{prior to the}} 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. Route 4N was {{designated}} in 1939 from the portion of pre-1927 Route 4 between Brielle and Eatontown; it is now Route 71. Route S4 was defined in 1927 {{to run to the}} Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy from present-day Route 35; it was eventually extended to the Garden State Parkway and this route is now Routes 440 and 184. Route S4A was planned in 1927 to run from Atlantic City across swamps to Tuckerton; {{only a small portion of}} this route was built and it is now Route 87. Route S4B was planned in 1929 to run Route 4 near Paterson northwest to the New York border, replacing a portion of what was legislated as Route 3 in 1927. The portion of this route that was built between Fair <b>Lawn</b> <b>and</b> Oakland is now Route 208. Route S4D was a never built spur in Teaneck proposed in 1938; the proposal was renumbered Route 303. Route 4A was created by the 1940s following a realignment of Route 4 (and U.S. Route 9) between Freehold and Cheesequake; it became Route 79 and a portion of Route 34 in 1953. Route 4 Parkway was planned in 1946 as a northsouth parkway running from Cape May north to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in Clifton, bridging the gap that existed along Route 4 between Rahway and Paterson; this proposal became Route 444 (Garden State Parkway). Route S4C was a planned route running from Route 4 in Bennett south to Cape May; the general alignment of this route is now Route 162 and Cape May County Route 626.|$|E
