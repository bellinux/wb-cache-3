The first {{limitation}} {{is the absence of}} a control group; the second is the lack of collected descriptive data for some of the outcomes (e.g. headache and migraine episodes, moderate/severe headache days, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire). The choice to not collect excessive descriptive data has been made to increase the compliance of our patients in fulfilling the diaries. In fact, usually patients report in diaries only information related to headache days, migraine days, day of utilization of drug and any adverse event. Similarly, the primary end point of the pooled data of PREEMPT was the frequency of headache days, which is considered more sensitive than headache episodes and fulfills recently proposed clinical trial guidelines for evaluating headache prophylaxis in CM (Silberstein et al. 2008). Another limitation is the absence of data about the length of time of effectiveness of treatment within the 3  months: in fact, we calculated the headache days, migraine days, and medication intake days as a mean of the overall days reported by the patients in the previous 3  months, without considering single months or weeks as outcome measures.

40|$|Automatic facial action unit (AU) {{detection}} {{from video}} is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Two main approaches have been pursued: (1) static modeling—typically posed as a discriminative classification problem {{in which each}} video frame is evaluated independently; (2) temporal modeling—frames are segmented into sequences and typically modeled with a variant of dynamic Bayesian networks. We propose a segment-based approach, kSeg-SVM, that incorporates benefits of both approaches and avoids their limitations. kSeg-SVM is a temporal extension of the spatial bag-of-words. kSeg-SVM is trained within a structured output SVM framework that formulates AU detection as a problem of detecting temporal events in a time series of visual features. Each segment is modeled by {{a variant of the}} BoW representation with soft assignment of the words based on similarity. Our framework has several benefits for AU detection: (1) both dependencies between features and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> units are modeled; (2) all possible segments of the video may be used for training; and (3) no assumptions are required about the underlying structure of the action unit events (e. g., i. i. d.).

40|$|SummaryBackgroound and objectivesBotulinum toxin (BTX) {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent {{bacterial}} toxins known and its effectiveness in the treatment of some pain syndromes is well known. However, the efficacy of some of its indications is still in the process of being confirmed. The objective of this study was to review the history, pharmacological properties, and clinical applications of BTX in the treatment of pain of different origins. ContentsBotulinum toxin is produced by fermentation of Clostridium botulinum, a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium. Commercially, BTX comes in two presentations, types A and B. Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin with high affinity for cholinergic synapses, blocks the release of acetylcholine by nerve endings without interfering with neuronal conduction of electrical signals or synthesis and storage of acetylcholine. It has been proven that BTX can selectively weaken painful muscles, interrupting the spasm-pain cycle. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of BTX-A in the treatment of tension headaches, migraines, chronic lumbar pain, and myofascial pain. ConclusionsBotulinum toxin type A is well tolerated in the treatment of chronic pain disorders in which pharmacotherapy regimens can cause side effects. The reduction in the consumption of analgesics and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of 3 to 4 months per dose represent other advantages of its use. However, further studies are necessary to establish the efficacy of BTX-A in chronic pain disorders and its exact mechanism of action, as well as its potential in multifactorial treatments...|$|E

40|$|Online 4 Oct 2012 Introduction: Current succesful AGC (Accurate Glycemic Control) {{protocols}} require extra clinical {{effort and}} are impractical in less acute wards where patients are still susceptible to stress-induced hyperglycemia. Long-acting insulin Glargine {{has the potential}} to be used in a low effort controller. However, potential variability in efficacy and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> prevent direct in-hospital use in an AGC framework for less acute wards. Method: Clinically validated virtual trials based on data from stable ICU patients from the SPRINT cohort who would be transferred to such an approach are used to develop a 24 -hour AGC protocol robust to different Glargine potencies (1. 0 x, 1. 5 x and 2. 0 x regular insulin) and initial dose sizes (dose = total insulin over prior 12, 18 and 24 hours). Glycemic control in this period is provided only by varying nutritional inputs. Performance is assessed as %BG in the 4. 0 - 8. 0 mmol/L band and safety by %BG< 4. 0 mmol/L. Results: The final protocol consisted of Glargine bolus size equal to insulin over the previous 18 hours. Compared to SPRINT there was a 6. 9 % - 9. 5 % absolute decrease in mild hypoglycemia (%BG< 4. 0 mmol/L) and up to a 6. 2 % increase in %BG between 4. 0 and 8. 0 mmol/L. When the efficacy is known (1. 5 x assumed) there were reductions of: 27 % BG measurements, 59 % insulin boluses, 67 % nutrition changes, and 6. 3 % absolute in mild hypoglycemia. Conclusion: A robust 24 - 48 clinical trial has been designed to safely investigate the efficacy and kinetics of Glargine as a first step towards developing a Glargine-based protocol for less acute wards. Ensuring robustness to variability in Glargine efficacy significantly affects the performance and safety that can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Electrophysiological {{effects of}} endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) were studied in rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) using {{conventional}} microelectrode and whole-cell {{voltage and current}} recordings. In rabbit SAN, RT-PCR detected ETA endothelin receptor mRNA. ET− 1 (100 nm) increased the cycle <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> potentials (APs) from 305 ± 15 to 388 ± 25 ms; this effect was antagonised by the ETA receptor-selective antagonist BQ− 123 (1 μm). ET- 1 increased AP duration (APD 50) by 22 %, depolarised the maximum diastolic potential (MDP) from − 59 ± 1 to − 53 ± 2 mV, shifted the take-off potential by + 5 mV and decreased the pacemaker potential (PMP) slope by 15 %. Under exactly the same experimental conditions, ET- 1 caused a positive chronotropic effect in guinea-pig SAN with a decrease of 13 % in APD 50, a shift of − 4 mV in the take-off potential and an increase of 8 % in the PMP slope. Rabbit SAN exhibited two major cell types, distinguished both by their appearances and by their electrophysiological responses to ET- 1. Whereas the spontaneous pacing rate and the PMP slope were similarly decreased by ET- 1 (10 nm) in both cell types, ET- 1 depolarised MDP from − 67 ± 1 to − 62 ± 4 mV in spindle-shaped cells but hyperpolarised it from − 73 ± 1 to − 81 ± 3 mV in rod-shaped cells. ET- 1 decreased APD 50 by 8 and 52 % and shifted the take-off potential by + 5 and − 9 mV in spindle- and rod-shaped cells, respectively. ET- 1 decreased the high-threshold calcium current (ICaL) by about 50 % in both cell types, without affecting its voltage dependence, and decreased the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) with significant shifts (of + 4. 7 and + 14. 0 mV in spindle- and rod-shaped cells, respectively) in its voltage dependence. It was exclusively in rod-shaped cells that ET- 1 activated a sizeable amount of time-independent inward-rectifying current. The hyperpolarisation-activated current (If), observed exclusively in spindle-shaped cells, was significantly increased by ET- 1 at membrane potentials between − 74. 7 and − 84. 7 mV whereas it was significantly decreased at more negative potentials. ET− 1 significantly decreased {{the slope of the}} current-voltage (I–V) relation of the If tail without changing its half-maximum voltage.
