6000|$|But, my Lords, we {{all know}} that there has been {{arbitrary}} power in India,--that tyrants have usurped it,--and that, in some instances, princes otherwise meritorious have violated the liberties of the people, and have been lawfully deposed for such violation. I do not deny that there are robberies on Hounslow Heath,--that there are such things as forgeries, burglaries, and murders; but I say that these acts are against law, and that whoever commit them commit illegal acts. When a man is to defend himself against a charge of crime, it is not instances of similar violation of law that is to be the standard of his defence. A man may as well say, [...] "I robbed upon Hounslow Heath, but hundreds robbed there before me": to which I answer, [...] "The law has forbidden you to rob there; and I will hang you for having violated the law, notwithstanding the long list of similar violations which you have produced as precedents." [...] No doubt princes have violated the law of this country: they have suffered for it. Nobles have violated the law: their privileges have not protected them from punishment. Common people have violated the law: they have been hanged for it. I know no human being exempt from the law. The law is the security of the people of England; it is the security of the people of India; it is the security of every person that is governed, and of every person that governs. There is but one law for all, namely, that law which governs all law, the law of our Creator, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity,</b> justice, equity,--the Law of Nature and of Nations. So far as any laws fortify this primeval law, and give it more precision, more energy, more effect by their declarations, such laws enter into the sanctuary, and participate in the sacredness of its character. But the man who quotes as precedents the abuses of tyrants and robbers pollutes the very fountain of justice, destroys the foundations of all law, and thereby removes the only safeguard against evil men, whether governors or governed,--the guard which prevents governors from becoming tyrants, and the governed from becoming rebels.|$|E

I was {{speaking}} of your bodily condition. Well, sir, and how did I discover your bodily condition? Providentially for you I was driving home yesterday evening by the lower road (which is the road by the river bank), and, drawing near to the inn here (they call it a hotel; it's nothing but an inn), I heard the screeching of the landlady half a mile off. A good woman enough, you will understand, as times go; but a poor creature in any emergency. Keep still, I'm coming to it now. Well, I went in to see if the screeching related to anything wanted in the medical way; and there I found you and the stranger lady in a position which I may truthfully describe as standing in some need of improvement on the score of propriety. Tut! tut! I speak jocosely--you were both in a dead swoon. Having heard what the landlady had to tell me, and having, {{to the best of my}} ability, separated history from hysterics in the course of the woman's narrative, I found myself, as it were, placed between two laws. The law of gallantry, you see, pointed to the lady as the first object of my professional services, while the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> (seeing that you were still bleeding) pointed no less imperatively to you. I am no longer a young man: I left the lady to wait. My word! it was no light matter, Mr. Germaine, to deal with your case, and get you carried up here out of the way. That old wound of yours, sir, is not to be trifled with. I bid you beware how you open it again. The next time you go out for an evening walk and you see a lady in the water, you will do well for your own health to leave her there. What's that I see? Are you opening your mouth again? Do you want another sup already?" ...|$|E

She has shown that the dictum of the early political economists, that population has a tendency to increase faster than the means of subsistence, is no <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity,</b> but merely a tendency of the barbaric and ignorant man, which can be counteracted by increasing manifold by scientific means his powers of producing food. She has taught men, during the last few years, to foresee and elude the most destructive storms; {{and there is no reason}} for doubting, and many reasons for hoping, that she will gradually teach men to elude other terrific forces of nature, too powerful and too seemingly capricious for them to conquer. She has discovered innumerable remedies and alleviations for pains and disease. She has thrown such light on the causes of epidemics, that we are able to say now that the presence of cholera--and probably of all zymotic diseases--in any place, is usually a sin and a shame, for which the owners and authorities of that place ought to be punishable by law, as destroyers of their fellow- men; while for the weak, for those who, in the barbarous and semi-barbarous state--and out of that last we are only just emerging--how much has she done; an earnest of much more which she will do? She has delivered the insane--I may say by the scientific insight of one man, more worthy of titles and pensions than nine-tenths of those who earn them--I mean the great and good Pinel--from hopeless misery and torture into comparative peace and comfort, and at least the possibility of cure. For children, she has done much, or rather might do, would parents read and perpend such books as Andrew Combe's and those of other writers on physical education. We should not then see the children, even of the rich, done to death piecemeal by improper food, improper clothes, neglect of ventilation and the commonest measures for preserving health. We should not see their intellects stunted by Procrustean attempts to teach them all the same accomplishments, to the neglect, most often, of any sound practical training of their faculties. We should not see slight indigestion, or temporary rushes of blood to the head, condemned and punished as sins against Him who took up little children in His arms and blessed them.|$|E

40|$|The {{opportunity}} to create an international court that provides fair, equitable, and efficient justice is rare and important. It requires expertise in comparative and international law. Problems are serious, however. Failure to address the formidable problems could cause the Court to run a risk of failure that could be disastrous for international law, {{for the victims of}} the horrors that have occurred and that will occur, and for the world. Failure could come in at least two forms: (1) the Court could merely be a conduit for retribution after a pro-forma kangaroo court or (2) it will not have sufficient funding or expertise to prosecute fairly, justly, and efficiently, so that all or most of the perpetrators will escape justice, unless national or regional courts take action. International law may be disparaged as meaningless. The victims of the horrific violations <b>of</b> the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> will {{have to live with the}} knowledge that the perpetrators, who flaunted the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> in the most cruel ways, walk free. The perpetrators and their victims know that fact. The cause of justice and international law or the cause of an international criminal court or set of courts could be set back badly. This point is not to suggest that we should not go forward with prosecuting those who commit atrocities. Rather, we should not do so to make us feel good, but to succeed. Failure could harm not only values that we all hold to be important, but also could weaken international <b>law.</b> The danger <b>of</b> failure is a mockery <b>of</b> international <b>law</b> giving impetus to those who suggest that it is not law at all!

40|$|This paper {{purports to}} explore the nature <b>of</b> crimes against <b>{{humanity}}</b> as a unique family of crimes and how the concept <b>of</b> crimes against <b>humanity</b> embodies the spirit of our time.

Doing so, it will first demonstrate how the concept <b>of</b> crimes against <b>humanity</b> bears out the truth that the norm <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> is a legal norm; humanity is a possible object of legal injury and a legitimate subject to which action is held accountable for. It then examines the four basic features <b>of</b> crimes against <b>humanity,</b> indicating that a crime against humanity is a global crime that is motivated to injure humanity, policy-laden, and systematic.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} as the Second Friedrich Martens Memorial Lecture inMay 2007. It takes a critical view of the current frequent reference to custom as asource <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> armed conflict and suggests {{that in many cases}} one shouldmore properly speak of the general principles <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> While some norms of the lawof armed conflict may not necessarily reflect “general practice accepted as law”,they may still be recognized as binding on account of their inner force and on thebasis of what may be referred to as communis opinio juris. The author advances the view that the existence of such communis opinio can beestablished by means of a threefold test. Thus, in order to be considered a principleof the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> armed conflict, a norm must (1) have a modicum of support on thepart of States, for instance {{in the shape of a}} reflection in military manuals, (2) reflect widely recognized core values <b>of</b> <b>humanity,</b> and (3) enjoy broad support ininformed international discourse (e. g., in Red Cross and Red Crescent conferences,in academic circles etc.). These requirements reflect, in effect, the three sourceslisted cumulatively in the Martens Clause: “the usages established among civilisednations, the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity,</b> and the dictates of the public conscience. ...|$|R

At the time of publication, anti-Japanese sentiments had not yet been suppressed, and the US and Russia were competing in a nuclear arms race during the Cold War.
