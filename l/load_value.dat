40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} the retention loads of differently fabricated secondary telescopic polyetheretherketone (PEEK) crowns on cobalt-chromium primary crowns with different tapers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cobalt-chromium primary crowns with 0 °, 1 °, and 2 ° tapers were constructed, milled, and sintered. Corresponding secondary crowns were fabricated by milling, pressing from pellets, and pressing from granules. For these nine test groups, the pull-off tests of each crown combination were performed 20 times, and the retention loads were measured (Zwick 1445, 50 mm/min). Data {{were analyzed using}} linear regression, covariance analysis, mixed models, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U-test, together with the Benferroni-Holm correction. RESULTS The mixed models covariance analysis reinforced stable retention <b>load</b> <b>values</b> (p = 0. 162) for each single test sequence. There was no interaction between the groups and the separation cycles (p = 0. 179). Milled secondary crowns with 0 ° showed the lowest mean retention <b>load</b> <b>values</b> compared to all tested groups (p = 0. 003) followed by those pressed form pellets with 1 °. Regarding the different tapers, no effect of manufacturing method on the results was observed within 1 ° and 2 ° groups (p = 0. 540; p = 0. 052); however, among the 0 ° groups, the milled ones showed significantly the lowest retention <b>load</b> <b>values</b> (p = 0. 002). Among the manufacturing methods, both pressed groups showed no impact of taper on the retention <b>load</b> <b>values</b> (p > 0. 324 and p > 0. 123, respectively), whereas among the milled secondary crowns, the 0 ° taper showed significantly lower retention <b>load</b> <b>values</b> than the 1 ° and 2 ° taper (p < 0. 002). CONCLUSION Based on these results, telescopic crowns made of PEEK seem to show stable retention <b>load</b> <b>values</b> for each test sequence; however, data with thermo-mechanical aging are still required. In addition, further developments in CAD/CAM manufacturing of PEEK materials for telescopic crowns are warranted, especially for 0 °...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{contemporary}} microprocessor design {{attempt to}} expose additional instruction level parallelism (ILP), data value speculation {{has become a}} mainstream microarchitectural feature. Many different value speculation techniques have been proposed. The goals are to both achieve a high prediction rate, while predicting values for critical instructions. One key issue is how value-based speculation affects other prediction mechanisms present in the pipeline. This paper investigates the impact of <b>load</b> <b>value</b> misprediction on branch resolution. We examine the behavior of branches that are speculatively issued using wrong data due to <b>load</b> <b>value</b> mispredictions in a pipeline where both branch prediction and <b>load</b> <b>value</b> prediction mechanisms are present. We have developed an execution-driven simulator and have found that for the suite of benchmarks studied, avoiding unnecessary pipeline flushes triggered by branches that resolved using wrong speculative data values increased performance by 2. 1 % on average.

40|$|Abstract — An {{increasing}} cache latency in next-generation processors incurs profound performance impacts {{in spite}} of advanced out-of-order execution techniques. One way to circumvent this cache latency problem is to predict load values {{at the onset of}} pipeline execution by exploiting either the <b>load</b> <b>value</b> locality or the address correlation of stores and loads. In this paper, we describe a new <b>load</b> <b>value</b> speculation mechanism based on the program syntax correlation of stores and loads. We establish a Symbolic Cache (SC), which is accessed in early pipeline stages to achieve a zero-cycle load. Instead of using memory addresses, the SC is accessed by the encoding bits of base register ID plus the displacement directly from the instruction code. Performance evaluations using SPEC 95 and SPEC 2000 integer programs on SimpleScalar simulation tools show that the SC achieves higher prediction accuracy in comparison with other <b>load</b> <b>value</b> speculation methods, especially when hardware resources are limited.

A <b>load</b> <b>value</b> predictor is an architectural enhancement which speculates over {{the results of}} a micro-processor load instruction to speedup the execution of the following instructions. The proposed architectural enhancement differs from a classic predictor due to an improved selection scheme that allows to activate the predictor only when a miss occurs in the first level of cache. We analyze the effectiveness of the selective predictor in terms of overall energy reduction and performance improvement. To this end, we show how the proposed predictor can produce benefits (in terms of overall cost) when the cache size of the SMT architecture is reduced and we compare it with a classic non-selective <b>load</b> <b>value</b> prediction scheme.

40|$|Approximate {{computing}} {{recognizes that}} many applications can tolerate inexactness. These applications, {{which range from}} multimedia processing to machine learning, operate on inherently noisy and imprecise data. As a result, we can tradeoff some loss in output value integrity for improved processor performance and energy-efficiency. In this paper, we introduce <b>load</b> <b>value</b> approximation. In modern processors, upon a load miss in the private cache, the data must be retrieved from main memory or from the higher-level caches. These data accesses are costly {{both in terms of}} latency and energy. We implement <b>load</b> <b>value</b> approximators, which are hardware structures that learn value patterns and generate approximations of the data. The processor can then use these approximate data values to continue executing without incurring the high cost of accessing memory. We show that <b>load</b> <b>value</b> approximators can achieve high coverage while maintaining very low error in the application’s output. By exploiting the approximate nature of applications, we can draw closer to the ideal memory access latency. 1...|$|E
