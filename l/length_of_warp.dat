50|$|The warp-weighted loom is a {{vertical}} loom {{that may have}} originated in the Neolithic period. The earliest evidence of warp-weighted looms comes from sites belonging to the Starčevo culture in modern Serbia and Hungary and from late Neolithic sites in Switzerland. This loom was used in Ancient Greece, and spread north and west throughout Europe thereafter. Its defining characteristic is hanging weights (loom weights) which keep bundles <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> threads taut. Frequently, extra warp thread is wound around the weights. When a weaver has reached the bottom <b>of</b> the available <b>warp,</b> the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> threads can be unwound from the weights to continue.

40|$|Yarns <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> beams to knit on warp {{knitting}} machines {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead to produce valleys and ridges <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> yarns on the beam and hence different <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>warp</b> yarns. These length variations lead to loop length variations in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted.

Michelson wanted the engine room to seem vast, a difficult effect to achieve on a small sound stage.

40|$|The Goldberger-Wise {{mechanism}} enables one {{to stabilize}} the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warped</b> extra dimension employed in Randall-Sundrum models. In this work we generalize this mechanism to models with multiple warped throats sharing a common ultraviolet brane. For independent throats this generalization is straight forward. If the throats possess a discrete interchange symmetry like Z_n the stabilizing dynamics may respect the symmetry, resulting in equal throat lengths, or they may break it. In the latter case the ground state of an initially symmetric configuration is a stabilized asymmetric configuration in which the throat lengths differ. We focus on two- (three-) throat setups with a Z_ 2 (Z_ 3) interchange symmetry and present stabilization dynamics suitable for either breaking or maintaining the symmetry. Though admitting more general application, our results are relevant for existing models in the literature, including the two throat model with Kaluza-Klein parity and the three throat model of flavor based on a broken Z_ 3 symmetry.

40|$|As {{a textile}} {{artist in the}} 21 st century, I {{continue}} to aspire to make art objects that are unique and timely, characteristic of my individual sensibility and experience. Using the latest digital tools - including the TC 1 (2) Single Thread Control loom - I strive to animate my woven forms through material interaction and a distinctive touch built on a foundation of research and practice - based in digital and hand craft. In my weavings I explore relationships of abstract systems created with traditional and innovative textile coloring techniques, material contrasts, and the generative processing of the computer and digital loom. Some of these systems or patterns are mathematically precise - hard-edged and geometric - formed through the mechanical operation of the loom with its underlying matrix of perpendicular threads. Other motifs evolve {{through the application of}} color selectively applied to the threads (through painting or dye resists) prior to weaving, often in conjunction with the manipulation of threads inserted in the weft during the weaving process. The development of the relationships of these multiple networks is done on the computer where I make color decisions, design weave structures and determine compositional strategies. The final topography of pattern that emerges through the physical interlacement <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> and weft threads establishes a visual and textural complexity that results from this multi-faceted orchestration. The transition from the virtual to the material engagement heightens my focus on the unique aspects of the process of weaving which marks time along the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> as the linear elements unite and are transformed into a continuous field of pattern. Awareness of this evolution, allows me to develop a stronger relationship with the piece under construction, enhancing my sensibility for this distinctive language in a concrete and poetic way...|$|R
40|$|My art {{practice}} {{revolves around}} {{an interest in}} abstract systems and digital design {{in combination with the}} mechanical, mathematical, and material aspects of weaving. The process of weaving conjures images of the sequential mapping of linear time along the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warp,</b> while designing on the computer implies speed and layering as in circular time. These two concepts are integrated in the construction and visual interpretation of my woven work. Using the generative capabilities of the computer, sharply defined and regular patterns of shapes are integrated with more organic and seemingly random systems. Their interplay seeks a balance that emerges from both logic and imagination. The construction of the weaving requires the use <b>of</b> two <b>warp</b> systems to adequately represent these multiple networks. Each is hand painted with one of the patterns from the design and then threaded onto the loom. Other compositional motifs will be programmed into the loom and revealed through the weaving process as warp and weft are united into a single planar cloth. The intersection of structural and visual systems creates a topography of overlaid patterns of different scale and clarity. Achieving this quality of complexity requires concentrated skill and disciplined work in harmony with the process of weaving. The finished object reveals its poetic essence through sustained viewing as the layers of information slowly distinguish themselves as rhythms of the whole.

40|$|A weaving {{drawdown}} is {{a rectangular}} grid {{of black and}} white squares with at least one black and one white square in each row and column. A pattern results from vertical and horizontal translations of the defining grid. Any such grid defines a tiling pattern.

This article addresses that issue, along with a discussion of binary representations of fabric structures. The article also catalogs all weaving (or tiling) patterns defined by grids having three distinct columns and three to six distinct rows, and groups these patterns into design families based on weaving symmetries. 1 Introduction.

This was the Putting-out system that survived in weaving long after the factory system was normal for spinning. He had commercial connections with Arkwright and with Drinkwater. To obtain yarn he opened a mill in 1791 at the Carrs, on the Tin Brook and a large mill at Mellor. The combination of a good water power site (described by Rodgers as [...] "by far the finest of any site within the lowland" [...] the Manchester region [...] ) and a large female and child workforce [...] used to textile factory work meant Stockport was well placed {{to take advantage of}} the phenomenal expansion in cotton processing in the late 18th century. Warren's mill in the market place was the first. Power came from an undershot water wheel in a deep pit, fed by a tunnel from the River Goyt. [...] In 1796, James Harrisson drove a wide cut from the Tame which fed several mills in the Park, Portwood.; Ashmore (1975). In 1786, Henry Marsland gained water rights to erect another mill adjacent to the 55 yd by 12 yd Park silk mill which he already owned. The two Carrs silk mills had converted to cotton before 1785, and the larger silk mills such as Park and Logwood followed.|$|R
