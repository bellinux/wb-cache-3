5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 7 September, the Pakistan Navy {{launched}} its assault on Western Indian shores. Dwarka was chosen for its proximity (200km from Karachi Port), its lower defences and historical relevance. The plan called for a fleet of 7 naval vessels of Pakistan to bomb {{the tiny town of}} Dwarka. It was aimed at luring the heavy ships anchored in Bombay into attacking the Pakistani ships. The intention was that the submarine PNS Ghazi <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arabian Sea would then engage and sink the Indian ships. Accordingly, a fleet of seven ships comprising PNS Babur, PNS Khaibar, PNS Badr, PNS Jahangir, PNS Alamgir, PNS Shah Jahan and PNS Tipu Sultan set sail for Dwarka and bombarded the town.|$|E

25|$|Smooth plains {{material}} (unit ps) {{forms the}} vast expanses of Borealis and Suisei Planitiae, {{as well as}} most basin and crater floors. It is the most extensive stratigraphic unit in the Borealis region, covering 30 percent of the mapped area. The surface of the smooth plains material is rather sparsely cratered compared to that of the intercrater plains material. Wrinkle ridges are common. Both the floor of the Goethe Basin and the younger craters (now observed as buried craters) superposed on it are mantled by smooth plains material; the unit also fills ghost and flooded craters that are common on both Borealis and Suisei Planitiae and resemble the lunar crater Archimedes. The enormous volume of smooth plains material that must underlie Borealis Planitia in order to bury pre-existing topography, as well as the presence of the material in basin and crater floors, suggest that the smooth plains material was emplaced in a fluidized state as volcanic lava flows (Murray and others, 1974). Even though flow fronts cannot be unambiguously mapped on Borealis Planitia, further evidence of the unit's volcanic origin is supplied by its overlap onto intercrater plains material, best observed along the west edge of Borealis Planitia (FDS 85, 152, 153, 156, and 160). The various types of plains material recognized on Mercury exhibit little tonal contrast. The albedo of smooth plains material is higher than that of lunar mare material (Hapke and others, 1975). The similarity in albedo between mercurian smooth plains material and lunar light plains material led Wilhelms to extend the analogy to composition: he suggested that both units consist of impact ejecta similar to the lunar Cayley Formation sampled by Apollo 16. Wilhelms even hypothesized that the source basin for material of the extensive plains of Borealis Planitia “could well be <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness beyond the terminator.” A fuller discussion of the problem is given by Strom.|$|E

One of the likely models for Le Chiffre was the influential English occultist, astrologer, mystic and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, on whose physical features Fleming based Le Chiffre's. Crowley's tastes, especially in sado-masochism, were also ascribed to Le Chiffre; as Fleming's biographer Henry Chancellor notes, [...] "when Le Chiffre goes to work on Bond's testicles with a carpet-beater and a carving knife, the sinister figure of Aleister Crowley is there <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{covers of}} The Nancy Drew Files and Girl Detective series {{represent}} further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy.

Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous." [...] In the Girl Detective series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip {{across the top of the}} cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of The Secret of the Old Clock.|$|E

500|$|Music {{columnist}} Everett True {{referred to}} [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] as [...] "the most unsettling thing I've heard since Patti Smith uncovered [...] "Piss Factory"... only it's way more personal." [...] In the 1995 book The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll, music scholars Simon Reynolds and Joy Press {{reflected on the}} track, writing: [...] ""Teenage Whore" [...] turns the lowliest member of rock society, the groupie, into the ultimate (anti) heroine. Love rasps out an unclassifiable alloy of growling defiance and retching disgust, while Hole's torturous music grinds out her humiliation and hatred with a creakiness that betrays how long this howl has been <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of the throat." [...] Cultural theorist Jan Jagodzinski also reads the song as the narrative of a groupie and representing a [...] "desublimated ugly aesthetic of the abjected mother." [...] In The Rough Guide to Rock, the song is noted as [...] "coercing the listener into Love's anguish" [...] as well as representing the band's early stylistic choices and aesthetic, characterized by [...] "drone" [...] and featuring [...] "poetic turns of phrase." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 1776, the Continental Congress {{voted to}} give Moore a {{commission}} as a brigadier {{general in the}} Continental Army, and placed him in command {{of all of the}} regular army forces in North Carolina. [...] Moore was one of only five North Carolinians to achieve the rank of brigadier general or higher in the Continental Army. [...] As a brigadier, he served under General Charles Lee, commander of the army's Southern Department, and was tasked with guarding Wilmington from attacks by British ships <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cape Fear area after the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. [...] In that capacity, Moore alternately harassed and observed the British and their Loyalist auxiliaries while simultaneously improving Wilmington's defenses by erecting two new coastal batteries, and by sinking ships in the main channel of the Cape Fear River south of the city to bar passage by larger vessels. [...] In April and May 1776, some British units from the approximately 7,000-strong force of General Henry Clinton disembarked near Wilmington, and threatened to confront Moore's garrison of 1,847 men. [...] Clinton soon decided that North Carolina was not an ideal objective, and the majority of the British fleet and army made its way south to Charleston on May 30, 1776.|$|E
500|$|By being {{composed}} using {{nothing more}} than a Rhodes piano, a vocal sample, and turntable scratches, [...] "Everything I Am" [...] stands as the third studio album's most minimalistic production. West marries a down-tempo beat to gentle piano chords which are accentuated by soulful cooing sampled from [...] "If We Can't Be Lovers" [...] by Prince Phillip Mitchell. The low-key track has a scratched hook by DJ Premier formed with the vocal sample, which contains the line, [...] "Here we go again", that is lifted from [...] "Bring the Noise" [...] by Public Enemy. With its thick, heavy bass-line pattern, [...] "The Glory" [...] is an up-tempo number which revisits the [...] "chipmunk-soul" [...] that once defined Kanye's early production style. It displays a sped-up and high-pitched vocal sample of [...] "Save The Country" [...] by Laura Nyro accompanied by uplifting strings, keys, and an all-male gospel choir. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin sings the chorus and supplies a gospel-style piano motif while West raps over heavy yet buoyant drums on [...] "Homecoming." [...] The chatter of a noisy, cheering crowd can inexplicably be heard <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background throughout the track. The Jay-Z ode [...] "Big Brother" [...] begins with West uttering the words, [...] "Stadium status...," [...] backed by a string orchestra, pounding drums, a distorted guitar riff and plinking piano keys. Around mid-verse, the track adopts synths that mimic the melodies of the string section. Before the second verse, additional instrumentation enters; including a heavy bass-line, metallic percussion, and 808-handclaps. The studio album's final track [...] "Good Night" [...] exhibits the production characteristics of West's next musical evolution. West juxtaposes the glitchy, mechanical sound of an 8-bit beat with the more elegant, traditional sound of a classical piano.|$|E
