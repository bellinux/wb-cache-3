40|$|Forest {{enterprises}} {{have always}} searched {{for ways to}} improve efficiency. For {{the past few years}} there has been an emphasis on stock-keeping levels. Increased demand for fresh round timber and the need to decrease the amount of tied-up capital has made the forest industry reduce its inventory levels. This has brought on a higher demand on the timber supply from the forest management districts concerning both delivery in time and assortment output. As a result, the flow of timber has fluctuated a lot with serious consequence for the timber supply during 1994. One reason was unexpected weather conditions which lead to transportation stops. This MSc thesis deals with the planning of logging operations and the problems that are involved in that process for SCA Forest and Timber. This study was initiated by the wood procurement and transportation department, Virke syd, and Strömsund's forest management district within SCA. The purpose is to formulate a flexible and optimizing model for decision-support in short-term planning and follow-up of logging operations. The decision-support involves linear programming in order to minimize the cost of cross­ cutting losses, delivery bonus-losses and moving the logging machines from on <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> to another. The aim is to increase the adaptability between timber request and logging result on assortment level. A seeond objective is to make a survey offactors that influence the possibility for forest management districtsto achieve a continuous timber yield in time and assortment output. The validity of the model in this paper is limited to the planning techniques and philosophy used within SCA and their short-term planning routine. The linear programming model involves: • a planning horizon of one to two months • optimization of <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> selection regarding rnachine resources in the ranger district • five assortments; pine and spruce timber, pulpwood of softwood, fresh cut spruce and hardwood • four cross-cutting alternatives; minimal top-diameter of timber; 12, 14, 16, 18 cm. A result from an optimization gives a <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> selection that minimizes the costs, earlier mentioned, for periods extending from a couple of days up to two months. The main thesis is that decision concerning resource allocation is to be taken "just in time". The advantage with this procedure is that the decision maker has the latest information regarding the actual wood flow and can make more accurate decisions. To improve management and the linear programming model a continuously increasing delivery bonus system has been constructed to allow the forest managementdistrictsto equalize their logging operation costs with the bonus. To refine the decision basis, harvester measurement of timber volume has been used in the decision-support system, to make simple yield forecast for logging units. Results from the decision-support system run on material from Strömsund's forest management district have involved a large amount of moving logging resources between logging units. This is mainly due to a relatively large difference between pulp wood and timber prices. U sing the current timber and pulp wood prices the marginal cost for cross­ cutting adjustments usually exceeded the cost for shifting a <b>logging</b> <b>unit.</b> This is also related {{to the size of the}} <b>logging</b> <b>unit,</b> whereas larger logging units have a low shifting cost per cubic meter. Major conclusions: • Output estimations used within SCA short-term planning routines suffer from bias and random errors. The most serious are the area estimation and the assortment output functions. This makes it difficult to maintain a continuous timber yield in time and assortment output in shorter periods. • The decision support model that this study focuses on can be used on a practical basis hut there is a substantial risk for suboptimization if the planning period is shorter than a month andfor the wood flow demands are set too high. • The use of "intelligent" computer based planning routines such as the model constructed in this study could improve decision-making if the decision-maker fully understood the fundamentals in economic optimization and the use of computers. The key is to use common sense with computer-based planning. • The use of harvest measurement, instead of wood measurement at milis, would improve both planning and foliow-up with more accurate, daily based <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> related measures. This would refine the decision basis for the planner and make it possible to do yield forecasting. • Increase the logging team's influence and co-operation especialiy in areas concerning wood flow planning and follow-up. This would not only give interesting task's for the logging team's, it could also give faster more pliable solutions in the area of interest. • Search for unconventional solutions in keeping a good wood flow; for example aliocate more than one logging team to a <b>logging</b> <b>unit,</b> move logging resources to logging units that give a more appropriate wood flow, change cutting form, etc...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} assumed that {{penicillin}} (and also other cell wall inhibitors) kill pneumococci predominantly by triggering their major autolytic enzyme (an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase; {{referred to as}} amidase), resulting in massive cell wall degradation. Three types of experiments suggest that only part of this killing is due to cell lysis by amidase. (i) Suppression of penicillin-induced lysis by specific inhibitors of amidase protected pneumococci only marginally from killing in spite of prolonged exposure to concentrations of penicillin that were 10 x, 20 x, or 100 x greater than the MIC. (ii) Mutants from which the amidase was completely eliminated by plasmid insertion or deletion (Lyt-) were still killed, albeit at a slower rate than the wild-type Lyt+ strains (3 to 4 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> instead of 4 to 5 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> per 6 h, i. e., about 1 <b>log</b> <b>unit</b> slower than the wild type; P less than 0. 001). (iii) A new mutation (cid), which {{was not related to}} the amidase gene, further reduced killing of mutants lacking amidase to 1 <b>log</b> <b>unit</b> per 6 h (Lyt- Cid- phenotype). Reintroduction of the amidase gene into Lyt- Cid- cells partially restored penicillin-induced lysis but increased only slightly the rate of killing (from 1 <b>log</b> <b>unit</b> per 6 h in Lyt- Cid- cells to 2 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> per 6 h in Lyt+ Cid- cells). We conclude that penicillin kills pneumococci by two distinct mechanisms: one that involves the triggering of the amidase (about 1 <b>log</b> <b>unit</b> of killing per 6 h) and another, amidase-independent mechanism that is responsible for 3 to 4 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> of killing per 6 h.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 High {{severity}} fire is {{a historical}} and integral disturbance process in coniferous forest types. Compounded disturbances such as multiple fires or post-disturbance management activities are increasingly common, but ecological responses are not well understood and may represent novel types of disturbances. I studied bird and small mammal communities in the mixed severity fire regime of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon, USA, at various points in time after one or two high severity fires {{in and around the}} historic 200, 000 -ha Biscuit Fire. Post-disturbance time intervals included 2 - 4 years after a single fire, 17 - 18 years after a single fire, 2 - 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and > 100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Additionally, I examined the response of these communities to postfire salvage logging of the Biscuit Fire. Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Among the recently burned habitats, bird density was highest 17 - 18 -years after fire and lowest 2 years after a single fire. Sites 17 - 18 years postfire were dominated by broad-leaved shrubs. Ordination of community data revealed two distinct gradients in avian species composition, one relating to tree structure (live, dead-sound, dead-decayed) and another relating to shrub volume and height. Bird density was positively related to shrub height and volume; increases in broad-leaved plants following fire were associated with significant increases in bird density. Immediately after a single high severity fire event, small mammal communities transitioned from low abundance and high species richness to high abundance and low species richness dominated by deer mice. Partial recovery to a pre-burn state was evident 17 years after fire with wood rats being present but vole species still absent relative to unburned mature forest. Repeat fire was associated with heightened abundance of deer mice and herbaceous cover. Postfire salvage logging created a significant pulse of woody debris but no significant changes in densities or biomass of small mammals were observed. Fire effects on small mammal communities were much larger than those of postfire salvage logging in the short term. Longer term studies of changes in small mammal communities following salvage logging are needed over decades and greater time scales to fully evaluate the impacts of the management activity. To examine bird response to postfire salvage logging, we used point counts to measure changes in densities and occurrence for 17 common bird species. Response was measured at two spatial scales (20 ha and 2 ha) relative to two measures of salvage logging: proportion of surrounding area logged and logging intensity (basal area removed). The 20 -ha scale comprised the <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> as well as unit edges and surrounding unlogged areas, while the 2 -ha scale comprised only the <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> and not surrounding edges. At the 20 -ha scale, we found a positive response in the density of shrub-associated species (house wren, lazuli bunting, black-headed grosbeak [scientific names given in Appendix A]) and edge-associated species (olive-sided flycatcher, yellow-rumped warbler) and little evidence of negative responses, save for a reduction in density of Hammond’s flycatcher. At the 2 -ha scale, shrub-associates again responded positively but not edge-associates. Brown creeper responded negatively at the 2 -ha scale and five species had suggestive negative trends but they were not significant suggesting that, except for shrub nesting species, bird use of salvage units is associated with edges and not interior portions of salvage units. The lack of a strong negative response to salvage logging of the Biscuit Fire suggests that the small <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> sizes relative to the burn area, as well as extensive snag retention in riparian buffers, tended to retain many bird species in the burn landscape...|$|E

Logging occurred in high-severity (stand-replacement) patches.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Road {{changing}} i. s {{the activity}} of moving operating lines on a cable yarding operation to permit access to logs in an unyarded portion of a <b>logging</b> <b>unit.</b> The time required to perform this activity varies widely and may consume {{a significant portion of}} the total yarding time. With rising costs in the logging industry, the efficiency of cable logging systems is constantly under critical review. Additional research in the area of road changing has been suggested in several studies (Dykstra, 1974 and Peters, 1973) Road changing information was gathered on several yarding operations in conjunction with detailed production studies of cable logging systems. On six of the operations the total time consumed by road changing was noted and recorded as a delay in the yarding process. On four operations, road changing was segmented into various activities, and factors hypothesized to influence road changing time were identified and measured. On the four operations studied in detail, two crewmen timed the road changing operation as the activities involved occurred at widely separated locations on the <b>logging</b> <b>unit.</b> The continuous time study method used on the overall production study (Dykstra, 1975 a) was also used during road changing. The analysis of road changing involves a descriptive analysis of all the operations studied and a quantitative analysis of road changing on the four operations studied in detail. The descriptive analysis consists primarily of a comparative investigation of road changing time between the operations. The quantitative analysis consists of a regression analysis of the four operations examined in detail. In the comparison of road changing times for the ten operations observed, road changing time varied widely. Even among similar systems a wide range was observed. This variability was most likely due to the differences in the road changing methods themselves, varying characteristics of the logging units and lengthy delays encountered during road changing. This could not be confirmed for six of the operations as road changing was not recorded in detail. However, among those operations observed in detail, this influence could be seen. Following a breakdown of road changing into machine intensive activities, labor intensive activities and delays, a large percentage of road changing time is occupied by delays. Also, the greatest proportion of delay-free time involved labor intensive activities. This was expected on the operations where pre-layout of roads was not done. On the operation where roads were pre-layed, other activities requiring labor intensive action occurred. Some of the delays encountered may have been due to characteristics of the particular yarder being used. A quantitative analysis was made of four operations. Road changing time, excluding delays and the time required to relocate the yarder was used as the dependent variable. Delay-free road changing time was found to be a function of the distance from the landing to the tailhold (SPAN) and groundslope. For two of the operations, identical machines and methods were used. A combined regression equation was formed based on the independent variable SPAN. Also, based on the scatter of observations for these systems, an equa. - tion using SPAN 2 as the independent variable was found to be a better predictor of delay-free road changing time than SPAN...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Managed {{forests are}} a major {{component}} of tropical landscapes. Production forests as designated by national forest services cover up to 400 million ha, i. e.  half of the forested area in the humid tropics. Forest management thus {{plays a major role in}} the global carbon budget, but with a lack of unified method to estimate carbon fluxes from tropical managed forests. In this study we propose a new time- and spatially-explicit methodology to estimate the above-ground carbon budget of selective logging at regional scale. Results The yearly balance of a <b>logging</b> <b>unit,</b> i. e. the elementary management unit of a forest estate, is modelled by aggregating three sub-models encompassing (i) emissions from extracted wood, (ii) emissions from logging damage and deforested areas and (iii) carbon storage from post-logging recovery. Models are parametrised and uncertainties are propagated through a MCMC algorithm. As a case study, we used 38  years of National Forest Inventories in French Guiana, northeastern Amazonia, to estimate the above-ground carbon balance (i. e. the net carbon exchange with the atmosphere) of selectively logged forests. Over this period, the net carbon balance of selective logging in the French Guianan Permanent Forest Estate is estimated to be comprised between 0. 12 and 1. 33  Tg C, with a median value of 0. 64  Tg C. Uncertainties over the model could be diminished by improving the accuracy of both logging damage and large woody necromass decay submodels. Conclusions We propose an innovating carbon accounting framework relying upon basic logging statistics. This flexible tool allows carbon budget of tropical managed forests to be estimated in a wide range of tropical regions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A rise of {{the global}} mean sea level {{by more than one}} metre by the year 2100 is expected. Measurements of the local sea level {{variations}} are important to understand the effect on a global scale. This report evaluate a new tide gauge installation at the Onsala Space Observatory with the aim to perform measurements at millimetre accuracy. The new tide gauge consist of two types of level sensors placed in a stilling well. A compact bubbler system and a pulsed radar where the compact bubbler system in the experimental setup consists of a total of five units of which two of the units are of a standard version with a nominal accuracy of 5 mm and three of them of an improved version (called USGS) with a nominal accuracy of 3 mm. Several indoor and field experiments were performed to evaluate the sensors in terms of accuracy, linearity, and stability. A new type of bubble chamber was constructed and compared to the original one. Systematic errors were found when the radar was placed in a narrow tube during the indoor experiments and tendencies of the same systematic error was found in the field experiment even though the tube in this case was significantly wider. A standard deviation of 2. 5 mm was found in the differences between the USGS versions in the field environment and a standard deviation of 10 mm between the standard bubbler and the USGS version which was about the same standard deviation that was found between the USGS bubblers and the radar. An improvement was seen in the comparison between the standard bubbler unit and the radar were a standard deviation of 6. 5 mm was found. The reason for the better agreement between the less accurate bubbler and the radar {{is believed to be the}} timing of the sampling units. The radar and standard bubbler uses the same <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> and are therefore sampled at the same time. The comparison between the bubbler chambers did not result in any significant differences. This evaluation will serve as a valuable foundation to continued measurements and improvements of the new tide gauge...|$|E

Contrast detection thresholds were measured (2 AFC) for a briefly presented (36 msec) foveal Gabor signal (GS), preceded by a presentation (90 msec) of two high-contrast GS flanked masks, with Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) varying from 0 to 16, 290 msec. Using target-to-mask separations of 3 and 12 (= 0. 15 ffi, GS wavelength), the 3 separated GS masks enhanced target threshold by 0. 25 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> at SOA= 0 and by 0. 17 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> at 2, 700 msec.

40|$|In the {{northern}} Barbados accretionary wedge, several Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) legs (DSDP Leg 78 and ODP Legs 110, 156, and 171 A) targeted the décollement and the seaward {{extension of the}} décollement, the proto-décollement. During Leg 171 A, the logging while drilling (LWD) technique {{was used to determine}} the physical properties variations along a profile across the deformation front. Because of the unstable borehole conditions in accretionary wedges, LWD is the most effective method for the measurements of physical properties in these poorly consolidated sediments. LWD data are acquired just above the drill bit a few minutes after the formation has been drilled, yielding measurements as close to in situ conditions as possible. The large amount of LWD data and the demand for a quick, objective, and reliable evaluation calls for the application of multivariate statistical methods. The multivariate factor analysis is a method of reducing the amount of logging data while giving them a new integrated meaning with no loss of important information, resulting in factor logs that are helpful tools for further interpretation. The cluster analysis of the two or three most significant factors proved to be a useful and objective method to identify and confirm significant logging units. The main objective of the application of multivariate statistical methods in this study is twofold. First, Leg 171 A was a stand-alone logging leg, where no cores were retrieved. The factor analysis was used as an objective tool for a classification of the drilled sequences based on their physical and chemical properties. The new factor logs mirror the basic processes behind the measured geophysical properties and make them easier to interpret. Second, in the succeeding cluster analysis, similar geophysical properties are grouped into one cluster, reflecting one <b>logging</b> <b>unit.</b> These objectively defined logging units can be compared to statistical electrofacies, which are helpful in differentiating lithologic characterizations. In particular for LWD measurements, the multivariate statistical methods of factor and cluster analysis are helpful tools for a fast, reliable, and objective definition of logging units, which should be considered for future legs...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in breaking the historical dependence on fossil energy and begin moving towards more {{renewable energy sources}} is rising worldwide. This {{is largely due to}} uncertainties in the future supply of fossil fuels and the rising concerns about humanity’s role in the currently ongoing climate changes. One renewable energy source is ocean waves and Uppsala University has since the early 2000 s been performing active research in this area. The Uppsala wave energy concept is centered on developing linear generators coupled to point absorbing buoys, with the generator situated on the seabed and connected to the buoy on the sea surface via a steel wire. The motion of the buoy then transfers energy to the generator, where it is converted into electricity and sent to shore for delivery into the electrical grid. This thesis will mainly focus on the development and evaluation of technologies used to automate the manufacturing of the translator, a central part of the linear generator, using industrial robotics. The translator is a 3 m high and 0. 8 m wide three sided structure with an aluminum pipe at its center. The structure consists of alternating layers of steel plates (pole-shoes) and ferrite magnets, with a total of 72 layers per side. To perform experiments on translator assembly and production, a robot cell (centered on an IRB 6650 S industrial robot) complimented with relevant tools, equipment and security measures, has been designed and constructed. The mounting of the pole-shoes on the central pipe, using the industrial robot, proved to be the most challenging task to solve. However, by implementing a precise work-piece orientation calibration system, combined with selective compliance robot tools, the task could be performed with mounting speeds of up to 50 mm/s. Although progress has been made, much work still remains before fully automated translator assembly is a reality. A secondary topic of this thesis is the development of stand-alone measurement systems {{to be used in the}} linear generator, once it has been deployed on the seabed. The main requirements of such a measurement system is robustness, resistance to electrical noise, and power efficiency. If possible the system should also be portable and easy to use. This was solved by developing a custom measurement circuit, based on industry standard 4 – 20 mA current signals, combined with a portable submersible <b>logging</b> <b>unit.</b> The latest iteration of the system is small enough to be deployed and retrieved by one person, and can collect data for 10 weeks before running out of batteries. Future work in this area should focus on increasing the usability of the system. The third and final topic of this thesis is a short discussion of an engineering approach to kinetic energy storage, in the form of high-speed composite flywheels, and the design of two different prototypes of such flywheels. Both designs gave important insights to the research group, but a few crucial design faults unfortunately made it impossible to evaluate the full potential of the two designs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Designing timber {{harvesting}} units is a challenging task. The task requires decision making on logging equipment, landing site, cable road profile, road location, and transportation system. Traditionally forest planners {{have done the}} task manually. However, the manual method {{makes it difficult to}} examine many alternatives and the harvest plans depend heavily on the experience of the individual planners. Furthermore, increased environmental concerns require more sophisticated planning procedures. Thus, it is challenging to find not only economically and environmentally "feasible" solutions but also "good" solutions by the manual method. Tools for detailed analysis and systematic evaluation of alternatives become essential for better planning of harvesting operations. This study develops a methodology with the purpose of assisting the planners in designing cable <b>logging</b> <b>unit</b> layout. The methodology combines a cable logging operation planning problem with a road network planning problem and optimizes them simultaneously. It incorporates modem computer software languages, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, and optimization techniques that have become available during the last two decades. The methodology includes logging feasibility and cost analysis to evaluate alternative cable roads and yarding equipment. Once the feasible cable road alternatives are identified, the methodology formulates two cost minimization network problems. The networks represent variable and fixed costs associated with yarding and truck transportation activities to move logs from the stump to the mill. The methodology uses a heuristic network algorithm as an optimization technique to solve the network problems. One of the two cost minimization network problems is for cable logging operation planning and the other is for truck transportation planning. Each of the network problems is solved separately using the heuristic network algorithm while being connected to the other by a feedback mechanism. The methodology is implemented in a computerized model that {{can be used as a}} decision support system. The model is applied to an actual harvest area of 93 ha. A total of 40 candidate landing locations with 2, 880 cable roads from 2 yarding equipment alternatives were evaluated. The model found 1, 719 feasible cable road alternatives by conducting the logging feasibility and cost analysis. Two cost minimization network problems were developed. A total of 141, 139 links and 1, 926 timber parcels were developed in the network problem for cable logging paths. In the network for solving road location problem, a total of 95, 904 links were developed to connect 13, 522 grid cells included in the planning area. After 47. 2 hours for 10 repetitions on Pentium HI 1 GHz speed desktop computer, the heuristic network algorithm solved these network problems and selected a total of 19 landings and 155 cable roads to harvest 8, 064 m³ of logs from 1, 926 timber parcels over the planning area. A total of 2. 85 kilometers of new access roads were proposed as a part of the solution for this application. Overall yarding and road costs for timber harvest in the planning area was 416, 675 (5 1. 67 /m³). Although the exact solution could not be verified, the solution obtained with this methodology when coupled with sensitivity analysis can be considered as a feasible and good harvest operation plan for the management goals. By providing systematic and analytic tools, the computerized model presented in this study can be used as a decision support tool assisting the forest planners in designing timber harvest layout...|$|E

40|$|The fresh-cut produce {{industry}} has been the fastest-growing portion of the food retail market during the past 10 years, providing consumers with convenient and nutritious food. However, fresh-cut fruits and vegetables raise food safety concerns, because exposed tissue may be colonized more easily by pathogenic bacteria than intact produce. This {{is due to the}} higher availability of nutrients on cut surfaces and the greater potential for contamination because of the increased amount of handling. We found that applied Listeria monocytogenes populations survived and increased only slightly on fresh-cut Red Delicious apples stored at 10 °C but increased significantly on fresh-cut honeydew melons stored at 10 °C over 7 days. In addition, we examined the effect of lytic, L. monocytogenes-specific phages via two phage application methods, spraying and pipetting, on L. monocytogenes populations in artificially contaminated fresh-cut melons and apples. The phage mixture reduced L. monocytogenes populations by 2. 0 to 4. 6 <b>log</b> <b>units</b> over the control on honeydew melons.
