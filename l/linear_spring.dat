A basic network of edge springs is complemented with an additional set of <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> that oppose element collapsing. This is here achieved by confining each mesh vertex to its ball, through <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> that {{are attached to the}} vertex and to its projections on the ball entities. The resulting linear pseudo-structural problem can be solved efficiently with an iterative method. The proposed procedures are compared with a revisited version of the torsional spring method with the help of two and three-dimensional example problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} behaviour at {{the interface}} between automotive tyres and roads is important in numerical contact models aiming at prediction of rolling resistance, traction, wear, excitation of vibrations, and noise generation. The detailed behaviour depends on the local dynamic response of the tread and the small-scale roughness of the road surface. For complete tyre-road interaction simulations predicting global vibrations, the tread layer has commonly been modelled using approximations such {{as a set of}} uncoupled <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> or an elastic half-space. These computational efficient approximations have been introduced in an ad hoc manner and they have seldom been evaluated in detail. This paper evaluates these two simplified approaches by comparison to results from a detailed numerical model for a tread layer on a rigid backing that is pressed into a road surface. The detailed contact model is formulated in the time-domain and includes the effect of small-scale roughness by non-linear force-indentation functions between each pair of contact elements. The results show that the effect of the inertia in the tread layer is insignificant for typical contact conditions. The stiffness of the <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> and the elastic half-space must be tuned to account for the actual coupling within the tread layer and the small-scale roughness of the road. The set of uncoupled <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> can be tuned to closely follow the force-indentation relation of the detailed model. The elastic half-space can only be tuned for a specific indentation, force or contact stiffness, since its relation has a slightly different character. It is concluded that purely elastic models of the tread are relevant and that the set of uncoupled <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> performs better than the elastic half-space. However, the tuning of the stiffness is not trivial without results from more elaborate models including the influence of local tread properties and small-scale surface roughness...|$|R

50|$|Spring rates {{typically}} have units of N/mm (or lbf/in). An {{example of a}} <b>linear</b> <b>spring</b> rate is 500 lbf/in. For every inch the spring is compressed, it exerts 500 lbf. A non-linear spring rate is one for which {{the relation between the}} spring's compression and the force exerted cannot be fitted adequately to a linear model. For example, the first inch exerts 500 lbf force, the second inch exerts an additional 550 lbf (for a total of 1050 lbf), the third inch exerts another 600 lbf (for a total of 1650 lbf). In contrast a 500 lbf/in <b>linear</b> <b>spring</b> compressed to 3 inches will only exert 1500 lbf.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{wearable}} sensing glove {{for measuring}} {{the motion of the}} fingers is proposed. The system consists of linear potentiometers, flexible wires, and <b>linear</b> <b>springs,</b> which makes it compact and lightweight so that it does not interfere with the natural motion of the fingers. Inspired by the way wrinkles on finger joints are smoothed out when the finger is flexed, a flexible wire is attached to the back of each finger. As the flexible wire moves due to the motion of the finger, the joint angles are calculated by measuring the change in length of wire. Linear potentiometers with <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> were used to maintain the tension of the wires in order to measure the wire length change consistently. Because the motion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is dependent on that of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, only two linear potentiometers were used for each finger. A compact sensing module including 10 <b>linear</b> potentiometers and <b>springs</b> was attached to a glove. The proposed system can widely be applied for the systems, which require to measure finger motions accurately, e. g., virtual reality or teleoperation systems.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{position}} fluctuations of interacting particles aligned in a finite cell that avoid any crossing in equilibrium with a thermal bath. The focus {{is put on}} the influence of the confining force directed along the cell length. We show that the system may be modeled as a 1 D chain of particles with identical masses, linked with <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> of varying spring constants. The confining force may be accounted for by <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> linked to the walls. When the confining force range is increased toward the inside of the chain, a paradoxical behavior is exhibited. The outermost particles fluctuations are enhanced, whereas those of the inner particles are reduced. A minimum of fluctuations is observed at a distance of the cell extremities that scales linearly with the confining force range. Those features are in very good agreement with the model. Moreover, the simulations exhibit an asymmetry in their fluctuations which is an anharmonic effect. It is characterized by the measurement of the skewness, which is found to be strictly positive for the outer particles when the confining force is short ranged...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{repair of}} the mitral valve results in better {{outcomes}} than valve replacement, yet diseased valves are often replaced {{due to the}} technical difficulty of the repair process. A surgical planning system based on patient-specific medical images that allows surgeons to simulate and compare potential repair strategies could greatly improve surgical outcomes. The system must simulate valve closure quickly and handle the complex boundary conditions imposed by the chords that tether the valve leaflets. We have developed a process for generating a triangulated mesh of the valve surface from volumetric image data of the opened valve. The closed position of the mesh is then computed using a mass-spring model of dynamics. In the mass-spring model, triangle sides are treated as <b>linear</b> <b>springs</b> supporting only tension. Chords are also treated as <b>linear</b> <b>springs,</b> and self-collisions are detected and handled inelastically. The equations of motion are solved using implicit numerical integration.

50|$|In {{a spring}} scale, the spring either {{stretches}} (as in a hanging {{scale in the}} produce department of a grocery store) or compresses (as in a simple bathroom scale). By Hooke's law, every spring has a proportionality constant that relates {{how hard it is}} pulled to how far it stretches. Weighing scales use a spring with a known spring constant (see Hooke's law) and measure the displacement of the spring by any variety of mechanisms to produce an estimate of the gravitational force applied by the object. Rack and pinion mechanisms are often used to convert the <b>linear</b> <b>spring</b> motion to a dial reading.|$|E
50|$|Solids {{are often}} modeled as linear springs because under {{the action of}} a force they {{contract}} or elongate, and when the force is lifted, they return to their original lengths, like a spring. This is true {{as long as the}} force is in the elastic range, that is, not large enough to cause permanent or plastic deformation. Therefore, the equations given for a <b>linear</b> <b>spring</b> can also be used for elastic solid bars. Alternately, we can determine the work associated with the expansion or contraction of an elastic solid bar by replacing the pressure P by its counterpart in solids, normal stress σ=F/A in the work expansion where A is the cross sectional area of the bar.|$|E

5000|$|A fluid droplet can float or bounce over a {{vibrating}} fluid bath {{because of}} the presence of an air layer between the droplet and the bath surface. The behavior of the droplet depends on the acceleration of the bath surface. Below a critical acceleration, the droplet will take successively smaller bounces before the intervening air layer eventually drains from underneath, causing the droplet to coalesce. Above the bouncing threshold, the intervening air layer replenishes during each bounce so the droplet never touches the bath surface.Near the bath surface, the droplet experiences equilibrium between inertial forces, gravity, and a reaction force due to the interaction with the air layer above the bath surface. This reaction force serves to launch the droplet back above the air like a trampoline. Molacek and Bush proposed two different models for the reaction force.
