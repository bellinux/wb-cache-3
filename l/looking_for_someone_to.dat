Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member to sit on the Northwest Territories council.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{had been}} <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> {{turn into a}} martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, {{a member of the}} Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught {{attempting}} to blow up a train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered.|$|E

The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against colleges from that area, with great success. In 1926, Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended him to Col. John S. Hammond, representing the owners of the new New York Rangers franchise, who was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> build his team. Smythe was hired to recruit a team, which he would then manage. But on October 27, 1926, before the Rangers had played a regular season game, Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick. Smythe believed that he lost his job by refusing to sign two-time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye, against Hammond's wishes. Smythe thought Dye was not a team player.|$|E

50|$|As is {{the case}} in other industries, when there is a mistake or error made people <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> blame. This may seem natural, but it creates a blame culture where who is more {{important}} than why or how. A just culture, also sometimes known as no blame or no fault, seeks to understand the root causes of an incident rather than just who was involved.|$|R

5|$|By 1965, the Americans were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> {{overthrow}} Khánh, {{and these}} efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers {{to move against}} Khánh {{since the start of}} the year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{met with}} Mahatma Gandhi, {{becoming}} the first African Americans to have an audience with him. When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States, he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished. One {{important aspect of the}} meeting was a discussion of how non-violent resistance {{could be used as a}} means of creating social change. The meeting had a profound effect on the couple, changing the direction of their lives. Though they would remain Christians, the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice, transcending racial, social, economic and spiritual boundaries. After they returned to the United States, Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides. Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman might know of a divinity student interested in the position. Instead, Howard decided to take up the challenge himself, securing a leave of absence in order to found the church. Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters, as she strongly believed in the cause.|$|E

She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she {{admitted}} to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.|$|E

25|$|David Seltzer {{wrote the}} first draft for Punchline in 1979 after {{becoming}} fascinated by comedy clubs while <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> play a psychiatrist on a television pilot that he was writing. He had a development deal with the movie division of ABC. Originally, {{the tone of the}} film was more good-natured a la Fame (1980) with more characters and less of an emphasis on Steven Gold. Bob Bookman, an executive, sponsored the script but left for Columbia Pictures. He bought the screenplay because Howard Zieff was interested in directing it. When Zieff lost interest (he ended up doing Unfaithfully Yours in 1984), the script was buried for years.|$|E

After only two first-class matches, and with the team <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> support the aging Jack Cowie, he played in a trial match in January 1949 for the New Zealand side that toured England that year. He took five wickets for 73, and was selected for the tour led by Walter Hadlee. He took 26 wickets at a bowling average of 33 before a groin injury in July ruled him out {{for the remainder of}} the tour. John Reid rated him as the fastest bowler of the 1949 English season.|$|E
25|$|Australian filmmaker Charles Chauvel {{was making}} a film about the Mutiny on the Bounty, In the Wake of the Bounty (1933), a {{combination}} of dramatic re-enactments of the mutiny and a documentary on present-day Pitcairn Island. Chauvel was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> {{play the role of}} Fletcher Christian. There are different stories how Errol Flynn was cast. According to one, Chauvel saw his picture in an article about a yacht wreck involving Flynn. The most popular account is that he was discovered by cast member John Warwick. The film was not a strong success at the box office, but it was the lead role and seemed to ignite Flynn's interest in acting. In late 1933 he returned to Britain to pursue a career in acting.|$|E

Hillary Clinton identifies middle-class families who are working harder but staying in place as the root cause. While all these factors and others helped increase inequality, they overlook the role of a key American institution that has also helped widen the gap between rich and poor: the Supreme Court...|$|R
25|$|Bragg {{received}} public {{praise for}} his conduct {{in the battle}} and on April 12, 1862, Jefferson Davis appointed Bragg a full general, the sixth man to achieve that rank and one of only seven {{in the history of}} the Confederacy. His date of rank was April 6, 1862, coinciding with the first day at Shiloh. After the Siege of Corinth, Beauregard departed on sick leave, leaving Bragg in temporary command of the army in Tupelo, Mississippi, but he failed to inform President Davis of his departure and spent two weeks absent without leave. Davis was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> replace Beauregard because of his perceived poor performance at Corinth, and the opportunity presented itself when Beauregard left without permission. Bragg was then appointed his successor as commander of the Western Department (known formally as Department Number Two), including the Army of Mississippi, on June 17, 1862.|$|E
25|$|Taishi Ci {{was from}} Huang County (黃縣), Donglai Commandery (東萊郡), {{which is in}} present-day Longkou, Shandong. As a youth, he was known for being studious. He served as a zoucaoshi (奏曹史; a minor official) in the local commandery office. Around 186, the commandery {{administration}} had a dispute with their superiors, the provincial administration of Qing Province. Both sides wrote to the imperial court in the capital Luoyang to complain about each other. At the time, since the imperial court often made decisions on a first-come, first-served basis, it meant that the court would tend to rule in favour of the party whose document it received first. Since the provincial administration had already sent a courier to deliver their complaint letter, the Administrator (太守) of Donglai Commandery began to feel anxious and started <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> help him deliver his letter. Taishi Ci, then 20 years old, was chosen for the task.|$|E

By the 2009 season, Hicks was possibly forced to find a buyer for the team. Three known bids were put in for the {{ownership of the}} Rangers. Former agent Dennis Gilbert, Houston businessman Jim Crane, and a partnership of Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan placed bids believed to be around $500 million {{for the purchase of}} the team. Hicks offered exclusive negotiation rights to the Greenburg-Ryan group on December 15 with a purchase expected to be complete prior to or following the start of the 2010 season. During the bidding process, it was discovered that Ryan, as president of the club, was not under contract, but working only on a handshake deal with Hicks, and that he would step down from the front office if another bidder were to win. After talks with Gilbert, Ryan later said he would not step down unless asked by the new owner to do so.|$|E
