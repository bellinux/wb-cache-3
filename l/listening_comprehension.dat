40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study analyzed (a) which lower- and higher-level semantic components uniquely predicted <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> and (b) {{the nature of}} the relation (i. e., direct and indirect) between the predictors and <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> in preschoolers. One-hundred and fifty-two children participated in the present study (68 females; mean age = 4; 10 years/months and 5; 5 years/months at Time 1 and Time 2, respectively). Participants were administered measures to evaluate <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> (Time 1 and Time 2) and (a) expressive and receptive word knowledge (lower-level semantic components), and (b) inferential skills and the ability to use context (higher-level semantic components) (Time 1). Verbal short-term and working memory were also included as control variables. Data were analyzed using path analysis models. Results showed that both types of semantic components (a) accounted for unique variance in <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> at Time 2, with lower-level semantic components explaining a larger proportion of variance than higher-level semantic components; (b) were related to later <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> through direct and indirect relations. Memory resources did not significantly contribute to <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension.</b> The results are discussed in light of their theoretical relevance and educational/practical implications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract : The {{current study}} adopted a {{longitudinal}} design {{to analyze the}} causal connection between <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> and receptive vocabulary in pre-schoolers. Verbal intelligence and working memory were considered as possible mediators. One-hundred and fifty-two children were tested at two time points {{at a distance of}} 7 - 8 months (mean age = 4; 10 years, SD = 7 months at Time 1; mean age = 5; 5 years, SD = 7 months at Time 2). Children were administered tasks to evaluate <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> and receptive vocabulary at both time points, and tests for the evaluation of verbal intelligence and verbal working memory at Time 1. Results showed that : (a) receptive vocabulary has a direct causal effect on <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension,</b> which is not entirely intertwined with that of verbal intelligence; (b) <b>listening</b> text <b>comprehension</b> affects the development of receptive vocabulary only indirectly, namely through verbal intelligence. Implications for understanding the developmental pattern of the relation between text comprehension and vocabulary were discusse...|$|R
25|$|Another {{phenomenon}} is relearning. Some studies show that, despite {{the end of}} learning and no language input, a residual learning can happen. Weltens (1989), who studied foreign language learners, identifies an increase in reading and <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension.</b> He says that it happens because a process of maturation happens. Schöpper-Grabe determines that contact and the intensity with the target language cannot be the only variable causing language attrition (Schöpper-Grabe 1998).|$|E
25|$|A <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> {{examination}} {{will test}} the students' ability {{to comprehend the}} spoken English language in various daily situations, and is composed of twenty multiple choice questions {{which is based on}} information contained in audio played to the students, and the examination is taken as a class, not individually. Usually, questions will be based on one of seven passages in different scenarios. This particular examination lasts around 35 minutes, with the maximum score being 20.|$|E
2500|$|Ido {{claims the}} prefix mal- (creating {{a word with}} the exact {{opposite}} meaning) in Esperanto to be overused as a prefix, and also to be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages, and introduces des- as an alternative in such cases. Ido also uses a series of opposite words {{in lieu of a}} prefix. For example, instead of malbona ("bad", the opposite of bona, [...] "good"), Ido uses mala, or instead of mallonga ("short", the opposite of longa, [...] "long"), kurta. <b>Listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> was also given as a reason: the primary Ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the Latin-based sinistra for [...] "left" [...] instead of maldextra (mal- plus the word dextra, or dekstra for [...] "right") is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands. Esperanto has developed alternate forms for many of these words (such as liva for maldekstra), but most of these are rarely used.|$|E

50|$|The Simple View of Reading was {{originally}} described by Gough and Tunmer in 1986 and modified by Hoover and Gough in 1990. The Simple View {{suggests that the}} ultimate goal of reading comprehension, and in order to have good reading comprehension, you need to have good decoding ability (e.g., ability to interpret the symbols) and good <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> (e.g., your ability to understand oral language). This model predicts four categories of readers. Readers with poor decoding skills but relatively preserved <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> skills would be considered readers who are poor decoders, or dyslexic. Readers with poor <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> skills are referred to as readers who are poor comprehenders. Readers with poor decoding skills and poor <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> skills are considered poor readers, or sometimes referred to as garden-variety poor readers. Readers who have good decoding and <b>listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> skills are considered typical readers.|$|E

40|$|Phonological {{awareness}} (PA) can {{be defined}} as the ability to recognize that orthographic patterns represent specific phonemic elements of speech (Nitrouer, 1999). Alternatively, some view PA as a purely linguistic skill that involves the ability to recognize and manipulate specific speech sounds (e. g., Catts, 1991). A large body of research indicates the primary problem for children who do not learn to read is a deficit in PA (e. g., Morris et al., 1998; Stanovich, 1988). Far less work has examined what drives the development of PA (Metsala & Walley, 1998). Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} oral language skills influence the acquisition of PA (e. g., Dickinson, McCabe, Anastasopoulos, Peisner-Feinberg, & Poe, 2003; Olofsson & Niedersoe 1999). The primary purpose of this study was to examine the development of PA skills in children classified with a reading disability who evidenced either typical or below-average oral language skills based on measures of receptive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, and <b>listening</b> <b>comprehensions</b> skills. In addition, this study examined whether differing conceptualizations o...|$|R

50|$|<b>Listening</b> <b>comprehension</b> is most {{neglected}} in language learning. It is generally treated as incidental to speaking {{rather than as}} a foundation for it.

40|$|<b>Listening</b> {{and reading}} <b>comprehension</b> form an {{important}} part of the educational needs of the child. Learning and development are dynamic processes and educators must take cognisance of the continually changing needs of the environment. The relationship between and development of <b>listening</b> and reading <b>comprehension</b> is complex and interlinked. Theoretical and developmental strategies need to be explored to help us understand assessment and teaching procedures. This study aimed to compare <b>listening</b> and reading <b>comprehension</b> using two assessment tools - the Sentence Verification Technique and the Performance Test: <b>Listening</b> and Reading <b>Comprehension</b> English First Language (HSRC). Three groups, standard 2, 3, and 4 students, were tested on both tests and reading and listening scores were compared in each test. Then the two tests were compared. Some qualitative analyses were carried out. The HSRC test showed listening and reading to be similar in all three groups, while listening was significantly better than reading on the SVT test. These differences may be related to the fact that the subjects were able to reread in the SVT 'reading test. A developmental trend was clear in both tests in that the scores in both reading and listening showed increases with each group. The results between the two tests were similar in the listening mode but showed differences in the reading mode. This implies that they cannot be directly compared but that both still play valuable, but different diagnostic roles. The results led to a discussion of the clinical and future research implications.

The present research was conducted to determine the reading comprehension level of primary school students that were from different socioeconomic levels. It was revealed that during the application of the study, students improved their reading comprehension skill. However, it was observed that both in the pre-test and in the post-test there were conditions where an important number of students, especially from the low socioeconomic level, didn’t provide any response to the questions at all, and/or provided wrong responses to a significant number of questions in both tests.
