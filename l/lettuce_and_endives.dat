40|$|Cadmium is a toxic element for {{all living}} beings, even at low concentrations, {{and it is}} a human {{carcinogenic}} according to IARC. Since food is reported as the main source of Cd intake in non-smoking individuals, FAO and WHO set limits for the maximum permitted human intake. Leafy vegetables have a relatively high potential for Cd uptake and translocation, therefore they are often considered Cd accumulators. As they are important salad crops of the Mediterranean diet and are available worldwide, their consumption may represent an effective risk for human health. <b>Lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa) <b>and</b> <b>endive</b> (Cichorium endivia), grown on different agricultural soils in Campania region (southern Italy), subjected to different fertilisation treatments (unfertilisation, compost amendment and mineral fertilisation), were analysed to clarify if the highest concentrations found are linked to external (older and inedible) or internal (younger and edible) leaves. All the leafy vegetables analysed showed on average 2 -fold higher (α= 0. 05) Cd concentrations in leaves than in roots. Leaf Cd concentrations in both <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> <b>endive</b> significantly differed among fertilisation treatments, with values highest in the plants grown on mineral fertilised soils. Apart from the soil fertilisation treatments, however, Cd leaf concentrations were often higher than maximum levels deduced by the CE 629 / 2008 Regulation. External leaves of endive plants showed significantly higher (α= 0. 05) concentrations than internal leaves (in some cases the values were 3 -fold higher). This study highlights worrying Cd concentrations in the edible parts of the studied vegetables, with concentrations up to 4 -fold higher than the threshold. Moreover, it points out two major drawbacks in the Italian and European regulatory frameworks: 1) metal concentration (as total and/or available fraction) limits in agricultural soils are lacking; 2) metal concentration thresholds reported in the CE 629 / 2008 Regulation, expressed on the fresh weight basis rather than on the dry weight basis, appear not suitable...|$|R

40|$|Market gardeners {{are facing}} new environmental, {{commercial}} and safety requirements {{and regulations that}} weigh heavily on their crop planting and management decisions. Producing high-quality products and simultaneously reducing the use of chemical products needs change in the multi-field planning of crops. In order to identify which cropping practice may be altered depending on each farm's characteristics, we built a rule-based model that represents how market gardeners plan cropping cycles of <b>lettuce</b> <b>and</b> <b>endive,</b> here denoted as salad vegetables, on a farm scale. The model is adapted to the specificities of salad vegetable crops in the Mediterranean region, in particular the combination of several cycles per year and of open field and sheltered crops. The output variables are the developed areas allocated to the different salad types {{and the range of}} the harvest dates, which are two key factors for commercialisation. The model is based on identifying the successive decision steps of growers when building their farming systems; descriptive variables are the effective surface area and period for salad cultivation, the number of salad cycles per year, the developed surface area of each salad type and the dates of harvest. The decision-making rules leading to each descriptive variable are based on the agronomic characteristics of soil, climate and crops, farmers' strategic objectives and organisation of farm resources. The cropping decisions were recorded in 38 farms in the large market-gardening region of Languedoc-Roussillon. In the sample, the number of salad types cultivated per farm varied from 1 to 8 and the harvesting period from 3 to 7 months. Our results demonstrate that the model can explain a substantial part of this variability, 26 and 28 farms among 38, respectively, being correctly classified by the model for the two variables. The original result of this work is to enhance the generality of a similar framework built earlier for arable cropping systems. From a practical point of view, this model can be used to determine the leeway available to the farmers for the introduction of technical change in salad cropping. It could therefore be used by agricultural advisors to plan salad crops either for individual farms or on the scale of a marketing structure...|$|R
