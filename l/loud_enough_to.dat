5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

The {{fact that}} women, despite the slow but {{emerging}} recognition of their silent contribution, still face stumbling blocks in their path towards development, makes this cry reverberated around the world. India, having agriculture as the main occupation and women playing a significant and crucial role in it, is also not an exception.

25|$|The dulcian is a {{flexible}} instrument, {{capable of being}} <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> play in outdoor bands, quiet enough for chamber music, and expressive enough to join in with the choir. Its uses would have included playing dance music with the shawms and sackbuts of the city watch, chamber music, and the grand polychoral repertoire from Venice and Germany, such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Heinrich Schütz. There are explicit dulcian parts in the sonatas by Dario Castello.|$|E
25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae {{a small amount of}} flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last a few seconds to a couple minutes and are <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} the {{rattling}} made by rattlesnakes of different species, the Canadian zoologists Brock Fenton and Lawrence Licht found that the sounds are always similar: they have rapid onset (starting suddenly, and reaching full volume in a few milliseconds); they consist of a [...] "broadband" [...] mixture of frequencies between 2kHz and 20kHz, with little energy either in the ultrasonic (above 20kHz) or in the rattlesnakes' hearing range (below 700Hz); and the frequencies do not change much with time (the rattling after 2 minutes having a similar spectrum to that at onset). There was no clear difference in the sounds made by the different species measured: Crotalus horridus, Crotalus adamanteus, Crotalus atrox, Crotalus cerastes, Crotalus viridis and Sistrurus catenatus. This pattern implies that the rattling [...] "could serve as a general attention-getting device", which [...] "is designed as a deimatic or startle display". Its similarity to the [...] "broadband, harsh sounds" [...] used as warning calls by birds and mammals may enhance its effectiveness. Since rattlesnakes can barely hear the sound, it is unlikely to serve as any form of communication to other snakes of the same species. Finally, the sounds are not in themselves <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause pain and hence keep predators away.|$|E

500|$|The Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is {{the most}} vocal of the rhinoceros species. Observations of the species in zoos show the animal almost constantly vocalizing, and it is known {{to do so in}} the wild, as well. The rhino makes three distinct noises: eeps, whales, and whistle-blows. The eep, a short, one-second-long yelp, {{is the most}} common sound. The whale, named for its similarity to vocalizations of the humpback whale, is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives. A vocalization of similar volume from elephants has been shown to carry [...] and the whistle-blow may carry as far. The Sumatran rhinoceros will sometimes twist the saplings they do not eat. This twisting behavior is believed to be used as a form of communication, frequently indicating a junction in a trail.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{said the}} album was never {{finished}} {{and because of the}} demand for the record, the distributors insisted the album be completed, otherwise they would cancel the album's orders. This resulted in Dr. Dre mixing the album and inserting the skits within 48 hours, which enabled the album to be released. Rolling Stone writer Jonathan Gold described how Dr. Dre produced a beat from scratch to complete instrumental: [...] "Dre may find something he likes from an old drum break, loop it and gradually replace each part with a better tom-tom sound, a kick-drum sound he adores, until the beat bears the same relationship to the original that the Incredible Hulk does to Bill Bixby". Gold also described how the track progressed with other musicians adding to the song, stating [...] "A bass player wanders in, unpacks his instrument and pops a funky two-note bass line over the beat, then leaves to watch CNN, though his two notes keep looping into infinity. A smiling guy in a striped jersey plays a nasty one-fingered melody on an old Minimoog synthesizer that's been obsolete since 1982, and Dre scratches in a sort of surfadelic munching noise, and then from his well-stocked Akai MPC60 samples comes a shriek, a spare piano chord, an ejaculation from the first Beastie's record -- [...] "Let me clear my throat"—and the many-layered groove is happening, bumping, breathing, almost <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{results of}} studies on the pygmy slow loris {{indicate}} that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from Saraca dives flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30–40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of exudates. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from [...] {{to as much as}} the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark, may be <b>loud</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be heard up to [...] away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area. Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family Fabaceae (peas), are high in carbohydrates and lipids, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue {{to make it easier to}} reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices, a large cecum to help the animal digest complex carbohydrates, and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding.|$|E

2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma.
