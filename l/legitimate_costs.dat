The opportunity to study naturally occurring variation in treatment prompted networking primary care research networks in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and North America to study acute otitis media. Addi-tional challenges faced and addressed in this study included (1) differing national requirements for protecting human subjects; (2) variation in data collection pro-cesses in primary care practices; (3) data transmission among participants; (4) duties and tariffs on necessary instruments; (5) fl uctuation in currency exchange rates; (6) incapacitation of coinvestigators; (7) complex administration of funds; (8) fi nancing the additional, <b>legitimate</b> <b>costs</b> of collaboration; (9) sustaining strong personal relationships among coinvestigators; and (10) accepting longer time frames than would otherwise be expected.

40|$|The justices of the Supreme Court {{have drawn}} new battle lines over the exclusionary rule. In Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U. S. 586 (2006), a five-justice majority, over a strong dissent, {{went out of}} the way to renew {{familiar}} criticisms of the rule. Just this January, in Herring v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 695 (2009), the justices again divided five to four. This time the dissenters raised the ante, by arguing that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s cost-benefit approach to applying the rule is misguided. For the first time since Justice Brennan left the Court, some of the justices appealed to broader justifications for exclusion, including concerns for judicial integrity, judicial review, and long-run and indirect influences on official behavior. This article challenges the majority positions in Hudson and Herring as both normatively mistaken and empirically unsupported. Normatively, the escape of the guilty is a cost of the Fourth Amendment rather than whatever remedies enforce it. The only <b>legitimate</b> <b>cost</b> of exclusion is possible overdeterrence, defined in careful way: discouraging lawful behavior in a pool of cases in which legality is uncertain. The Article then tests the overdeterrence hypothesis against empirical evidence reporting hit rates for different types of searches and seizures. The current mix of Fourth Amendment remedies {{does not appear to be}} overdeterring and indeed appears to underdeter certain types of low-cost Fourth Amendment violations. The article also criticizes the Herring dissent 2 ̆ 7 s more majestic view of the exclusionary rule, because the dissent 2 ̆ 7 s approach (1) cannot account for the law 2 ̆ 7 s response to innocent victims of illegal searches and seizures; (2) fails to account for alternative remedies, including a deterrence-based exclusionary rule; (3) conflicts with the good-faith immunity defense to tort actions against the police, thus threatening overdeterrence; and, most fundamentally, (4) mistakes the nature of Fourth Amendment rights as trumps over the application of otherwise valid criminal laws to private behavior, i. e., as a right to commit crimes in secret. Finally, the article presents a proposed improvement on current exclusionary rule practice, the virtual deterrence approach. Under this approach, before suppressing evidence (or admitting tainted evidence under an exception), the court should demand an account of what specific remedial steps, by way of training, discipline, or record-keeping, the department has taken to prevent recurrence of the violation. In typical cases the proposal may not be worth the additional layer of procedural complexity. When, however, the charged offense is exceptionally serious, or when the government exploits an exception to exclusion for fruits of conduct found unconstitutional by the court, virtual deterrence probably would increase compliance by police with constitutional requirements, and reduce both the chances of the guilty escaping and the temptation to distort fact and law to avoid such miscarriages of justice. The government 2 ̆ 7 s option to refuse to undertake remedial measures and thereby acquiesce in a suppression order provides a strong safeguard against overdeterrence...|$|R

An increasing share of such large dams is globally {{represented by the}} type Concrete Face Rockfill Dam (CFRD) due to its safe behaviour at a relatively low construction cost. China is however building them higher than has earlier been done {{and the lack of}} worldwide experience requires thorough studies on their behaviour. This report presents a study of the Cihaxia dam that is to be built in the river basin of Huang He, regarding the optimisation of an increased rockfill compaction and its final effects on the settlements of the concrete face. The settlements of a typical cross section of the Cihaxia dam are modelled with a Finite Element Method (FEM) program with varying values for a number of structural properties. The effect of each variation indicates what properties that will have the largest effect on the behaviour of the finished structure and points out where focus shall be laid when optimising the design of a high CFRD. The outcome of the FEM analysis shows the static comportment of the rockfill body and its concrete face at two stages, at the end of construction and after reservoir impoundment. The difference between the two provides data on what effects the water load would cause, which constitute the main displacements of the concrete slabs. It is evident from the obtained results that the most important of the studied parameters alongside with the level of compaction is the geometrical extension downwards and inwards of the zone subject to increased compaction. A higher degree of compaction will always produce a beneficial decrease of settlements but might not always be economically <b>legitimate</b> as <b>costs</b> rapidly increase with higher levels of compaction. An adequate level of a CFRD’s compaction increase can with advantage be determined by comparing different designs regarding the volumetric percentage to compact against the calculated decrease in slab deflection...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} provide {{justification}} {{for the creation of}} my thesis project: the creation of a childbirth and family planning resource for the Health Extension Workers of the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. Building on knowledge of visual literacy studies, health education trends and my own interviews with Health Extension Workers in the Oromia Region, it is my suggestion that focusing on the education of community based health workers, by providing them with custom designed health education materials, is a <b>legitimate</b> and <b>cost</b> effective strategy for improving health worker performance, increasing populace utilization of health system services and better educating the populace at large. Illustrated health education materials can improve retention of key health message in semi-literate communities and illustrated reference materials can be valuable to community health workers who may have little formal training. Such materials are an essential input into the work of Health Extension Workers (HEWs) in Ethiopia—a new category of health workers that has recently been introduced by the government to provide health education and preventative care in rural populations. We carried out a preliminary survey of 60 HEWs in Jimma region in southwestern Ethiopia to investigate the appropriateness of illustrated health messages in materials commonly available to the workers. We found that HEWs had difficulty understanding locally available illustrated health messages and using them in their health education work because these materials were not relevant to regional health, language and culture. Within the Ethiopian framework, the Health Extension Worker and her community will additionally benefit from a childbirth and family planning resource manual for reasons relating both to country health indicators, and national political frameworks. There is an inherent need to design an educational material not simply produce it, especially with respect to a highly technical manual on childbirth. The design strategy employed with this project utilizes the assumption that a useful language will provide HEWs with a relevant verbal context for understanding included visual aids. Because they are literate, HEWs are {{likely to be able to}} understand a more technical manual, especially if it is illustrated...|$|R

Study Design: Patients with a primary diagnosis of CAP {{were enrolled in}} a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled Phase III clinical trial. Both inpatients and outpatients were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: (1) intravenous (IV) or po levofloxacin; or (2) IV ceftriaxone and/or po cefuroxime axetil. Methods: To make <b>legitimate</b> and meaningful <b>cost</b> comparisons between similar types of patients receiving drugs via the same route of administration (ie, orally), this outpatient economic study examined the resource utilization of the 211 patients enrolled as outpatients who received oral formulations as initial treatment (levofloxacin, 103 patients; cefuroxime axetil, 108 patients). Resource utilization data and clinical trial data were collected concurrently. To generate cost estimates, Medicare cost estimates for resources were multiplied by the resource units used by patients in each treatment arm. Results: Cost estimates indicated a total cost difference that favored the levofloxacin group (base case: 169; sensitivity analysis: 223 [P =. 008]). The results for the base case were not significant (P =. 094). In addition, within the cost categories, there was a statistically significant study drug cost differential favoring levofloxacin (86; P =. 0001 for both the base case and sensitivity analysis).

This is particularly important for less developed countries (LDC) who do not maintain satellite or regional testing facilities. As part of a proposed protocol to assess field portable detection equipment, an ultrafast liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of liquid formulation Oxytocin was developed. The six minute method was found to have a within run %bias of +/- 16 %, a linear dynamic range of 150 - 1000 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml), and an accuracy within acceptability criteria for all tested concentrations. 	The effectiveness of three identified transition ions, 723. 1, 86. 2 and 70. 1 Daltons, for the analysis of oxytocin by mass spectrometry was assessed across several figures of merit to include signal to noise ratio, %CV, calibration sensitivity, and analytical sensitivity. The 723. 1 ion fragment was recommended for quantification, while the 70. 1 dalton ion was recommended as a qualifier ion, although 86. 2 also performed within acceptability criteria.

40|$|Will {{environmental}} issues challenge the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ? Calls {{for a new}} round of multilateral trade negotiations on the environment have multiplied. Environmentalists have kept up pressure to modify GATT. Industries with higher environmental costs may seek protection from imports. But the GATT, as a trade forum, is not the right place to discuss environmental solutions, contends the author. Focusing on trade will only distract attention from the true causes of environmental problems. Legitimate environmental policies conflict little with GATT rules because the source of most environmental problems is not trade but prices that do not reflect environmental cost, subsidies to environmentally damaging activities, or unclear property rights. Furthermore, the GATT imposes few constraints on the setting of domestic standards and environmental policies, so there is no environmental need to modify the GATT. On the contrary, by limiting the use of trade measures, which make for poor environmental policies, GATT rules support good environmental practice. By restricting unilateral recourse to trade sanctions, Gatt rules respect sovereignty and help contain power-based abuse of the trading system. In a number of areas, however, the rules are subject to wide-ranging interpretation and would benefit from clarification. This applies especially to GATT's relationship with international agreements and also, in some cases, to the unilateral use of trade sanctions. Industries and policy-makers also call for clearer rules for the application of environmental policies with trade effects. Any attempt at unilateralism should be avoided. A closer look reveals some anomalies in the GATT with regard to environmental policy; these may merit further discussion. GATT rules on border adjustment may encourage the use of indirect policies, since these can be extended to competing imports. Indirect policies can lead to environmental costs being passed on to importers, or to double taxation of environmental <b>costs.</b> <b>Legitimate</b> policies may be left out for lack of specific reference to the environment Article XX. GATT subsidy rules may constrain burden sharing options for environmental policies.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of process orientation at Aker Verdal was enhanced by a cooperative information system (CIS) that supported process management {{with the right}} information, at the right time, at the right place, etc. A CIS {{is based on the}} assumption that agents, both human and computerized, share goals and cooperate towards the shared goals. To ensure the continued cooperation of agents towards shared goals, a CIS needs to be able to deal with changes. In the context of understanding and managing change, change-related issues for information systems can be seen to arise from three facets of concern – systems, group cooperation, and organizational – and the interactions among them. The systems facet specifies how information is to be processed making best use of existing systems. The group cooperation facet is concerned with how people working on a common business process can coordinate their activities. The organizational facet is concerned with managing work from a formal organizational perspective, regardless of by whom (the group cooperation facet) or with what technology (the systems facet). The {{implementation of}} a CIS to support process management in an offshore workshop was enabled by four major areas: (1) cooperative learning culture, (2) coordination mechanisms, (3) integrating infrastructure middleware, and (4) organizational structure. A cooperative learning culture implies that people working on a common process share goals and cooperate towards the shared goals. Coordination mechanisms help to understand the wider context of modeling artifacts in a model-driven change management approach. Integrating infrastructure middleware are software components that can be used to support flexible, incremental and bottom-up integration of information systems. Organizational structure involves focusing on organizational structural properties that ease the implementation of new information and communication technology.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between approaches to people management and competitiveness, by examining the case of the textile and clothing industry in Southern Africa. The textile and clothing industry has historically {{played a major role in}} many national economies (including many southern African countries) contributing not only to overall economic growth, but also to the creation of significant numbers of relatively well-paid jobs. In the Southern African Region (SAR), the textile and clothing industry has undergone many structural pressures in the face of increased cheap imports from South-East Asian countries – above all, China and Bangladesh - which have resulted in the closure of many firms, and the significant downsizing of many survivors. This study seeks to explore the relationship between HR practice and organizational sustainability in the textile and clothing industry in Southern Africa region, with a particular emphasis on the cases of three countries: South Africa, Mauritius and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Whilst at very different stages of national development, and with distinct political and developmental histories, all three countries were subject to active industrial policies, including the development of national clothing and textile industries. Again, all have faced the challenge of sustaining these industries in the face of liberalization and intensive competition from the Far East. This study is based on a multi-method approach, combining in-depth interviews with national industry surveys, and the usage of relevant documentary sources. It takes cognizance of the increasing relevance of new HRM practices and discourses to the growing field of Development Studies in the 21 st century. The existing HRM literature suggests that there are a number of alternative people management strategies through which firms may secure their competitiveness, most notably strategic approaches to hard HRM (which treats people as an instrument to be strategically deployed to promote competitiveness), soft HRM (which promotes cooperative approaches to managing people) and traditional labour repression (managing people simply as a cost, to be managed in a short-term, un-strategic manner). The literature on HRM in Africa has suggested an alternative paradigm, which combines autocratic paternalism with elements of communitarianism. This study found that the bulk of firms encompassed by the study employed HR policies that recognizably fell within the soft HRM paradigm, enabling high value added production. However, an important exception lies in the area of security of tenure: firms tended to combine high levels of employee involvement and participation; as well as a commitment to human resource development, along with a persistent reliance on the usage of redundancies to adjust changes in the relative need for labour. Hence, this study highlights the limitations of theoretical approaches which see HR strategies as being necessarily coherent and self-reinforcing. Firms may broadly adhere to one approach, whilst adopting aspects of another as needs arise and in response to external pressures. An important exception to this was Mauritius, in which security of tenure appeared to be stronger, perhaps owing to the greater ease of enforcing regulations against illegal imports in a relatively small island country by allowing firms to plan for the future with greater confidence. In contrast, firms in South Africa were characterized by much lower security of tenure, against a backdrop of declining profits, reflecting the competitive challenges posed not only by <b>legitimate</b> low <b>cost</b> imports, but also illegal imports and the proliferation of rural sweatships. One again, this study highlights the relative fragility of the position of many firms and the continued importance of governmental support, most notably in terms of export incentives, support and facilitation in the adoption of new technologies, as well as better policing against illegal imports...|$|R
40|$|NZIER {{was engaged}} by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide {{technical}} assistance to feed into New Zealand’s contribution to the APEC ‘Collective Strategic Study on Issues related to the Realisation of the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific’. The focus of this assistance was on quantifying the costs of nontariff measures in the APEC region.  Our paper aims to present some initial estimates of the potential costs of NTMs in the Asia-Pacific, by sector and by economy. We hope that it generates further debate and discussion, {{given the importance of}} the topic and the paucity of empirical estimates currently available.   Key points Asia-Pacific trade is characterised by the increased use of non-tariff measures. 	As tariff levels fall over time, the use of non-tariff measures (NTMs) has become more common in the Asia-Pacific region. 	NTMs are regulatory tools, other than standard border tariffs, that can have potential economic effects on trade – either a decrease in quantities traded, an increase in their price, or some combination of both. 	The total number of NTMs within APEC has increased by 74 % from 814 in 2004 to 1, 414 in 2015. All NTMs impose costs on businesses and households 	While some NTMs are put in place for legitimate public policy reasons, such as consumer safety or for protecting human, animal and plant health, others are used for more nefarious, intentionally trade-distorting purposes. 	Even the <b>legitimate</b> NTMs impose <b>costs</b> on domestic and foreign firms and households, which can often outweigh their domestic welfare benefits. 	Asia-Pacific economic integration is characterised by multi-country Global Value Chains, and the costs of NTMs accumulate along these chains. 	Reducing the costs of NTMs is therefore important for lowering firms’ transaction costs and improving competitiveness. 	Ultimately this will benefit consumers through lower prices for traded goods and services. NTMs in the APEC region are three times as costly as tariffs; imposing costs of US$ 790 billion per year 	We estimate that the ad valorem equivalent of NTMs in APEC is 9. 7 %, compared to an average APEC tariff of 2. 9 %. 	NTMs are particularly costly in sectors like dairy, rice, meat and horticultural products. 	NTMs cost APEC economies some US$ 790 billion each year, around three times as much as tariffs. New Zealand’s exporters face NTM costs of US$ 5. 9 billion. 	The overall cost of NTMs on New Zealand’s primary sector exports to APEC economies is US$ 4. 7 billion (based on 2011 trade). For our overall export portfolio, the cost is US$ 5. 9 billion. 	The vast majority of these costs are imposed on the dairy (US$ 2. 7 billion), beef (US$ 768 million) and food products sectors (US$ 717 million). 	Our initial estimates of the costs of NTMs point to the potential gains that could be made through researchers and policymakers more proactively addressing the most trade-distorting, discriminatory and hence welfare-reducing NTMs...|$|R
40|$|Since first being {{pronounced}} in 1984, the phrase "information {{wants to be}} free" has echoed through the corridors of information management as a rallying cry, an aspiration, and a fact. But can it be true? The champions of Web 2. 0 propose {{that we live in}} an age when anyone can be a publisher. Wiki media and institutional repositories allow authors to publish freely and allow users free access. No-fee services are widely available for blogs, instantaneous status updates, and widespread dissemination of even the most trivial communications, to even the most micro-scale niche audiences. Have we finally reached an age when information can really be free? The costs of producing information are undeniable. The funding models for publishing it are clearly shifting, and the business of scholarly communication is being revolutionized???increasingly corporatized on the one hand, and in search of viable open-source options on the other. It is critical that information professionals examine the economic issues of information distribution during this transformation process to ensure greatest success for reliable, stable, accessible, and equitable dissemination of scholarly knowledge. This poster examines the real financial costs of producing and providing information. Open publishing formats depend on actual people doing actual work???often unseen and unacknowledged. The chain of funding and support for academic research is complicated and hierarchical; researchers providing knowledge "for free" as a service to their field are typically drawing a salary from the university, which is itself funded by taxpayers and donors. Research is funded by corporate grants and academic salaries. Yet would deducting the acknowledged costs of research and publication create a free-information model? We conclude that it would not. By comparing the costs of traditional publishing with their open-access "cost-free" alternatives, we find that we still cannot eliminate the actual expenses of publishing scholarly research. Development costs for open-access architecture remain <b>legitimate</b> and undissolvable <b>costs,</b> regardless of access philosophy. When research is posted, hosted, edited, and peer-reviewed voluntarily by an open scholastic community, we may remove those fiscal expenses from the publication equation. What remains???the invisible work of infrastructure, architecture, testing, implementation, and the like???must still be funded. From software developers to hardware assembly line workers, the work of non-academic participants cannot be deducted from the university funding model. Additionally, the open-publishing options that require unpaid scholarly services still depend on a variation of the traditional forcompensation economic model: We trade the commodity of time for the currencies of information exchange, academic prestige, and publication credit. We rely increasingly on unpaid academic labor for editing and vetting scholarly output. These "free" services are not without costs. Mindful of the time and skill put into this work, the community must examine the ethics of using "free" labor. What are the guarantors of quality in a nocompensation work-place? How much are faculty willing to contribute beyond being on reviewing boards? Will they, and can they, perform the tasks that hired professional copy editors, indexers, proofreaders, and catalogers once performed? What price do faculty pay for the increased pressure to donate extracurricular labor? Acknowledging the real costs of open-access scholarly publication will better enable information professionals to seek reasonable long-term solutions to the problems of information distribution. Ignoring these costs leaves information vulnerable to corporate influence and to obsolescence. Moreover, suggesting that information wants to be free disregards the morality of compensating all players???not just the professors and journal editors, but the code scripters and the server masters and the thirdshift IT techs???for real work provided. In the end, information may want to be free, but it is unlikely that it ever will be...|$|R
