40|$|Background: Disturbed {{psychiatric}} inpatients {{are managed}} using {{a range of}} <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> (e. g. seclusion, mechanical restraint) whose use differs by country. Little is known about why these differences exist, or about how staff choose between the different methods available to them. Aims: To compare psychiatric professionals attitudes to <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> between countries with different practices, and to discover what factors have {{the greatest impact on}} preparedness to use a containment method. Method: Surveys of psychiatric professionals in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, and Australia, using the Attitude to <b>Containment</b> <b>Measures</b> Questionnaire. Results: Relative approval of different <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> broadly matched what we know about different practices, with some notable differences. Staff in Finland expressed the highest level of approval of containment, staff in the UK the least, with those in the Netherlands in between. Individuals’ preferences for different <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> were largely determined by whether they considered it (i) safe for the patients undergoing it, (ii) prevented them from injuring others, and (iii) quickly calmed them. Conclusion: Future evaluation research on <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> should use time taken to calm the patient, injury to patients and others, as primary outcomes. National clinical audit and injury reporting systems would also enable the identification of methods that are truly physically injurious to patients, aiding in the rational selection of appropriate <b>containment</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

Cleanup costs are impacted by numerous factors such as location of the spill, type of oil spilled, surrounding sensitive areas, and local regulations. For example, the average cost of cleanup (per ton) after an oil spill is drastically different for a spill in the Gulf of Mexico than it would be in South American waters, where there is a difference of almost $70,000. Instead of paying for a costly cleanup, <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> reduce the impact on the environment and the surrounding area, and may save some of the resource.|$|R

The first offers a brief description of the Spanish Health Care System, with emphasis placed on the issue of expenditure control and health planning targets. The second part outlines a set of cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> that has accompanied the process of extending universal health care coverage which occured during the mentioned period and which has helped keep public expenditure under control.

During a recession health-care expenditures are often among the first to be cut. However, what is occurring in daily practice {{from the point of view}} of care has not been documented to date. Describing the cost containment interventions undertaken and their effects as perceived in daily practice by Italian nurses was the aim of the study. A longitudinal study design was adopted from 2010 to 2011 involving 1, 001 nurses each year. In the 2 -year period taken into consideration, participants reported a significant increase in the number of cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> adopted by their health-care organisations. The effects of these cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> have been perceived by nurses especially in terms of (1) increased stress levels, (2) increased number of patients with social problems, and (3) increased nursing workloads. In addition, greater difficulties in finding clinical placement for nursing students and fewer resources devoted to nursing professional development were reported, indicating that some cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> will have long- term effects.

40|$|Background: Disruptive {{behaviours}} {{of acute}} psychiatric inpatients have typically been studied separately, as have {{the methods used}} to contain them. There are indications that behaviours and containment methods are systematically related. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the frequency and relationship between the differing conflict behaviours of patients, and explore the relationship between professional <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> and those conflict behaviours. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of conflict behaviours and containment of 238 two-week admissions to 12 acute psychiatric wards in London, UK was carried out. Results: Factor analysis revealed seven patterns of conflict behaviours, with aggression being separately associated with absconding and medication refusal. Neither substance misuse nor self-harm were associated with aggression. Aggressive behaviour attracted the widest range of <b>containment</b> <b>measures,</b> including the use of special observation. Conclusions: The conflict behaviours of patients form complex patterns, and should be studied together rather than separatel...|$|R

Different methods are used to contain these behaviours, and there is international variation in which are approved of or used. Previous research suggests that staff attitudes to patients may affect their willingness to use, or choice of, method. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the relationship between approval of <b>containment</b> <b>measures,</b> perception of aggression and attitude to personality disorder. A survey of student psychiatric nurses was conducted, and using three attitudinal questionnaires related to aggression and containment. An association was found between positive attitude to patients and the approval of containment methods that involved nurses being in personal contact with patients. There was evidence that students’ attitudes to patients deteriorated over time.

40|$|The {{biological}} hazards {{posed by}} micro-organisms have lead to their categorisation into risk {{groups and the}} elaboration of classification lists. Current classification systems rely on criteria defined by the World Health Organization, considering {{the severity of the}} disease the micro-organism might cause, its ability to spread and the availability of prophylaxis or efficient treatment. Animal pathogens are classified according to the definitions of the World Organization of Animal Health whereby also economic aspects are considered. In Europe, classification is often directly linked to <b>containment</b> <b>measures.</b> The Belgian classification however, considers only the inherent characteristics of the micro-organism, not its use, making it independent of <b>containment</b> <b>measures.</b> Also a common list for human and animal pathogens is elaborated, allowing a comprehensive approach.

This paper describes the particularities of the Belgian classification and the methodology that was used for its peer-reviewed revision, hereby focusing on animal pathogens. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, animal cell culturing has been {{essential}} for biomedical research and biotechnological activities in general. Along with this increasing importance, biosafety concerns have pointed to the risks of manipulating animal cell cultures for {{human health and the}} environment. A maximal reduction of these risks necessitates a thorough risk assessment of the cell cultures used. It involves an evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture, including subsequent properties acquired as a result of genetic modification, and the possibility that the cell culture may inadvertently or deliberately become contaminated with pathogens. The latter is a major hazard associated with the manipulation of animal cell cultures, as adventitious agents may be pathogenic and have a better capacity to survive in unfavorable conditions. Consequently, most of the <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the risks encountered during the handling of cell cultures should include considerations regarding the type of manipulation as well. As a rule, cell cultures known to harbor an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> recommended for the etiologic agent. With the exception of very well-characterized cell cultures for which the use of a type II biosafety cabinet depends on the origin of the cells, work with cell cultures from human or primate origin should generally and minimally be performed under containment level 2 using a type II biosafety cabinet. In every case, <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> should minimize adventitious contamination of the cell cultures and offer a maximal protection of human health and the environment...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: Owing to {{the growing}} health care {{expenditure}} {{and the need to}} improve efficiency, public authorities have since the 1980 s changed their policy with respect to health care. Financial pressures encouraged them to investigate methods to control health care costs. One recent method is the enactment of cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> based on clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) that provide financial or administrative sanctions. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This article describes the legal value of CPGs, the evolution towards cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> based on CPGs, and finally the legal value of these new cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures.</b> It questions whether these measures may {{have an impact on the}} medical liability rules and it wants to open the debate on the legal value of these measures based vis-à-vis the professional autonomy of the physician and patients' rights on quality care. METHODS: The research for this article is based on a comparative analysis of the legal literature and jurisprudence of a number of legal systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The article concludes that, as a result of the rising costs, it becomes increasingly difficult for a physician to balance his duty to take care on the one hand and his duty to control costs on the other. Maintaining a high standard of care towards patients becomes difficult. Consequently, one wonders whether the law should then allow the standard of care to be adjusted according to the available means. Until now, courts in a fault based system have not been willing to accept such an adjustment of the standard of care, but it might well be possible that this attitude will change in case of no-fault compensation systems. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In Minnesota, several {{health care}} cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures</b> {{occurred}} {{about the time}} Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) was implemented. These included a moratorium on additional nursing home beds, preadmission screening of nursing home applicants, and rapid growth in HMO (health maintenance organization) enrollment by Medicare recipients. Hospital days per elderly Medicaid recipient decreased by 38 percent for those in nursing homes and by 35 percent for those not in nursing homes from 1982 to 1984. By 1986, hospital days per recipient had decreased 53 and 55 percent, respectively, from the 1982 level. Age-adjusted mortality rates for elderly Medicaid nursing home residents for the period 1977 through 1986 showed an increasing trend after 1982. Estimated age-adjusted mortality rates for the entire County population, which had decreased steadily from 1970 to 1982, rose significantly above the projected rate in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987. We conclude that, coincident with {{the institution of the}} PPS and other health care cost <b>containment</b> <b>measures,</b> use of hospital care has fallen for all elderly Medicaid recipients, age-adjusted mortality rates among those in nursing homes have increased, and the mortality rate trend for the total Hennepin County elderly population has stopped declining...|$|R
