25|$|During 1841–1844, Štúr was {{co-editor of}} Palkovič's {{literary}} magazine, Tatranka. In 1841, he started activities aimed at publishing a Slovak political newspaper. He wrote defenses and polemic texts, {{as well as}} his Starý a nový věk Slovákov ("The old and the new age of the Slovaks"), written in Old Czech and published in 1935 (not in Slovak until 1994). On 16 August 1841, Štúr and his friends ascended Kriváň (a symbolic mountain in Slovak culture), an event that is now commemorated by annual excursions to its summit. In 1842, he initiated the first Slovenský prestolný prosbopis, a Slovak petition to the Royal Court in Vienna requiring the government to stop national persecutions by the Hungarians in Upper Hungary. His application for a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> a newspaper was turned down in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|The stated {{policy of}} the RAS is [...] "to focus on high quality papers through {{rigorous}} peer review and, as far as practicable, to provide free publication." [...] Authors are not charged for publishing in MNRAS, with the costs of publications being met by subscriptions. MNRAS provides a form of open access by providing authors with the option to pay for publication, allowing free access by anyone without charge (hybrid open-access model). Fellows of the RAS are given free online access to the RAS journals {{as part of their}} membership benefits. Downloadable PDF versions of MNRAS articles are made available 36 months after publication (delayed open-access model), on both the journal website and the Astrophysics Data System. MNRAS also permits self-archiving by authors on personal webpages, in institutional repositories, and on the arXiv server (green open access). Also, authors are provided with a link to a perpetually freely accessible PDF file, the idea being that the file itself should not be hosted by the author nor by anyone except the publisher, while the link to it can be freely distributed. [...] This is the modern equivalent of offprints, paper copies of the article which used to be provided to the author to distribute, freely, as he saw fit. Authors do not assign copyright to the RAS or OUP, but are required to grant an exclusive <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> the article prior to its publication.|$|E

E-learning research, as an emergent field in the UK, is highly political in nature (Conole & Oliver, 2007, p. 6) occupying a complex landscape which houses policy-makers, researchers and practitioners. Increasingly and more interestingly, the landscape is being shaped by the narratives and experiences of the learners themselves (Creanor et al., 2006, Conole et al., 2006) {{and the use of}} Web 2. 0 technologies. However, as Laurillard (2007, p. xv) reminds us we still, ‘tend to use technology to support traditional modes of teaching’ and ‘we scarcely have the infrastructure, the training, the habits or the access to the new technology, to be optimising its use just yet’ (p. 48). Web 2. 0 spaces, literacies and practices offer the possibility for new models of education (Mayes & de Freitas, 2007, p. 13) which support iterative and integrative learning but as educators and higher educational establishments are we prepared and ready to re-think our pedagogies and re-do (Beetham & Sharpe 2007, p. 3) our practices? This concise paper will reflect upon how the use of new learning landscapes such as eportfolios might offer us the opportunity to reflect upon the implications of letting in the e-learning eportfolio Trojan mouse (Sharpe & Oliver, 2007, p. 49) ...|$|R

50|$|Voltaire's next play, , set {{in ancient}} Macedonia, opened on 15 February 1720. It was a flop and only {{fragments}} of the text survive.

50|$|This {{novel is}} {{one of a number of}} Virgin Doctor Who novels which sell for far in excess of their cover price, {{especially}} on online auction sites such as eBay and Amazon.
