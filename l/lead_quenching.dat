Lead and lead oxide scavenge radical intermediates in combustion reactions. Engine knock {{is caused by a}} cool flame, an oscillating low-temperature combustion reaction that occurs before the proper, hot ignition. <b>Lead</b> <b>quenches</b> the pyrolysed radicals and thus kills the radical chain reaction that would sustain a cool flame, preventing it from disturbing the smooth ignition of the hot flame front.

40|$|Abstract—When a {{superconductor}} is {{fed with}} an alternating current, {{the temperature rise}} created by the losses tends to reduce the current carrying capacity. If the amplitude of the current exceeds {{the value of the}} critical current, then the losses become particularly high and the thermal heating considerable. In this paper, a numerical and an analytical model which allow to estimate AC transport losses are presented. These models, which use the expression of c () and (), are available for any applied current (below and above c). The results are compared and the validity of the analytical model is considered. Then, the analytical formula allows to easily obtain the thermoelectric balance point of the system, when the losses and the temperature do not vary any more. Moreover, a maximum value of the current transport, beyond which the balance point does not exist, is detected. Indeed, when this maximum value is exceeded, the system is not stable and, say, superconducting current <b>leads</b> may <b>quench.</b> Index Terms—AC losses, Bi- 2223 current <b>lead,</b> over current, <b>quench,</b> temperature dependence.

Commercially available silica particles (20 nm diameter) were functionalized with triethoxysilane derivatives of selective Cu(II) ligands and fluorescent dyes. Grafting of the sensor components to the particle surface ensures the spatial proximity between the sensor components and, as a consequence, binding of Cu(II) ions by the ligand subunits <b>leads</b> to <b>quenching</b> of the fluorescent units emission.

Sensors with the desired photophysical properties can be easily prepared by using different fluorescent dyes. Moreover, the organization of the network of sensor components gives rise to cooperative and collective effects: on one hand, the ligand subunits bound to the particle surfaces cooperate to form multivalent binding sites with an increased affinity for the Cu(II) ions; on the other hand, binding of a single metal ion <b>leads</b> to the <b>quenching</b> of several fluorescent groups producing a remarkable signal amplification...|$|R
