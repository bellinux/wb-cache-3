40|$|Retarding {{action of}} many sorts of inhibitors on the {{reaction}} between aluminum particles and carbon tetrachloride {{was reported in}} the previous many papers. Now, analogous studies with mercaptanes as inhibitor are carried out and further more solvent effects of <b>ligroins</b> are checked. The outline of results may be summarized in the following: (1) N-alkyl-, sec-(iso-) alkyl mercaptanes prolonged the induction period, but tert-alkyl mercaptanes did not affect that period irrespective their carbon number. (2) ln the mercaptanes having lower alkyl, the order of the prolonged effect is shown as follows: n-<sec-(iso) <tert-. (3) It is recognized that aromatic mercaptanes are more valid for prolonging the induction period than aliphatic mercaptanes. (4) Since mercaptanes is weaker agents for coordinating with produced AlCl_ 3 and less reactive for aluminum particles than corresponding alcohols, the former is inferior to the latter for prolonging the induction period. (5) ln the case of pretreatment of aluminum particles, benzyl mercaptane is inferior to tert-butyl, but regarding to washing effect, if any benzyl mercaptane is sorped (chemical sorpticn) on the surface of aluminum particles, this film is very powerful. (6) In solvent effect, the induction period is shortened with a narrow range having the small quantity, but is prolonged with the quantity beyond that range. アルミニウム粒と四塩化炭素の反応について，各種の阻害剤の添加効果の研究に対しては従来浅岡らが多数の報告を行って来ている。本報ではこれらに関連して，メルカプタン類添加の場合と，溶媒としてリグロインを添加した場合の誘導期におよぼす影響について行ったものである...|$|R

5000|$|Petroleum benzine is a {{hydrocarbon}} based solvent mixture that {{is classified}} by its physical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure) {{rather than a}} specific chemical composition, often obfuscating distinction within {{the long list of}} petroleum distillate solvent mixtures: mineral spirits, naphtha, white spirits, petroleum spirits, turps substitute, mineral turpentine, petroleum benzine, petroleum ether, <b>ligroin,</b> and Stoddard Solvent. The chemical composition of a petroleum distillate can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and aromatic content. Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the aromatic content of petroleum distillate solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that [...] "To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit." [...] Petroleum spirit is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 °C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as hydrotreated light petroleum distillates comprising ≥ 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‘Benzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters’ Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.|$|E

After polymerization had produced evidence of some conversion (as indicated by the attached viscometer), the reaction tubes were cooled in a Dry Ice acetone bath. The contents of the tube were then subjected to a purifying procedure which for this system required that the mixture of monomer and polymer be precipitated four times from a dioxane solution by a four fold excess of <b>ligroin.</b> This procedure was deduced from preliminary solubility studies of monomer and polymer. The purifying procedure was tested by preparing synthetic mixtures of both monomers and polymers in proportions which amounted to a ten percent conversion of monomer to polymer. From the results of the test of the purification procedure a correction factor was calculated by which the experimentally determined values of the polymer composition were corrected. The calibration factors were determined by analyzing known mixtures of the two homopolymers. Five copolymerization runs were made in bulk at 65 ° with 0. 5 [...] 0. 6 mole percent initiator (dibenzoyl peroxide) to low conversion. The values for the relative reactivity ratios are as follows: r 1 = 2. 12, r 2 = 0. 36. These were determined by plotting the data according to the equations of Fineman and Ross: F(f- 1) /f = r 2 *(F 2 /f) -r 2 (f- 1) /F= -r 2 *(f/F 2) + r 1 where F=F 1 /F 2 (F 1 and F 2 are the initial mole fractions of monomers in the charge) f=f 1 /f 2 (f 1 and f 2 are the mole fractions of the polymers). In order to visualize the accuracy of the results a theoretical curve of incremental polymer composition as a function of monomer composition was constructed using the above values of r 1 and r 2. The experimental points were then placed on the same curve. All the points fell close to the curve thus indicating acceptable results...|$|E
