25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the greater {{predictability}} in economic and financial performance associated with the Great Moderation caused firms to hold less capital and to be less concerned about <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions.</b> This, in turn, is thought to have been a factor in encouraging increased debt levels and a reduction in risk premia required by investors.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} theory of {{international}} indebtedness over time {{from the viewpoint of}} both the demand and the supply of international credit. The demand for foreign credit depends ultimately on the optimal trade-off between financing and correcting external deficits, subject to the constraint of availability of credit. The conditions for debt crises to arise are analysed. The overall supply of international credit depends mainly on trade imbalances and on the rate of growth of international reserves. The supply of credit for a single country depends on risk indicators related to its solvency and <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, {{one of the most}} prominent examples of unconventional monetary stimulus was Japan's "quantitative easing policy" (QEP). Most analysts agree that QEP did not succeed in stimulating aggregate demand sufficiently to overcome persistent deflation. However, it remains unclear whether QEP simply provided little stimulus, or whether its positive effects were overwhelmed by the contractionary forces in Japan's post-bubble economy. In the spirit of Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Hosono (2006), this paper uses bank-level data from 2000 to 2009 to examine the effectiveness in promoting bank lending of a key element of QEP, the Bank of Japan's injections of liquidity into the interbank market. We identify a robust, positive, and statistically significant effect of bank <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions</b> on lending, suggesting that the expansion of reserves associated with QEP likely boosted the flow of credit. However, the overall size of that boost was probably quite small. First, the estimated response of lending to <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions</b> in our regressions is small. Second, much of the effect of the BOJ's reserve injections on bank liquidity was offset as banks reduced their lending to each other. Finally, the effect of liquidity on lending appears to have held only during the initial years of QEP, when the banking system was at its weakest; by 2005, even before QEP was abandoned, the relationship between liquidity and lending had evaporated.

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{liquidity}} held by banks on their accounts {{can be a}} lot less (and usually is) than the total value of transferred payments during a day. The total amount of liquidity needed by banks to settle a given set of payments is dependent on the balancedness of the circulation of money from account to account (reciprocity of payments), the timing of payments and the netting procedures used. The inability of some participants to send payments can cause severe falls in settlement ratios of payments. The failure of one participant to send payments can have negative contagion effects on other participants' <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions</b> and their potential to send payments.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{assesses the}} impact of the fixed-rate full-allotment {{procedure}} implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) in October 2008 on the functioning of the interbank money market. More specifically, our work examines whether the excess <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions</b> of financial institutions observed during the fixed-rate full-allotment period have altered the activity and the liquidity of the overnight segment of the euro area money market. In normal times, the limited amount of excess liquidity makes the dynamics of the money market insensitive to it. In contrast, the introduction of the fixed-rate full-allotment procedure – as one prominent unconventional measure of the ECB – has made the dynamics of the money market growingly dependent on the time-varying level of excess liquidity in the euro area...|$|R
50|$|In 2004, it {{was closed}} down by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the {{national}} banking regulator. The assets of the bank were merged with those of Barbican Bank and Royal Bank Zimbabwe, both of which had also been shut down by RBZ, to form Zimbabwe Allied Banking Group (ZABG). The major reason was that the bank was illiquid and its managers had been irresponsible in managing depositors's funds. Prior to this corrective action, Trust has suffered a ZW$7 billion fraud committed by its own staff. This was attributed to weak controls and risk management systems. This worsened its <b>liquidity</b> <b>position,</b> which had hitherto started to deteriorate.|$|E
50|$|Alan Greenspan (1999) {{discusses}} {{management of}} foreign exchange reserves and suggested a measure called Liquidity at risk. A country's <b>liquidity</b> <b>position</b> under a range of possible outcomes for relevant financial variables (exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads, etc.) is considered. It {{might be possible to}} express a standard in terms of the probabilities of different outcomes. For example, an acceptable debt structure could have an average maturity—averaged over estimated distributions for relevant financial variables—in excess of a certain limit. In addition, countries couldbe expected to hold sufficient liquid reserves to ensure that they could avoid new borrowing for one year with a certain ex ante probability, such as 95 percent of the time.|$|E
50|$|A {{surplus of}} {{liabilities}} over assets creates {{the need to}} find efficient uses for those funds, i.e. a positive mismatch {{that is not a}} wrong signal (generally a rare scenario in a bank as the bank always has a target return on capital to achieve and so requires funds to be put to work by acquiring assets) but only means that the bank is sacrificing profits unnecessarily to achieve a <b>liquidity</b> <b>position</b> that is too liquid. This excess of liquidity can be deployed in money market instruments or risk-free assets such as government T-bills or bank certificate of deposit (CDs) if this liability excess belongs to bank's capital (the ALM desk will not take the risk of putting capital in a credit-risk investment).|$|E
40|$|Many {{central banks}} in {{emerging}} economies have used reserve requirements (RR) {{to alleviate the}} trade-off between financial stability and price stability in recent years. Notwithstanding their widespread use, transmission channels of RR have remained largely as a black-box. In this paper, we use bank-level data to explore the interaction between RR and bank lending behavior. Our empirical findings suggest that short-term borrowing from the central bank is not a close substitute for deposits for banks. Bank lending behavior responds significantly to reserve requirements and <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions.</b> Our analysis allows us to identify a new channel that we name as the "liquidity channel".

40|$|We study {{differences}} in the price paid for liquidity across banks using price data at the individual bank level. Unique to this paper, we also have data on individual banks' reserve requirements and actual reserve holdings, thus allowing us to gauge {{the extent to which}} a bank is short or long liquidity. We find that the price a bank pays for liquidity depends on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions</b> of other banks, as well as its own. There is evidence that liquidity squeezes occasionally occur and short banks pay more the larger is the potential for a squeeze. The price paid for liquidity is decreasing in bank size and small banks are more adversely affected by an increased potential for a squeeze. Contrary to what one might expect, banks in formal liquidity networks do not pay less. [...] liquidity,banking,squeezes,money markets,repo auctions...|$|R

Using data from the syndicated loan market, we exploit variation in banks' reliance on wholesale funding and their structural <b>liquidity</b> <b>positions</b> in 2007 Q 2 to estimate the impact of exposure to market freezes during 2007 - 08 on the supply of bank credit. We find that banks with strong balance sheets were better able to maintain lending during the crisis. In particular, banks that were ex ante more dependent on market funding and had lower structural liquidity reduced the supply of credit more than other banks. However, higher levels of better-quality capital mitigated this effect. Our results suggest that strong bank balance sheets are key for the recovery of credit following crises, and provide support for regulatory proposals under the Basel III framework...|$|R
