40|$|Cash flow is {{the life}} blood of the {{construction}} industry and basically cash flow is majorly contributed by payment that gain. Unfortunately, <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> becomes a habit {{in the construction industry}} and this practice could turn the construction company to many implications such as bankruptcy, the higher the contract sum due to the risk, uncomfortable relationship between the payer and payee, disturbance supply chain and others. The objectives of this master project are to study the construction industry payment scenario, impact of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> to contractors, to identify the factors of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> in the construction industry and to identify methods for tackling <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> in the construction industry.

The collected data were analysed by using frequency distribution and relative important index. The results of the study show that the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> {{is one of the most}} critical problems in the Malaysian construction industry. The majority of the contractor experienced <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> quite frequently and even beyond the stipulated term. The top 3 impact of the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> problems is the negative chain effect on other parties, results in delay in completion projects and leads to bankruptcy or liquidation. The top 3 factors that contribute to the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> problem are disagree with the valuation of work done, technical problem and conflict among parties involve.

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are examined {{in an analysis}} of habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> of trade credit by UK small firms. Multivariate logistic regression is employed to test the influence of variables expected to discriminate between small firms which pay late habitually and those which never or only occasionally pay late. Case studies extend quantitative analysis by validating interpretation of the results and providing explanations for unexpected outcomes. The results provide strong evidence of a financing demand for habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment.</b> There is a positive relationship between habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and difficulty obtaining bank finance and <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> by debtors and a negative relationship with the use of long term sources of finance. The influence of relationships between customer and supplier is shown to be complex. A concentrated supplier base is shown to be positively associated with <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and case studies provide evidence that this is because increased knowledge of suppliers' credit management procedures is used to pay late without penalties. The implications of this result for the large number of firms that do not enforce their statutory right to interest on <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> are highlighted.

Courts and commissions have resisted this attack by classifying late charges in other ways, thereby increasing confusion among jurisdictions about the real nature of the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> charge.

40|$|The {{public sector}} {{is the biggest}} {{consumer}} of construction works in South Africa. Public sector is known for <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> to its service providers. This led to the study’s problem statement that stipulates that, the construction industry; particularly emerging contractors generally experience <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> from clients and employers. This {{is due to the}} fact that emerging contractors are vulnerable to failing as these contractors have limited financial resources and experience. The primary objective of the study was to develop a better understanding of the implications of <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> by the government on emerging construction contractors. The study therefore investigated the experiences of emerging construction contractors in the Eastern Cape. The secondary objectives of the study were: to identify the reasons for <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> by the public sector; determine the payment norms applicable to, and expectations of emerging construction contractors; establish construction contractors’ experiences with government payment methods; and to examine the implications of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> on emerging contractors and their businesses. The study was conducted within a qualitative research paradigm. The participants were identified through non-probability snowball sampling. The sample consisted of five emerging construction contractors mainly from the Civil Engineering and General Building sectors in the Eastern Cape. The data was collected using semi-structured interviewing and was analysed using Tesch’s qualitative analysis explained by Hesse-Biber & Leavy (2011 : 201). The key results of the empirical study show that <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> have incapacitating effects on the development of emerging contractors. The conclusion reached from the empirical study includes recommendation that construction industry stakeholders form payment legislation aimed at curbing the delay of payments...|$|R

The results show high variability of <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> during financial crisis compare to period of relative stable economic situations and <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> is significantly evident across countries under different economic conditions. Additionally, we identify positive relationship between the response variable, <b>late</b> <b>payments,</b> and firm profitability measured with returns on assets, but negative relationship with firm total assets as it depends on the speed of collections from receivables. The results suggest delays in payment of invoices beyond the given credit period across the different European Union member countries...|$|R
