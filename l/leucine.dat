In vivo assays revealed that SlMKK 2 interacted with the downstream MAPK SlMPK 3 independent of PCD elicitation and two conserved <b>leucines</b> in the D-site were required for both interaction with SlMPK 3 and PCD elicitation.

Mutation of distal <b>leucines</b> 499 L and 502 L (LL mutant) caused an inhibitory effect on Alix-dependent SIVsmE 543 release that was quantitatively similar to that observed following disruption of the type 3 L domain or RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of Alix.

Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation.

An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (<b>leucine,</b> isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role.

40|$|Neutron {{reflectometry}} {{has been}} used to study the structure of the biosurfactant, surfactin, at the air/water and at the hydrophobic solid/water interfaces. Three different deuterated surfactins were produced from the Bacillus subtilis strain: one perdeuterated, one with the four <b>leucines</b> perdeuterated, and one with everything except the four <b>leucines</b> perdeuterated. The neutron reflectivity profiles of these three samples in null reflecting water and in D 2 O with a seventh profile of the protonated surfactin in D 2 O were measured at pH 7. 5. This combination of different isotopic compositions made it possible to deduce the distribution of each type of labeled fragment in the surfactin. Surfactin is found to adopt a ball-like structure with a thickness of 14 ± Å and an area per molecule of 147 ± 5 Å 2. This makes it more like a hydrophobic nanoparticle, whose solubility in water is maintained only by its charge, than a conventional surfactant. This is probably what makes it surface-active at such low concentrations and what contributes to its forming very compact surface layers that are more dense than observed for most conventional amphiphiles. The reflectivity data were fitted by a model in which the structure of surfactin was divided into three fragments: the four <b>leucines</b> taken as a group, the hydrocarbon chain, and a hydrophilic group containing the two negative charges. An analysis of the reflectivity gave the following separations between fragments, where zero corresponds to the Gibbs plane for zero water adsorption: chain - water 7 Å, hydrophile - water 1 Å, and <b>leucines</b> - water 6. 5 Å, all ± 1 Å. The overall structure of the layer appears to be identical at a hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane-coated silicon surface where the thickness of the surfactin layer is 15 ± 1 Å and the area per molecule is 145 ± 5 Å 2. Finally, the structure of surfactin micelles has been examined by means of small-angle neutron scattering. The aggregation number was found to be unusually small at 20 ± 5.

40|$|Type III cytotoxins {{contribute}} {{to the ability of}} bacterial pathogens to subvert the host innate immune system. ExoS (453 amino acids) is a bifunctional type III cytotoxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Residues 96 to 232 comprise a Rho GTPase activating protein domain, while residues 233 to 453 comprise a 14 - 3 - 3 -dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase domain. An N-terminal domain (termed the membrane localization domain [MLD]) targets ExoS to the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum (Golgi-ER) of mammalian cells. This study identifies an amino acid motif that is responsible for the membrane binding properties of the MLD. Deletion mapping showed that the MLD included a symmetrical leucine-rich motif within residues 51 to 77 of ExoS. The terminal dileucines and internal <b>leucines</b> and an isoleucine within the MLD, but not charged or other hydrophobic residues, targeted a reporter protein to the Golgi-ER region of HeLa cells. Mutations of the <b>leucines</b> within the MLD did not affect type III secretion or translocation into HeLa cells but limited the ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate Ras GTPases. Mutations of charged residues within the MLD did not affect type III secretion, delivery into HeLa cells, or the ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate Ras GTPases. The organization of the <b>leucines</b> within the MLD of ExoS is different from that of previously described leucine-rich motifs but is present in several other bacterial proteins. This implies a role for intracellular targeting in the efficient targeting of mammalian cells by type III cytotoxins...|$|R
40|$|The Sec 61 translocon forms a pore to {{translocate}} polypeptide sequences {{across the}} membrane {{and offers a}} lateral gate for membrane integration of hydrophobic (H) segments. A central constriction of six apolar residues {{has been shown to}} form a seal, but also to determine the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration: Mutation of these residues in yeast Sec 61 p to glycines, serines, aspartates, or lysines lowered the hydrophobicity required for integration; mutation to alanines increased it. Whereas four <b>leucines</b> distributed in an oligo-alanine H segment were sufficient for 50 % integration, we now find four <b>leucines</b> in the N-terminal half of the H segment to produce significantly more integration than in the C-terminal half, suggesting functional asymmetry within the translocon. Scanning a cluster of three <b>leucines</b> through an oligo-alanine H segment showed high integration levels, except around the position matching that of the hydrophobic constriction in the pore where integration was strongly reduced. Both asymmetry and the position effect of H-segment integration disappeared upon mutation of the constriction residues to glycines or serines, demonstrating that hydrophobicity at this position within the translocon is responsible for the phenomenon. Asymmetry was largely retained, however, when constriction residues were replaced by alanines. These results reflect on the integration mechanism of transmembrane domains and show that membrane insertion of H segments strongly depends not only on their intrinsic hydrophobicity but also on the local conditions in the translocon interior. Thus, the contribution of hydrophobic residues in the H segment is not simply additive and displays cooperativeness depending on their relative position...|$|R

We show that the t peptide induces the misfolding of a fraction of AChE subunits, even when mutations disorganized the cluster of aromatic residues or when these residues were replaced by <b>leucines,</b> indicating that this effect is due to hydrophobic residues. Mutations in the aromatic-rich region affected the cellular fate of AChE in a similar manner, with or without mutations that prevented dimerization. Degradation was decreased and secretion was increased when aromatic residues were replaced by <b>leucines,</b> and the opposite occurred when the amphiphilic alpha helix was disorganized.

J. Hope, B. L. Bond, D. McDonald, N. P. Klein, and T. G. Parslow, J. Virol. 65 : 6001 - 6007, 1991). In this report, we (i) identify and characterize a position-independent 17 -amino-acid region of HTLV- 1 Rex that fully complements HIV- 1 Rev effector domain mutants and (ii) show that this 17 -amino-acid region and specific hydrophobic substitutions can serve as nuclear export signals. Mutagenesis studies revealed that four <b>leucines</b> within the minimal region were essential for function. Alignment of the minimal Rex region with the HIV- 1 Rev effector domain suggested that the position {{of some of the}} conserved <b>leucines</b> is flexible. We found two of the <b>leucines</b> could each occupy one of two positions {{within the context of the}} full-length HTLV- 1 Rex protein and maintain function. The idea of flexibility within the Rex effector domain was confirmed and extended by identifying functional substitutions by screening a library of effector domain mutants in which the two regions of flexibility were randomized. Secondly, the functional roles of the minimal Rex effector domain and hydrophobic substitutions were independently confirmed by demonstrating that these effector domains could serve as nuclear export signals when conjugated with bovine serum albumin. Nuclear export of the wild-type Rex conjugates was temperature dependent and sensitive to wheat germ agglutinin and was blocked by a 20 -fold excess of unlabeled conjugates. Together, these studies reveal that position-variable hydrophobic interactions within the HTLV- 1 Rex effector domain mediate nuclear export function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Latherin is an {{intrinsically}} surfactant protein of * 23 kDa {{found in}} the sweat and saliva of horses. Its function is probably to enhance the translocation of sweat water from the skin {{to the surface of}} the pelt for evapo-rative cooling.

However, the structural significance of its abundant noncoded residues (α-methylalanine or Aib) for its ion channel activity remains unknown, although {{a previous study}} showed that replacement of all Aib residues with <b>leucines</b> preserved the essential channel behavior except for much faster single-channel events. To correlate these functional properties with structural data, here we compare the secondary structures of an alamethicin derivative where all the eight Aibs were replaced by <b>leucines</b> and the native alamethicin. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of these peptides were recorded in methanol and in aqueous phospholipid membranes. Results obtained show a significant conformational change in alamethicin upon substitution of its Aib residues with Leu. The amide I band occurs at a lower frequency for the Leu-derivative indicating that its α-helices are involved in stronger hydrogen-bonding. In addition, {{the structure of the}} Leu-derivative is quite sensitive to membrane fluidity changes. The amide I band shifts to higher frequencies when the lipids are in the fluid phase. This indicates either a decreased solvation due to a more complete peptide insertion or a peptide stretching to match the full thickness of the bilayer.

25|$|The {{branched-chain}} {{fatty acid}} synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as primers. This system {{is distinct from}} the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers. α-Keto acid primers are derived from the transamination and decarboxylation of valine, <b>leucine,</b> and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from <b>leucine</b> {{may be used to}} form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selectivity}} {{underlying the}} recognition of oxidized calmodulin (CaM) by the 20 S proteasome in complex with Hsp 90 was identified using mass spectrometry. We find that degradation of oxidized CaM (CaMox) occurs in a multistep process, which involves an initial cleavage that releases a large N-terminal fragment (A 1 -F 92) as well as multiple smaller carboxyl-terminus peptides ranging from 17 to 26 amino acids in length. These latter small peptides are enriched in methionine sulfoxides (Met(O)), suggesting a preferential degradation around Met(O) within the carboxyl-terminal domain. To confirm the specificity of CaMox degradation and to identify the structural signals underlying the preferential recognition and degradation by the proteasome/Hsp 90, we have investigated how the oxidation of individual methionines affect the degradation of CaM using mutants in which all but selected methionines in CaM were substituted with <b>leucines.</b> Substitution of all methionines with <b>leucines</b> except Met 144 and Met 145 has no detectable effect {{on the structure of}} CaM, permitting a determination of how site-specific substitutions and the oxidation of Met 144 and Met 145 affects the recognition and degradation of CaM by the proteasome/Hsp 90. Comparable rates of degradation are observed upon the selective oxidation of Met 144 and Met 145 in CaM-L 7 relative to that observed upon oxidation of all nine methionines in wild-type CaM. Substitution of <b>leucines</b> for either Met 144 or Met 145 promotes a limited recognition and degradation by the proteasome that correlates with decreases in the helical content of CaM. The specific oxidation of Met 144 has little effect on rates of proteolytic degradation by the proteasome/Hsp 90 or the structure of CaM. In contrast, the specific oxidation of Met 145 results in both large increases in the rate of degradation by the proteasome/Hsp 90 and significant circular dichroic spectral shape changes that are indicative of changes in tertiary rather than secondary structure. Thus, tertiary structural changes resulting from the site-specific oxidation of a single methionine (i. e., Met 145) promote the degradation of CaM by the proteasome/Hsp 90, suggesting a mechanism to regulate cellular metabolism through the targeted modulation of CaM abundance in response to oxidative stress...|$|R

Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, <b>leucine,</b> and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of <b>leucine,</b> isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae.
