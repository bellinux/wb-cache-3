5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute. As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in case of an emergency, while attached to the carrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the D1A, based on the Heinkel He 66, an export model of the He 50, was {{designed}} as a biplane constructed of metal, with a fabric covering, a fixed landing gear and a conventional type tail <b>landing</b> <b>skid.</b> Original models had 365kW (490hp) engines and it was not until later models that more powerful 433kW (580hp) engines were included in the construction.|$|E
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> was mounted {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, cropped tipped elevators were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
5000|$|Both Dyna-Soar and Spiral were {{designed}} to <b>land</b> on <b>skids.</b> The <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> on Dyna-Soar {{were designed}} to deploy from insulated doors {{on the underside of}} the vehicle, like a conventional aircraft. Soviet engineers designed the <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> on Spiral to deploy from a set of doors on the sides of the fuselage just above and ahead of the wings.|$|R

5000|$|The EADS [...] "Scorpio" [...] is a {{much smaller}} {{battlefield}} helicopter, focused on special operations. It is also of conventional helicopter configuration, with a two-blade main rotor with Hiller-type stabilization paddles, an exposed two-blade tail rotor, and <b>landing</b> <b>skids.</b> A sensor turret may be fitted between the <b>landing</b> <b>skids.</b> There are several variants in the Scorpio line: ...|$|R
2500|$|The Ka 1 has a ply-covered, rounded wooden-framed {{fuselage}} {{but that}} of the Ka 3 is more angular, steel tube-framed, fabric covered and slightly longer. [...] Both have a simple, deep, sprung <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> reaching from the nose to under {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, assisted by a tail bumper. [...] Their cockpits are under the wing leading edge, into which the clear canopy extends.|$|E
2500|$|The Sb.1 had an {{open frame}} fuselage. A beam less than about [...] long {{served as a}} <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> and {{supported}} the controls and the pilot's {{seat in front of}} a square cross-section fairing which converged in boat-tail fashion in plan and elevation to a point only a short distance aft of the skid. [...] From the beam a pair of struts converged above the wing, the rear one almost vertical. Two pairs of steel tube struts, attached to {{the top and bottom of}} the rear upright, spread out into Vs to support the rectangular plan tailplane. The rest of the structure was wire-braced.|$|E
2500|$|Each wing was braced from {{a single}} point on the lower {{fuselage}} pod longeron to nose and rear spars at about 40% span by an faired V-strut. [...] There were a pair of sturdy, faired, vertical struts between the upper pod and the wing centre. The pod was flat sided, with angled upper and lower surfaces and on the Storch IV projected back almost to a line between the aileron trailing edges to provide some yaw stability. On the Storch V this provided a place to mount a small DKW [...] air-cooled two-stroke engine in pusher configuration with its output shaft just lower than the wing. [...] Enclosed within a humped, metal cowling, it proved difficult to cool, so it was generally run at less than full power. [...] There was a <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> under the pod which extended back past {{the end of the}} pod to protect the propeller.|$|E

50|$|The A600 Talon is a {{development}} of the RotorWay Exec and externally resembles the earlier design. The A600 incorporates a different structure, a shaft-driven tail rotor, taller and longer <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> and a new in-house developed turbocharged powerplant.|$|R
2500|$|Musterles wing {{was mounted}} over the {{fuselage}} on a low, ply covered pylon which blended into the fuselage and extended well behind the wing trailing edge, gradually decreasing in height. The fuselage was ply covered and ovoid in cross section, formed by ply covering over three longerons held in transverse frames; it was distinctly [...] pointed on its underside and tapered aft. [...] The cockpit was {{just ahead of}} the wing under a removable, largely ply cover; the only transparencies were the windscreen and a small rectangular roof window, though there were open circular portholes on either side. All tail surfaces were built in a similar way to the wing. [...] Both the tall rudder and elevators were all-moving and balanced, with straight edges and rounded tips. The elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage and the rudder extended down to the keel, so a generous cut-out in the elevators was provided for its movement. Musterle had a <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> under the forward fuselage, reaching back almost to the wing trailing edge, and a spring type tailskid.|$|E

50|$|Later {{modifications}} {{replaced the}} pontoons with <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> fashioned from automobile leaf springs, {{and the addition}} of twin McCulloch MC70 engines driving a common propeller in an unsuccessful attempt to motorise the aircraft. The prototype was later donated to the EAA AirVenture Museum.|$|R
50|$|Tubular <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> {{are often}} used by {{helicopters}} to save weight and complexity, {{as well as to}} allow the mounting of flotation devices. However, the danger of ground resonance may require dampers so touchdown shocks or jolts are not transmitted to the main rotor system.|$|R

50|$|The Basettino had a {{hexagonal}} section, plywood covered nacelle, with curved {{upper and}} lower surfaces. A deep, rubber sprung, wooden <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> on most of its underside formed its undercarriage. The pilot's cockpit, comfortable though open and without a windscreen, was placed below the wing leading edge.|$|E
50|$|According to the film's {{production}} executive, Jayan {{insisted on}} yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the <b>landing</b> <b>skids,</b> and later succumbed to his injuries.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{feedback}} from the Army during the evaluation, Seibel, shortened the fuselage of the second YH-24 (51-5113) and widened the cockpit for a co-pilot's seat next to the pilot's seat. Seibel also replaced that aircraft's original wheeled, tricycle undercarriage with <b>landing</b> <b>skids.</b> This aircraft would become the S-4B.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Venture {{was flat}} sided, with decking behind {{the wings and}} a shallow ventral extension from the wings forward. The latter carried a <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> with a fixed monowheel behind it, under the wing. A tail bumper completed the undercarriage. The open cockpit seated two side-by-side under the wing leading edge.|$|E
2500|$|In service between 1960 and 1972, the XM1 {{consisted}} of two [...]30-caliber M37C [...] machine guns mounted on the <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> of either the OH-13 or OH-23 helicopter. These weapons were fixed forward, but flexible in elevation, with their ammunition (500 rounds per gun) stored externally. The XM1E1 was the product engineering design.|$|R
2500|$|The UH-1 has a metal {{fuselage}} of semi-monocoque construction with tubular <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> and two {{rotor blades}} {{on the main}} rotor. [...] Early UH-1 models featured a single Lycoming T53 turboshaft engine in versions with power ratings from [...] to [...] [...] Later UH-1 and related models would feature twin engines and four-blade rotors.|$|R
50|$|Riot Control UAV {{developed}} by Skyview has entered service with PAP, which is {{specifically designed to}} meet the law enforcement requirement, hence the name Armed Police Custom Built Riot Control UAV (Wu-Jing Ding-Zhi Fang-Bao Wu-Ren-Ji, 武警定制防暴无人机). Riot Control UAV has a conventional helicopter layout and a pair of rails perpendicularly attached to the <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> provide four hardpoints.|$|R
50|$|A variant {{with much}} shorter barrels, {{designated}} the M195, was also developed {{for use on}} the M35 Armament Subsystem for use on the AH-1G Cobra helicopter. This variant fed from ammunition boxes fitted to the <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> and was developed to provide the AH-1 helicopter with a longer-range suppressive fire system before {{the adoption of the}} M97 Universal Turret mounting the M197 cannon.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the work-class ROVs are built as described above; however, {{this is not the}} only style in ROV building method. Smaller ROVs can have very different designs, each appropriate to its intended task. Larger ROVs are commonly deployed and operated from vessels, so the ROV may have <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> for retrieval to the deck.|$|R
50|$|SEAMOS owed much to DASH, {{and in fact}} a {{modified}} QH-50D {{was used as the}} SEAMOS demonstrator prototype. Like the original DASH, SEAMOS was a coaxial-rotor drone helicopter with twin <b>landing</b> <b>skids,</b> though it was unsurprisingly a more refined system, and in particular even had a real fuselage. SEAMOS was powered by an Allison 250-C20W turboshaft engine with 315 kW (420 shp).|$|R
50|$|On 4 December, an Australian EMU pilot rescued a South Vietnamese patrol boat, {{which had}} been {{disabled}} and was drifting towards the Viet Cong force that had attacked it and sunk a companion craft. Despite coming under fire, the pilot achieved this by entangling his Iroquois' <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> in the boat's superstructure and towing it away. He was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions.|$|R
