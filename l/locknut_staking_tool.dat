The most probable reason for non-uniform contact at the bearing interface appears to be due to improper staking of the bearing into the rod end top bore.

40|$|Landscape: <b>stake</b> and <b>tool</b> {{for land}} use planning. For last decades, {{landscape}} has gradually become a stake {{of land use}} planning in Europe. The European Landscape Convention formalizes landscape as an issue of general interest and promotes a democratic landscape planning. However, landscape is rarely in practice the subject of pluridisciplinary and concerted approaches. So land use planning searches for a landscape concept able to gather together the various disciplinary and societal points of view. This federative concept can help it to build concerted policies of landscape planning. To question about and clarify nature, scale and ways of reading of landscape then enable us to develop a landscape concept that holds two positions in land use planning. Firstly, landscape as we define it constitutes a stake of land use planning in line with its pluridisciplinary and concerted approach. Secondly, as tool of questioning and consciousness-raising about land use planning, landscape contributes to elaborate a concerted land management...|$|R

40|$|PosterFor {{the past}} two centuries, floods have led to serious damage on the railway network and its operation. Taking into {{consideration}} extreme floods in conception, maintenance, risk management for railway infrastructures {{is one of the}} current issues of the SNCF. SNCF archives about historical data related to flood events which have impacted the railway network are abundant but scattered around the country and unexploited. Gathering those data about floods and damages on railway in France caused by extreme flooding phenomenon is essential for the evaluation and better understanding of the risk. Indeed, this analysis of flood risks would enable its anticipation by setting up an appropriate surveillance, but also to manage the risk on the rail traffic, during and after the event, and finally to improve the network operation. Moreover, a space-time representation of data would present a consistent and chronological vision of events and would enable to determine socio-economic impact of those extreme events. The aim of the collaboration between SNCF and the SARDO SNCF, the BDHI team, IRSTEA, the LIG and ACHTYS Diffusion is on one hand to set up a methodology of flood data identification and assessment that {{can be found on the}} SCNF archives and, on the other hand, to develop an innovative work tool for space-time visualisation of historical events. That would enable to enlarge the floods consequences analysis from railway infrastructures damages to socio-economic impacts induced by transport network <b>stakes.</b> This <b>tool</b> will enable to optimize railway maintenance and railway traffic management costs according to the risks, in order to optimize the network operation...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{conditions}} of usage of public cost-benefit analysis {{are no longer}} met to-day {{in the field of}} infrastructure projects, for instance for transportation and other networks. When environmental conflicts are at <b>stake,</b> such a <b>tool</b> is no longer supporting both a decisionmaking process aiming at the general interest of society and decisions accepted by various parts of society. To elaborate assessment methods more appropriate to real {{conditions of}} decision- making and have them to bring support to coordination and conflict resolution, the building process and the output should respond to the general requirements of justification on the public arena. Methods should subsequently adapt to the existence of a handful of different justification orders in Western societies. Such orders quite often shock one another about environmental issues. All this urges a significant renewal of theoretical foundations and practices of assessment, with a special mention for revealed preferences theory, and an adaptation of the procedural conditions under which economic expertise is to be implemented, what has been achieved in other fields as food safety. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Examinations in {{undergraduate}} medical education consist {{to a large}} extent of Multiple Choice Questions. Clinical reasoning represents one core competency addressed by undergraduate medical education. Aim {{of this study is to}} approve the appropriateness of a tool to assess clinical reasoning competence, the Script Concordance Test (SCT). It aims to find validity for the test as a tool to assess clinical reasoning competency by a large group of medical students related to the grade of competence of clinical experts from the same department. Methods A workshop was held to define a pool of 150 SCT-questions was developed, based on the learning objectives in eleven pediatric subspecialities. A prospective cohort study was conducted with all students of the sixth clinical semester during winter semester 2008 / 2009. Scores of the SCT were compared to student’s MCQ-scores. Scores of the teachers’ group were compared to those of their students to analyze their influence on the development of clinical reasoning competence during the course. Results 287 students took part in the obligatory MC-assessment in summer semester 2008 of whom 232 took part in the SCT in winter semester 2008 / 2009 at the end of the “Blockpraktikum Pädiatrie” course (64 percent female, 36 percent male). All 51 teachers of the course took part in SCT test. The SCT results of all students were correlated to their MC-test results (summer semester 2008) and to the results of their groups’ teachers results. The scores on the SCT of the students ranged from 49 to 95 percent (mean 80, 4 percent). Teachers scores ranged from 63 to 96 percent (mean 82, 5 percent). The optimized reliability of the SCT scores, using Cronbach’s alpha, was 0. 72, of the MC test 0, 76. The student’s correlations between the scores of the SC-Test and the MC-Test results were with r= 0, 11 and r= 0, 04 statistically non-significant. Correlation between students’ and teachers’ mean scores was significant (r= 0, 55, p< 0, 001) Conclusion The SK-Test results could significantly differentiate between students and residents. The SC-Test could not show an increase in performance between residents and senior house officers. The poor correlation between the performance on the SCT and the performance on the MC-Test are due to the fact that the test evaluated a different domain. SCT has proven its ability to fulfill the needs of a high <b>stakes</b> examination <b>tool</b> and to assess students’ clinical reasoning capabilities as summative test tool...|$|R
40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. CML {{has contributed}} to the {{development}} of life cycle decision support tools, particularly Substance/Material Flow Analysis (SFA respectively MFA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Ever since these tools emerged there have been discussions on how these tools relate to each other, and how they relate to more traditional tools. Remarkably little, however, has been published on these relationships from an empirical side: which combinations of tools have actually been used, and what is the added value of combining tools in practical case studies. In this paper, we report on CML's experience in this field by presenting a number of case studies with their related research questions, for which different tools were deployed. Methods. Three case studies are discussed: 1) Waste water treatment: various options for waste water treatment have been assessed on their eco-efficiency, using SFA to comment on the influence of these options on the flows of certain substances in the water system of a geographical area and a combination of LCA and life cycle costing (LCC) to assess the life-cycle impacts and costs of these options; 2) Prioritization of environmental policy measures: A methodology has been developed to prioritize environmental policy measures and investments within companies based on both the environmental impacts and the costs of these measures; and 3) Environmental weighting of materials: to add an environmental dimension to standard MFA accounts, materials were weighted with cradle-to-grave impact factors based on LCA data and impact assessment factors. Results and Discussion. For each of these cases, the research questions at <b>stake,</b> the <b>tools</b> applied, the results and the added value, limitations and problems of combining the tools are reported. Conclusions and Perspective. Based on these experiences, it is concluded that using several tools to address a complicated problem is not only a theoretical proposal, but also something that has been applied successfully in a variety of practical situations. Furthermore, using several tools in combination does not necessarily lead to an increased information supply to decision-makers. Instead, it may contribute to the comprehensibility and ease of interpretation of the information that would have been provided by using a single tool. Finally, it is concluded that there is not one generally valid protocol for which tools to use for which question. The essential idea of using a combination of tools is exactly the fact that research questions are not simple by nature and cannot be generalized into protocols...|$|R
40|$|Orientation This report {{outlines}} {{literacy and}} numeracy progress for learners enrolled in targeted level- 1 to level- 3 modules, irrespective of level of programme, for 2012 and 2013. We intend {{to provide a}} pro-active account of LN progress as we anticipate the Tertiary Education Commission’s (TEC’s) progress measures to be published early in 2014. This report should therefore {{be seen as a}} point of orientation for interpreting these anticipated progress measures. LN Progress Using a data extraction from the TEC assessment tool website (2012 - 2013), we prepared the following matched repeated measures data sets, followed by analyses in IBM SPSS (Version 21) : •	Composite data sets (Step 1 to step 6) - Sets 1 and 2 (2012) and sets 3 and 4 (2013) as matched samples. •	Sub-samples: Our analyses showed that these means mask progress in reading and numeracy at different step-levels. For this reason, we split the data sets into the following sub-samples: o	Sets 5 and 6 (2012) and sets 7 and 8 (2013) of Step 1 and step 2 learners o	Sets 9 and 10 (2012) and sets 11 and 12 (2013) : Step 3 and step 4 learners o	Sets 13 and 14 (2012) and sets 15 and 16 (2013) : Step 5 and step 6 learners Findings and Discussion Applying repeated measures t-tests for matched pairs in the 2012 and 2013 cohorts, we found mean differences to be ambiguous for both reading and numeracy. However, our analyses showed that the results for the full cohorts masked significant growth for at-risk learners at step 1 and step 2, hence our analysing sub-groups of learners. We report descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations and the proportions of learners at various step levels. For the latter, we used step levels at start and finish for the three sub-samples to perform cross-tabulations. These cross-tabulations show the proportions of the sub-samples that either improved or regressed. Conclusions and Recommendations In this section, we present our conclusions, followed by recommendations for further action. Conclusion 1 : The low-stakes status of the TEC assessment tool for learners and its high-stakes status for the institution remain an ostensibly negative anomaly undermining measures of participation and progress. Recommendation 1 : Declare the TEC assessment <b>tool</b> high <b>stakes,</b> integrating <b>tool</b> results into module assessments and grading. If the TEC assessment tool retains its low-stakes status for learners, the LN-embedding team and vocational tutors have to intensify their advocacy plan to keep learners on board with these assessments. Conclusion 2 : The low-stakes status of the TEC assessment tool has negative consequences for its reliability. Recommendation 2 : Declare the TEC assessment <b>tool</b> high <b>stakes</b> (see directly above). Conclusion 3 : Learner performance in 2012 and 2013, outlined in this report, should serve as metrics in setting targets for improving progress in 2014. Recommendation 3 : Define objectives for 2014 on the basis of means and standard deviations obtained in 2013...|$|R
