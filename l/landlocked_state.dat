25|$|The initial {{impetus for}} Toungoo’s {{military}} campaigns was defensive. The <b>landlocked</b> <b>state</b> was being encircled {{by the powerful}} Confederation, which by 1533 had defeated its erstwhile ally Prome. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation’s paramount leader Saw Lon was assassinated a few months later, and the coalition suddenly {{ceased to be a}} coherent force. Tabinshwehti and his court decided {{to take advantage of the}} lull, and break out of their increasingly narrow realm by attacking Hanthawaddy, the larger and wealthier but disunited kingdom to the south. In 1534, Toungoo forces began annual raids into Hanthawaddy territory. They finally broke through in 1538, capturing Pegu (Bago) and the Irrawaddy delta. In 1539, Tabinshwehti moved the capital to Pegu where it would remain until the end of the century.|$|E

500|$|The {{establishment}} {{features a}} glass {{wall behind the}} bar looking into an indoor swimming pool where swimmers can be seen under water. It is located inside the O'Haire Motor Inn, which was built in 1962. [...] The concept of a swimming pool designed so underwater swimmers can be viewed from inside the bar was original to the building, {{as the person who}} built the O'Haire had been inspired by a similar design he saw when visiting the Playboy Club in Chicago. [...] When built in the 1960s, the O'Haire Motor Inn was considered [...] "swank" [...] and modern, and the tiki concept was popular, in part due to the then-recent admission of Hawaii to the United States as a state. [...] The concept of a tropical theme was also viewed as a fun concept for Montana, a <b>landlocked</b> <b>state</b> with long, cold winters.|$|E

500|$|Hyderabad was a <b>landlocked</b> <b>state</b> that {{stretched}} over 82,000 square miles (over 212,000 square kilometres) in southeastern India. While 87% of its 17 {{million people were}} Hindu, its ruler Nizam Osman Ali Khan was a Muslim, and its politics were dominated by a Muslim elite. The Muslim nobility and the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, a powerful pro-Nizam Muslim party, insisted Hyderabad remain independent and stand {{on an equal footing}} to India and Pakistan. Accordingly, the Nizam in June 1947 issued a firman announcing that on the transfer of power, his state would be resuming independence. The Government of India rejected the firman, terming it a [...] "legalistic claim of doubtful validity". It argued that the strategic location of Hyderabad, which lay astride the main lines of communication between northern and southern India, meant it could easily be used by [...] "foreign interests" [...] to threaten India, and that in consequence, the issue involved national-security concerns. It also pointed out that the state's people, history and location made it unquestionably Indian, and that its own [...] "common interests" [...] therefore mandated its integration into India.|$|E

40|$|Of the {{approximately}} 150 {{nations in the}} world today, thirty, scattered among four continents, have no direct access to the sea [...] they are landlocked. Although these nations are diverse in their histories, peoples, economic, social and governmental situations, they share a number of important problems. The greatest of these shared problems is that of transporting the imports and exports of these nations to and from the oceans, since all states rely in part upon the ocean for the movement of their external commerce and "the landlocked state…can never escape the expense of hauling seaborne goods from the foreign coastal port to its own territory,” and must maintain friendly relations with these coastal neighbors. Two other major problems are shared by <b>landlocked</b> <b>states.</b> The first of these is the fact that such states have been excluded from sharing in the wealth of the continental shelves. The Law of the Sea conventions have set down guidelines for the division of portions of the continental shelf between adjoining nations which border on a shelf, but <b>landlocked</b> <b>states</b> have yet to be given their share, and it has not even been determined whether they are entitled to such a share...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} {{obligations}} of <b>landlocked</b> <b>states</b> (LLSs) to protect the marine environment as a whole. In order to limit the scope, three international instruments are focussed upon: the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Fish Stocks Agreement (FSA). This thesis then goes one step beyond the existing regulations, and brings the obligations to protect the marine environment {{in conjunction with the}} participation in regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs). It is examined what role RFMOs play in the protection of the marine environment {{and if there is a}} right for LLSs to accede to RFMOs with the sole interest of marine environmental protection. The focus lies again on the UNCLOS, the CBD, and the FSA. Furthermore, the extension of the powers of RFMOs from fisheries management to additional protection of the marine environment is discussed. In order to understand the role of LLSs in using and protecting the oceans, it is important to know the modalities of the right to transit and the right to access to the sea. It is therefore assessed whether <b>landlocked</b> <b>states</b> have a right to transit and a right to access to the sea, and how these rights are regulated. Throughout the whole thesis, a special emphasis is put on the case of Switzerland. All general discussions regarding rights and obligations of LLSs are adapted to Switzerland’s position as feasibly possible...|$|R
