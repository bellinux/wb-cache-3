5000|$|Appropriate {{policy changes}} are a must, for instance, {{in the post}} WTO period the {{international}} prices of wheat and rice came to their lowest levels. But in India due to high MSP’s the prices were relatively high. Thus as a result importing was cheaper than buying from the domestic market. As a result, the government <b>levied</b> 50% <b>tariff</b> <b>on</b> wheat and 80% percent <b>tariff</b> <b>on</b> rice which further resulted {{in one of the}} outlandish incidents in the Indian history that was accumulation of buffer stocks which were exported which, incidentally, came back for sale at high MSP’s for instance in 2002-03, the government sold 1.6 million tones to exporters but in reality exports were only 0.682 million tones ...|$|R

The shogunate had no defense against Perry's gunboats and had to agree to his demands that American ships be permitted to acquire provisions and trade at Japanese ports.

50|$|Import Tariff: The Revenue Act of 1861 <b>levied</b> various <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> imports {{including}} sugar, tea, nuts, brimstone, coffee, liquor, {{and various}} fruits and herbs. The majority of imports were taxed {{on a per}} unit basis while certain imports, often those with more volatile pricing such as hides, citrus fruit, silk, and gunpowder were taxed ad valorem, with rates ranging from 10% on hides and rubber to 50% on wines. The act imposed an additional tax of 10% ad valorem on articles imported in foreign vessels from beyond the Cape of Good Hope. The provisions included in the act expanded upon the protectionist precedent set by the Morrill Tariff of 1861.|$|R
25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had <b>levied</b> <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer <b>levy</b> <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.|$|R
50|$|The {{committee}} was officially inaugurated {{in a ceremony}} at Bailingmiao in April 1934. By late June, offices had been installed at the monastery and blessed by its priests. Their clashes with other regional authorities began immediately; both the Committee {{and the government of}} Suiyuan Province under Fu Zuoyi attempted to <b>levy</b> <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> goods imported from Gansu. Regional nobility such as Shirabdorji of the Urad also did not cooperate with the Committee; in August 1935, Suiyuan forces, seeking to take advantage of their conflict, again confronted Committee troops near Shirabdorji's residence, and forced them to cede further authority to him. The Nationalist government took little action in the conflict. Yondonwangchug, angered by this, threatened to dissolve the Committee in response. The Japanese military watched the conflict closely, and even had its air force make several illegal overflights of Suiyuan in late September.|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries still <b>levy</b> <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> mosquito nets, thereby discouraging their use {{and contributing to}} the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue. Focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, the paper shows to which extent such tariffs are in place and, based on existing elasticity figures, calculates the cost of this policy. It is estimated that <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> insecticide-treated bed nets have reduced demand by some US$ 7 million between 2011 and 2015, equivalent to around 3. 1 million bed nets. This has contributed to some 2. 9 million malaria cases and over 5, 000 fatalities during this period. The paper discusses various policy implications of this finding, including whether tariff concessions (e. g. for local relief organizations) are more effective than a general zero-tariff policy. It is argued that concessions give rise to a process that is bureaucratic and only partially compensatory for the cost incurred. The introduction of a new six-digit tariff line specifically for mosquito nets with HS 2017 will facilitate a zero-tariff policy on bed nets. By the same token, policy makers should address remaining non-tariff barriers that affect the importation of anti-malarial products...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} procompetitive effects of trade {{policies}} against a foreign oligopoly {{in a model}} of vertical product differentiation. We show that a uniform tariff policy like the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause is always welfare superior to free trade because of a pure rent-extraction effect. However, a nonuniform tariff policy is, in addition, procompetitive and thus yields {{a higher level of}} social welfare. The first best policy typically consists of giving a subsidy to the country producing low quality and <b>levying</b> a <b>tariff</b> <b>on</b> the country producing high quality. Regional Trade Agreements (RTYs) are examples of nonuniform tariff policies. We show that these arrangements yield higher welfare than free trade and, moreover, that a RTA with a low-quality producing country yields larger gains than a RTA with a high-quality producing country. endogenous quality, most favored nation (MFN) clause, procompetitive policies, regional trade agreements...|$|R
2500|$|Economist Arnold Kling {{said the}} bill [...] "maximizes {{rent-seeking}} (favoritism toward particular businesses) and minimizes carbon reduction". Other economists {{have argued that}} the bill will create significant financial costs. The Wall Street Journal accused the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of significantly underestimating the bill's ultimate costs, pointing out supposed flaws in its calculations. The Wall Street Journal also suggested that the bill's costs would disproportionately affect lower-income households, for which the CBO estimates did not account. The New York Times reported that the bill's provisions to <b>levy</b> <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> Chinese imports due to carbon emissions could provoke a trade war. The Competitive Enterprise Institute argued that the bill was essentially the [...] "largest tax hike in world history". The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the petroleum and natural gas industry, said the bill would place [...] "disproportionate burden on all consumers of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, propane and other petroleum products", and by 2035, it would cause gasoline prices in excess of $4.00 per gallon by today's standards.|$|R
