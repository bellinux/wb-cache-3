The minimal inhibitory concentration of <b>lividomycin</b> was 12. 5 to 25 μg/ml, and three strains were resistant to {{high concentrations of}} <b>lividomycin</b> (more than 200 μg/ml). It was found that P. aeruginosa TI- 13 and K- 11, highly lividomycin-resistant strains of clinical origin, strongly inactivated the drug. The third resistant strain, Km- 41 /R, was developed in vitro. Unlike the other resistant strains, Km- 41 /R, was developed in vitro. Unlike the other resistant strains, Km- 41 /R did not inactivate the drug, indicating that different mechanisms were involved in <b>lividomycin</b> resistance.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of Providencia stuartii resistant to multiple aminoglycoside antibiotics prompted {{an investigation into}} the mechanism of their resistance. Crude enzyme extracts of a strain of P. stuartii inactivated kanamycin, <b>lividomycin</b> A, and butirosin B in the presence of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), as measured by a microbiological assay. The occurrence of inhibitory concentrations of 500 μg or greater per ml against kanamycin, <b>lividomycin</b> A, and butirosin B, coupled with the inactivation of these antibiotics in the presence of ATP, suggested enzymatic phosphorylation. This was documented by the transfer of the γ-phosphate of [γ- 32 P]ATP. In contrast, the inability to inactivate gentamicin or tobramycin by the crude enzyme extracts in the presence of ATP suggests another enzymatic mechanism of resistance for these antibiotics, such as adenylation or acetylation. Of importance is the fact that amikacin, a semisynthetic analogue of kanamycin A which is resistant to inactivation by most resistance transfer factor enzymes, was found to inhibit the growth of P. stuartii at low concentrations...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that are}} more sensitive than the wild type to the aminoglycoside antibiotics G 418, hygromycin B, destomycin A, and gentamicin X 2. In addition, the mutants are sensitive to apramycin, kanamycin B, <b>lividomycin</b> A, neamine, neomycin, paromomycin, and tobramycin [...] antibiotics which do not inhibit wild-type strains. Mapping studies suggest that supersensitivity is caused by mutations {{in at least three}} genes, denoted AGS 1, AGS 2, and AGS 3 (for aminoglycoside antibiotic sensitivity). Mutations in all three genes are required for highest antibiotic sensitivity; ags 1 ags 2 double mutants have intermediate antibiotic sensitivity. AGS 1 was mapped 8 centimorgans distal from LEU 2 on chromosome III. Analyses of yeast strains transformed with vectors carrying antibiotic resistance genes revealed that G 418, gentamicin X 2, kanamycin B, <b>lividomycin</b> A, neamine, and paromomycin are inactivated by the Tn 903 phosphotransferase and that destomycin A is inactivated by the hygromycin B phosphotransferase. ags strains are improved host strains for vectors carrying the phosphotransferase genes because a wide spectrum of aminoglycoside antibiotics can be used to select for plasmid maintenance...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{resistance of the}} gentamicin-producing organism Micromonospora purpurea was analyzed. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations revealed high resistance to the 4, 6 -substituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin and also to <b>lividomycin</b> A and hygromycin B, but susceptibility to streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, paromomycin, and neomycin during all phases of the growth cycle. The nonproducing, closely related Micromonospora melanosporea was susceptible to these compounds. In agreement with results from previous studies (R. Benveniste and J. Davies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70 : 2276 - 2280, 1973), extracts from M. purpurea showed no activity of enzymes specifically modifying gentamicin. 70 S ribosomes from M. purpurea but not from M. melanosporea were resistant to inhibition by gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and <b>lividomycin</b> in a polyuridylic acid-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis system and susceptible to those compounds which were inhibitory in vivo. The former antibiotics were also unable to induce misreading.

40|$|The kissing-loop {{complex that}} initiates dimerization of genomic RNA {{is crucial for}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV- 1) replication. We showed that owing to its strong similitude with the {{bacterial}} ribosomal A site it can be targeted by aminoglycosides. Here, we present its crystal structure in complex with neamine, ribostamycin, neomycin and <b>lividomycin.</b> These structures explain the specificity for 4, 5 -disubstituted 2 -deoxystreptamine (DOS) derivatives and for subtype A and subtype F kissing-loop complexes, and provide a strong basis for rational drug design. As {{a consequence of the}} different topologies of the kissing-loop complex and the A site, these aminoglycosides establish more contacts with HIV- 1 RNA than with 16 S RNA. Together with biochemical experiments, they showed that while rings I, II and III confer binding specificity, rings IV and V are important for affinity. Binding of neomycin, paromomycin and <b>lividomycin</b> strongly stabilized the kissing-loop complex by bridging the two HIV- 1 RNA molecules. Furthermore, in situ footprinting showed that the dimerization initiation site (DIS) of HIV- 1 genomic RNA could be targeted by these aminoglycosides in infected cells and virions, demonstrating its accessibility...|$|E

40|$|A multiple-primer PCR {{was used}} to {{identify}} genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in 381 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The technique used three sets of primers delineating specific DNA fragments of the aph(3 ′) -III, ant(4 ′) -I, and aac(6 ′) -aph(2 ") genes, which influence the MICs of gentamicin, tobramycin, and <b>lividomycin.</b> Isolates {{with none of the}} three genes detected were susceptible to all three agents. Isolates with the aph(3 ′) -III gene showed resistance to <b>lividomycin</b> (MIC > 1, 024 μg/ml), and those with the ant(4 ′) -I gene were resistant to tobramycin (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml). Isolates with only the aac(6 ′) -aph(2 ") gene were resistant to gentamicin (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml) and tobramycin in decreasing order; those with both the ant(4 ′) -I and aac(6 ′) -aph(2 ") genes also were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin, but in increasing order. Susceptibility testing, then, could detect specific genes. In 381 Japanese MRSA isolates, the ant(4 ′) -I, aac(6 ′) -aph(2 "), and aph(3 ′) -III genes were prevalent in 84. 5, 61. 7, and 8. 9 %, respectively. Isolates with only the ant(4 ′) -I gene had coagulase type II or III, but isolates with both the ant(4 ′) -I and aac(6 ′) -aph(2 ") genes included all coagulase types. Most isolates with coagulase type IV or VII carried the aac(6 ′) -aph(2 ") gene. Of the MRSA isolates with ant(4 ′) -I and/or aac(6 ′) -aph(2 ") genes, 97 % were resistant to aminoglycosides in clinical use, but a new aminoglycoside, arbekacin, had excellent activity against these isolates...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundHigh-level {{gentamicin}} {{resistance in}} enterococci and staphylococci is conferred by AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ″), an enzyme with 6 ′-N-acetyltransferase and 2 ″-O-phosphotransferase activities. The {{presence of this}} enzyme in pathogenic gram-positive bacteria prevents the successful use of gentamicin C and most other aminoglycosides as therapeutic agents. ResultsIn an effort to understand the mechanism of aminoglycoside modification, we expressed AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ″) in Bacillus subtilis. The purified enzyme is monomeric with a molecular mass of 57 kDa and displays both the expected aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase and O-phosphotransferase activities. Structure-function analysis with various aminoglycosides substrates reveals an enzyme with broad specificity in both enzymatic activities, accounting for AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ″) 's dramatic negative impact on clinical aminoglycoside therapy. Both <b>lividomycin</b> A and paromomycin, aminoglycosides lacking a 6 ′-amino group, were acetylated by AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ″). The infrared spectrum of the product of paromomycin acetylation yielded a signal consistent with O-acetylation. Mass spectral and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the products of neomycin phosphorylation indicated that phosphoryl transfer occurred primarily at the 3 ′-OH of the 6 -aminohexose ring A, and that some diphosphorylated material was also present with phosphates at the 3 ′-OH and the 3 ″'-OH of ring D, both unprecedented observations for this enzyme. Furthermore, the phosphorylation site of <b>lividomycin</b> A {{was determined to be}} the 5 ″-OH of the pentose ring C. ConclusionsThe bifunctional AAC(6 ′) -APH(2 ″) has the capacity to inactivate virtually all clinically important aminoglycosides through N- and O-acetylation and phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups. The extremely broad substrate specificity of this enzyme will impact on future development of aminoglycosides and presents a significant challenge for antibiotic design...|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, fradiomycin, <b>lividomycin,</b> and mannosylparomomycin) through porin pores was examined in vitro by the liposome swelling technique, using vesicle membranes reconstituted from phospholipids and purified porin trimers. Results showed that aminoglycoside antibiotics diffuse through porin-pores very efficiently, {{as rapidly as}} hexoses and disaccharides, {{despite the fact that}} the molecular weights of the aminoglycosides used were higher than or close to the exclusion limit of porin pores. The susceptibility to aminoglycoside antibiotics of mutant strains producing 3 to 4 % of porin was not significantly different from that of a strain producing a wild-type quantity of porin. These results were interpreted to mean that aminoglycoside antibiotics diffuse through porin-pores very efficiently.

Furthermore, we found that fully modified 4 ′-thioDNAs behaved like RNA molecules in their hybridization properties and structural aspect, {{at least in the}} case of the 4 ′-thioDNA duplex. This observation was confirmed by experiments using groove binders, in which a 4 ′-thioDNA duplex interacts with an RNA major groove binder, <b>lividomycin</b> A, but not with DNA groove binders, to give an increase in its thermal stability.

40|$|International audienceOwing to a striking, {{and most}} likely fortuitous, {{structural}} and sequence similarity with the bacterial 16 S ribosomal A site, the RNA kissing-loop complex formed by the HIV- 1 genomic RNA dimerization initiation site (DIS) specifically binds 4, 5 -disubstituted 2 -deoxystreptamine (2 -DOS) aminoglycoside antibiotics. We used chemical probing, molecular modeling, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV melting to investigate aminoglycoside binding to the DIS loop-loop complex. We showed that apramycin, an aminoglycoside containing a bicyclic moiety, also binds the DIS, but {{in a different way}} than 4, 5 -disubstituted 2 -DOS aminoglycosides. The determination of thermodynamic parameters for various aminoglycosides revealed the role of the different rings in the drug-RNA interaction. Surprisingly, we found that the affinity of <b>lividomycin</b> and neomycin for the DIS (K(d) approximately 30 nM) is significantly higher than that obtained in the same experimental conditions for their natural target, the bacterial A site (K(d) approximately 1. 6 microM). In good agreement with their respective affinity, aminoglycoside increase the melting temperature of the loop-loop interaction and also block the conversion from kissing-loop complex to extended duplex.

Resistance to th 14 antibiotics was cotransferred by in vitro conjugation between S. liquefaciens and strains of Escherichia coli. Mating between S. liquefaciens and E. coli also occurred in vivo, in the digestive tract of axenic mice and gnotobiotic mice associated with the whole human fecal flora. It was also shown that mating between these two strains occurred even when the donor S. liquefaciens strain was only transient in the digestive tract of the gnotobiotic host animals. A dense population of Bacteroides (10 (10) viable cells per g of fresh feces) did not hinder this mating. All the matings occurred {{in the absence of}} an antibiotic selection pressure, and the resulting transferred strain of E. coli did not have the same colonizing capacity as the recipient parental strain.

Although {{the number of}} contacts between the RNA and the aminoglycosides varies between 20 and 31, up to eight direct hydrogen bonds between rings I and II of the neamine moiety are conserved in the observed complexes. The puckered sugar ring I is inserted into the A site helix by stacking against G 1491 and forms a pseudo base pair with two H-bonds to the Watson–Crick sites of the universally conserved A 1408. This central interaction helps to maintain A 1492 and A 1493 in a bulged-out conformation. All these structures of the minimal A site RNA complexed to various aminoglycosides display crystal packings with intermolecular contacts between the bulging A 1492 and A 1493 and the shallow/minor groove of Watson–Crick pairs in a neighbouring helix.

Each contained {{at least one}} plasmid {{greater than or equal}} to 41 kilobases in size. The MIC of kanamycin for all 11 strains was determined to be {{greater than or equal to}} 256 micrograms/ml by an agar dilution method. In addition, all of the strains exhibited resistance to tetracycline (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Eight of the 11 strains transferred the kanamycin resistance phenotype to other Campylobacter strains by conjugation. DNA from 9 of the 11 strains hybridized to a DNA probe specific for the 3 '-O-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type III gene. The remaining two strains also failed to show homology with DNA probes specific for the genes encoding 3 '-O-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase types I, II, and III. The novel kanamycin resistance gene was cloned into the vector pBR 322 and was expressed in Escherichia coli.

Read-through drugs have been used to suppress premature stop codons, and this can potentially be used to treat patients who have this type of mutation. We examined the effects of aminoglycoside treatment on the IDUA mutations Q 70 X and W 402 X in cultured cells and show that 4, 5 -disubstituted aminoglycosides induced more read-through for the W 402 X mutation, while 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycosides promoted more read-through for the Q 70 X mutation: <b>lividomycin</b> (4, 5 -disubstituted) induced a 7. 8 -fold increase in α-l-iduronidase enzyme activity for the W 402 X mutation; NB 54 (4, 5 -disubstituted) induced a 3. 7 fold increase in the amount of α-l-iduronidase enzyme activity for the W 402 X mutation, but had less effect on the Q 70 X mutation, whereas gentamicin (4, 6 -disubstituted) had the reverse effect on read-through for both mutations.

40|$|We have {{developed}} methods {{for studying the}} interactions between small molecules and RNA and have applied them to characterize the binding of three classes of aminoglycoside antibiotics to ribosomal RNA subdomains. High-resolution MS was used to quantitatively identify the noncovalent binding interactions between mixtures of aminoglycosides and multiple RNA targets simultaneously. Signal overlap among RNA targets was avoided {{by the addition of}} neutral mass tags that direct each RNA target to a unique region of the spectrum. In addition to determining binding affinities, the locations of the binding sites on the RNAs were identified from a protection pattern generated by fragmenting the aminoglycoside/RNA complex. Specific complexes were observed for the prokaryotic rRNA A-site subdomain with ribostamycin, paromomycin, and <b>lividomycin,</b> whereas apramycin preferentially formed a complex with the eukaryotic subdomain. We show that differences in binding between paromomycin and ribostamycin can be probed by using an MS–MS protection assay. We have introduced specific base substitutions in the RNA models and have measured their impact on binding affinity and selectivity. The binding of apramycin to the prokaryotic subdomain strongly depends on the identity of position 1408, as evidenced by the selective increase in affinity for an A 1408 G mutant. An A 1409 –G 1491 mismatch pair in the prokaryotic subdomain enhanced the binding of tobramycin and bekanamycin.

To study the role of rings III, IV, and V in aminoglycoside binding, we used isogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis DeltarrnB mutants carrying homogeneous populations of mutant ribosomes with alterations in the 16 S rRNA A site. MICs were determined to investigate drug-ribosome interactions, {{and the results were}} compared with that of the previously published crystal structure of paromomycin bound to the ribosomal A site. Our analysis demonstrates that the stacking interaction between ring I and G 1491 is largely sequence independent, that rings III and IV each increase the strength of drug binding to the ribosome, that ring IV of the 6 '-NH 3 + aminoglycosides compensates for loss of interactions between ring II and U 1495 and between ring III and G 1491, that the aminoglycosides rely on pseudo-base pairing between ring I and A 1408 for binding independently of the number of sugar rings attached to the neamine core, that addition of ring V to the 6 '-OH 4, 5 -aminoglycoside paromomycin does not alter the mode of binding, and that alteration of the U 1406.

Their identification was confirmed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The antibiotic resistance profiles of the isolates were determined against forty-one antibiotics belonging to eleven distinct classes. All the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, cloxacillin, oxacillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, sulphatriad cotrimoxazole, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. All were sensitive to ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftriaxone, meropenem, aztreonam, amikacin, apramycin, butirosin A, <b>lividomycin</b> and colistin sulphate. One of the isolates, PA 13, was resistant to a further fourteen antibiotics and {{was identified as a}} multidrug resistant strain. A 2. 2 kbp PCR product was amplified from P. aeruginosa PA 13.

The presence of the integrase gene and the quaternary ammonium compound gene suggested that the genes were on a Class 1 integron.

40|$|The broad-spectrum {{aminoglycoside}} phosphotransferase, APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa, confers {{resistance to}} several aminoglycoside antibiotics in opportunistic pathogens {{of the genera}} Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. The profile of the drug resistance phenotype suggested that the enzyme would transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the 32 ̆ 7 -hydroxyl of aminoglycosides. In addition, resistance to the 32 ̆ 7 -deoxyaminoglycoside antibiotic, <b>lividomycin</b> A, suggested possible transfer to the 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyl of the ribose [Trieu-Cuot, P., and Courvalin, P. (1983) Gene 23, 331 - 341]. Using purified overexpressed enzyme, we have prepared and purified the products of APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa-dependent phosphorylation of several of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Mass spectral analysis revealed that 4, 6 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics such as amikacin and kanamycin are monophosphorylated, while 4, 5 -disubstituted aminoglycosides such as butirosin A, ribostamycin, and neomycin B are both mono- and diphosphorylated by APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa. Using a series of one- and two-dimensional 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P NMR experiments, we have unambiguously assigned the regiospecificity of phosphoryl transfer to several antibiotics. The 4, 6 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics are exclusively phosphorylated at the 32 ̆ 7 -OH hydroxyl, and the 4, 5 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics can be phosphorylated at both the 32 ̆ 7 - and 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyls. The first phosphorylation can occur on either the 32 ̆ 7 - or 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyl group of neomycin B or butirosin A. Initial phosphotransfer to the 32 ̆ 7 -position predominates for butirosin while the 52 ̆ 2 -OH is favored for neomycin.
