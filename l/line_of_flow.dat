Even along the broad Baker Flats, this feature is still prominent. The north side is a long gentle slope toward the divide, rising more sharply in its upper part, while across the flats the southern side may be seen rising abruptly from the valley floor.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss some}} aspects of the {{behaviour}} of a string gas at the Hagedorn temperature from a Euclidean point of view. Using AdS space as an infrared regulator, the Hagedorn tachyon can be effectively quasi-localized and its dynamics controled by a finite energetic balance. We propose that the off-shell RG flow matches to an Euclidean AdS black hole geometry in a generalization of the string/black-hole correspondence principle. The final stage of the RG flow can be interpreted semiclassically as the growth of a cool black hole in a hotter radiation bath. The end-point of the condensation is the large Euclidan AdS black hole, and the part of spacetime behind the horizon has been removed. In the flat-space limit, holography is manifest by the system creating its own transverse screen at infinity. This leads to an argument, based on the energetics of the system, explaining why the non-supersymmetric type 0 A string theory decays into the supersymmetric type IIB vacuum.
