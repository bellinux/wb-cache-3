When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get better.... <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

60|$|They advance slowly, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things. The cat remains {{where they}} found her, still snarling at the {{something}} on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs. What is it? Hold up the light.|$|R
5000|$|I am {{permanently}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> systems. And of course, {{there are}} tens of thousands of these assessments going on all the time. There will, I dare say, be individual cases that are wrong and as they are {{brought to the attention of}} ministers we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Bid, we'll go and be vulgar together; for that's what we are, I'm afraid," [...] {{her brother}} said to her. [...] "We'll go and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> low works of art." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{about three}} {{thousand}} for the Island--enough to stop any expedition that might come. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> little bays and coves. There are twenty {{places at the}} back of the island where you could land men and make things unpleasant for Hong-Kong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But you are {{not going}} away to-night!' said Stephen in dismay. 'Can't you manage to stay here? Indeed you must! <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people, some of whom may need special {{attention}} or perhaps treatment. We do not know yet if any may be injured.' He answered at once: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It’s {{about my}} love for the state and seeing state being {{completely}} undermined," [...] Rodriguez told MintPress News during an interview at his Tia Chucha store. The richest state in the Union, he noted, has the highest poverty rate, and the state {{that is home to}} the entertainment industry has the lowest funding for the arts. “I’m <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> contradictions,” Rodriguez said.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{looked up and}} down, at the flower-embosomed cottages, with their {{thatched}} roofs and trim appearance, at the neatly cut hedges, the well-kept road, the many signs of prosperity. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the little grey church standing in its ancient walled churchyard, where the road divided, a very delightful addition to the picturesque beauty of the place. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things and he sighed.|$|R
60|$|Rollo <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> portraits, as {{his father}} {{requested}} him to do; but he {{was more interested in}} two other objects which stood on a table in the same room. These objects were two little figures, one representing a horse and the other a lamb. These figures were under a glass. The horse was about a foot long, and the lamb about six inches. The horse was of a very pretty form, and was covered with hair, like a living animal. The lamb in the same manner was covered with wool. Indeed, they were both in all respects models of the animals they represented in miniature.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't," [...] and Mary {{shook her}} head. [...] "I wish I could, father, {{but it has}} a sort of horrible fascination. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> upturned faces; it is the same with them all. You can see that there is not one who would not go if he could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll ask," [...] she cried. [...] "We've {{got to win}} out at this game, and the way is to know. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> Portuguese. Where are all the Americans? They {{owned the}} land first, after the Mexicans. What made the Americans clear out? How do the Portuguese make it go? Don't you see? We've got to ask {{millions}} of questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{our journey}} ends," [...] said the queen. [...] "Is {{it not a}} {{wonderful}} land, and well worth the seeing? <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> jewels and this gold, as plenty as fruits and flowers at home. You may take what you please; but while you are gathering them I have another matter after which I must look. Wait for me here, and by-and-by I will be back again." ...|$|E
2500|$|ROVE: I'm <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> Robert {{and adding}} them up. I {{add up to}} a Republican Senate and Republican House. You may end up with a {{different}} math but you are entitled to your math and I'm entitled to the math.|$|R
6000|$|Otherwise, the {{plastered}} {{white walls}} were completely bare, {{except for a}} water-colour sketch of the San Tome mountain--the work of Dona Emilia herself. In {{the middle of the}} red-tiled floor stood two long tables littered with plans and papers, a few chairs, and a glass show-case containing specimens of ore from the mine. Mrs. Gould, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things in turn, wondered aloud why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing the prospects, the working, and the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy, whereas she could talk of the mine by the hour with her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction. And dropping her eyelids expressively, she added-- ...|$|R
60|$|They {{stood for}} a few moments <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{wonderful}} beauties of the mysterious night--which dwellers in the country so rarely appreciate, because to them they are common, daily things--and listening to the soft, long-drawn murmuring of the sea upon the shingle. Then they went forward {{to the edge of the}} cliff, but although Morris threw the fur rug over it Mary did not seat herself in the comfortable-looking deck chair. Her desire for repose had departed. She preferred to lean upon the low grey wall in whose crannies grew lichens, tiny ferns, and, in their season, harebells and wallflowers. Morris came and leant at her side; for a while they both stared at the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say aught against it," [...] the tanner said, [...] "though {{my heart}} feels well-nigh broken. Had we only men here, I should say let us {{fight to the}} last, but <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> women and children! Think what {{thousands}} and thousands of them are in the town. Truly, I cannot blame the council that they have decided not to bring this terrible suffering upon the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? It is {{as well to}} face things. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> monuments about us, and inscriptions, {{a lot of them}} {{to young}} people, though now it doesn't matter if they were old or young. Gone, every one of them and quite forgotten, though some were great folk in their time. Gone utterly and for always, nothing left, except perhaps {{descendants}} in a labourer's cottage here and there who never even heard of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|SIGSBY Look here. What I {{want to know}} is this: am I {{being asked}} to regard Lady Mogton as my opponent's {{election}} agent, or as my principal's mother-in-law? That point's got to be settled. [His vehemence deepens.] <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> posters. Not to be used, for fear the other side mayn't like them. Now Lady Mogton writes me that my candidate's supporters are not to employ a certain argument she disapproves of: because, if they do, she'll tell his wife. Is this an election, or is it a family jar? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} door, {{and found himself}} in a long, narrow room, which seemed, however, more like a passage way than like a room. There was a sort of rack on one side of it for hats and coats. There were several {{pictures}} in this room, with prices marked upon them, as if they were for sale, and also a number of very pretty specimens of marble, and inlaid paper weights, and models of columns, temples, and ruins of various kinds, and other such curiosities as are kept every where in Rome to sell to visitors. Rollo <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things as he passed through the room, considering, as he examined them, whether his uncle George would probably wish to buy any of them.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the {{possibility}} of pilot error being the proximate cause of the crash, acting NTSB chairman Christopher Hart said: [...] "We are not ruling anything out.

40|$|Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Industry {{has been}} growing at a phenomenal rate over the past 4 - 5 years. Companies started {{adopting}} this business model since this result in cost savings and allow the company to focus on its core competencies. Moreover there are specialists in the market who can manage the business function more efficiently than the company itself. Companies generally experience four basic decision making predicaments when they decide to go for outsourcing. Firstly they had to justify themselves why they are going for Outsourcing, secondly they have {{to decide on the}} Business Process to outsource, Thirdly they have to decide who can manage their business function in the most efficient manner and finally {{the most important part of}} it, how to manage the outsourcing deal.

No, my boy; {{advertisement}} is the thing. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> men on the beach. Are they going to roll in of their own free wills to see a play like The Footpills?

There's hardly one of them who hasn't got now, or hasn't had, some personal difficulty or trouble before them as big as yours almost; bigger perhaps. And here they are as lively as fleas.

6000|$|... "You know," [...] he {{explained}} to Lapham, [...] "that we have to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> facts as material, and we get the habit of classifying them. Sometimes a leading question will draw out a whole line of facts that a man himself would never think of." [...] He went on to put several queries, and it was from Lapham's answers that he generalised the history of his childhood. [...] "Mr. Lapham, {{although he did not}} dwell on his boyish trials and struggles, spoke of them with deep feeling and an abiding sense of their reality." [...] This was what he added in the interview, {{and by the time he}} had got Lapham past the period where risen Americans are all pathetically alike in their narrow circumstances, their sufferings, and their aspirations, he had beguiled him into forgetfulness of the check he had received, and had him talking again in perfect enjoyment of his autobiography.|$|E
30|$|The gravity profile (Figure  7) from Gugi to Rajapur shows a {{disparity}} in gravity anomaly, {{perhaps due to}} the variation in thickness of the Deccan Flood Basalt. The gravity anomaly in Rajapur is 10  mGal, which is lower than others observed in the Gugi area. If we apply complete Bouguer correction in the Rajapur area for the 600 -m-thick basalt layer, we find a comparatively similar gravity anomaly as in the Gugi area. Also, the existence of low density rock like granite underlying the DFB cannot be ruled out. With {{the help of the}} gravity anomaly, it can be predicted that the main heat source for the Rajapur thermal springs is the granitic batholith, which extends from Gugi to the Rajapur. Finally <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> aspects, it can be postulated that the thermal waters from Rajapur area, coming from underneath Dharwar Granitic Batholith and underlying the basaltic terrain, interact with the near-surface groundwater {{on their way to the}} surface, to emerge as thermal springs.|$|R
40|$|At {{least nine}} {{different}} criteria are relevant for decisions about public spending for health care. These include economic efficiency criteria (public goods, externalities, catastrophic cost, and cost-effectiveness), ethical reasons (poverty, {{horizontal and vertical}} equity, {{and the rule of}} rescue), and political considerations (especially demands by the populace). Sometimes one criterion should be examined before another one is considered; that is, they are hierarchically related. Sometimes two criteria will not be compatible but will conflict, forcing difficult choices—particularly between efficiency and equity. Properly thought-out choices of which health care interventions to finance with public funds therefore depend not only on <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> criteria, but also on treating them in the appropriate sequence and taking account of their possible inconsistencies. Public funds should finance public and semi-public goods that are cost-effective and for which demand is inadequate; cost-effective interventions that preferentially benefit the poor; and catastrophically costly care, when contributory insurance will not work or there are good reasons to finance insurance publicly. © 1999 Elsevie...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Henry did {{not appear}} {{satisfied}} with these promises, {{but she did not}} urge Phonny any longer to give the hatchet to her. She walked along, seeming, however, not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>at</b> her ease. Phonny showed her his stock of boards and blocks, among which last, was one which he said was to be made into a boat. After <b>looking</b> around <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things, Mrs. Henry and Malleville went away. Phonny and Stuyvesant remained in the shop.|$|R

Then {{his mother would}} {{tell him about the}} crucifixion of Christ. 'They nailed him to the cross,' she would say, 'by long nails passing through his hands and feet. Don't you see the nails?' And the child would say, 'Yes,' and look at the nails very intently. 'The soldiers climbed up by a ladder,' she would say. 'Don't you see the ladder? And by and by, when in his fever he called for some drink, they reached something up to him by a sponge fastened {{to the end of a}} long pole. Do you see the pole?'

60|$|Kipps made a {{very special}} thing of his breakfast. Daily once hopeless dreams came true then. It had been {{customary}} in the Emporium to supplement Shalford's generous, indeed unlimited, supply of bread and butter-substitute, by private purchases, and this had given Kipps very broad, artistic conceptions of what the meal might be. Now {{there would be a}} cutlet or so or a mutton chop--this splendour Buggins had reported from the great London clubs--haddock, kipper, whiting or fish-balls, eggs, boiled or scrambled, or eggs and bacon, kidney also frequently and sometimes liver. Amidst a garland of such themes, sausages, black and white puddings, bubble-and-squeak, fried cabbage and scallops came and went. Always as camp followers came potted meat in all varieties, cold bacon, German sausage, brawn, marmalade and two sorts of jam, and when he had finished these he would sit among his plates and smoke a cigarette and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> dishes crowded round him with a beatific approval. It was his principal meal. He was sitting with his cigarette regarding his apartment with that complacency begotten of a generous plan of feeding successfully realized, when newspapers and post arrived.|$|E

Now I was confused and I looked and I looked and I was confused. Gertrude Stein, on her reaction to first seeing Cubist paintings. The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas. I heard Daniel Dennett, last year, winding up his Royal Institute of Philosophy Millennial Lecture with the prediction: “I anticipate a day when philosophers and scientists and laypeople will chuckle over the fossil traces of our earlier bafflement about consciousness ” (Dennett, in press). And I thought at the time: that’s not quite right. Future philosophers won’t chuckle over the difficulties we now have with understanding consciousness- any more than we, today, chuckle over the difficulties people had two centuries ago with understanding the evolution of life. We chuckle when something is comical. But the spectacle of earnest seekers after truth trying their very best to make sense of something that is presently beyond their capacity is, I’d say, more chastening than comical. In the case of evolution, when we look back on the effort...|$|R
5000|$|On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{found in}} favour of the defendant, Arriba Soft. In {{reaching}} its decision, the court utilized the statutory four-factor analysis. First, it found the purpose of creating the thumbnail images as previews to be sufficiently transformative, noting {{that they were not}} meant to be viewed at high resolution as the original artwork was. Second, the photographs had already been published, diminishing the significance of their nature as creative works. Third, although normally making a [...] "full" [...] replication of a copyrighted work may appear to violate copyright, here it was found to be reasonable and necessary in light of the intended use. Lastly, the court found that the market for the original photographs would not be substantially diminished by the creation of the thumbnails. To the contrary, the thumbnail searches could increase the exposure of the originals. In <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> factors as a whole, the court found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on July 7, 2003. The remaining issues were resolved with a default judgment after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.|$|R
