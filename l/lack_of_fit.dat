40|$|Patterns in the commonness and {{rarity of}} species are a {{fundamental}} characteristic of ecological assemblages; however, testing between alternative models for such patterns remains an important challenge. Conventional approaches to fitting or testing species abundance models often assume that species, not individuals, are the units that are sampled and that species' abundances {{are independent of}} one another. Here we test three different models (the Poisson lognormal, the negative binomial, and the neutral, “zero-sum multinomial” [ZSM]) against species abundance distributions of Indo-Pacific corals and reef fishes. We derive and apply several alternative bootstrap analyses <b>of</b> model <b>fit,</b> each <b>of</b> which makes different assumptions about how species abundance data are sampled, and we assess {{the extent to which}} tests <b>of</b> model <b>fit</b> are sensitive to such assumptions. For all models, goodness <b>of</b> <b>fit</b> is remarkably consistent, regardless of whether one assumes that species or individuals are the units that are sampled or whether or not one assumes that species' abundances are statistically independent of one another. However, goodness-of-fit estimates are approximately twice as precise and detect <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> model <b>fit</b> more frequently, when based on sampling of individuals, rather than species. Bootstrap analyses indicate that the Poisson lognormal distribution exhibits substantially better fit to species abundance patterns, consistent with model selection analyses. In particular, heterogeneity in species abundances (many rare and few highly abundant species) is too great to be captured by the ZSM model or the negative binomial model and is best explained by models that predict species abundance patterns that are much closer, but not identical, to the lognormal distribution. More broadly, our bootstrap analyses suggest that estimates <b>of</b> model <b>fit</b> are likely to be robust to assumptions about the statistical interdependence of species abundances, but that tests <b>of</b> model <b>fit</b> are more powerful when they assume sampling of individuals, rather than species. Such individual-based tests therefore may be able to identify <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> model <b>fit</b> where previous tests have been inconclusive...|$|R

Indeed, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> model <b>fit</b> and oversimplification <b>of</b> the real world {{can be attributed to}} the rigidity of these models, which assumes that each organization that uses the framework is equal. This research investigates this fundamental rigidity from an analytics perspective, analysing in casu a focus area maturity matrix targeted at information security. The results show that organizational characteristics influence the maturity framework both in parts and as a whole significantly, concluding that current maturity frameworks have a poor model fit and advising that a maturity framework should account for the differences between the characteristics of their target organizations...|$|R

Sensitivity studies demonstrate that an eddy diffusion profile with a homopause level of 850 km and a methane stratospheric mole fraction of 2. 2 % provides the best <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> stratospheric and upper atmosphere observations and an improved fit over previous Titan photochemical models. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits</b> for C 3 H 8, HC 3 N, and possibly C 2 H 3 CN can be resolved with adjustments in aerosol opacity.

An electron peak concentration of 4200 cm(exp - 3) is calculated, which exceeds observations by 20 %, considerably lower than previous ionosphere models.
