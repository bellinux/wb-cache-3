40|$|Safety cues are {{frequently}} used in online stores to relieve consumers' risk perceptions concerning online purchases. This paper uses regulatory focus theory (RFT) {{to predict the}} persuasiveness of online safety cues. According to RFT (Higgins, 1997), people process information differently depending on whether they strive for achieving gains (promotion focus) or avoiding <b>losses</b> (<b>prevention</b> focus). The aim {{of the present study}} is to examine the impact of the regulatory focus compatibility of Web content on online consumer behavior. Using different online stores, two experiments show that the effect of online safety cues depends on the consumers'regulatory focus. A pilot study demonstrates that safety-oriented Web content lowers consumers' risk perceptions, but only when in a prevention focus. The main study replicates and extends this finding by showing that online safety cues both lower consumers' risk perceptions and engender more favorable attitudes and intentions, depending on the regulatory focus...|$|R
40|$|University binge {{drinking}} is a concern. Traditionally, social norms marketing campaigns have been employed. Regulatory focus theory – {{based on the}} premise that behavior is driven either by the motivation to maximize gains (promotion) or to minimize <b>losses</b> (<b>prevention)</b> – offers an alternative approach to crafting persuasive appeals in this population. This study investigated the effectiveness of gain-framed versus loss-framed advertisements in lowering drinking intentions in a university sample. It further explored whether the effects were moderated by regulatory focus – primed and dispositional – and trait reactance. Online surveys were completed by 208 Introductory Psychology students (51. 7 % female, mean age = 19. 0 [SD = 1. 78]). Message framing did not interact with regulatory focus to create regulatory fit. However, those high in promotion focus and females were more responsive to the ads, particularly the loss-framed ones, whereas those high in reactance were less responsive to the ads. Implications for tailoring anti-{{binge drinking}} ads are discussed. Keywords: alcohol, message framing, reactance, regulatory focus, universit...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxin {{contamination}} {{of food and}} feed poses major risks for human or animal health and leads to economic <b>losses.</b> <b>Prevention</b> and intervention measures are very well described on the field, but still contaminated batches remain a reality in practice. In order to salvage these resources, feed remediation based on mycotoxin adsorption is already applied {{through the use of}} binders. However, adsorption is reversible, pH-depending and non-specific. Moreover, these binders negatively influence the transfer of medication to the bloodstream. Therefore, there is need to develop more reliable detoxification strategies. This research focuses on the microbial degradation of mycotoxins, in particularly deoxynivalenol (DON) which frequently occurs in crops in Belgium. Several microbial communities with a possible exposure history to mycotoxins or other complex molecules, are screened for the presence of DON degrading microorganisms. Enrichment cultures of soil and activated sludge showed degradation of DON after two weeks, as analyzed with ELISA, whereas detoxification of DON was confirmed with a bio-assay using Lemna minor. Subsequently, several strains, among which one promising isolate related to Streptomyces sp. (derived from soil), have been purified and characterization of their degrading capacities is ongoing...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of natural hazards {{has been increasing}} in the last decades in Europe and specifically in Mediterranean regions due to climate change. For example heavy precipita-tion events can lead to disasters through the interaction with exposed and vulnerable peo-ple and natural systems. It is therefore necessary a prevention planning to preserve human health and to reduce economic <b>losses.</b> <b>Prevention</b> should mainly be carried out with more adequate land management, also supported {{by the development of}} an appropriate risk pre-diction tool based on weather forecasts.

In particular, a specific risk index (WT-FLARI) for each WT was developed at national and regional scale. This study has identified a specific risk index associated with each weather type, calibrated for each Italian region and applicable to both annual and sea-sonal levels. The risk index represents the seasonal and annual vulnerability of each Italian region and indicates that additional preventive actions are necessary for some regions. Th...|$|R

2500|$|Security – Packaging {{can play}} an {{important}} role in reducing the security risks of shipment. [...] Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail <b>loss</b> <b>prevention.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} form of self-insurance is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage {{for the majority of}} governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. [...] Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a risk pool. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> services) and subject matter expertise. [...] Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. [...] Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing protection device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E
