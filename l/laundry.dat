5|$|The Yale Union <b>Laundry</b> Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} <b>laundry</b> during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their <b>laundry</b> for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam <b>laundry</b> machine in the mid-19thcentury, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible {{by the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Charles F. Brown, {{who entered}} the <b>laundry</b> {{business}} in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale <b>Laundry</b> Building, and to operate an industrial power <b>laundry</b> on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and {{the main part of}} the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale <b>Laundry,</b> one of the larger laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women.|$|E
