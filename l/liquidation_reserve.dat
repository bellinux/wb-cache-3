40|$|This paper evaluates ways {{to protect}} highly dollarized banking systems from {{systemic}} liquidity runs (such as the ones that took place recently in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay). In view {{of the limitations of}} available (private or official) insurance schemes, and the distortions introduced by central bank lending of last resort (LOLR), the authors favor decentralized liquid foreign asset requirements on dollar deposits, supplemented by a scheme of "circuit breakers. " The latter combines the use of limited dollar liquidity to ensure the convertibility of transactional deposits with a mechanism that automatically limits the convertibility of dollar term deposits once triggered by a predetermined decline in banks'' liquidity.

While both Franco-American gold policies and systemic weaknesses of the international monetary system emerge as important factors in explaining the international distribution of reserves, the first of these factors turns out to play the more important role in the monetary stringency associated with the Great Depression. ...|$|R
