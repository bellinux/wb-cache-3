5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, {{including the}} posts the 'beauty' {{is tied to}} and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands and arms (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like Archaeopteryx.|$|E

She {{is on the}} track and field team along with Mariya, who is her , and has low confidence in her ability to run. Another first-year at {{the dormitory}} named Kana Suoin meets Mizuho {{on the day he}} moves in, and soon after Mizuho becomes her Oneesama. Kana is more than happy to serve Mizuho any way she can, since she admires him immensely. A hyperactive ghost resides in Mizuho's room named Ichiko Takashima and is shown to speak very fast when excited. She says that Mizuho <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like her previous Elder love interest, who turns out to be Mizuho's deceased mother. The student council president at Seio is Takako Itsukushima who tends to have a serious personality.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{definition}} of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to n4 exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz is based on closed ordered walks (short clow). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like an iterated product of triangular matrices.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E
25|$|The {{chimney swift}} <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like the closely related Vaux's swift, but is {{slightly}} larger, with relatively longer wings and tail, slower wingbeats {{and a greater}} tendency to soar. It tends to be darker on the breast and rump than the Vaux's swift, though there is some overlap in plumage coloring. It can {{be as much as}} 30 percent heavier than the Vaux's swift, and its wings, which are proportionately narrower, show a pronounced bulge in the inner secondaries. The chimney swift is smaller, paler and shorter tailed than the black swift. In Central America, it is most similar to the Chapman's swift, but it is paler (matte olive rather than glossy black) and has a stronger contrast between its pale throat and the rest of its underparts than does the more uniformly colored Chapman's swift.|$|E

25|$|Particularly in {{the medieval}} period, Satan was often shown as having horns and a goat's {{hindquarters}} (though occasionally with the legs of a chicken or a mule), and with a tail. He was also depicted as carrying a pitchfork, the implement used in Hell to torment the damned, or a trident, deriving from the regalia of the sea-god Poseidon. Occasionally more imaginative depictions were illustrated: Sometimes the Devil was depicted as having faces all over his body, as in the painting of a Deal with the Devil. Depictions of the Devil covered in boils and scars, animal-like hair, and monstrous deformities were also common. None of these images seem {{to be based on}} biblical materials, as Satan's physical appearance is never described in the Bible or any other religious text. Rather, this image is apparently based on pagan Horned Gods, such as Pan, Cernunnos, Molek, Selene and Dionysus, common to many pagan religions. Pan in particular <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like the images of the medieval Satan. These images later became the basis for Baphomet, which is portrayed in Eliphas Levi's 1854 Dogme et rituel de la haute magie (English translation Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual). Even some Satanists use Baphomet as the image of Satan in Satanic worship. It has been alleged that this image was chosen specifically to discredit the Horned God.|$|E

Upon Willis' victory, Bricker wired {{a friend to}} express jubilation, {{which turned out to}} have been unfounded: [...] "Election showed {{definite}} trend in all areas against New Deal. I was not surprised at the outcome particularly in Kentucky because the thinking {{of the people of the}} Middle West is in line with results down there. It <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like a Republican victory next year." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{crescent}} moon {{shape in the}} middle of the sky <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like a circumzenithal arc, which is parallel to the horizon but centred at and located near zenith. [...] However, they only form when the sun is located lower than 32.2° and are at their brightest when the sun is located at 22°, which is not consistent with other haloes depicted in the painting. [...] Furthermore, one of the most striking features of circumzenithal arcs is their rainbow colours, and the shape in the painting is perfectly devoid of any colours. It is however not a complete circle (see Kern arc), and it is facing the sun, which are both correct properties for this phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|The fossils {{found in}} Java are {{considered}} the type specimen for H. erectus. Because the fossils of Java Man were found [...] "scattered in an alluvial deposit"they had been laid there by the flow of a riverdetractors doubted that they belonged to the same species, let alone the same individual. German pathologist Rudolf Virchow, for instance, argued in 1895 that the femur {{was that of a}} gibbon. Dubois had difficulty convincing his critics, because he had not attended the excavation, and could not explain specifically enough the exact location of the bones. Because the Trinil thighbone <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like that of a modern human, {{it might have been a}} [...] "reworked fossil", that is, a relatively young fossil that was deposited into an older layer after its own layer had been eroded. For this reason, there is still dissent about whether all the Trinil fossils represent the same species.|$|E
500|$|King George VI's florin, {{produced}} {{each year}} between 1937 and 1951, <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{like the one}} planned for his brother Edward VIII. Like on the patterns for King Edward, the words [...] are omitted; they would remain absent for the coin's remaining existence. The obverse, by Thomas Humphrey Paget, shows the left-facing effigy of the King inscribed [...] The reverse, by Kruger Gray, depicts a crowned rose with a thistle and shamrock on either side. There is a G below the thistle and R below the shamrock, and the inscription [...] until 1948. From 1949, the coins were struck without the , in acknowledgement of India's independence. From 1947, the metal content was changed, as for all British silver circulating coins, to 75% copper, 25% nickel. This {{was due to the}} need for Britain to return Lend-Lease silver to the United States. The florin's diameter and weight remained unchanged at 11.3 grams and 28.5 millimetres, despite the change of alloy.|$|E

While trying out a new vehicle designed by his friend Mark, Oliver almost drowns, but is saved by his mother Allie; however, she immediately dies from heart problems after saving him. As Oliver cries, his tears cause his doll, a gift from his mother, to come to life and reveal itself as a fairy named Shizuku, who tells Oliver that he is from another world where an evil wizard named Jabou took control. He also tells Oliver that each person from his world has a [...] "soulmate", a person that shares a link with someone in Oliver's world, and that his mother <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like a great sage, Alicia, who was captured by Jabou. Realizing that Alicia must have been Allie's soulmate, Oliver sets out with Shizuku {{to travel to the}} other world and rescue Alicia in the hope that doing so will bring Allie back in his world.|$|E

500|$|Paul Dean of Faded Glamour {{believed}} that Strike Back [...] "remains {{pretty good at}} what it does—providing Sky viewers with their weekly Die Hard fix," [...] adding [...] "series two won't win any new converts, but it <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like {{it will continue to}} serve up the same pacey, unpretentious and unambiguous action as its predecessor." [...] Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated it 2.5 out of five. Foley felt the death of Porter in the first episode was [...] "striking" [...] since Armitage was the [...] "main reason for watching." [...] The reviewer also {{believed that}} while the first series [...] "offered a keen mix of Spooks and 24 that expertly blended top-drawer action with some emotional complexity and intrigue," [...] the second series [...] "already feels inferior to both by virtue of the fact that its brains appear to lie in its pants, or blown from Porter's head." [...] Keith Watson of Metro stated that Project Dawn was merely [...] "gung-ho nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, and was shot in West Hollywood at [...] "The London". It premiered on MTV on January 28, 2010. French fashion model Noemie Lenoir portrays Usher's love interest. Like the album version of the song, the music video does not feature Plies or his verse. In the video, Usher struggles {{to get home to}} his wife, however due to several obligations and his partying, he cannot make it. Previous shots are given of Usher and Lenoir in a brown backdrop, and assumed previous situations of their love life and Usher coming home. Scenes are seen with Usher in a boardroom setting, and then teaching dance to a group of women in a studio, then in a club. Several instances in the video are unknown as in the scene in which Usher takes a phone call, unknown to the viewer for [...] "business or pleasure," [...] as explained by James Montgomery of MTV News. In describing the video, he went on to say, [...] "...you can kind of see why it'd be about both. Such is the life he's chosen, and now he must deal with the repercussions." [...] In following scenes the threat of infidelity is seen even clearer as Usher gets close to the [...] "over-friendly dancers" [...] and [...] "sipping — and spitting — champagne in a place that <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like a strip club." ...|$|E

[...] A sub-set of the limited equity model is the no-equity model, which <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like renting, with a very low purchase price (comparable to a rental security deposit) and a monthly fee in lieu of rent. [...] When selling, all that is re-couped is that very low purchase price.|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, Professor William E. Knickerbocker, Chairman of the Romance Languages Department, {{was accused}} of {{anti-semitism}} by four faculty members. They claimed that [...] "for at least seven years they {{have been subjected to}} continual harassment and what <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like discrimination" [...] by Knickerbocker. Four years later Knickerbocker was again accused of anti-semitism, this time for denying honors to high-achieving Jewish students. About the same time, Professor William C. Davis of the Economics Department was accused by students of maintaining a racially segregated dormitory at Army Hall. Professor Davis was the dormitory's administrator. CCNY students, many of whom were World War II veterans, launched a massive strike in protest against Knickerbocker and Davis. The New York Times called the event [...] "the first general strike at a municipal institution of higher learning." [...] Also see the Knickerbocker Case.|$|E
