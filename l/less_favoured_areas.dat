40|$|In {{a special}} report on EU {{agricultural}} sector aid to <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> <b>areas</b> of the EU, which accounts for 55. 8 % of the EU's agricultural holdings, the EU Court of Auditors found that: there is insufficient {{evidence to show that}} the classification of <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> <b>areas</b> is valid; while the system should have been reviewed in the early 1990 s no such review took place in the face of opposition from EU member states; definitions of <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> <b>areas</b> vary considerably.

Our aim was to analyse the distribution of traditional agricultural landscapes in <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> <b>areas</b> {{and the effects of}} the supportive measures of the Common Agricultural Policy, which are oriented towards helping farmers from these areas in maintaining traditional agriculture.

In this paper, we analyse the spatial economic consequences of LFA support for all 16 NUTS 2 regions in Poland using a regional computable general equilibrium model called POLTERM.

The majority of Hill farming land in England {{is classified as}} <b>Less</b> <b>Favoured</b> <b>Area</b> (LFA), and the LFA constitutes 17% of land farmed in England. [...] The LFA is further divided into Severely Disadvantaged Areas (SDAs) and Disadvantaged Areas (DAs), which make up 67% and 33% of the LFA respectively. These areas are classified as such on account of poor climate, soils, and terrain which cause higher costs in production and transportation as well as lower yields and less productivity. The LFA is significant in England’s farming on a whole despite these disadvantages: 30% of beef cows and 44% of breeding sheep come from LFAs.

A group of farms receiving support payments was compared with a group without this kind of support, in order to evaluate the impact of support payments. The results show that LFA pay-ments have facilitated a significant income growth, especially for small farms. They have also con-tributed to more intense use of the land.

Managerial efficiency scores are calculated using a four-step approach that allows disentangling managerial inefficiency from other technical inefficiency components, notably what is due to unfavourable environment conditions.

Moreover, there is a significant negative relationship between managerial efficiency and CAP direct payments for crop farms, but a positive relationship for livestock farms.

40|$|This paper investigates French {{field crop}} farms’ use {{of various types}} of labour during the period 1990 – 2007. We explore the {{determinants}} of {{the three types of}} labour used on farm (family labour, hired labour and contract labour), with a particular emphasis on the impact of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms and subsidies on the three labour types. We estimate a system of three equations, including a censored model, using the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) database. We find that hired labour and contract labour are substitutes as expected, but that hired labour and family labour are complements. This may reveal complementarities between management tasks (which are specifically for the farm head and family labour) and technical operations (the only operations performed by hired labour). In addition, we find that, in general, crop area payments and Single Farm Payments (SFP) have reduced farm labour, while agri-environmental payments, <b>Less</b> <b>Favoured</b> <b>Area</b> (LFA) payments and investment subsidies have increased it. Our results agree with most of the literature that coupled and decoupled area payments reduce labour use on farms...|$|R

The first goal is {{directed}} to the overall problematic {{of the development of}} the mountain areas, giving particular attention to the generic constraints that can be expected especially in the <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> mountain <b>areas</b> of Southern Europe. That is, areas traditionally submitted to the dominance of a poor agriculture practised under very harsh conditions, difficult accessibility and showing a persistent demographic drainage. The second goal is to conduct a reflection of some preliminary results of the Portuguese case study, which is part of a broad theoretical and empirical research that includes five European Mediterranean countries under the framework of a FAIR project. This reflection is based on the answers given by a sample of actual entrepreneurs, about the main factors that strengthen or undermine the development of their business. The paper will focus on rural entrepreneurship both in the secondary and tertiary sectors. This opinion is in tune not only with the theoretical idea {{that it is necessary to}} promote and support non agricultural activities in order to develop the <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> rural <b>areas,</b> but it is also in tune with recent policy options of the European Union.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} farm-based tourism in the <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> <b>area</b> of the northern Pennines. Farm tourism is conceptualized as an alternative farm enterprise (AFE) comprising one of seven possible `pathways of farm business developmentâ��. As such, the development of farm-based tourism (FBT) is influenced by a range of factors both external and internal to the farm. Lower levels of family labour distinguish tourist AFE farms from non-tourist AFE farms, while different types of FBT are associated with particular farm and household characteristics. Nevertheless, the reasons for adopting tourist enterprises are diverse and often very individualistic. Institutional involvement in FBT {{in the study area}} is increasing, but it is reactive rather than proactive and tends to constrain as well as enable the development of farm tourism. Few farmers have contacted institutions about new or existing farm tourism enterprises. However, levels of inter-agency networking are increasing and a core of eight institutions is now dominating institutional behaviour towards AFEs and FBT in the northern Pennines, especially in Northumberland. More research is needed on the interactions between farm households and institutions in the development of FBT...|$|R

The {{results suggest that the}} rate of modulation, introduced by the 2003 reforms, will have a very minor impact on farm profitability and will exert little pressure on farms to restructure. Farms that can be profitable without any direct payments while valuing unpaid land and labour input at their opportunity costs are significantly more likely to be large, extensive, specialised in cropping and based in a non-mountainous <b>less</b> <b>favoured</b> <b>area.</b> Direct payments account for a smaller share of the gross revenue of profitable farms.
