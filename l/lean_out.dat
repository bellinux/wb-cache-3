5|$|The {{player can}} select from four {{difficulty}} levels: Walk on the Beach, Combat Op, Suicide Mission, and FUBAR. A player only {{gain access to}} the FUBAR difficulty after completing the game on Suicide Mission. Various new weapons and equipment become available as the game progresses, some dropped by downed enemies. These include several different rifles, handguns, and machine guns. Some offer alternate firing modes, like attaching a suppressor or using a telescopic sight. Players can also acquire and make use of grenade launchers, hand grenades, and turrets. However, the player can only carry two weapons at a time. Supply caches can be found {{in different parts of the}} game, allowing the player to refill their ammo and grenades. Whenever the player successfully shoots an enemy in the head, the game enters a slow-motion mode for a short period of time. The player can also defeat enemies at close range via melee combat. Dying enemies can be executed, which grants the player additional ammo. Hiding behind cover can provide protection and prevents the player from being shot, as well as providing opportunities to blindfire or <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> to shoot enemies.|$|E
25|$|After wartime {{experiences}} suggested improvements, Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft {{were given}} extra features to augment their air-sea rescue capability. One such invention {{was a small}} platform that could be braced {{against the side of}} the flying boat's hull to allow a team of two Catalina crewmen to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> into the water and rescue a swimmer.|$|E
25|$|The first {{train in}} the United Kingdom with {{corridor}} connections between all carriages entered service on 7 March 1890 on the Paddington to Birkenhead route, and further corridor trains were introduced on all the main routes {{over the next few}} years. In 1900 a new Milford Boat Train set introduced electric lights and the communication cord was moved inside the train; until now a passenger needing to stop the train in an emergency had to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> of the window and pull a cord above the door. At this time carriages generally had a clerestory roof but elliptical roofs were fitted to the GWR steam rail motors in 1903.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stobell, {{afraid to}} trust himself, {{got up and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> of the window.|$|R
60|$|The coupé, however, {{was already}} occupied. Elisabeth <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> of the window. She {{held the door}} open.|$|R

25|$|After {{purchasing}} {{the more powerful}} Hiller 12E, Wes began to operate more lift jobs. One of these large jobs {{was working on the}} John Day Dam on his company's name sake Columbia River. Here Wes began performing precision lift jobs by using a longer than average cable. The concept was the pilot could <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> the side of the aircraft and see directly where they are placing the load. A few years later Wes' brother Jim was flying a Sikorsky S-61 in the Colorado Rockies. Jim was so cold he was forced to land. In need of an enclosed cockpit Columbia went on to develop the first pilot bubble window.|$|E
25|$|Mélisande is at {{the tower}} window, singing a song (Mes longs cheveux) as she combs her hair. Pelléas appears and asks her to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> so he can kiss her hand as he is going away the next day. He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down {{from the window and}} he kisses and caresses it instead. Pelléas playfully ties Mélisande's hair to a willow tree in spite of her protests that someone might see them. A flock of doves takes flight. Mélisande panics when she hears Golaud's {{footsteps}} approaching. Golaud dismisses Pelléas and Mélisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pelléas away.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} 119 undelivered aircraft {{were bought}} {{up by the}} British Purchasing Commission and transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan between August and September 1940, and all were operational by November The type was named the Yale Mk.I following British naming practice of naming trainers after education institutions and US-supplied aircraft after American locations, in this case, Yale University, and were used initially as intermediate pilot trainers taking pilots from the de Havilland Tiger Moth and Fleet Finch to the much faster and more complex North American Harvard, until this category was dispensed with as being unnecessary. They were then relegated for use as airborne wireless radio trainers, along with the contemporary Fleet Fort intermediate trainer in 1943. Prior to service entry, the throttle and engine mixture controls were modified from the system used by the French whereby the throttle was pulled back to increase power, and the mixture control pulled back to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> the mixture, to the system used on the Harvard. The Yale appeared in the movie Captains of the Clouds. The RCAF sold all surviving examples off as scrap in 1946 but over 30 survive today {{as a result of}} a large number of them being bought surplus by a single farmer, with about 15 currently in airworthy condition.|$|E
60|$|The tramp of hoofs grew nearer, and the Colonel <b>leaned</b> <b>out</b> {{through the}} open {{casement}} with the hand that gripped its ledge quivering.|$|R

2500|$|Chadwell St Mary {{has one of}} the few {{examples}} of a [...] "Sunspan" [...] house designed by the architect Wells Coates. Although built in the 1950s, Woodside Primary School's architecture has been described as the slightly earlier [...] "ocean liner" [...] style of Art Deco. The building features a number of bricked curves and circular windows, while the wrought-iron banisters on the stairs are deliberately set to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> at an angle.|$|E
2500|$|In the Mouldiness Manifesto {{he first}} claimed the [...] "Window Right": [...] "A {{person in a}} rented {{apartment}} {{must be able to}} <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> of his window and scrape off the masonry within arm's reach. And he must be allowed to take a long brush and paint everything outside within arm's reach. So that it will be visible from afar to everyone in the street that someone lives there who is different from the imprisoned, enslaved, standardised man who lives next door." [...] In his nude speeches of 1967 and 1968 Hundertwasser condemned the enslavement of humans by the sterile grid system of conventional architecture and by the output of mechanised industrial production. He rejected rationalism, the straight line and functional architecture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{undergraduates}} have {{a number}} of traditions: Painting The Rock (originally a fountain donated by the Class of 1902) is a way to advertise, for example, campus organizations, events in Greek life, student groups, and university-wide events. Dance Marathon, a 30-hour philanthropic event, has raised more than 13 million dollars in its history for various children's charities. Primal Scream is held at 9 p.m. on the Sunday before finals week every quarter; students <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> of windows or gather in courtyards and scream. Armadillo Day, or, more popularly, Dillo Day, a day of music and food, is held on Northwestern's Lakefill every Spring on the weekend after Memorial Day. [...] And in one of the University's newer traditions, every year during freshman orientation, known as Wildcat Welcome, freshmen and transfer students pass through Weber Arch to the loud huzzahs of upperclassmen and the music of the University Marching Band.|$|E

6000|$|A {{policeman}} {{pulled the}} little soldier by the arm; his drab figure with eyes fixed and lustreless, passed down and away. From his very soul Mr. Bosengate wanted to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> and say: [...] "Cheer up, cheer up! I understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [The {{agitation}} in {{the street}} communicates itself to the room. [...] Some of the ladies weep silently as they wait, much longer this [...] time.

60|$|You cannot <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> of a German bed {{to pick up}} {{anything}} off the floor, owing to its box-like formation; {{so he has to}} scramble out after it, and of course every time he does this he barks both his shins twice against the sides of the bed.|$|E
60|$|Betty {{was so full}} of this {{delightful}} {{plan that}} she went early to bed, but did not forget to <b>lean</b> <b>out</b> of her window and peep through the roses into the nest where Mamma Wren brooded over her babies while the papa roosted near by with his head under his wing.|$|E
