The monitoring towards laundry {{business was}} a part of environmental preservation effort. How does the role of <b>Life</b> <b>Environmental</b> Agency of Yogyakarta in the monitoring of laundry business activity as an effort of <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>control</b> of Yogyakarta, what are the obstacles faced by <b>Life</b> <b>Environmental</b> Agency of Yogyakarta in monitoring laundry business activity as the effort of <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>control</b> in Yogyakarta. This thesis was aimed to find out the role of <b>Life</b> <b>Environmental</b> Agency of Yogyakarta in monitoring laundry business activity as an effort of <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>control</b> in Yogyakarta. This was empirical research that focused on law behavior. In the empirical research, primary data was used as the main data besides secondary data. There were two conclusions drawn from this research, which was the licensing monitoring, detergent uses, waste discharge process and obstacles faced were lack of monitoring because there were too many laundry businesses and there were still many unlicensed laundry business. Related government gives socialization to laundry businesses. Yogyakarta city environmental agency should add officers to conduct surveillance on a regular basis. Yogyakarta city government nedds to conduct law enforcement against businesses that violate the laundry rules...|$|R

The effective rate of protection equation is modified in order to quantify the loss of protection due to <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs and {{compare it to the}} protection afforded by the tariff structure. Results are presented for the following two cases: (1) only direct <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs influence the net level of protection, and (2) direct <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs and <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs borne by inputs influence the net level of protection. For the case with direct <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs and <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs borne by inputs, the loss ofprotection due to <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> costs is 19. 67 % of the protection afforded by the U.

40|$|Latino and African American {{children}} with asthma are {{at increased risk}} for asthma morbidity compared with non–Latino White children. <b>Environmental</b> <b>control</b> (ie, <b>environmental</b> exposures and family strategies to control them) may contribute to greater asthma morbidity for ethnic minority children living in urban environments. This study examined ethnic differences in a semi-structured assessment of <b>environmental</b> <b>control,</b> associations between <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> and asthma outcomes (asthma control, functional limitation, and emergency department [ED] use), and ethnic differences in environmental triggers in a sample of urban Latino, African American, and non–Latino White families. One hundred thirty-three children (6 – 13 years of age) and their caregivers completed demographic questionnaires, measures of asthma control and morbidity, and a semi-structured interview assessing <b>environmental</b> <b>control.</b> Reported <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> differed significantly by ethnicity (P< 0. 05), with Latino families reporting higher levels of <b>environmental</b> <b>control.</b> Reported <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> was significantly associated with asthma control (P< 0. 017) and functional limitation (P< 0. 017). Reported <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> and ED use were significantly associated in Latino families (P< 0. 05). Non–Latino White and African American families reported more secondhand smoke exposure than Latino families (P< 0. 001). Latino families reported more optimal home <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> than other ethnic groups. Substantial ethnic differences in asthma triggers suggest that observed ethnic disparities in asthma may be due, at least in part, to differences in the home environment...|$|R

The first stage of this project collected data from existing users of speech-driven <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> systems and provided information for the specification for the new device. A secondary analysis of this data revealed perceptions about <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> systems in general and the results are presented here. Independence and control emerged as a key aspect of <b>environmental</b> <b>control</b> systems. In addition it was possible to identify other themes around topics such as perceptions of service delivery and provision.

The paper divides <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> {{modes of}} {{residential}} projects into four types: static and non-integrated mode, static and integrated mode, dynamic and non-integrated mode, and dynamic and integrated mode. The paper elicits that the dynamic and integrated <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> mode for residential projects {{is better than}} other three kinds of modes by comparing four kinds of dissimilarity modes of <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> system. The Dynamic and Integrated <b>Environmental</b> Risk <b>Control</b> System(DIERCS) for residential projects is established. The establishment of Dynamic and Integrated <b>Environmental</b> Risk <b>Control</b> System(DIERCS) for residential projects is based on dynamic and integrated <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> mode; therefore, it is necessity {{to carry on a}} study to the dynamic and integrated <b>environmental</b> risk <b>control</b> mode of residential projects first from the theory.
