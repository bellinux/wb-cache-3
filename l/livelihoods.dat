40|$|This paper {{examines}} the various dimensions of <b>livelihood</b> risk as informed by a in-depth {{case study of}} an agrarian village namely, Cherumad in Kerala. The <b>livelihood</b> risk in Cherumad since {{the last quarter of}} the 1990 ’s has been unique and unprecedented in their nature and intensity. The effect of price risk and productivity risk of crops became an income risk to the farming community. For agricultural labour too it was an income risk with double effects of wage risk and employment risk. These risk have resulted in a general fall in the living standards of people. The <b>livelihood</b> dynamics in Cherumad shows that improvement in <b>livelihood</b> assets improves <b>livelihood</b> outcomes and vice versa. Institutions (both formal and informal) affect access to assets and <b>livelihood</b> outcomes. Across socio-economic groups, <b>livelihood</b> outcome are determined by the portfolio of <b>livelihood</b> assets, especially land. The households have developed a number of coping strategies in response to distress. These strategies are meant to smooth consumption and income and rebuilding household <b>livelihood.</b> In this context, the overall emphasis of state intervention should be in strengthening their <b>livelihood</b> assets.

Based on the gradient altitude and resettlement project, mountain settlements are classified into four types: the high-mountain settlement, the semi-mountain settlement, the river valley settlement and the resettlement area. Using semi-structured interviews, we have defined the farm and non-farm <b>livelihood</b> strategies as dependent variables, while the natural, human, physical, financial, and social capitals are considered as independent variables in order to model the relationship between <b>livelihood</b> strategies and <b>livelihood</b> capitals. In term of different settlements, we estimate the sensitivity of farm and non-farm <b>livelihood</b> strategies to <b>livelihood</b> capitals. The results indicate that natural and human capitals exhibited a positive correlation with the farm <b>livelihood</b> strategy, although the effect varies with the four types of settlements. Financial and social capitals are the catalyst for driving non-farm activities. Our findings suggest that no size fits all solutions to the <b>livelihood</b> strategy issues, and only <b>livelihood</b> capitals will be helpful in the long term if they are complemented by relative policies that enhance capital capacity as well as increase access to capitals.

The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E

The number of income sources however did not have significant influence on whether a household was pursuing an agro-pastoral or off-farm <b>livelihood.</b> An explanation for this could be that pursuance of a pastoral <b>livelihood</b> competes for labour with other <b>livelihood</b> options.

30|$|The {{ultimate}} {{component of}} the conceptual framework is <b>livelihood</b> outcome which {{is a function of}} the types of <b>livelihood</b> activities the immigrants undertake and their personal characteristics (Fig. 1). Theoretically, a <b>livelihood</b> can either be positive [improve], negative [deteriorate] or neutral [remain the same] (GSS, 2013; Tanle, 2010, 2015). Positive outcomes denote improved <b>livelihood</b> status measured by improved food security, security of employment, increased incomes, improved human and social capitals, and increased assets (including access to land or land ownership and other consumer durable goods), reduction in vulnerability, and ultimately improvement in general wellbeing (Rigg et al., 2014). Negative <b>livelihood</b> outcome according to UNDP (2009) is denoted by increased vulnerability, and decline in <b>livelihood</b> status and well-being. Neutral outcomes on the other hand signify neither positive nor negative changes in the lives of the immigrants. Nevertheless, the <b>livelihood</b> status of the immigrants in this study was subjectively measured as either positive or negative due to the fact that the <b>livelihood</b> status of people cannot remain unchanged.|$|R
30|$|In the framework, <b>livelihood</b> {{strategy}} {{consists of}} various <b>livelihood</b> activities undertaken by individuals and households {{to make a}} living. In this study, the main <b>livelihood</b> strategy adopted among the immigrants is migration for itinerant retail trade. According to the framework for migration and <b>livelihood</b> studies (Tanle, 2015), the types of <b>livelihood</b> strategies migrants undertake are a function of their background characteristics (e.g. sex, age, education, place of origin). In line with this view, Tanle (2014) and Awumbila (2017) maintained that migrants tend to engage in <b>livelihood</b> activities which in their view afford them the greatest or optimal <b>livelihood</b> status (measured by their earnings and savings, access to essential goods and services and general socio-economic wellbeing). Based on the above observations in the conceptual framework (Fig. 1), it was hypothesised in the study that the socio-demographic characteristics of the immigrant traders {{and the types of}} trading activities they undertake at the destination had significant influence on their <b>livelihood</b> status (i.e. whether it has improved or deteriorated).|$|R

5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the <b>livelihoods</b> of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea.

However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units.

Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E

Around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire.

The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa. Moreover, the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish. The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices. The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade. The letter from King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut, which was translated by the ruler's Arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of Arab traders.
