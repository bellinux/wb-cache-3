5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are <b>living</b> <b>without</b> parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out {{of a desire to}} keep them out of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something that had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear <b>living</b> <b>without</b> him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of <b>living</b> <b>without</b> compromising the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|E

25|$|Thrombolysis, such as with {{recombinant}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to <b>living</b> <b>without</b> disability. It does not, however, improve chances of survival. Benefit is greater the earlier it is used. Between three and {{four and a half}} hours the effects are less clear. A 2014 review found a 5% {{increase in the number of}} people <b>living</b> <b>without</b> disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term. After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes. These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated.

25|$|The NEP {{and other}} {{privileges}} accorded to the Bumiputras or Malays under Article 153 {{have been noted}} for not explicitly seeking to eradicate poverty among the Malays, but instead largely aiming to improve the Malays' overall share of the economy, even if this share is held by {{a small number of}} Malays. However, the NEP has also been defended as having been largely successful in creating a Malay middle class and improving Malaysian standards of <b>living</b> <b>without</b> compromising the non-Bumiputra share of the economy in absolute terms; indeed, statistics indicate that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'.

25|$|Another case {{alluded to}} in the Torcaso v. Watkins footnote, and said by some to have {{established}} secular humanism as a religion under the law, is the 1957 tax case of , 249 F.2d 127 (D.C. Cir. 1957). The Washington Ethical Society functions much like a church, but regards itself as a non-theistic religious institution, honoring the importance of ethical <b>living</b> <b>without</b> mandating a belief in a supernatural origin for ethics. The case involved denial of the Society's application for tax exemption as a religious organization. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court's ruling, defined the Society as a religious organization, and granted its tax exemption. The Society terms its practice Ethical Culture. Though Ethical Culture {{is based on a}} humanist philosophy, it is regarded by some as a type of religious humanism. Hence, it would seem most accurate to say that this case affirmed that a religion need not be theistic to qualify as a religion under the law, rather than asserting that it established generic secular humanism as a religion.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus organizes a {{swimming}} contest and allows Ampelus to win. Ampelus is elated by his success and dresses up as a Bacchante {{as a form}} of celebration. Dionysus warns the boy to stay close to him, just in case a deity is jealous of their happiness and tries to kill him. A portent tells Dionysus that Ampelus will die and become a vine. Ate (Delusion) makes Ampelus jealous reminding him that Dionysus and the gods usually give their friends a special present, a special mount, and suggests that he should make a bull his own. Deluded, Ampelus rides a bull and provokes Selene by saying that he is a better bull-rider than her. Selene sends a gadfly to sting the bull. The animal starts kicking and Ampelus falls on his head on the ground. A satyr brings Dionysus the ill news. Dionysus prepares the body for the funeral and makes a long lament. Eros tries to console and distract him with the story of Calamos and Carpos, two handsome youngsters who were in love with each other. During {{a swimming}} contest Carpos drowns and Calamos, incapable of <b>living</b> <b>without</b> him, commits suicide. Calamos becomes the reeds of the river and Carpos the fruit of the earth. Dionysus is comforted with the story but mourning does not leave him. In the meantime the Seasons visit the house of Helios, the Sun.|$|E

500|$|The figure (right) {{examines}} sustainability at {{the scale}} of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN Human Development Index (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use. The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of <b>living</b> <b>without</b> increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed [...] "one planet" [...] consumption. Information generated by reports at the national, regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time.|$|E
500|$|Psycho-Pass further {{suggests}} {{that the price of}} <b>living</b> <b>without</b> stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so long as we accept that the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is [...] "fear" [...] as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize him for what he actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.|$|E
500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} <b>living</b> <b>without</b> stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E

50|$|The term bioorthogonal {{chemistry}} {{refers to}} any chemical reaction {{that can occur}} inside of <b>living</b> systems <b>without</b> interfering with native biochemical processes.

A number of chemical ligation strategies have been developed that fulfill the requirements of bioorthogonality, including the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between azides and cyclooctynes (also termed copper-free click chemistry), between nitrones and cyclooctynes, oxime/hydrazone formation from aldehydes and ketones, the tetrazine ligation, the isocyanide-based click reaction, and most recently, the quadricyclane ligation.|$|R
