25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.|$|E

50|$|Level of {{measurement}} or scale of measure is a classification {{that describes the}} nature of information within the values assigned to variables.

5000|$|The type or <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is a {{taxonomy}} for {{the methodological}} {{character of a}} comparison.

5000|$|In statistics, {{groups of}} {{individual}} data points may {{be classified as}} belonging to any of various statistical data types, e.g. categorical ("red", [...] "blue", [...] "green"), real number (1.68, -5, 1.7e+6), etc. The data type is a fundamental component of the semantic content of the variable, and controls which sorts of probability distributions can logically be {{used to describe the}} variable, the permissible operations on the variable, the type of regression analysis used to predict the variable, etc. The concept of data type is similar to the concept <b>of</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> but more specific: For example, count data require a different distribution (e.g. a Poisson distribution or binomial distribution) than non-negative real-valued data require, but both fall under the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> (a ratio scale).|$|R
50|$|Ordinal data is a categorical, {{statistical}} data type where the variables have natural, ordered categories and the distances between the categories is not known. These data exist on an ordinal scale, {{one of four}} <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> described by S. S. Stevens in 1946. The ordinal scale is distinguished from the nominal scale by having ordered categories. It also differs from interval and ratio scales by not having category widths that represent equal increments of the underlying attribute.|$|E
5000|$|In statistics, dichotomous {{data may}} only exist at first two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{measurement}},</b> namely at the nominal level of measurement (such as [...] "British" [...] vs [...] "American" [...] when measuring nationality) {{and at the}} ordinal level of measurement (such as [...] "tall" [...] vs [...] "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a dummy variable. If a dependent variable in a regression is dichotomous, then logistic regression or probit regression is employed.|$|E

50|$|In social {{sciences}} in general, psychology and psychiatry included, data about differences between individuals, like any data, can be collected and measured using different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Those levels include dichotomous (a person either has a personality trait or not) and non-dichotomous approaches. While the non-dichotomous approach allows for understanding that everyone lies somewhere {{on a particular}} personality dimension, the dichotomous (nominal categorical and ordinal) approaches only seek to confirm that a particular person either has or {{does not have a}} particular mental disorder.|$|E
