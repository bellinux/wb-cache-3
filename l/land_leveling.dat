Many of the industrial policies affecting the cluster—including <b>leveling</b> <b>land,</b> developing better varieties, establishing a potato trade association, lobbying for increasing freight car quotas, and attracting processing firms—were implemented at the local level, highlighting the need for discussion of local industrial policymaking as a major determinant of cluster development.

40|$|A {{major goal}} of {{both state and}} federal {{agricultural}} and environmental agencies in the United States is sustainable management of watersheds where agriculture is a dominant land use. Because watershed processes and conditions directly and indirectly affect soil, water, air, plants, animals, and humans, USDA NRCS encourages a watershed approach to management of agricultural operations in the United States. This requires a suite of approaches or practices that address natural resource concerns in uplands and stream corridors. <b>Land</b> clearing, <b>leveling,</b> draining, tilling, fertilizing, and harvesting together create prolonged perturbations manifested in the ecological and physical conditions of streams and rivers. Regardless of {{the cause of a}} problem in a watershed, its effect on aquatic habitats and their biological communities is dramatic. Physical damage due to channelization, erosion, sedimentation, and altered hydrological regimes coupled with ecological damage due to excessive nutrients, pesticide contamination, and riparian clearing cumulatively diminish the quality of aquatic habitats and threaten their biological communities. In general, the primary goals for farmers and ranchers in agricultural watersheds are (a) control of non-point source pollutants such as nutrients, sediments, and pesticides, (b) adequate water supplies for crop and animal production, and (c) stream/river channel stability. As indicators of watershed conditions, aquatic species and their habitats play a pivotal role in how we manage watersheds, with the ultimate goal of sustaining water quality and ecological integrity. Conservation planning identifies resource concerns within watersheds and what practices should be implemented to address them. If such practices are applied according to USDA standards, habitats will benefit as will the species that inhabit them.

Biomass to biofuel conversion is compared between lipid extraction (LE) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technologies. National-scale models of water, CO 2 (as flue gas), <b>land</b> acquisition, site <b>leveling,</b> construction of connecting roads, and transport of HTL oil to existing refineries are used in conjunction with estimates of fuel value (from HTL) to prioritize and select from 88, 692 unit farms (UF, 405 ha in pond area), a number sufficient to produce 136 E+ 9 L yr- 1 of renewable diesel (36 billion gallons yr- 1). Strain selection and choice of conversion technology have large economic impacts, with differences between combinations of strains and biomass to biofuel technologies being up to $ 10 million dollars yr- 1 UF- 1. Results based on the most productive strain, HTL-based fuel conversion, and resource costs show that the economic potential between geographic locations within the selection can differ by up to $ 4 million yr- 1 UF- 1, with 1. 8 BGY of production possible from the most cost-effective sites. The local spatial variability in site rank is extreme, with very high and low sites within 10 s of km of each other.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze the short-term effects of <b>land</b> <b>leveling</b> on the magnitudes, variances, spatial variability, and distributions of surface (0 – 20 [*]cm) and subsurface (20 – 40 [*]cm) soil properties of bulk density, field capacity, permanent wilting point, water holding capacity and particle size fractions. The study was conducted in a 1. 2 [*]ha field with clay loam soil located on the low terraces of Yesilirmak River, Tokat, Turkey. According to the paired t-test results, water holding capacity, and bulk density significantly increased, while permanent wilting point (P ≤  0. 001) and field capacity (P ≤  0. 05) significantly decreased for surface soil due to <b>land</b> <b>leveling.</b> The reasons for the increases in WHC values in both cut and fill areas (29 %, and 12 %, resp.) of surface soil are look like the much more decreases in PWP values than those of FC values and the increases in BD values. The moderate positive linear relationship between the surface soil clay contents and cut depths through cut areas (r = 0. 64) was also determined in this study...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain more insight into the {{relationship}} between off-farm employment of rural households and water-saving investments and irrigation water use in rural China. Design/methodology/approach – Data from a survey held among 317 households in Minle County, Zhangye City, Gansu Province, covering the year 2007, are used for a probit analysis explaining investments in <b>land</b> <b>leveling</b> and for an ordinary least squares regression explaining irrigation water use per mu. Findings – Off-farm employment is not significantly related to investments in <b>land</b> <b>leveling,</b> but is negatively associated with water use per mu. In addition, the paper finds that the share of migrant students in a household is positively related to investments in <b>land</b> <b>leveling.</b> The results indicate the presence of major factor market imperfections in the research area, and confirm that the new economics of labor migration (NELM) approach is more relevant for analyzing off-farm employment and agricultural production in China than neoclassical economic theory. Originality/value – The paper expands the NELM approach towards the analysis of water-saving investments and water use. In addition, it distinguishes migrant students as an important category that should be taken into account in analyzing farm household decisions making.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the relationship between soil chemical and biological attributes and the magnitude of cuts and fills after the <b>land</b> <b>leveling</b> process of a lowland soil. Soil samples were collected from the 0 - 0. 20 m layer, before and after leveling, on a 100 point grid established in the experimental area, to evaluate chemical attributes and soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Leveling operations altered the magnitude of soil chemical and biological attributes. Values of Ca, Mg, S, cation exchange capacity, Mn, P, Zn, and soil organic matter (SOM) decreased in the soil profile, whereas Al, K, and MBC increased after leveling. <b>Land</b> <b>leveling</b> decreased in 20 % SOM average content in the 0 - 0. 20 m layer. The {{great majority of the}} chemical attributes did not show relations between their values and the magnitude of cuts and fills. The relation was quadratic for SOM, P, and total N, and was linear for K, showing a positive slope and indicating increase in the magnitude of these attributes in cut areas and stability in fill areas. The relationships between these chemical attributes and the magnitude of cuts and fills indicate that the <b>land</b> <b>leveling</b> map may be a useful tool for degraded soil recuperation through amendments and organic fertilizers...|$|E

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>leveling</b> or {{land grading}} for {{irrigation}} is modifying the surface relief {{of a field}} to a planned grade {{to provide a more}} suitable surface for efficiently applying irrigation water. Normally <b>land</b> <b>leveling</b> requires moving a lot of earth over several hundred feet. This {{should not be confused with}} land planning, land smoothing, or land floating. They are usually accomplished with special equipment to eliminate minor irregularities, and they do not change the general topography of the land surface.
