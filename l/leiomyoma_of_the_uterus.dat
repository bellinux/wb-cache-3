40|$|Objective: Mitotically active <b>leiomyoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> {{complicated}} with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding {{has never}} been reported in Taiwan. Here, we present a case of mitotically active <b>leiomyoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> complicated with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in a breast cancer patient who had been receiving tamoxifen for 2 years Case Report: A 56 -year-old woman visited our clinic due to abnormal vaginal spotting for 3 months. This patient had been menopausal for about 6 years without hormone replacement therapy. She had been suffering from breast cancer, had undergone conservative breast surgery, and had been taking tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for 2 years. Pelvic ultrasound was performed and revealed an 8. 9 × 7. 7 cm uterine mass. After simple total hysterectomy, we found an enlarged uterus with a mass over the posterior wall. Final pathology demonstrated a mitotically active leiomyoma, adenomyosis of the uterus, and proliferation of the endometrium. Conclusion: Endometrial cancer is rarely noted in breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen. Further, none have reported mitotically active <b>leiomyoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> From this case, endometrial proliferation and mitotically active <b>leiomyoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> {{may be related to}} tamoxifen therapy, and should not be neglected in breast cancer patients...|$|E

40|$|Answer: Massive uterine fibroidUterine fibroids (<b>leiomyomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus)</b> are {{extremely}} common, typically measuring 2 cm to 5 cm in size.

Histologically, a monoclonal proliferation ofsmooth muscle cells gives rise to these tumours, which can be hugely variable in size. Uterine fibroids occur twice as frequently inblack women as in either white or Asian women and can occur at any time between menarche and menopause, but are most common in women 35 to 49 years of age. 1 Fibroids typically resolve after menopause.

40|$|Although <b>leiomyomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> are <b>the</b> most {{frequent}} gynecological tumours, their pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Chromosomal rearrangements affecting the region 12 q 14 ~ 15 {{belong to the}} {{most frequent}} recurrent chromosomal aberrations. A strong overexpression of HMGA 2 in this group was confirmed in the present thesis. Since losses of miRNA binding sites due to truncated transcripts caused by intragenic breakpoints occur in a minority of these tumours, they cannot account for <b>the</b> reactivation <b>of</b> HMGA 2 in <b>leiomyomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 q 14 ~ 15 group in general. Moreover, fibroids without cytogenetically detectable 12 q 14 ~ 15 aberration were found to express HMGA 2 at higher rates than the corresponding myometrium. Therefore, HMGA 2 may also be of pathogenetic relevance in fibroids without chromosomal abnormalities and could possibly {{play a crucial role}} in a much larger fraction <b>of</b> uterine <b>leiomyomas</b> than previously assumed. Besides benign mesenchymal tumours, several malignant tumours of epithelial origin also exhibit a reactivation of HMGA 2.

40|$|Introduction: Cecal volvulus is a {{relatively}} uncommon encountered clinical condition. Presentation of case: A 48 -year-old patient known with a large uterine leiomyoma, presented with progressive abdominal pain since one week. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a very large <b>leiomyoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> severely distended loops of the small bowel with a caliber change and a suggested ‘whirl sign’ of the mesenteric vessels. A laparotomy was performed, showing a very large uterus as well as torsion of the mesentery of the cecum with a sharp demarcated area of necrosis of the right hemicolon. Discussion: Cecal volvulus due to a large uterine mass is a rare encountered clinical entity. The suggested mechanism might be the same mechanism causing cecal volvulus during pregnancy; the enlarged uterus raisingout the mobile cecum out of the pelvis. Obstruction may occur from kinking of the colon at a fixed point. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that uterine leiomyoma can be a cause of a cecal volvulus, leading to severe intestinal strangulation...|$|E

Myometrial cells at different phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstrual cycle to investigate <b>the</b> influences <b>of</b> oestrogen and progesterone during the cycle. 3.

Neoplastic cells <b>of</b> <b>leiomyomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> to investigate whether these benign tumours behave {{in the same manner}} as myometrium or, because they are neoplastic, they react differently. A preliminary investigation was undertaken to establish the optimal methodology for this study to measure myometrial and leiomyoma nuclei in <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> <b>The</b> aims <b>of</b> this preliminary investigation were: 1. To test <b>the</b> reproducibility <b>of</b> measurements <b>of</b> myometrial and <b>leiomyoma</b> nuclei in transverse and cross section. 2. To test five histological staining methods to ascertain the best method for a morphometric study on uterine cells. 3. To find the minimum sample size of nuclei per section <b>of</b> myometrium or <b>leiomyoma</b> in order to yield statistically significant results. This preliminary study found that the Haematoxylin and Eosin stain gave the most statistically reproducible measurements. Subjective assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five staining methods also found Haematoxylin and Eosin to be optimal. It was also found during the preliminary study that measuring the myometrial nuclei in cross rather than transverse section gave the most statistically reproducible measurements. It was also found that it was best to use an axial ratio criterion of 0, 9 when measuring cross-sectioned myometrial nuclei. The optimum sample size per section was also investigated and it was found that measuring 100 nuclei was optimal. It was found that in the uteri used in this study there was no statistically significant decrease in nuclear size after the menopause. It was also found that there was no statistically significant difference in nuclear size during <b>the</b> different phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstrual cycle. There was also no notable difference in nuclear size between nuclei in the fundus and lower segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uteri in this study.

It is more usual in pregnant women or postmenopausal women who have vascular disease. The condition is usually fatal unless treated with appropriate antibiotics and surgical intervention. Case presentation We report {{a case of a}} 44 -year-old Afro-Caribbean woman with diabetes who presented with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and fever over a period of five months. Her problem proved to be a diagnostic dilemma mimicking cholecystitis, pyelonephritis and ovarian cancer. Her blood cultures were positive on one occasion for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. An ultrasound scan suggested uterine fibroids but a computed tomography scan suggested an ovarian malignancy because the mass appeared heterogeneous with fluid filled areas. She was treated with several courses of antibiotics and eventually at laparotomy, she was found to have a large pyomyoma which was successfully removed by subtotal hysterectomy with immediate and complete resolution of her symptoms. Conclusion The diagnosis of pyomyoma should be considered in perimenopausal women with large fibroids and pyrexia of unknown origin. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leiomyomas</b> or myomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> {{also known}} as a fibroid <b>uterus,</b> are <b>the</b> most common tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> They are benign {{neoplasms}} of smooth muscle origin with various degrees of fibrous connective tissue.

Asymptomatic uterine fibroids can be left untreated {{as long as they are}} monitored closely. However, larger tumors usually require surgical treatment. Medical management by prescribing gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue has been used to suppress estrogen production, thereby reducing the size of existing myomas to make them amenable to laparoscopic surgery. Selective embolization of uterine artery has been used successfully in the treatment of uterine fibroids. We came across a similar case of a large leiomyoma in a sexually inactive adolescent girl. She presented with a lump in her abdomen and without a history of menstrual disturbances or intake of oral contraceptives. Keywords: leiomyoma of uterus, fibroid uteru...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case of}} endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from endometriosis of the mesenterium of the sigmoid colon following total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for <b>leiomyoma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> and infiltrating pelvic endometriosis, and hormone replacement therapy. A 62 -year-old woman presented with an abdominal tumor. Based on the diagnosis of mesocolonic tumor, sigmoidectomy with lymph node resection was performed. The tumor cellswere immunopositive for cytokeratin 7, but negative for cytokeratin 20, and the tumor was histologically diagnosed as endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the meso-colon. Hyperestrogenism has been implicated as {{a risk factor for}} the development of cancer from endometriosis. The patient had been receiving high-dose unopposed estrogens for 14 years after a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Physicians should recognize that endometriosis-associated neoplasms are able to cause symptoms or signs such as abdominal and/or pelvic pain, pelvic mass, and vaginal bleeding, especially if the patient has been treated with hormone replacement therapy. It is important to recognize the possibility of tumors arising from endometriosis when evaluating intestinal or mesenteric neoplasms in women, even in the patient who has previously undergone total abdom-inal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, particularly if the patient has a history of endometriosis and has received hormone replacement therapy.

40|$|Fumarate hydratase (FH) encodes a Krebs cycle (also called TCA cycle) enzyme which {{converts}} fumarate to malate {{and also}} {{functions as a}} tumour suppressor gene. Germline mutations in FH predispose to hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). Affected individuals develop benign smooth muscle tumours (<b>leiomyomas)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin and <b>uterus</b> and renal cysts and cancers; specifically type II papillary and collecting duct carcinomas. Kidney-specific deletion <b>of</b> Fh 1 (<b>the</b> murine orthologue <b>of</b> FH) recapitulates HLRCC in part and mice develop renal cysts that are proliferative and express constitutively hypoxia inducible factors - 1 α and - 2 α (Hif- 1 α and Hif- 2 α). This phenomenon of pseudo-hypoxia (HIF expression in normal oxygen tension) is also evident in cultured cells deficient in FH and is proposed as a possible mechanism for initiation and/or progression of carcinogenesis. We have utilised our mouse model to investigate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> Hif- 1 α and Hif- 2 α and Fh 1 in renal cyst development and show remarkably that combined genetic inactivation of Hif- 1 α and Fh 1 increased both cyst size and frequency. However, kidneys deficient for both Fh 1 and Hif- 2 α were comparable to those deficient for Fh 1. Immunohistochemical analyses show that Fh 1 inactivation leads to increased proliferation, DNA damage and affects the cell cycle in the renal cysts. Hif- 1 α and Hif- 2 α inactivation is not shown to contribute to these. Through genome-wide mRNA expression analysis we have identified that Ccnd 1 is significantly upregulated (or the most significantly upregulated gene) in Fh 1 /Hif- 1 α knockout kidneys compared to wild type and Fh 1 knockout kidneys. Other upregulated genes in the double knockout kidneys include genes involved in cell cycle, proliferation and structural organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell.

40|$|Uterine fibroids or <b>leiomyomas</b> are tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> which {{result from}} <b>the</b> {{excessive}} deposition <b>of</b> scar-like fibrous tissue into the myometrial smooth muscle. Although {{they are not}} metastatic, these growths cause chronic debilitating conditions in around 70 - 80 % of reproductive aged women. Treatment options for this common pathology are extremely limited and often involve invasive surgery or unwanted side effects. Hence there is an urgent need for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> better treatment options for this fibrotic disease. To test new treatments, a model system with which to investigate aspects of fibroid pathogenesis and evaluate treatment strategies is needed. Current models are limited and predominantly involve monolayer cell cultures. However such cultures do not facilitate <b>the</b> deposition <b>of</b> a collagenous extracellular matrix; {{a critical component of}} fibroids. This study investigates <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> a technique known as macromolecular crowding, to model fibroid pathology. In this technique, large space-occupying molecules are incorporated into the culture medium, facilitating the correct processing and deposition of collagen by cells in culture. This technique has been investigated in cultures of fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells. However its impact on collagen deposition by myometrial smooth muscle cells is unknown. By immunocytochemical staining, the current study demonstrates that like fibroblasts, myometrial smooth muscle cells respond to crowded culture conditions by increasing production of type I collagen. This is mediated by enhanced processing <b>of</b> procollagen, enabling <b>the</b> secretion and deposition of cross-linked collagen, thus modelling the most important and symptomatic feature of fibroid pathology. Unlike monolayer cultures, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> an extracellular matrix in this culture system enables investigation of cell-matrix interactions. Indeed the current study suggests that the extracellular matrix produced in these cultures may interact with cell surface receptors to influence alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actin cytoskeleton. By this means, these cultures may facilitate <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> mechanotransduction thought to be involved in fibroid pathogenesis. Furthermore, culturing myometrial cells under crowded conditions was shown to modulate <b>the</b> bioavailability <b>of</b> endogenous growth factors, further indicating that this methodology may prove useful in studying fibroid pathology...|$|R
