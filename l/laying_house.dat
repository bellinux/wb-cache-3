40|$|International audienceEffective {{terminal}} {{cleaning and}} disinfection (C&D) {{is regarded as a}} necessary step for the elimination of Salmonella spp. from <b>laying</b> <b>houses.</b> A total of 60 commercial <b>laying</b> <b>houses</b> which had <b>housed</b> <b>laying</b> flocks infected with Salmonella Enteritidis or S. Typhimurium that were representative of all production systems (cage, barn, free-range) were intensively sampled immediately after {{cleaning and disinfection}} {{as well as in the}} follow-on flock. The procedures investigated were: (1) A compound disinfectant consisting of a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and quarternary ammonium applied at the recommended concentration; (2) Formalin 10 % (vol/vol) of the standard 37 % commercial dilution applied by a contractor; (3) Other disinfection procedures selected and applied by the farmer. The recovery of Salmonella in the cleaned and disinfected houses was variable, with samples from floor and dropping boards/belts (cage houses) and scratching areas (non-cage houses) being the most likely to remain contaminated. In cage houses, the use of formalin 10 % led to a statistically greater reduction in the sample prevalence than using any of the other cleaning and disinfection method. A negative post-C&D result predicted clearance of Salmonella in 52 % cases, although the isolation of Salmonella from the houses immediately after C&D was not a perfect predictor of carry-over of infection...|$|R

50|$|Early battery cages {{were often}} used for {{selecting}} hens based on performance, since {{it is easy to}} track how many eggs each hen is laying if only one hen is placed in a cage. Later, this was combined with artificial insemination, giving a technique where each egg's parentage is known. This method is still used today.Early reports from Arndt about battery cages were enthusiastic.

50|$|The {{birds are}} {{then moved to}} broiler breeder laying houses or {{production}} barns. The birds are typically placed into crates, and transported by truck to a separate facility. Males and females are raised together at this point. Outwardly the <b>laying</b> <b>house</b> will resemble the rearing house. Inside, about one-half of the floor might consist of raised 'slats.' During the production run, manure will drop through the slats and accumulate in the pit underneath the slats. The birds are not generally caged, especially since the roosters must mate with the hens to fertilize the eggs. Nests are provided for laying hens. Both automatic and manual (example) nesting systems exist. Manual nests are usually stuffed with straw or shavings and eggs are hand-collected. Automatic systems usually have a plastic carpet lining, with a belt for egg collection. Careful layout and attention to bird behavior is required to avoid 'floor eggs'.|$|E
50|$|All poultrymen {{should realize}} that there are no known {{substitutes}} for sunshine and young green grass in keeping poultry in the best possible state of health and in promoting growth and maintaining egg production. Where sunshine and green grass cannot be provided, {{as in the case of}} birds kept in strict confinement, the best possible substitutes must be provided. In the case of most farm and many commercial flocks, however, the growing stock is reared on range, and the adult birds are given yards or allowed to roam at will.If the staggering losses among growing chicks and laying birds that occur annually are to be reduced materially, better methods of flock management must be employed. The losses from mortality are due largely to internal parasites and diseases of one kind or another. Bare ground over which the chickens have run for some time, mud puddles, and stagnant water are the chief sources of the spread of diseases, most of which are filth borne....The mortality that usually occurs in growing and adult stock may be materially reduced by providing the birds with an alternate yarding system. Probably the best arrangement is to provide each colony brooder and each <b>laying</b> <b>house</b> with three yards (3 m) which the birds would be allowed to use every 3 or 4 weeks. By alternating the birds in the yards every 3 or 4 weeks each yard is kept reasonably sanitary, especially if the soil in the immediate vicinity of the house is cultivated and treated with lime, and young green grass is available for the birds throughout the season. The importance of clean range for both birds and adult stock cannot be emphasized too strongly... For adult stock a good grass sward can be maintained on fertile soil, allowing about 200 birds to the acre m² per hen.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The Oregon State University Production Line of Single Comb White Leghorns {{was under}} {{selection}} for increased henhoused egg production from 1947 through 1972. Since henhoused egg production {{is directly related}} to mortality, mortality would be expected to decrease over the years if selection was effective. To determine if the mortality had decreased and to gain a comprehensive view of the problem that mortality presents, the <b>laying</b> <b>house</b> mortality during a 23 year period, 1950 through 1972, was analyzed. Analysis of percent mortality in the flock between 20 and 68 weeks of age showed a decrease of slightly over fourtenths of a percent per year, about 10 percent during the entire period studied, or a 50 percent decrease from the original level. The average length of life in the <b>laying</b> <b>house</b> increased by about 16 days during the 23 year period. At 70 percent production this translates to 11 extra eggs in a 48 week laying period. Mortality was lowest {{in the early part of}} the laying year and reached its peak when the birds were between 57 and 60 weeks of age. Over three-fourths of the production time lost due to mortality occurred in the first half of the laying year. Leukosis claimed more of the flock than any other disease and most of the deaths from this disease occurred in the early part of the laying year. Marek's disease and non-leukotic tumors appeared to follow the same pattern as leukosis over the years.
