25|$|New York City FC {{made their}} {{first trip to}} RFK Stadium, and the debutante side {{proved to be the}} tonic that D.C. United needed to break their spirit-crushing winless streak, which had begun at NYCFC's home field seven games earlier. When the game began, it seemed that United's losing ways were destined to continue. At the 45-second mark, Frank Lampard {{followed}} up the rebound of a David Villa shot, and gave the visitors a very early 1-0 lead. It was not even the first time this season that United had fallen behind in the first minute, but that knowledge was probably <b>little</b> <b>comfort.</b> Over the next 70 minutes, both teams squandered chances, but D.C. finally broke through when Espindola scored off of a rebound that came when NYCFC goalie Josh Saunders made a diving stop on a long-range strike by Chris Pontius. In stoppage time, Pontius was dragged down making a long run, setting up a free kick for the home team. Espindola's service found its way to substitute Saborio, after a misplay by a NYCFC defender. Saborio delivered with a memorable game-winner for D.C. The 2-1 victory, D.C. United's first ever win over NYCFC, not only ended almost two months of frustration for the team, it also clinched a playoff spot for the team. This would be the first time since 2006 and 2007 that United would qualify for the playoffs in each of two consecutive seasons.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, 615–1410 ppm {{water in}} melt {{inclusions}} in lunar sample 74220 was reported, the famous high-titanium [...] "orange glass soil" [...] of volcanic origin {{collected during the}} Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's upper mantle. Although of considerable selenological interest, this announcement affords <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> to would-be lunar colonists—the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.|$|E
500|$|From 1690 onwards, William {{was often}} absent from England on campaign, each year {{generally}} {{from the spring}} until the autumn. In 1690, he fought Jacobites (who supported James) in Ireland, and whilst her husband was away, Mary administered {{the government of the}} realm with the advice of a nine-member Cabinet Council. She was not keen to assume power and felt [...] "deprived of all that was dear to me in the person of my husband, left among those that were perfect strangers to me: my sister of a humour so reserved that I could have <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> from her." [...] Anne had quarrelled with William and Mary over money, and {{the relationship between the two}} sisters had soured.|$|E

500|$|Side two {{opens with}} [...] "Julius Caesar (Memento Hodié)", which lyrically explores myths and gods. It {{features}} Nico's low, droning harmonium accompanied by Cale's viola. On [...] "Frozen Warnings", Cale's arrangement harmonically blends with the pipe organ. It is considered Nico's signature song from her collaboration with Cale; Nina Antonia wrote: [...] "Of all the strange and wracked {{numbers on the}} record, 'Frozen Warnings' is quintessential Nico; lyrics that convey a sorrowful atmosphere and <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> in the melody." [...] The album's dreamlike quality end with its last song, [...] "Evening of Light", which {{has been described as}} [...] "frighteningly quiet and hypnotizing". Nico sings [...] "Midnight winds are landing at the end of time", with harpsichord and Cale's staccato viola building until the latter gains ground and sways with the tympani's [...] "roar and clatter". The 1991 reissue of The Marble Index also includes the outtakes [...] "Roses in the Snow" [...] and [...] "Nibelungen". In the latter, Nico's vocals are unaccompanied. The full version (with instrumental accompaniment) was included in the 2007 compilation The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970; according to Dave Thompson of AllMusic, [...] "It rises to equal any of Nico's subsequent performances or compositions." ...|$|E
2500|$|After being {{replaced}} as Blockade Minister, in April 1940 Pernot criticized {{the failure to}} stimulate the wartime economy, saying [...] "Reports on top of reports, all stuffed with figures, many of which unfortunately provide <b>little</b> <b>comfort.</b> What an effort remains to increase our number of aircraft, to accelerate the production of munitions." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Eliade, this [...] "terror of history" [...] becomes {{especially}} acute when {{violent and}} threatening historical events confront modern man—the {{mere fact that}} a terrible event has happened, that {{it is part of}} history, is of <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> to those who suffer from it. Eliade asks rhetorically how modern man can [...] "tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to atomic bombings—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning".|$|E

2500|$|The Flying Pigeon {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the bicycle phenomenon in the People’s Republic of China. The vehicle was the government approved form of transport, and the nation became known as zixingche wang guo (自行车王国) [...] the 'Kingdom of Bicycles'. A bicycle was regarded as one of the three [...] "must-haves" [...] of every citizen, alongside a sewing machine and watch - essential items in life that also offered a hint of wealth. The Flying Pigeon bicycle became a symbol of an egalitarian social system that promised <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> but a reliable ride through life.|$|E
2500|$|The Perales {{proceeding}} {{is not the}} same. We are {{not concerned}} with termination of disability benefits once granted. Neither are we concerned with a change of status without notice. Notice was given to claimant Perales. The physicians' reports were on file and available for inspection by the claimant and his counsel. And the authors of those reports were known and were subject to subpoena and to the very cross-examination that the claimant asserts he has not enjoyed. Further, the specter of questionable credibility and veracity is not present; there is professional disagreement with the medical conclusions, to be sure, {{but there is no}} attack here upon the doctors' credibility or veracity. Kelly affords <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> to the claimant.|$|E
2500|$|So, yet again, {{the courts}} {{are faced with a}} sample of the deeply {{confusing}} provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and the satellite statutory instruments to which it is giving stuttering birth. The most inviting course for this Court to follow, would be for its members, having shaken their heads in despair, to hold up their hands and say: [...] "the Holy Grail of rational interpretation is impossible to find". But it is not for us to desert our judicial duty, however lamentably others have legislated. But, we find <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> or assistance in the historic canons of construction for determining the will of Parliament which were fashioned in a more leisurely age {{and at a time when}} elegance and clarity of thought and language were to be found in legislation as a matter of course rather than exception.; LTL 9/12/2005; (2006) 1 WLR 2543; (2006) 2 All ER 444; (2006) 2 Cr App R (S) 26 ...|$|E

2500|$|Over time, {{the farms}} in St. Mary's City were {{consolidated}} {{into a large}} antebellum slave plantation which lasted for more than 150 years until the Civil War. The plantation changed hands a few times, but continued to grow until it reached over 1,715 acres in size. [...] Enslaved African American's became the largest population in St. Mary's City. Records show that slaves on the plantation were bought and sold which would certainly have broken up families. Ruins and archeological {{research in the area}} has shown that slaves lived in poorly insulated huts, enduring the extremes of Maryland weather with <b>little</b> <b>comfort</b> or protection. Typically 5 or 6 people lived in 15 foot by 17 foot huts. The plantation system also caused greater poverty among less advantaged free people in the area, because the labor market was always depressed due to competition with slave labor. Power and wealth therefore proceeded to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, and the impoverished classes grew in St. Mary's County. Harsh anti-Catholic laws also created barriers for the county's Catholic population. [...] A pattern was established of rural poverty in the county among the non-landed free population.|$|E
