In 1825, he received an invitation to complete his bachelor's degree in London. However the Russian government refused to let him out of the country, fearing that Kazembek would choose to stay and work in England upon graduation. Instead by Imperial decree he was appointed as a teacher of the Tatar language in Omsk, thus being held away from his academic instructors. He never made it to Omsk as, while staying in Kazan due to an illness, Kazembek met historian Karl Fuchs and was invited by him to pass an academic test to determine Kazembek's eligibility to teach Arabic and Persian at Kazan University. The test was passed and Kazembek was hired as a senior teacher. In 1828, he was chosen {{to be a member of}} the Royal Asiatic Society and became head of the newly established Faculty of Turkic languages at Kazan University. In 1831, he attained a master's degree after writing an academic essay called Views on the History and Vocabulary of the Arabic Language (in Persian). In 1835 he was admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences as a Corresponding Member. In 1837, he earned a Ph.D. degree at Kazan University. In 1839, he wrote a detailed work called Grammar of the Turco-Tatar language (at that time, most Turkic languages were regarded as dialects of one single <b>language</b> <b>unit</b> often referred to as 'Tatar' or 'Turco-Tatar'), where he compared Ottoman Turkish, Azeri and various dialects of Tatar in terms of their phonology, morphology, and syntax and for which he received the Demidov Prize. The second edition of this book was published in 1846 and incorporated the author's latest research in the field. It became popular in Western Europe, being the richest academic source on the Turkic languages at that time, and was used in universities as a primary reference book until 1921, when Jean Deny published his Grammar of the Turkish language (Ottoman dialect).|$|E
2500|$|Jamaica is {{regarded}} as a bilingual country, with two major languages in use by the population. The official language is Jamaican Standard English (JSE) or Standard Jamaican English (SJE), which is [...] "used in all domains of public life", including the government, the legal system, the media, and education. However, the primary spoken language is an English-based creole called Jamaican Patois (or Patwa). A 2007 survey by the Jamaican <b>Language</b> <b>Unit</b> found that 17.1 percent of the population were monolingual in JSE, 36.5 percent were monolingual in Patois, and 46.4 percent were bilingual, although earlier surveys had pointed to a greater degree of bilinguality (up to 90 percent). The Jamaican education system has only recently begun to offer formal instruction in Patois, while retaining JSE as the [...] "official language of instruction".|$|E

It gives basic information on the dictionary's microstructure (for further details see Grochowski, Kisiel, Żabowska 2011). The most important issue presented here is, however, scope of the notion "particle". After preparing a tentative list of <b>language</b> <b>units</b> that seemed {{to belong to the}} class, its content has been verified basing on strict semantic and syntactic criteria of indicating particles as a class. According to further insights into the list, the following expressions were rejected: a) expressions that are not <b>language</b> <b>units</b> as a whole, b) <b>language</b> <b>units</b> belonging to the class of adverbs (and other classes often confused with adverbs) or metapredicate operators, c) metatextual <b>language</b> <b>units</b> either not having fixed place in TRS or being indeed stable in TRS but being not exclusively adrhematical.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Lexical {{semantics}} {{studies the}} meaning of words, which is {{a useful tool for}} computer-based automatic natural language processing (NLP). This thesis explores graph-based algorithms to learn and apply distributional lexical semantics in NLP applications. One theory of lexical semanticists holds that semantic relations among words can be extracted from their textual context in natural languages. Based on this theory, we propose using graphs to represent natural language text according to the contextual relations of words in higher-level <b>language</b> <b>units</b> (e. g. sentences, definitions or documents). In these graphs, words and/or higher-level <b>language</b> <b>units</b> are represented with nodes, and edges are added between them according to their textual context to indicate their observed relatedness in a dictionary or a collection of documents. We explore two types of graph representations: the word-word graph which is used for modeling the semantic relations among words, and the instance-word bipartite graph which uses words as a medium to study the relatedness among higher-level <b>language</b> <b>units.</b> In this way, we can embed the semantic relations among words and optionally higher-level <b>language</b> <b>units</b> into the graph structure. We design algorithms to propagate semantic information through the graphs in order to recover the unobserved relatedness among words or higher-level <b>language</b> <b>units,</b> which is used in designing unsupervised, semi-supervised or active learning algorithms to reduce human supervision in NLP applications for harvesting or analyzing text data resources. Specifically, we design graph-based algorithms either for quantitatively assessing lexical semantic similarity, or for developing representativeness and diversity criteria for selecting a characteristic subset of terms, which is useful for problems such as keyword summarization and query design for active learning. In particular, we focus on designing graph-based algorithms to apply lexical semantics in three NLP applications, including Wiktionary lexical semantic similarity extraction, Twitter user interest extraction, and active learning for semantic orientation classification...|$|R

Having selected contextual particles as an example, the author shows how specific structuralisation of TRS is strictly connected with particle meaning.

40|$|A {{synopsis}} of the grammatical {{description of the}} so-called ‘subject concord’ in Sotho and Zulu: historical and comtemporary views The term "concord” is generally used as an umbrella term for a diversity of language forms in the morphological description of <b>language</b> <b>units</b> in African <b>languages.</b> Since “concord" does not specifically indicate a unit of rank in the morphological hierarchy of language symbols, but implicitly refers to the function of <b>language</b> <b>units,</b> {{the result of this}} practice is that a purely grammatical distinction between related <b>language</b> <b>units</b> is not always possible. For example, historically and contemporarily, the so-called "subject concord" is often interpreted in morphologically diverse and often even contradictory ways. This article examines the grammatical status of the so-called "subject concord” in Northern Sotho and Zulu in terms of existing views regarding its morphological or word status in the light of Van Wyk's (1953, 1958 and 1967) research. Specific attention is paid to changes in rank, drawing a clear distinction between “subject concords” as verbal prefixal morphemes and “subject concords” as particle words. Finally, it is recommended that a clear grammatical distinction should be drawn between morphemes and words, and furthermore that reference to these units should differ terminologically. This viewpoint suggests that the term "concord" should rather be avoided completely...|$|R
