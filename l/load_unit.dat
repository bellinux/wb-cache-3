40|$|The primary {{function}} of a power system is to supply its customers with electrical energy as economically as possible and with acceptable reliability and quality. Generating capacity adequacy evaluation is {{the oldest and most}} extensively studied aspect of power system reliability assessment. A wide range of methods have been developed to perform this evaluation. Two computer programs were developed based on the analytical and simulation techniques and used as tools in this research work. A number of basic considerations in generating capacity adequacy evaluation are investigated. Generating unit residence time distributions and peaking <b>load</b> <b>units</b> are incorporated in the analysis. Two commonly encountered misconceptions regarding the basic system reliability indices are examined by applying the two programs to two reliability test systems. Reliability index probability distributions can be used to supplement the information provided by the expected index values. The concept of creating distributions and the additional information that can be obtained is illustrated in this thesis. Generating unit residence time distributions are generally categorized as being either exponential or non-exponential in form. The exponential distribution is utilized, however, in virtually all practical system studies. The impacts on the system reliability of non-exponential unit state residence time distributions are examined in this research. Peaking <b>load</b> <b>units</b> and base <b>load</b> <b>units</b> have different operating characteristics. The functions of peaking <b>load</b> <b>units</b> vary with changes in the system operating conditions. This is examined in this research.
