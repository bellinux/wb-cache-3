Both of these algorithms {{use the same}} 8 -bit S-Box but its design rationale was never made public. In this paper, we reverse-engineer this S-Box and reveal its hidden structure. It {{is based on a}} sort of 2 -round Feistel Network where exclusive-or is replaced by a finite field multiplication. This structure is hidden by two different <b>linear</b> <b>layers</b> applied before and after. In total, five different 4 -bit S-Boxes, a multiplexer,two 8 -bit linear permutations and two finite field multiplications in a field of size $ 2 ^{ 4 }$ are needed to compute the S-Box. The knowledge of this decomposition allows a much more efficient hardware implementation by dividing the area and the delay by 2. 5 and 8 respectively. However, the small 4 -bit S-Boxes do not have very good cryptographic properties. In fact, one of them has a probability 1 differential. We then generalize the method we used to partially recover the <b>linear</b> <b>layers</b> used to whiten the core of this S-Box and illustrate it with a generic decomposition attack against 4 -round Feistel Networks whitened with unknown <b>linear</b> <b>layers.</b> Our attack exploits a particular pattern arising in the Linear Approximations Table of such functions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find the {{dispersion}} relation for waves on an arbitrary current velocity profile approximated by N <b>linear</b> <b>layers.</b> Using a Stokes expansion to first order in the steepness parameter ka the dispersion relation for systems with one, two and three <b>linear</b> <b>layers</b> was derived, a process revealing a general pattern for an increase in N. The pattern was then used to derive the dispersion relation for the N-layer system, which is shown valid even to second order theory. The dispersion relation was significantly simplified by a recursion formula which made it easy to solve numerically. To test the formula two possible current velocity profiles of water flowing down a river was investigated; a parabolic and a logarithmic profile. The numerical analysis revealed that even a linear current velocity profile serve as a good approximation. The results also showed that we get N+ 1 solutions. However, data supported a theory that only two of them are physical possible. The extra solutions probably originates from the unphysical bends in the velocity profile, and are not waves but layers of vortices drifting with the current...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{lightweight}} block ciphers apply a {{very simple}} key schedule in which the round keys only differ by addition of a round-specific constant. Generally, {{there is not much}} theory on how to choose appropriate constants. In fact, several of those schemes were recently broken using invariant attacks, i. e., invariant subspace or nonlinear invariant attacks. This work analyzes the resistance of such ciphers against invariant attacks and reveals the precise mathematical properties that render those attacks applicable. As a first practical consequence, we prove that some ciphers including Prince, Skinny- 64 and Mantis 7 are not vulnerable to invariant attacks. Also, we show that the invariant factors of the <b>linear</b> <b>layer</b> {{have a major impact on}} the resistance against those attacks. Most notably, if the number of invariant factors of the <b>linear</b> <b>layer</b> is small (e. g., if its minimal polynomial has a high degree), we can easily find round constants which guarantee the resistance to all types of invariant attacks, independently of the choice of the S-box layer. We also explain how to construct optimal round constants for a given, but arbitrary, <b>linear</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E
