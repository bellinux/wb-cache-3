40|$|Let Γ be a rank three {{incidence}} {{geometry of}} points, lines and planes whose planes are <b>linear</b> <b>spaces</b> and whose point residues are dual <b>linear</b> <b>spaces</b> (notice {{that we do}} not require anything on the line residues).

This class consists of six families of <b>linear</b> <b>spaces.</b> In Γ the amalgamation of two such <b>linear</b> <b>spaces</b> imposes an equality on their orders leading, in particular, to a series of diophantine equations, the solutions of which provide a reduction theorem on the possible amalgams of <b>linear</b> <b>spaces</b> that can occur in Γ We prove that one of the following holds (up to a permutation of the words "point" and "plane") : A) the planes of Γ and the dual of the point residues belong to the same family and have the same orders, B) the diagram of Γ is in one of six families, C) the diagram of Γ belongs to a list of seven sporadic cases. Finally, we consider the particular case where the line residues of Γ are generalized digons. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

500|$|Prior to the {{development}} of Hilbert spaces, other generalizations of Euclidean spaces were known to mathematicians and physicists. In particular, the idea of an abstract <b>linear</b> <b>space</b> had gained some traction {{towards the end of the}} 19th century: this is a space whose elements can be added together and multiplied by scalars (such as real or complex numbers) without necessarily identifying these elements with [...] "geometric" [...] vectors, such as position and momentum vectors in physical systems. Other objects studied by mathematicians at the turn of the 20th century, in particular spaces of sequences (including series) and spaces of functions, can naturally be thought of as linear spaces. Functions, for instance, can be added together or multiplied by constant scalars, and these operations obey the algebraic laws satisfied by addition and scalar multiplication of spatial vectors.|$|E
