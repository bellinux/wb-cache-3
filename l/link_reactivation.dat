This antigen is found in infected cells in association with the expression of the herpesvirus 'immediate early' genes and is recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) 8. We now demonstrate that an unexpectedly high proportion of the CTL precursors generated in vivo during acute murine cytomegalovirus infection are specific for cells that selectively synthesize immediate early proteins, indicating an immunodominant role of viral non-structural proteins. ...|$|R

Understanding of the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to androgen deprivation therapy {{has the potential}} to lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for type of {{prostate cancer}} with poor prognosis. Progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is characterized by aberrant androgen receptor (AR) expression and persistent AR signaling activity. Alterations in metabolic activity regulated by oncogenic pathways, such as c-Myc, were found to promote prostate cancer growth during the development of CRPC. Non-coding RNAs represent a diverse family of regulatory transcripts that drive tumorigenesis of prostate cancer and various other cancers by their hyperactivity or diminished function.

However, up to this point, {{there has been no}} direct evidence to support this assertion in humans, and the physiological processes supporting such reactivation are unknown. Here, simultaneous electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings were conducted during post-learning sleep to directly investigate the spindle-related reactivation of a memory trace formed during motor sequence learning (MSL), and its relationship to overnight enhancement in performance (reflecting consolidation). We show that brain regions within the striato-cerebello-cortical network recruited during training on the MSL task, and in particular the striatum, were also activated during sleep, time-locked to spindles. Interestingly, the consolidated trace in the striatum was not simply strengthened, but was transformed/reorganized from rostrodorsal (associative) to caudoventral (sensorimotor) subregions.

Re-discovery of cue-dependent amnesia, wide availability of functional imaging tools and increased dialog among clinicians, cognitive psychologists, behavioral neuroscientists, and neurobiologists have provided impetus for the search for new paradigms for the study of memory. Memory is increasingly viewed as an open-ended process, with retrieval being recognized as an intricate part of the encoding process. New memories are always made on the background of past experience, so that every consolidation is, in fact reconsolidation, serving to update and strengthen memories after retrieval. Spontaneous reactivation of memory circuits occurs during sleep and there is converging evidence from rodent and human studies that this {{is an important part of}} the extended off-line memory processing. The noradrenergic neuromodulatory system is engaged at retrieval, facilitating recall. The noradrenergic system is also activated during sleep after learning and noradrenergic neurons fire in concert with cortical oscillations that are associated with reactivation of memory circuits.

To elucidate the mechanistic basis for this paradoxical observation, we conducted detailed phenotypic and functional analyses of T-cell and NK-cell populations from 25 dasatinib-treated leukemia patients. All tested patients with LGL expansions (15 / 16) were cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin (IgG) seropositive with high frequencies of CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cells; 5 / 16 LGL patients also experienced symptomatic CMV reactivation during dasatinib therapy. Expanded T-cell and NK-cell populations exhibited late differentiated (CD 27 (_) (-) CD 57 (+)) phenotypes; this {{was associated with a}} predisposition to apoptosis within the T-cell compartment and impaired NK-cell cytotoxicity. Only 3 / 9 non-LGL patients were CMV IgG seropositive. Dasatinib inhibited in vitro lymphocyte functions, similarly in LGL patients and controls. Notably, distinct CD 8 (high) and CD 8 (low) T-cell subsets were observed in LGL patients; this phenotypic dichotomy was also apparent in CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell populations, and exhibited features consistent with antigen-driven activation.

The use of the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet (PFA) is restricted to ACV-resistant (ACV(r)) VZV infections.

The string of 6 Cs at nucleotides 493 to 498 of the VZV TK gene appeared to function as a hot spot for nucleotide insertions or deletions. Novel amino acid substitutions (G 24 R and T 86 A) in VZV TK were also linked to drug resistance. Six mutations were identified in the "palm domain" of VZV DNA polymerase in viruses selected for resistance to PFA, PCV, and the 2 -phophonylmethoxyethyl (PME) purine derivatives.

Starting from the known bathymetry and an initial sediment thickness estimate and making allowance for thermal effects, the geometry of the crystalline crust was predicted using isostatic and flexural principles. Optimization methods were then used to modify the base sediment and Moho interfaces to improve the fit between observed and calculated gravity anomalies. The method provides new insights into basin morphology and into variations in the thickness of both crystalline continental crust and igneous oceanic crust. When combined with imaging of the gravity and magnetic fields, the model {{highlights the importance of}} broadly NW-trending lineaments on the development of post-Caledonian basin architecture. In some cases these lineaments are interpreted as pre-Caledonian structures that were reactivated as transfer zones during phases of Mesozoic extension. Some of the lineaments appear to have influenced the early evolution of the oceanic crust by providing the precursors to transform offsets and possibly also by affecting the pattern of asthenospheric flow. The crustal thickening of the Faroe–Iceland Ridge is clearly imaged and its geometry is interpreted to reflect temporal variations in the enhanced oceanic crustal production rate responsible for this feature, including a Late Eocene minimum which can be correlated with plate reorganization in the north Atlantic region. There is some evidence of Cenozoic deformation <b>linked</b> to transpressive <b>reactivation</b> of the lineaments.

Having evolved with their natural host, herpesviruses encode numerous gene {{products that are}} involved in modulating host immune responses to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of lifelong chronic infection. One such protein, MHV 68 M 1, is a secreted protein that has no known homologs, but has been shown to {{play a critical role in}} controlling virus reactivation from latently infected macrophages. We have previous demonstrated that M 1 drives the activation and expansion of Vβ 4 + CD 8 + T cells, which are thought to be involved in controlling MHV 68 reactivation through the secretion of interferon gamma. The mechanism of action and regulation of M 1 expression are poorly understood. To gain insights into the function of M 1, we set out to evaluate the site of expression and transcriptional regulation of the M 1 gene. Here, using a recombinant virus expressing a fluorescent protein driven by the M 1 gene promoter, we identify plasma cells as the major cell type expressing M 1 at the peak of infection in the spleen. In addition, we show that M 1 gene transcription is regulated by both the essential viral immediate-early transcriptional activator Rta and cellular interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF 4), which together potently synergize to drive M 1 gene expression. Finally, we show that IRF 4, a cellular transcription factor essential for plasma cell differentiation, can directly interact with Rta.

M 2 expression in B cells results in activation of B cell receptor signaling pathways that promote proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production-a hallmark of gammaherpesviruses. In this study, we utilized an adoptive transfer model to explore the biological consequence of M 2 expression in activated B cells in vivo. Secondly, we engineered and validated two independent MHV 68 M 2 reporter viruses that track M 2 protein expression in latently infected B cells during infection. Here we demonstrate that upon adoptive transfer into naive mice, M 2 expression promotes activated primary B cells to competitively establish residency in the spleen as either a GC B cell or a PC, most notably in the absence of an ongoing GC reaction. Moreover, M 2 antigen drives robust PC differentiation and IL 10 production in vivo in the absence of other viral factors. Lastly, we confirm that M 2 expression during MHV 68 infection is localized to the GC compartment, which is a long term latency reservoir for gammaherpesviruses. Overall, these observations are consistent with, and extend upon previous reports of M 2 function in B cells and within the context of MHV 68 infection.

The first indicates NW-SE trending dextral strike-slip faults.

The project encompassed field work and processing of the data, which involved different methods to investigate the characteristics of the mine's seismicity: Statistics were kept to record the activity rate of the seismicity over time; spectral analysis was used to study the frequency content of the seismicity; particle motion plots were constructed to identify body-phases in the seismicity; Local Earthquake Tomography was used to upgrade the velocity model of the mine and to relocate the induced seismicity with more accuracy; cross-correlation was used to find events originating from similar sources; and finally, magnitude analysis was used to compare the different types of seismicity within the mine. Three main types of induced events were observed in the mine: low-frequency events with clear first arrivals, emergent events with long duration, and high-frequency events that could either have clear first arrivals or emergent-like with long durations. Through the analysis of their characteristics, they were linked to different types of rockbursts. The low-frequency events were <b>linked</b> to both <b>reactivation</b> of fault zones triggered by the mine activity, and rockbursts within the mine directly related to the mining. The emergent and high-frequency events were also linked to rockbursts directly related to the mine activity, e. g. ejection of rock from the tunnel walls or arch collapses in stopes...|$|R
40|$|Tenerife {{is one of}} {{the most}} well {{monitored}} islands of the Canaries, but the surveillance generally is centred on Las Cañadas Caldera, where the Teide volcano is located. In the last 180 000 yr, the eruptions on Tenerife Island have never occurred in the same volcanic structure, except for the Teide and Pico Viejo central volcanic system, so that a complete monitoring network would have to cover the whole island. As a result, Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is being used on Tenerife, because this space technique can provide a displacement map of the surface of the earth with centimetre precision. This paper presents the results obtained on Tenerife Island using 18 SAR images acquired by the ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 satellites during the period 1992 - 2000. Two important results have been obtained: no deformation on Las Cañadas Caldera, coinciding with results obtained using terrestrial techniques, and two subsidence episodes outside monitoring areas in the NW of the island, in the region of the last historic eruptions. These results show that InSAR is a useful technique for monitoring the entire island, thus allowing us to discover deformations in areas that are not routinely or easily monitored. This technique has been used in combination with Global Positioning System (GPS) observation of a global network on the island to define a new geodetic monitoring system. The possible causes of the deformations observed have been studied in an endeavour to discern if they might be of natural origin, in particular <b>linked</b> to a <b>reactivation</b> of prior volcanic activity. Examination of the geophysical observations on the island, human activities underway and the results of the modelling seem to indicate that at least part of the deformations may be caused by changes in the groundwater level and therefore are not linked to a volcanic reactivation. This result is important because it implies that, if geodetic volcano monitoring is to be performed on the island, the system used must be capable of discerning between various possible origins of the deformation by analysing their patterns and ancillary information from other sources. In this regard, InSAR is a basic tool on account of its unpaired wide area coverage and spatial density. © 2005 RAS. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Equine Herpesvirus type 1 (EHV- 1) is a {{worldwide}} {{threat to the}} health of horses. It can cause mild respiratory disease, abortions and deaths of newborn foals as well as a potentially fatal neurologic disorder known as Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The virus is maintained in populations by stress-induced periodic reactivation of virus in long-term latently infected horses and transmission of the reactivated virus to susceptible individuals. In horses, peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) are thought to be an important site for EHV- 1 latent genomes. Since the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a cellular response to a variety of stressors that has been <b>linked</b> to <b>reactivation</b> of herpes simplex virus in humans, a virus closely related to EHV- 1, I tested the hypothesis that latent EHV- 1 relies on the UPR as a pluripotent stress sensor and uses it to reactivate lytic gene expression. Since little work has been done in defining the UPR in horses, I first successfully developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay to detect and quantitate transcripts for selected UPR genes in equine dermal (E. Derm) cells and PBLs. Activation of the UPR was achieved in both cell types using thapsigargin and a difference in gene expression after activation of the UPR in two equine cell types was found. A nested PCR assay to detect and distinguish latent EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 was evaluated and the sensitivity of the technique to detect EHV- 1 was determined. I discovered that the nested PCR technique was not sensitive enough to detect the estimated one latent viral genome in 50, 000 PBLs. Lytic EHV- 1 infection was characterized by single step growth curve in E. Derm cells and consistent detection of temporal EHV- 1 gene expression by RT-qPCR was achieved. The relationship between EHV- 1 gene expression and UPR gene expression during lytic infection was investigated. While EHV- 1 infection had no effect on UPR gene expression, activation of the UPR appeared to decrease the expression of EHV- 1 genes temporarily and reversibly during the first 4 h after infection. Finally, detection of EHV- 1 in PBLs from horses presumed to be latently infected by co-cultivation with E. Derm cells permissive to EHV- 1 infection was attempted. To detect viral DNA, PBLs were stimulated with thapsigargin or interleukin 2 (IL- 2) which was previously reported to induce reactivation of latent EHV- 1. I was not able to reproduce previously published experiments of reactivation in vitro of latent EHV- 1 by stimulation with IL- 2, and virus reactivation did not occur after stimulation of PBLs with thapsigargin. In summary, a RT-qPCR assay to measure the expression of equine UPR genes was developed and activation of the UPR by treatment of E. Derm cells and PBLs with thapsigargin was successfully achieved. A difference in gene expression after activation of the UPR in two equine cell types was found. In contrast to what has been reported for other alphaherpesviruses, there appears to be no, or only little, interaction between the UPR and EHV- 1 during viral infection. Detection of latent EHV- 1 genomes in PBLs was not achieved by using a nested PCR, as this technique was not sensitive enough to detect the estimated one latent viral genome in 50, 000 PBLs. Finally, latent EHV- 1 was not detected in presumed latently infected PBLs or reactivated by triggering the UPR in equine PBLs...|$|R
40|$|A Plataforma Sul Americana inclui dois importantes componentes geológicos de escala {{continental}} e com raízes estruturais em comum: o Lineamento Transbrasiliano (LTB) e a Bacia do Paraná. Importante relação entre os dois ocorre na região entre o Arco Magmático de Goiás e a Faixa Paraguai, que impõem particularidades estruturais obscurecidas pela cobertura sedimentar da Bacia do Paraná. A área, alvo desse estudo, é recoberta por dados aerogeofísicos, magnéticos e gravimétricos, adquiridos com diferentes resoluções. Sua integração permitiu gerar mapas de anomalias magnéticas e anomalias Bouguer, este incluindo dados terrestres. Técnicas de processamento e modelagem geofísica foram utilizadas com objetivo de esclarecer a disposição de compartimentos crustais e estruturas do embasamento da bacia em diferentes níveis de profundidade. Três grandes descontinuidades magnéticas do LTB limitam compartimentos crustais na área, de leste para oeste: lineamentos Serra Negra, Baliza e General Carneiro, com direções gerais N 30 °E, N 60 °E e N 70 °E, respectivamente, que separam mudanças significativas no background gravimétrico, ainda subdividido por lineamento adicional N 50 °W, São Vicente. Análise de lineamentos de 1 ª, 2 ª e 3 ª ordens aponta a predominância de orientações NE, interpretadas como originalmente brasilianas e reativadas no Jurássico-Cretáceo, e direções NW, bem marcadas nas unidades sedimentares da bacia e com caráter distensivo, atribuído a reativação mesozóica. Análise do matched-filter aplicada a dados magnéticos e gravimétricos, com suporte da deconvolução de Euler e tilt-depth, aponta estimativas de profundidades importantes: (i) 2, 5 km, relacionado ao topo do embasamento da Bacia do Paraná; (ii) 6 km, atribuído ao topo do embasamento da bacia neoproterozóica (Grupo Cuiabá); (iii) 20 km, possivelmente associado à interface crosta superior/inferior; e (iv) 33 - 39 e 43 km, relativos às espessuras crustais a oeste e sudeste do lineamento Serra Negra, respectivamente. A crosta a leste é formada pelo o Arco Magmático de Arenópolis e o limite noroeste do Bloco Paranapanema e a oeste é constituída por zona de transição crustal e o paleocontinente Amazônico. A modelagem geofísica conjunta 2 D com dados gravimétricos e magnéticos esclarece a geometria assimétrica do embasamento da bacia, configurando pelo menos três meiográbens formados ao longo de estruturas reativadas do LTB. A região entre os lineamentos Serra Negra e General Carneiro caracteriza-se por menor espessura e maior fraqueza crustal, onde importantes estruturas se desenvolveram no Mesozóico: desde reativações com direção NW, vinculadas a soerguimento crustal e à implantação de pequenas bacias cretáceas alinhadas a NE. Dois depocentros importantes ocorrem: a norte do lineamento General Carneiro, com direção N 70 °E, e a leste da falha Serra Negra, com direção N 30 °E – NS. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe South American Platform {{includes two}} major geological components of continental scale with common structural roots: the Transbrasiliano Lineament (LTB) and the Paraná Basin. An important {{relationship between the}} two is observed in the region between the Goiás Magmatic Arc and the Paraguay Belt, which impose structural features concealed by the sedimentary cover of the Paraná Basin. This region comprises our study area, and is covered by airborne magnetic and gravity surveys, acquired with different resolutions. These data were integrated to generate maps of magnetic and Bouguer anomalies, the latter included ground data. Data processing and geophysical modeling techniques were used in order to reveal the disposition of crustal compartments and the basin basement structures at different depths. Three large magnetic discontinuities limit crustal compartments in the area, from east to west: Serra Negra, Baliza and General Carneiro lineaments, with N 30 °E, N 60 °E and N 70 °E trending alignments, respectively, which separate significant changes in the gravity background, still subdivided by the additional Sao Vicente lineament, N 50 °W. Analyses of 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd order lineaments indicate predominance of NE trending directions, which were interpreted as Brasiliano structures, reactivated in the Jurassic-Cretaceous. NW directions, well-marked in the sedimentary units of the basin and with extensional character, were attributed to Mesozoic reactivation. Matched-filter analysis applied to magnetic and gravity data, supported by the Euler deconvolution and tiltdepth, yielded important depths estimates: (i) 2. 5 km {{to the top of the}} Paraná Basin basement; (ii) 6 km to the top of the Neoproterozoic Basin basement (Cuiabá Group); (iii) 20 km, possibly associated with the upper/lower crust interface; and (iv) 33 - 39 and 43 km related to crustal thicknesses west and southeast of the Serra Negra lineament, respectively. To the east, the crust is formed by the Arenópolis Magmatic Arc and the northwest boundary of Paranapanema Block, while to the west it consists of a crustal transition zone and the Amazon paleocontinent. The 2 D geophysical modeling based on gravity and magnetic data sheds light on the asymmetric geometry of the basement of the basin, with at least three half-grabens formed by LTB reactivated structures. The region between the Serra Negra and General Carneiro lineaments is characterized by thinner crust and higher crustal weakness, where important structures have developed in the Mesozoic, including NW trending <b>reactivations,</b> <b>linked</b> to crustal uplift and deployment of small NE-aligned Cretaceous basins. Important depocenters occur: the first, to the north of General Carneiro lineament, and the second, to the east of the Serra Negra fault, with N 70 ºE and N 30 °E – NS trending directions, respectively...|$|R
