5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille <b>looking</b> <b>on.</b> Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. <b>Looking</b> <b>on</b> the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> the floor.|$|E

5|$|The Mahdists in the trenches, {{equipped}} with outdated rifles and makeshift ammunition, designed {{to wait until}} Hunter's forces were well within range to open fire. The entrenched Mahdists weathered the continual barrage of the advancing forces until the distance shrunk to one hundred yards. Together, the Mahdist line erupted in rifle fire, hammering the advancing battalions and, in particular, the stationary 10th Sudanese. Two British officers, Brevet-Major Henry Sidney and Lieutenant Edward Fitzclarence, three Egyptian officers, and a dozen regular soldiers {{were killed in the}} volleys. Over fifty were wounded across the brigade. Following this exchange, the battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged the trenches with their bayonets. A furious melee ensued, wherein soldiers of MacDonald's brigade poured into the trenches and through the town, engaging in vicious hand-to-hand combat with Mahdists wherever they were {{to be found in the}} winding alleyways and narrow houses of Abu Hamed. In several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders, while the Mahdist cavalry, <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> as Hunter's battalions swept through the town, turned to flee south towards Berber.|$|E

25|$|After the 2001 general {{election}} he was moved, against his wishes, from the Foreign Office to be Leader of the House of Commons.

In the event he accepted, and <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> the bright side welcomed the chance {{to spend more time}} on his favourite stage. According to The Observer, it was Blair's fears over political battles within the Cabinet over Europe, and especially the euro, which saw him demote the pro-European Cook.|$|E

After harsh criticism from Lisa, {{as well as her}} streaking down the school hallway naked (an allusion to Jurel's earlier accusation that she was unable to walk down the school halls 'naked' and see its true troubles), he finally stands up to Burke and Rubell, reminding them that the school exists for the students and not for the administration and protecting their jobs. He also threatens to sue should he be fired. He proudly walks back into the school, with loud cheers from the school's students and Lisa <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> proudly.|$|E

25|$|Following his {{recovery}} from a life-threatening fungal infection {{of his right}} lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement {{to start a new}} spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert at the Ambassador Theater in Pasadena for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, and with Bob Hope <b>looking</b> <b>on,</b> Crosby fell off the stage into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977 (the day singer Elvis Presley died); when the power went out during his performance, he continued singing without amplification.|$|E
25|$|After days of {{bombardment}} from Union gunboats {{and floating}} batteries, Pope {{was finally able}} to move his army across the river and trap the Confederates opposite the island, who by now were in retreat. Outnumbered at least three to one, the Confederates realized their situation was hopeless and decided to surrender. At about the same time, the garrison on the island surrendered to Flag Officer Foote and the Union flotilla. As Foote and Phelps were <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> from the Benton a Confederate steamer DeSoto approached with a flag of truce with lieutenants George S. Martin and E. S. McDowell aboard with a message. After the meeting Phelps escorted the Confederate officers back to the island, returning April 8 to announce their unconditional surrender.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 74, Tipton had {{symptoms}} {{which he}} attributed to the emphysema he had contracted from heavy smoking and refused to call a doctor. He was actually suffering from a hemorrhaging peptic ulcer, which, untreated, was fatal. It was while paramedics were trying to save Tipton's life, with son William <b>looking</b> <b>on,</b> that William learned that his father was a transgender man. Tipton was pronounced dead at Valley General Hospital. The coroner shared this {{with the rest of the}} family. In an attempt to keep the secret, Kitty arranged for his body to be cremated, but later after financial offers from the media, Kitty and one of their sons went public with the story. The first newspaper article was published the day after Tipton's funeral and it was quickly picked up by wire services. Stories about Tipton appeared in a variety of papers including tabloids such as National Enquirer and Star, as well as more reputable papers such as New York Magazine and The Seattle Times. Tipton's family even made talk show appearances.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, the Mets {{loaded the}} bases on a hit-by-pitch and two walks off of Shawn Estes when Timo Perez's two-run single {{put them up}} 2–0. The Giants cut it to 2–1 {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Jeff Kent hit a leadoff single and scored on Ellis Burks's double. Behind strong {{pitching}} from Al Leiter and a two-out two-run home run from Edgardo Alfonzo in the top of the ninth inning off of Felix Rodriguez, the Mets carried a 4–1 lead into the last of the ninth. However, following a double by Barry Bonds and a single from Jeff Kent, pinch hitter J. T. Snow hit a towering three-run home run off of Mets reliever Armando Benítez to tie the game at four. The Mets would bounce back in the tenth inning, with Rookie Jay Payton singling home Darryl Hamilton, who doubled with two outs, off of Rodriguez. The Giants would threaten again, and had the tying run on with two out and Bonds at the plate, but John Franco struck out Bonds <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> a wicked 3–2 changeup, giving the Mets a heart-stopping 5–4 victory and a 1–1 series moving to New York.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, the American {{offensive}} stalled when Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave and 120 British {{soldiers of}} the 40th Foot stoutly defended the Chew House. After artillery and infantry assaults failed, du Plessis and other officers attempted to set the house on fire. To fellow aide John Laurens, du Plessis suggested the idea of fetching hay from the nearby barn and using it to ignite the structure. Using the kitchen outbuilding as cover, du Plessis reached a ground-floor window {{to the left of}} the servant's entrance. He smashed it and tried to climb in. Perched on the window sill, he found himself face to face with a pistol-wielding British officer who demanded his surrender. At that moment, a British soldier burst into the room and fired at du Plessis but hit the officer by mistake. After this close call, the Frenchman decided to retreat. With numerous American soldiers <b>looking</b> <b>on,</b> he refused to run for it. He later claimed that he retired at a walk, which he managed to do without being shot, though Laurens was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Two of Major General John Sullivan's aides, Captains John White and Edward Sherburne were killed while unsuccessfully trying to carry out this dangerous mission.|$|E
