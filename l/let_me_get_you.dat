And at this the bully lost no time in retreating. He was evidently afraid that the Rovers would hand him over to the authorities.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hi! <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> down! Do <b>you</b> want to burn me up?" [...] yelled the story-teller of the school, suddenly, as, chancing {{to glance}} down, {{he saw that}} the barrels were on fire. [...] "Let me down, I say!"

5000|$|It {{is a song}} {{written with}} simple words: [...] "Let <b>me</b> inside, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> close to <b>you</b> / Change your mind, I'll <b>get</b> lost if <b>you</b> want me to / Somehow I {{found a way to}} get lost in you." [...] The lyrics are {{bittersweet}} as Gontier sings about a love that has its ups and downs.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] he continued, [...] "Brass Buttons didn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> to Saville. <b>You</b> see, when he {{got back}} to town last night they told him he had been buncoed out of the biggest thing for years, and they got it into his head that I was child enough to run a ferry for criminals.

6000|$|... "Well, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to your feet," [...] Harry said, {{holding out}} his hands, but {{with a feeling of}} some disgust at the abject fear {{expressed}} in the tones of the man's voice. He was indeed trembling so that even when Harry hauled him to his feet he could scarcely stand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Anne! Anne! What {{can have}} {{happened}} to you? Are you frightened? There's not the least fear of any body disturbing us. They are all at luncheon, and the servants are at dinner.

6000|$|She was powerfully {{moved as}} she went in to say good-by to him. He {{was sitting in a}} chair, but looked very pale and weak.

6000|$|THE WOMEN. Oh! [They rush at him, vituperating, {{screaming}} passionately, {{tearing at}} him. Lottie puts {{her fingers in}} her ears and runs out. Hannah follows, shaking her head.

How dare you put such a name to a decent woman? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> at him. <b>You</b> coward! Oh, he struck me: did you see that? Lynch him! Pete, will you stand by and hear me called names by a skunk like that? Burn him: burn him! Thats what I'd do with him. Aye, burn him! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He Says the Same Things to Me" [...] was {{recorded}} at the RCA Victor Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, United States on November 15, 1963. The session {{was produced by}} Chet Atkins. The song was released as a single the following year (January 1964), serving as the follow-up to Davis' major country pop crossover hit, [...] "I Can't Stay Mad at You". The single also reached the Billboard Hot 100, however it peaked outside the top-forty at number forty-seven. In addition, the single reached number fifteen on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, becoming Davis' second entry on that chart. Later in the year, the single was issued onto Davis' studio album, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Get</b> Close to <b>You.</b>|$|R
6000|$|After a moment's pause he said: [...] "Though I {{came only}} yesterday, I have {{equipped}} myself properly for Bath already, you see," [...] (pointing {{to a new}} umbrella); [...] "I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I {{think it would be}} more prudent to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> a chair." ...|$|E
6000|$|STEVE, soothingly, 'Come now, we won't go {{into that}} again. It was just a mistake; and {{now that it is}} all settled and done with, I'll tell you what we shall do.

'I promise not to listen to the address; and after you have had a good night you--you will see things differently.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, there I am {{completely}} at sea! But I'll deliver it, {{and at once}} too, only I don't like to leave you. Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of Paris first? I think just before dawn it could be done. We can get the cart from Lucas, and if we could reach St. Germain before noon, I could come straight back then and deliver the letter to de Batz. This, I feel, I ought to do myself; but at Achard's farm I would {{know that you were}} safe for a few hours." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August of 1963, [...] "I Can't Stay Mad at You" [...] {{was officially}} {{released}} {{as a single}} by RCA Victor, with the b-side being, [...] "It Was Only a Heart". As a country music artist, the song became Davis' twelfth top-twenty hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles, peaking at number fourteen. The record was an even bigger hit on the pop charts, becoming Davis' second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of number seven in 1963. The second peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks [...] The song would become Davis' last single to enter the Billboard Pop top-forty, as her follow-up singles would reach progressively-lower positions on the chart in the later months and years. [...] "I Can't Stay Mad at You" [...] was later issued onto Davis' studio album, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Get</b> Close to <b>You</b> in 1964.|$|R
60|$|TANNER. Anything except <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> {{loose from}} <b>you.</b> Even {{then you had}} {{acquired}} by instinct that damnable woman's trick of heaping obligations on a man, of placing yourself so entirely and helplessly at his mercy that at last he dare not take a step without running to you for leave. I know a poor wretch whose one desire {{in life is to}} run away from his wife. She prevents him by threatening to throw herself in front of the engine of the train he leaves her in. That is what all women do. If we try to go where you do not want us to go there is no law to prevent us, but when we take the first step your breasts are under our foot as it descends: your bodies are under our wheels as we start. No woman shall ever enslave me in that way.|$|R
5000|$|On October 7, 2009, {{the eighth}} {{anniversary of the}} start of the Afghanistan war, the Rochester police broke up a peace march protesting the Afghanistan war {{organized}} by Rochester Students for a Democratic Society with a massive police response which included at least 40 police. [...] In the end twelve people were arrested, two were hospitalized for their injuries sustained from police. The severe police response drew massive public outcry. [...] Executive Deputy Police Chief Markert admitted the police could have acted differently to ensure everyone's safety. [...] 20/20 hindsight, would I have loved to say, OK, hold on folks, where are you going, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> facilitate <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> there in a safe manner, that's me the next day. I don't know why that didn't happen. -Executive Deputy Police Chief George Markert, at a Special Session of City Council [...] Although Rochester police promised a full report on incident, no report was ever released and it remains unclear if any changes were made in result of the public response or the internal investigation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] the Cave-man went on, [...] "there {{are lots}} of ways and {{passages}} through. I guess they went in another direction. The wife generally likes to take a stroll round {{in the morning and}} see some of the neighbours. But, say," [...] he interrupted, [...] "I guess I'm forgetting my manners. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> a drink of cave-water. Here, take it in this stone mug! There you are, say when! Where do we get it? Oh, we find it in parts of the cave where it filters through the soil above. Alcoholic? Oh, yes, about fifteen per cent, I think. Some say it soaks all through the soil of this State. Sit down and be comfortable, and, say if you hear the woman coming just slip your mug behind that stone out of sight. Do you mind? Now, try one of these elm-root cigars. Oh, pick a good one--there {{are lots of}} them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't mention that," [...] said she. [...] "If I'd been in your place, I {{should have}} been mad enough to say anything. But it's no use {{to sit here and}} be grumpy.

The [...] "Critical Magazine" [...] for 1767 and 1768, is on that list, and I know there are lots of queer, {{interesting}} things in it, but it takes a good while to hunt them out from the other things for which you would not care at all. And then there are all the [...] "Spectators," [...] and [...] "Ramblers," [...] and [...] "The World Displayed" [...] in eight volumes, which, from what I saw when I looked through it, seems to be a different kind of world from the one I live in; and there are others that you will see on your list. But there is one book which I have been reading lately which I think you will find odder and funnier than any of the rest. It is the [...] "Geographical Grammar" [...] by Mr Salmon. Suppose I bring you that. It is a description of the whole world, written {{more than a hundred years}} ago, by an Irish gentleman who, I think, never went anywhere." ...|$|R
