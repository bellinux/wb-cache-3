40|$|Abstract Background Detection of {{outbreaks}} is {{an important}} part of disease surveillance. Although many algorithms have been designed for detecting outbreaks, few have been specifically assessed against diseases that have distinct seasonal incidence patterns, such as those caused by vector-borne pathogens. Methods We applied five previously reported outbreak detection algorithms to Ross River virus (RRV) disease data (1991 - 2007) for the four local government areas (LGAs) of Brisbane, Emerald, Redland and Townsville in Queensland, Australia. The methods used were the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) C 1, C 2 and C 3 methods, negative binomial cusum (NBC), historical <b>limits</b> <b>method</b> (HLM), Poisson outbreak detection (POD) method and the purely temporal SaTScan analysis. Seasonally-adjusted variants of the NBC and SaTScan methods were developed. Some of the algorithms were applied using a range of parameter values, resulting in 17 variants of the five algorithms. Results The 9, 188 RRV disease notifications that occurred in the four selected regions over the study period showed marked seasonality, which adversely affected the performance of some of the outbreak detection algorithms. Most of the methods examined were able to detect the same major events. The exception was the seasonally-adjusted NBC methods that detected an excess of short signals. The NBC, POD and temporal SaTScan algorithms were the only methods that consistently had high true positive rates and low false positive and false negative rates across the four study areas. The timeliness of outbreak signals generated by each method was also compared but there was no consistency across outbreaks and LGAs. Conclusions This study has highlighted several issues associated with applying outbreak detection algorithms to seasonal disease data. In lieu of a true gold standard, a quantitative comparison is difficult and caution should be taken when interpreting the true positives, false positives, sensitivity and specificity. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study explores energy {{efficient}} building technologies, specifically in {{hot and humid}} climates. The study focuses on optimization of design parameters and climate-based indoor temperature standards. Previous studies in the energy efficiency in buildings in hot and humid climates used the PMV-Fanger Model as a reference for the indoor thermal comfort but field {{studies have shown that}} it does not adequately satisfy the requirements of thermal comfort in these regions. Field study results for the thermal comfort in hot and humid climates based on the Humphrey’s equations were applied for comparison of energy efficiency and used to define the indoor thermal comfort limits for both free-running (FRB) and air-conditioned buildings (ACB). Parametric models were generated and used to investigate the influence of various design parameters in terms of the indoor thermal comfort and cooling energy demand. Comparative analysis was done with both Nicols/Humphrey’s and ATG (Adaptive temperature <b>limits)</b> <b>method.</b> The study shows that, design parameters have a potential of keeping the indoor thermal comfort of a FRB below the maximum limit of 80 % acceptability for 90 % of annual office working hours and reduce the annual cooling energy demand by 13 % to 18 %. Further analysis shows that the indoor thermal comfort of a FRB is inversely proportional to the total thermal transmittance (?) of the façade construction. From the analysis of parametric models, it can be concluded that design parameters have significant influence on the indoor thermal comfort and reduction of cooling energy demand for both FRB and ACB respectively. The use of various design parameters in buildings in a hot and humid climate is recommended as a means to regulate the indoor thermal comfort and lower the cooling energy demand.

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two common}} types of {{solution}} methods for solving simple integrals: using integration constants or using limits of integration. We use the resources framework to model student solution methods. Preliminary results indicate both problematic and meaningful intersections of physical meaning and mathematical formalism when solving linked integrals. Students solving separable first order differential equations in typically use two methods: an integration constant (“+C”) or limits of integration. The two methods are similar, involving anti-derivatives and boundary conditions. But, {{we have found}} that students using the integration constant method rarely find a physically complete solution. We use a resources framework (Hammer, 1996, 2000; Sabella & Redish, 2007; Sayre & Wittmann, 2008; Sherin, 1996) to give a fine-grain, “knowledge-in-pieces ” analysis of student reasoning (diSessa, 1988, 1993). Consider the question asked in Figure 1. Students are given a separable differential equation and a set of unusual boundary conditions. A typical solution of the integrals in time and velocity requires that one carry out indefinite integration on each. In the “+C ” method, the matched equations require a velocity of 366 m/s at 0 s. In the <b>limits</b> <b>method,</b> the time integral runs from t = 0 s to some unspecified time, t, and the velocity integral runs from 366 m/s to some undefined velocity, v. For all the mathematical similarity of the two, our students rarely use limits. We have asked this question (with and without some steps filled in) in several settings, and present examples from three student groups to illustrate problems they have with integration limits and how we might help them. A group is working on the following problem. A bullet fired horizontally has a muzzle velocity of 366 m/s and experiences a –cv 2 air resistance.
