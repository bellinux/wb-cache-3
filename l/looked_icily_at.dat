60|$|Mrs. Poyser had had {{her eyes}} fixed on her husband with cold {{severity}} during his silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss, <b>looked</b> <b>icily</b> <b>at</b> the opposite roof of the cow-shed, and spearing her knitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly between her clasped hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir, I can't {{speak to}} that," [...] said Mrs. Poyser {{in a hard}} voice, rolling and {{unrolling}} her knitting and <b>looking</b> <b>icily</b> out of the window, as she continued to stand opposite the squire. Poyser might sit down if he liked, she thought; she wasn't going to sit down, as if she'd give in to any such smooth-tongued palaver. Mr. Poyser, who looked and felt the reverse of icy, did sit down in his three-cornered chair.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} an unsmiling Cohen staring <b>icily</b> <b>at</b> the camera. The liner notes were composed by the little-known (and often institutionalized) artist and poet Daphne Richardson. Two {{months before the}} album's release, Cohen, who had been grappling with depression at the time, told Roy Hollingworth from Melody Maker, [...] "I just cannot stand to remain part of the music business. I've reached a state when I'm just not writing anything." [...] In March 1975 he would explain to Harvey Kubernik of Melody Maker, [...] "The previous album Live Songs represented a very confused and directionless time. The thing I like {{about it is that}} it documents this phase very clearly." ...|$|R
500|$|Heather Phares, {{writing for}} Allmusic, rated the album three-and-half stars out of five, {{describing}} it as [...] "an admirable artistic choice, {{even though it}} doesn’t always pay off". Phares felt that Gravity the Seducer was [...] "more focused" [...] than the band's previous album Velocifero, but was [...] "not as accessible" [...] as that record. The A.V. Club Christopher Bahn gave the album a B- rating, calling it [...] "heart-on-sleeve and <b>icily</b> detached <b>at</b> the same time"; however, Bahn felt that [...] "the lack of a propulsive single ... {{as well as an}} overabundance of instrumentals, suggests a band that’s spinning its wheels".|$|R
60|$|I {{had once}} vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had {{fastened}} {{on her hand}} which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she regarded me so <b>icily,</b> I felt <b>at</b> once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony eye--opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.|$|R
5000|$|June Stahl {{arrives in}} Charming in episode 6, [...] "AK-51", and is {{assigned}} to a case involving the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club and their involvement in inter-state arms trafficking. She had been called in by David Hale, the local police department's Deputy Chief, {{as he had been}} struggling to rid the town of the gang due to his superior, Wayne Unser's, corruptness. She soon becomes involved in an affair with David Hale. Jax Teller, SAMCRO's Vice President, witnessed them in a sexual encounter at the police station while breaking Cherry out of lockup. Agent Stahl became even more obsessed with crushing SAMCRO after being severely beaten by Big Otto Delaney, who hit her head into a table as a way to show the club that he did not succumb to her pressure. He also detested her for arresting his wife Luann as a way to force him to become an informant. Her subsequent attempts to recruit Opie Winston caused her to trick Clay Morrow, SAMCRO's President, into believing that Opie had betrayed the Club and the others with whom he murdered Hefferen, a port commissioner. Clay responded by ordering Tig Trager to kill Opie and pin it on the One-Niners street gang. Opie's wife, who was driving his truck, was mistakenly killed instead. This incident caused a rift between Stahl and Deputy Chief Hale, who <b>icily</b> told her <b>at</b> the crime scene, [...] "This blood's on you." [...] She continued in her attempts to bring down SAMCRO until the very end, keeping another member, Bobby Munson, in jail three weeks after the case was dropped and he was a free man. When Bobby asked her why she did that, even though it caused so much sorrow and did not accomplish anything, she says it gave her peace of mind.|$|R
