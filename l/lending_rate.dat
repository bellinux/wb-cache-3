40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we examine}} {{the extent to which}} changes in the money market {{interest}} rate are passed through to a number of retail <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> between 1980 and 2001. In addition, we analyse the speed of adjustment of these <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> with respect to such changes in the money market rate. Our main findings are: (1) pass-through from the money market <b>rate</b> to <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is not complete (2) the speed of adjustment varies quite considerably across alternative <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and (3) there has been significant structural change in the relationship between the money market <b>rate</b> and <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> both in terms of pass-through and speed of adjustment during this period. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} effects of {{corruption}} and government control of the banking system for 18 Western hemisphere countries on the sensitivity of commercial <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> to changes in international financial conditions and find that most countries' <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> are insensitive to these conditions. Only the least corrupt nations exhibit a significant positive relation between <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and international financial conditions. The responsiveness of these <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is nonlinearly related to corruption and government control of the banking sector. The findings suggest that both corruption and government control of banks need to be considered when analyzing international credit markets. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{beginning}} of 2009 saw the ushering {{in of the}} multi-currency system in Zimbabwe. The banking sector was resultantly affected, mainly {{in the area of}} determination of optimal <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> The purpose of the research was to investigate the determination of optimal bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> under the multi-currency regime in Zimbabwe. The study investigated the drivers/variables of bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates,</b> perception on average <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and the models {{to be used in the}} determination of bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> under the multi-currency era. This study used the survey research strategy. Key players involved in lending practices notable the Ministry of Finance, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Borrowers, and Banking Sector institutions were the population of the study. Consideration was given to both empirical and theoretical literature review to identify determinants of bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> For the purposes of the research, convenience purposive sampling was employed. The Researcher distributed questionnaires to a sample of 80 that comprised of the key players involved in lending activities. Interviews were also used as a research instrument to aid in research data collection. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 18 software.

25|$|At the end {{of every}} day, a {{commercial}} bank will have to examine the status of their reserve accounts. Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> (sometimes known as a discount rate) on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a support rate from the central bank. Some countries, such as Japan, have a support rate of zero.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.|$|E
30|$|We {{find that}} while the {{pass-through}} to deposit and <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is complete, confirming {{the effectiveness of the}} monetary policy transmission mechanism. Government domestic bond rates also react to monetary policy changes. Moreover, our results reveal that the pass-through to <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is generally faster than to deposit rates. Finally, we find some evidence of asymmetric adjustment as short-term deposit rates respond faster to monetary policy rate cuts than hikes, and short-term <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> respond faster to monetary policy rate hikes than cuts.|$|R
30|$|Other {{explanatory}} variables {{turn out}} significant. An {{increase in the}} EMBI spread is unequivocally reflected in higher deposit and <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> The effect is robust across maturities and lending categories. An increase in the reserve requirement coefficient is {{found to have a}} positive effect on most of the <b>lending</b> <b>rates,</b> consistent with a reduction of liquidity. Changes in the NPL ratio are not significantly associated with retail rates. The exchange rate turns out significant only for the specification of <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and personal consumption, suggesting that these increase in response to depreciation. Finally, we find some evidence of lower <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> owing to heightened advanced economiesâ€™ volatility risk, proxied by the VIX. However, the effect is relatively small and not robust across maturities.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} {{effectiveness of the}} ECB s Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) program in safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission. Since the program aims at manipulating bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> by conducting sovereign bond purchases on secondary markets, a stable relationship between bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and government bond rates is of prime importance. Using vector autoregressive models with time varying parameters (TVP VAR) we evaluate the stability of this relationship {{by focusing on the}} reaction of bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> to movements in government bond rates over the period 2003 2013. Our results suggest that the potential success of OMTs in restoring the monetary transmission mechanism is limited as the link between bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and government bond rates has substantially weakened since the end of 2008...|$|R

500|$|In October 1907, the United States {{experienced}} a bank {{run on the}} Knickerbocker Trust Company, forcing the trust to close on October 23, 1907, provoking further reactions. The panic was alleviated when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury George B. Cortelyou and John Pierpont [...] "J.P." [...] Morgan deposited $25 million and $35 million, respectively, into the reserve banks of New York City, enabling withdrawals to be fully covered. The bank run in New York led to a money market crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for credit heightened from cereal and grain exporters. Since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in London, the international markets became exposed to the crisis. The Bank of England had to sustain an artificially high discount <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> until 1908. To service the flow of gold to the United States, the Bank of England organized a pool from among twenty-four different nations, for which the Banque de France temporarily lent Â£3 million (GBP, 305.6 million in 2012 GBP) in gold.|$|E

According to a stress test {{conducted by the}} central bank Russian financial system {{would be able to}} handle a currency decline of 25%â€“30% without major central bank interference. However, the Russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the War in Donbass is in danger of entering stagflation, slow growth and high inflation. The recent decline in the Russian ruble has increased the costs for [...] Russian companies to make interest payments on debt issued in U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies that have strengthened against the ruble; thus it costs Russian companies more of their ruble-denominated revenue to repay their debt holders in dollars or other foreign currencies. As of March 2016, the ruble was devalued more than 50 percent since July 2014. Moreover, after bringing inflation down to 3.6% in 2012, the lowest rate since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, inflation in Russia jumped to nearly 7.5% in 2014, causing the central bank to increase its <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> to 8% from 5.5% in 2013. In an October 2014 article in Bloomberg Business Week, it was reported that Russia had significantly started shifting its economy towards China in response to increasing financial tensions following its annexation of Crimea and subsequent Western economic sanctions.|$|E

30|$|The {{interest}} rate pass-through may be asymmetric because bank concentration leads to oligopolistic behaviors. On one hand, the collusive behavior hypothesis of Hannan and Berger (1991) suggests that following {{an increase in}} the monetary policy rate, deposit rates could be rigid upwards because higher deposit rates represent an additional cost for banks. Similarly, the <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> could exhibit downward rigidity in reaction to a reduction in the monetary policy <b>rate</b> as lower <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> imply lower profits for banks. On the other hand, the adverse customer reaction hypothesis indicates that if customers have bargaining power deposit rates could be rigid downwards when the monetary policy <b>rate</b> falls and <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> may be rigid upwards when the monetary policy rate increases.|$|R
