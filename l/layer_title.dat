The dynamic regions are Vaidya-like, with ingoing radiation of positive energy flux during collapse and negative energy flux during evaporation, the latter balanced by outgoing radiation of positive energy flux and a surface pressure at a pair creation surface. The black hole consists of a compact space-time region of trapped surfaces, with inner and outer boundaries which join circularly as a single smooth trapping horizon.

In the way, we solve the Kato square root problem for parabolic operators with coefficients of the elliptic part depending measurably on all variables.
