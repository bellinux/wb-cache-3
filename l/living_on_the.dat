5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couches of friends.|$|E

5|$|Icke made {{no effort}} at school, {{but when he was}} nine, he was chosen for the junior school's third-year {{football}} team.

He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge between hero and villain.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 {{there were}} just 11 people <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island {{but it was not}} long before the island farms expanded. In the 1850s gold was {{discovered}} on mainland Australia where crews would abandon their ships, preferring to dig for gold than to risk a life at sea. As a consequence many vessels avoided the mainland and Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851 about 16 people were <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. Vegetable crops now included potatoes, carrots, maize, pumpkin, taro, watermelon – even grapes, passionfruit and coffee. Between 1851 and 1853 there were several aborted proposals by the NSW Government to establish a penal settlement on the island.|$|E

The kermes dye is a rich red, and has good colour fastness in silk and wool.|$|E

5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E

5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remote island of Skokholm. These small seabirds make {{one of the longest}} migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This {{behaviour}} led {{to the question of how}} they navigated.|$|E

5|$|The {{first and}} second century AD were an age of {{prosperity}} for the population <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Swiss plateau.

5|$|There is no firm {{documentary}} evidence of {{occupation of the}} Webster County village after 1809. However, analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re-occupied during the second decade of the 19th century; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the Kitkehahki were <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Republican. By 1833, however, the village had been abandoned and the band was <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Loup River. In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of the Platte.|$|E

Pat Coughlan was the eldest of the family. He was followed by Denis 'Lyonsie' Coughlan, Jer Coughlan, Dan Coughlan and Tom 'Honest Man' Coughlan who all played with 'the Rockies' and claimed All-Ireland titles with Cork.|$|R

The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E
5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first {{came to the attention of}} scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876.
