25|$|Coronary artery <b>luminal</b> {{narrowing}} {{reduces the}} flow reserve for oxygenated {{blood to the}} heart, typically producing intermittent angina. Very advanced <b>luminal</b> occlusion usually produces a heart attack. However, it has been increasingly recognized, since the late 1980s, that coronary catheterization does not allow {{the recognition of the}} presence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis itself, only significant <b>luminal</b> changes which have occurred as a result of end stage complications of the atherosclerotic process. See IVUS and atheroma for a better understanding of this issue.|$|E

25|$|Furosemide, {{like other}} loop diuretics, acts by {{inhibiting}} the <b>luminal</b> Na-K-Cl cotransporter {{in the thick}} ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the chloride transport channel, thus causing sodium, chloride, and potassium loss in urine.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina {{is short}} to very short. Oviduct is {{measuring}} about 2/3 {{of the length}} of the proximal part of the pedunculus, which is clearly shorter than its much narrower distal segment. Proximal part of the pedunculus about as broad as the proximal half of the oviduct, which is twice as broad as the distal half; the much narrower diverticulum reaches somewhat further than the bursa of the bursa copulatrix, which is separate from the spermoviduct. Male part of the genitalia forming a loop because the vas deferens and a short, most proximal part of the penis are united by a common sheath; with a single retractor muscle, inserting rather close {{to the beginning of the}} vas deferens, without a flagellum or caecum. The <b>luminal</b> structure, as far as visible in the transparent genital slides, enables the distinction of three segments: (1) a short broadest part with a relatively simple, longitudinal, <b>luminal</b> structure, (2) a much longer part, with a more complicated <b>luminal</b> surface of many protuberances that very gradually decrease in size towards segment (3), which has a wall structure with very small, irregular protuberances and changes into the epiphallus near the insertion site of the retractor muscle, without an obvious boundary.|$|E
25|$|The copper IUD's primary {{mechanism}} of action is to prevent fertilization. Active substances released from the IUD, together with products derived from the inflammatory reaction present in the <b>luminal</b> fluids of the genital tract, are toxic for spermatozoa and oocytes, preventing the encounter of healthy gametes {{and the formation of}} viable embryos.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 a German family asked Adolf Hitler to {{have their}} {{disabled}} son killed, the five-month-old boy was given a lethal dose of <b>Luminal</b> after Hitler sent his own doctor to examine him.

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of SEMS are used to alleviate symptoms caused by cancers of the gastrointestinal tract that obstruct {{the interior of the}} tube-like (or <b>luminal)</b> structures of the bowel â€” namely the esophagus, duodenum, common bile duct and colon. SEMS are designed to be permanent and, as a result, are often used when the cancer is at an advanced stage and cannot be removed by surgery.|$|E
25|$|The first {{barbiturate}} drug, barbital, was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering and {{was first}} marketed as Veronal by Friedr. Bayer et comp. By 1904, several related drugs, including phenobarbital, had been synthesized by Fischer. Phenobarbital {{was brought to}} market in 1912 by the drug company Bayer as the brand <b>Luminal.</b> It remained a commonly prescribed sedative and hypnotic until the introduction of benzodiazepines in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Mammary {{stem cells}} provide {{the source of}} cells for growth of the mammary gland during puberty and {{gestation}} and {{play an important role}} in carcinogenesis of the breast. Mammary stem cells have been isolated from human and mouse tissue as well as from cell lines derived from the mammary gland. Single such cells can give rise to both the <b>luminal</b> and myoepithelial cell types of the gland, and have been shown to have the ability to regenerate the entire organ in mice.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple <b>luminal</b> surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple <b>luminal</b> surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E
25|$|SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G are {{commonly}} expressed in tight epithelia that have low water permeability. The major organs where ENaC is expressed include {{parts of the}} kidney tubular epithelia, the respiratory airway, the female reproductive tract, colon, salivary and sweat glands. In the skin, SCNN1A is expressed in the keratinocytes in the epidermal layer, in the sebaceous sweat glands, and the smooth muscle cells mostly within the cytoplasm. In contrast, in the eccrine sweat glands ENaC is mostly located on the <b>luminal</b> surface of eccrine duct epithelia.|$|E
25|$|Reabsorption is the {{transport}} of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the peritubular capillary. It is accomplished via selective receptors on the <b>luminal</b> cell membrane. Water is 99% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism {{for this is the}} Na+/glucose cotransporter. A plasma level of 350mg/dL will fully saturate {{the transport}}ers and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 is involved in regulation of biosynthesis of cardiolipin in mitochondria, and its overexpression in cultured cells resulted in increased cardiolipin synthase, activity. As cardiolipin is synthesized in the <b>luminal</b> side of inner mitochondrial membrane, a major fraction of this newly synthesized pool of cardiolipin has to be translocated from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane. PLSCR3 has been proposed {{to be involved in}} this translocation from the inner to the outer membrane that is essential for maintaining the mitochondrial architecture, mass, and transmembrane potential.|$|E
25|$|Self-expandable {{metallic}} stents are cylindrical in shape, and are devised in {{a number}} of diameters and lengths to suit the application in question. They typically consist of cross-hatched, braided or interconnecting rows of metal that are assembled into a tube-like structure. SEMS, when unexpanded, are small enough to fit through the channel of an endoscope, which is meant for delivery of devices for therapeutic endoscopy. They expand through a deployment device which is placed {{at the end of the}} SEMS, and are held in place against the wall of the <b>luminal</b> surface by friction.|$|E
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though <b>luminal</b> stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|E
25|$|NKCC1 {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the body, especially in organs that secrete fluids, called exocrine glands. In cells of these organs, NKCC1 is commonly found in the basolateral membrane, {{the part of the}} cell membrane closest to the blood vessels. Its basolateral location gives NKCC1 the ability to transport sodium, potassium, and chloride from the blood into the cell. Other transporters assist in the movement of these solutes out of the cell through its apical surface. The end result is that solutes from the blood, particularly chloride, are secreted into the lumen of these exocrine glands, increasing the <b>luminal</b> concentration of solutes and causing water to be secreted by osmosis.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{synthesis}} {{begins with}} a reaction between UDP-galactose and 2-hydroxylated or non-hydroxylated ceramide. This reaction is catalyzed by galactosyltransferase (CGT), where galactose is transferred to 2-hydroxylated, or non-hydroxylated ceramide, from UDP-galactose. This reaction occurs in the <b>luminal</b> leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum, and its final product is GalCer, or galactocerebroside, which is then transported to the Golgi apparatus. Here, GalCer reacts with 3â€™-phosphoadenosine-5â€™-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to make sulfatide. This reaction is catalyzed by cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST). CST is a homodimeric protein that {{is found in the}} Golgi apparatus. It has been demonstrated that mice models lacking CST, CGT, or both are incapable of producing sulfatide indicating that CST and CGT are necessary components of sulfatide synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Polymeric IgA (mainly the {{secretory}} dimer) {{is produced}} by plasma cells in the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, and is taken up into the cell via endocytosis. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the <b>luminal</b> surface of the epithelial cells, still attached to the receptor. Proteolysis of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with {{a portion of the}} receptor known as the secretory component, are free to diffuse throughout the lumen. In the gut, IgA can bind to the mucus layer covering the epithelial cells. In this way, a barrier capable of neutralizing threats before they reach the epithelial cells is formed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{event of}} biomechanical-driven hierarchal remodelling occurs {{just after the}} onset of heart beat, when the vitelline artery forms by the fusion of several smaller capillaries. Subsequently, side {{branches}} may disconnect from the main artery and reattach to the venous network, effectively changing their identity. This {{is thought to be}} due to the high <b>luminal</b> pressure in the arterial lines, which prevents reattachment of the branches back onto arterial vessels. This also prevents the formation of shunts between the two components of the network. Researchers have verified this identity-switching phenomenon by successfully grafting sections of quail endothelial tubing which had previously expressed arterial markers onto chick veins (or vice versa), showcasing the plasticity of the system. Reversing flow patterns in arteries and/or veins can also have the same effect, although it is unclear whether this is due to differences in physical or chemical properties of venous vs. arterial flow (i.e. pressure profile and oxygen tension).|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} studies {{published}} in Science involved introduced viruses known to cause cancerous mutation in prostate cells: AKT, ERG, and AR into isolated samples of basal and <b>luminal</b> cells and grafted the treated tissue into mice. After 16 weeks, none of the <b>luminal</b> samples had undergone malignant mutation, while the basal samples had mutated into prostate-like tubules which had then developed malignancy and formed cancerous tumors, which appeared identical to human samples under magnification. This led {{to the conclusion that}} the prostate basal cell may be the most likely [...] "site of origin" [...] of prostate cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{causes of}} bowel {{obstruction}} may resolve spontaneously; many require operative treatment. In adults, frequently the surgical intervention {{and the treatment}} of the causative lesion are required. In malignant large bowel obstruction, endoscopically placed self-expanding metal stents may be used to temporarily relieve the obstruction as a bridge to surgery, or as palliation. [...] Diagnosis of the type of bowel obstruction is normally conducted through initial plain radiograph of the abdomen, <b>luminal</b> contrast studies, computed tomography scan, or ultrasonography prior to determining the best type of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Biomechanics {{act on the}} {{vascular}} network connections as well. <b>Luminal</b> {{pressure has}} been shown to direct the recycling of vessel segments to high-pressure areas, and govern the disconnection of vessel segments from arterial lines and reattachment to venous lines in order to shape the network. [...] This type of vessel breakage may even be indirectly responsible for the development of some organ systems and the evolution of larger organisms, as without detachment and migration, large masses of tissue in the embryo would remain disconnected from the blood supply. Once vessels break away from the parent artery, they may also undergo angiogenesis to infest tissues distal {{to the rest of the}} network.|$|E
2500|$|Rudi Stern has written, [...] "The 1930s were {{years of}} great {{creativity}} for neon, {{a period when}} many design and animation techniques were developed. ... Men like O. J. Gude and, in particular, Douglas Leigh took neon advertising further than Georges Claude and his associates had ever envisioned. Leigh, who conceived and created the archetypal Times Square spectacular, experimented with displays that incorporated smells, fog, and sounds {{as part of their}} total effect. ... Much of the visual excitement of Times Square in the thirties was a result of Leigh's genius as a kinetic and <b>luminal</b> artist." [...] Major cities throughout the United States and in several other countries also had elaborate displays of neon signs. Events such as the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition (1933â€“34), the Paris World's Fair (1937) and New York World's Fair (1939) were remarkable for their extensive use of neon tubes as architectural features. Stern has argued that the creation of [...] "glorious" [...] neon displays for movie theaters led to an association of the two, [...] "One's joy in going to the movies became inseparably associated with neon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{infections and}} {{parasitic}} infestations produce {{patterns of the}} <b>luminal</b> surface, which are best seen on Barium examinations. Certain parasites are seen as filling defects outlined by Barium and Barium examinations {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of intestinal infections and infestations as compared to other techniques. Barium studies show tapeworms and roundworms as thin, linear filling defects of the bowel. Because roundworms have a developed alimentary tract, barium may outline the parasitesâ€™ intestinal tracts on delayed images. In Strongyloidiasis barium studies show intestinal wall oedema, thickening of intestinal folds with flattening, and atrophy of the overlying mucosa. Schistosomiasis caused by infection with flatworms [...] have an appearance resembling colitis ulcerosa, with inflammatory polyps, ulcers, fibrosis, wall thickening, loss of haustration, and stenosis in Barium X-rays. Anisakiasis is demonstrated by Barium X-rays as bowel wall oedema, thickening, ulceration, or stricture due to inflammation. Sometimes worms are seen as long, thread-like, linear filling defects up to 30cm long. In Typhlitis Barium studies show oedema, ulceration, and inflammation of bowel wall resulting in wall thickening. In pseudomembranous colitis, barium studies show pancolitis with thumb printing and shaggy margins as well as plaque-like eccentric, nodular or polypoid appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Under normal {{conditions}} in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, most of the carbonic acid (H2CO3) produced intracellularly {{by the action of}} carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates in the cell to bicarbonate (...) and an [...] ion (a proton), as previously mentioned.
