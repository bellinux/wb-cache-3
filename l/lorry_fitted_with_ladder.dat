50|$|By 20 July 2013 all tracks through Bolsover Castle station {{site had}} been lifted, but the {{trackbed}} was intact. The station itself was demolished some years ago. A business park {{had been developed}} immediately west of the station site. One occupant is a firm providing road-rail vehicles, such as track welding <b>lorries</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> retractable rail wheels. A length of track with dummy overhead wires, presumably for training and clearance testing purposes, has been installed in their depot in plain view from public areas.|$|R
50|$|Railcar movers {{are fairly}} lightweight, {{so in order}} to gain more {{traction}} some models transfer weight from the car they are hauling onto their own wheels to increase their effective weight. These models use steel wheels on steel rail, much like a locomotive, which provides a more consistent traction among wider variety of conditions. The steel wheels also last far longer than rubber tires and overall cost less to operate. In Australia, construction equipment such as loaders and telehanders are converted to shunting use and on these machines, the boom lift is used to transfer weight from the car to the drive wheels. In Europe, trucks (<b>lorries)</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> railway wheels and couplings are used as rail car movers (often called towing or shunting vehicles).|$|R
50|$|In 1941, LPTB were {{allocated}} ten 'unfrozen'TD7 Titans (STD 101-11), {{which received}} early Ministry of Supply Utility Style bodies by Park Royal Vehicles. Their heavy flywheels and slow gearchanges made them umpopular with drivers. The London Fire Brigade, {{and some other}} Fire Brigades, {{as well as the}} National Fire Service also had Titan TD7s <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> turntable <b>ladders</b> (see above).|$|R
50|$|In 1999, five {{hydroelectric}} dams on Battle Creek, a major {{tributary of}} the Sacramento River, were removed to allow better passage of the fish. Three other dams along the creek were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> fish <b>ladders.</b> The river {{is considered one of}} the best salmon habitats in the watershed because of its relatively cold water and the availability of ideal habitat such as gravel bars.|$|R
50|$|The park is {{the central}} piece of a 'Green fingers' network of parks that is being {{established}} (mostly aligned along around 45 km of streams and creeks draining the Flat Bush catchment). The ecological system involved consultation with groups such as Forest & Bird and the Auckland Regional Council. The water systems also work as stormwater ponds, and have been <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> fish <b>ladders</b> to ensure connected water habitats.|$|R
25|$|The {{nacelles}} had aluminium skeletons, {{the bottom}} halves {{of which were}} clad with aluminium sheeting and the tops with cotton cloth. A hatch, <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a connecting <b>ladder</b> to {{the main body of}} the airship, enabled the mechanics to climb in or out of the nacelles when their shifts changed.|$|R
5000|$|Reversing (also {{known as}} backing up) {{is the process}} of driving a vehicle in the reverse {{direction}} in order to maneuver. Rear view mirrors are standard equipment for this endeavor. Extremely large or luxury vehicles may have in addition technical aids such as backup cameras. Many industrial vehicles such as fork lifts automatically activate a warning beep whilst reversing. In the UK <b>lorries</b> may be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> warning devices which repeatedly announce [...] "This vehicle is reversing", or the equivalent phrase in Welsh.|$|R
50|$|UK <b>lorries</b> are now <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> {{an impact}} {{absorbing}} rear barrier, meeting {{one of the}} recommendations.Investigation techniques included interviews with police, hospitals, survivors and coroners to study ways in which vehicle design could be changed to avoid accidents {{in the first place}} and to mitigate the injuries caused.Speaking in 2002, the former director of the hospital's research unit, Dr John Bull credited the unit with calling for mandatory seatbelt installation in new vehicles and compulsory wearing of motorbike crash helmets. The AA provided some money for research.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the rates of cooling of vehicle brake drums and discs. Thermocouples were inserted in the drums and discs and in the wheel hubs and their outputs fed via slip ring units to meters mounted inside the vehicle. The drums or discs were heated to a uniform temperature of 30 O 0 - 40 OcC by drag braking and the rate at which they cooled measured while the vehicle was driven at constant speed. Measure-ments were made at various speeds in the range 0 to 90 mile/h. From the log (temperature) against time plot a cooling coefficient b, was determined. It is shown that at a vehicle speed v the quantity b, can be expressed in the form b, = bo +KVO. ~ where b, represents the loss of heat to the hub and K is a constant depending on {{the size and shape of}} the drum or disc. Values of these constants have been determined on a variety of cars having discs and drums varying from 7 in to 11 in diameter and on a <b>lorry</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> 16. 75 in diameter drums. Cooling rates are shown to depend on shape and size of the disc or drum. Results show that the cooling rates of front brakes are about 20 per cent higher than the rear brakes and that front discs cool about 25 per cent more quickly than the corresponding drum size recom-mended for the same vehicle. The cooling rate of front discs did not change when wire wheels were fitted instead of solid wheels. Ventilated discs and solid discs were also compared. The effect of fitting dust shields on disc brakes is shown to reduce the cooling rates by about 30 per cent. The effect of otherwise disturbing the air flow was studied...|$|R
50|$|Like the {{majority}} of California rivers, the Yuba was dammed at many points during the 20th century and large amounts of water are drawn for irrigation and municipal water supply. Daguerre Point Dam was built in 1906 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in order to trap hydraulic mining debris. After concerns about its impact on fish populations, the dam was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> fish <b>ladders</b> in 1937. The concrete arch Englebright Dam was built in 1941 to trap mining debris following the re-legalization of hydraulic mining during the 1930s. Mining never resumed on a Gold Rush scale in the Yuba River watershed; today Englebright serves primarily for hydroelectricity generation.|$|R
25|$|Units {{such as the}} Ohio State Highway Patrol's Special Response Team (SRT) used {{a vehicle}} called a B.E.A.R., made by Lenco Engineering, {{which is a very}} large armored vehicle <b>with</b> a <b>ladder</b> on top to make entry into the second and third floors of buildings. Numerous other {{agencies}} such as the LAPD, LASD and NYPD use both the B.E.A.R. and the smaller Lenco BearCat variant. The Anaheim Police Department has a customized B.E.A.R. <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a <b>ladder</b> for assaulting multi-story buildings. Many SWAT teams in the states and around the world, including the LAPD, fit their armored and non-armored vehicles with the Patriot3 Liberator and 'MARS' (Mobile Adjustable Ramp System) Elevated Tactics Systems for gaining entry to 2nd- and 3rd-story buildings, airplane assault, sniper positioning, ship access, etc.|$|R
50|$|Carp, rainbow trout, cherry salmon, iwana (char), ugui (big-scaled redfin) and ayu all inhabit Tama River in {{sufficient}} numbers for limited commercial fishing {{to take place}} in upstream areas. Recent moves to <b>fit</b> weirs <b>with</b> fish <b>ladders</b> have resulted in a steep increase in the numbers of ayu migrating upstream. Other fish such as loach inhabit the river, as do crabs, turtles and crayfish.|$|R
25|$|During the 1950s the South Ore Shoot {{had been}} {{exhausted}} and workings below the 175Fathom Level {{at the south}} end were abandoned and allowed to flood. Exploration was continued in all likely areas, from diamond drilling in the Glencoyne Level at the north end, to an extension of the 175Fathom Level beyond the Clay Vein {{at the south end}}. Good pockets of ore were found in some places and production actually remained higher than in the mid-19th century. In 1954 a second exit from the mine was created as an emergency escape route. This led through the Alma workings to the Low Horse Level, up an old sump into the High Horse Level, through the old brick dam and out through the Glencoyne Level. The shafts were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> climbing <b>ladders,</b> and the route was inspected weekly.|$|R
50|$|The Dworshak Dam {{power station}} was {{designed}} to accommodate six generating units for purposes of peaking power production. However, this form of operation would cause excessively large flow fluctuations on the North Fork Clearwater River, and the main Clearwater River below their confluence at Ahsahka. A dam was to be built on the Clearwater River above Lenore to provide a forebay for smoothing out Dworshak releases, but due to opposition by local residents it was never built. Although {{it would have been}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a fish <b>ladder,</b> the Lenore dam would have affected steelhead and salmon migration to the entire upper Clearwater River and its tributaries, including the South Fork, Middle Fork, Lochsa and Selway Rivers. In addition, the flooding caused by its 11 mi-long reservoir would require the relocation of the Dworshak fish hatchery. The proposed fifth and sixth units of the plant were deauthorized in 1990, and the fourth unit was deauthorized in 1995.|$|R
50|$|In August 1941 a new squadron, No. 138 (Special Duties), {{was formed}} to {{undertake}} missions for the Special Operations Executive to maintain clandestine contact with the French Resistance. Among its aircraft were Lysander Mk IIIs, which flew over and landed in occupied France. While general supply drops could {{be left to the}} rest of No. 138's aircraft, the Lysander could insert and remove agents from the continent or retrieve Allied aircrew who had been shot down over occupied territory and had evaded capture. For this role the Mk IIIs were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a fixed <b>ladder</b> over the port side to hasten access to the rear cockpit and a large drop tank under the belly. In order to slip in unobtrusively Lysanders were painted matte black; operations almost always took place within a week of a full moon, as moonlight was essential for navigation. The aircraft undertook such duties until the liberation of France in 1944.|$|R

30|$|Therefore, in this letter, {{we present}} a novel and easy AFM-based {{nanomanufacturing}} method combining the AFM internal tip scanning cycles with the high-precision stage movement to fabricate nanochannels <b>with</b> <b>ladder</b> nanostructure at the bottom. Using this method, a nanochannel <b>with</b> <b>ladder</b> nanostructure at the bottom {{can be achieved by}} continuous scanning with a fixed scan size. Different structures can be obtained according to the matching relation of the feeding velocity of the tip and the moving velocity of the precision stage. As such, this nanomachining method has the potential to advance the AFM tip-based nanomanufacturing by increasing the removal speed, simplifying the processing procedure, and achieving the large-scale nanofabrication.|$|R

50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Fischer bow collector, 378 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an ASEA pantograph, 379 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 {{were all}} fitted {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 had their pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R
