5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E

40|$|In many {{biological}} and environmental studies, measured data {{is subject to}} a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection. The <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection is generally defined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be differentiated from a blank sample with some certainty. Data falling below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection is left-censored, falling below a level that is easily quantified by a measuring device. A great deal of interest lies in estimating the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection for a particular measurement device. In this paper we propose an innovative change-point model to estimate the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection using data from an experiment with known analyte concentrations. Estimation <b>of</b> the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection proceeds {{by way of a}} two-stage maximum likelihood method. The proposed methodology is analyzed via simulation, and is applied to copy number data from an HIV pilot study. This method is shown to lead to improved estimation <b>of</b> the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection.
