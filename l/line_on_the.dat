5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side and the Furuset <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side of Groruddalen and the Lambertseter <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and would quickly need a good public transport system; suburban lines would first be built out extending from the existing tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, U2 {{released}} their 12th studio album, No <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Horizon. The album received generally favourable {{reviews and}} debuted at {{number one in}} over 30 countries, but its sales of 5million units were comparatively low by U2 standards {{and it did not}} contain a hit single. Having spent time in Fez, Morocco, recording and absorbing exotic musical influences, the group intended the record to be more experimental than their previous two. However, critics found it to be more conventional than expected. During the five-and-a-half year gestation period for Songs of Innocence, lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty on several occasions over how U2 could remain relevant musically after the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of No <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Horizon.|$|E

5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{on their first}} {{possession}}s, Arkansas long snapper Will Coleman snapped the ball {{over the head of}} punter Dylan Breeding that gave Alabama possession at the Razorbacks' six-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> next play, Eddie Lacy scored on a six-yard run for a 7–0 Crimson Tide lead. The Razorbacks responded with an eight-play, 51-yard drive, but failed to score any points after a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal hit the left upright. Each team again traded punts before the Crimson Tide extended their lead to 10–0 early in the second quarter on a 51-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After these exploits, he {{was badly}} wounded {{on the front}} <b>line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gallipoli Peninsula, but {{recovered}} and served continuously {{for the remainder of}} the war and into the Russian Civil War.

During his lengthy career, Robinson remained a highly regarded officer who had served through four wars.|$|E

5|$|Amman was an {{important}} city on the Ottoman lines of communication. All of the supplies and reinforcements for the Ottoman army force defending the <b>line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern edge of the}} Jordan Valley had passed through it. Now the city was on the main line of retreat.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Fjord City and {{redevelopment}} of Bjørvika, the Ekeberg Line {{has been}} proposed to follow a new <b>line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side of Oslo Central Station to Jernbanetorget, with stops at Sørengautstikkeren and Bjørvika.

5|$|Because Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Following the kickoff and return, Virginia Tech began at its 19-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play of the second half, Oxendine broke loose for a 36-yard run to the Nebraska 45-yard line and a first down. Despite that strong opening play, Tech was unable to gain another first down {{and was forced to}} punt after gaining only two additional yards. The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the Nebraska 26-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Both the Steelers and Indianapolis Colts drove {{more than}} 60yards on their opening {{offensive}} drives, each scored a touchdown {{to bring the}} score to 7–7 after the first quarter. A Steelers 42-yard flea flicker advanced {{the ball to the}} 2yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> following play Mewelde Moore scored his second touchdown of the game. The Steelers extended their lead to ten, but an interception with 1:30 remaining in the half led to a Colts touchdown—bringing the halftime score to 17–14.|$|E
5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle <b>line</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati's kickoff {{after the}} {{touchdown}} {{was returned to}} the Virginia Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their first offensive possession of the game. That play was a 27-yard run by wide receiver Dyrell Roberts, who ran an end-around for the big gain. Now on the Cincinnati side of the field, Virginia Tech running Back Darren Evans ran for one yard, then Hokies quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed a 34-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale. The catch gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Cincinnati 14-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play following the long completion, Evans was tackled for a six-yard loss, pushing the Hokies back to the Bearcats' 20-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> next two plays, Tyrod Taylor rushed {{for a total of}} 11yards, but was unable to gain another first down. Facing fourth down, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Dustin Keys into the game to attempt a 26-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the uprights, however, and Virginia Tech was denied a scoring opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Counter-attacks by the 4th Guards Division, {{reinforced}} by {{a battalion of}} the 220th Division, forced the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade back to the start <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> right flank, one unit of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered {{a large number of}} shellfire casualties, while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire as it neared its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives late in the evening and a salient was created in the 4th Canadian Division <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful. An additional attack planned for 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking a slagheap called Green Crassier and the mine complex at Fosse St. Louis. The attack was repulsed, with the majority of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's kickoff and a 38-yard return, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 45-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second {{play of the}} drive, Noel {{completed}} a 55-yard pass to Andre Davis, who ran {{into the end zone}} for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech regained the lead, 1713, with 40seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play up the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard running into the kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E
