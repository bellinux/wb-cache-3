50|$|Problems {{can occur}} when the market-based {{measurement}} does not accurately represent the underlying asset's true value. This can occur when a company is forced to calculate the selling price of these assets or liabilities during unfavorable or volatile times, such as a financial crisis.

This case occurred during the financial crisis of 2008/09 where many securities held on banks' balance sheets could not be valued efficiently as the markets had disappeared from them.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the liquidity effect in the euro area – the link between the availability of aggregate liquidity and the interbank overnight rate. Applying a set of assumptions which also lead to the “martingale property ” of the overnight rate, a model linking the latter to the expected aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>conditions</b> is formulated and calibrated. Different assumptions for how the market is establishing its expectation and uncertainty about the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>conditions</b> are tested for. It is found that the dynamics of the overnight rate is consistent with market participants having, in aggregate, a rather precise expectation about the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>conditions,</b> however, with an apparent uncertainty which by far exceeds the rather limited variance of the error of this expectation. While the model presented here provides a rather good fit of the overnight rate this indicates that further aspects than just the dynamics of the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>conditions</b> need to be included in order to conceptually describe the overnight rate.

40|$|Market {{liquidity}}, or liquidity in trading, {{has become}} {{an important aspect of}} financial stability. The measurement of market liquidity has been especially important for emerging markets as they are exposed to the flow of short term investment fund. We follow the liquidity measurement approach by Bervas (2006) and a combination of Value at Risk (VaR) and Liquidity-adjusted Value at Risk developed by Bangia, et al (1999) and produce the measurement of exogenous cost of liquidity (CoL) from the Indonesian stock market. The paper sheds light on the possibility of the use of this liquidity risk measure as part of the financial stability analysis. We also forecasted the value of CoL to see if it can be used as an early warning indicator. The results shows that especially for the series during the final quarter of 2008, the movement of the forecasted values can predict whether the liquidity risk will be worse. However, the magnitude of the forecasted increase of CoL undervalued the real increase of CoL. The forecast in the second semester of 2009 is roughly similar to the actual measurement as it is considered a more normal period. The methodology is deemed to be fairly simple and intuitive to help provide an objective assessment of the stock market <b>liquidity</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

A computational model is {{used to assess the}} resilience of the Czech banking system to interbank contagion, taking into account the size and structure of interbank exposures as well as balance sheet and regulatory characteristics of individual banks in the network. The simulation results suggest that the potential for contagion due to credit losses on interbank exposures was rather limited.

Activation of the asset price channel further increases the losses due to interbank contagion, showing that liquidity of government bonds would be essential for the stability of Czech banks in stress situations. Finally, the simulation results for both idiosyncratic and multiple bank failure shocks suggest that the potential for contagion in the Czech banking system has decreased since the onset of the global financial crisis...|$|R

Using a large sample of hedge funds, we find strong evidence of liquidity timing. A bootstrap analysis suggests that top-ranked liquidity timers cannot be attributed to pure luck. In out-of-sample tests, top liquidity timers outperform bottom timers by 4. 0 – 5. 5 % annually on a risk-adjusted basis. We also find {{that it is important}} to distinguish liquidity timing from liquidity reaction, which primarily relies on public information. Our results are robust to alternative explanations, hedge fund data biases, and the use of alternative timing models, risk factors, and liquidity measures. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and incorporating market <b>liquidity</b> <b>conditions</b> in investment decision making...|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{liquidity}} risk management has increased, the importance of comprehensive liquidity assessments of exchanges has been highlighted. This thesis investigates the liquidity on the Nasdaq OMX Stockholm exchange by using daily end of day data. The transaction cost is evaluated using the Holden model and the price impact from trading is evaluated using the Illiq model. Considering the three segments; small cap, mid cap, and large cap, {{the results suggest that}} both the transaction cost and price impact is highest for small cap stocks and lowest for large cap stocks. It is also shown that the transaction cost has decreased between 2002 - 03 - 20 and 2012 - 01 - 06 for all three segments although the cost is increasing for the small cap segment again. No decrease in price impact over this time period could be found. The data behind the results has then been used to create a combined liquidity measure with the purpose of indicating the <b>liquidity</b> <b>condition</b> of a mutual fund. The combined measure {{can also be used to}} assess whether it is price impact or transaction cost that contributes most to the liquidity cost when liquidating stocks or reveal what stocks in a portfolio that are the most illiquid.

40|$|Preliminary Draft, Please do not Quote) The US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank {{have adopted}} a number of measures, {{including}} aggressive policy rate cuts, to ease the liquidity crunch {{in the financial markets}} following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Using high frequency spot and forward foreign exchange quote and interest rate data in the period from 1 September to 31 December 2008, this study investigates how these policy actions affect the dynamics of market <b>liquidity</b> <b>condition.</b> Following Hui et al. (2009), the paper uses the differential between the US dollar rate implied by the covered interest parity condition and the corresponding US dollar interest rate as a proxy for (the lack of) the liquidity in the US dollar money market. The study focuses on EUR/USD and compares the most stressful crisis period with other relatively less stressful periods. The paper then examines how policy action announcements by the central banks affect the dynamics of intraday money market liquidity. The study employs autoregressive models to capture the potential effects of monetary policy action announcements on both the mean and volatility of the liquidity proxy. The results show that the coordinated cuts of policy rates failed to stimulate lending in the short-term US money market, whereas the unlimited currency swap line offered by the Federal Reserve with other central banks succeeded in reducing the illiquidity and the effectiveness persisted longer for short-term funding.
