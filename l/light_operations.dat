In addition, the San Antonio shops camouflage-painted the B-52Gs for Southeast Asia Arc <b>Light</b> <b>operations.</b> This era in Kelly's history ended when the Air Force shifted the B-52 workload to Oklahoma City AMA at Tinker AFB {{in the spring of}} 1993.

50|$|Reactivated an {{intermediate}} command echelon of Strategic Air Command in 1959, it {{gained control of}} the 340th and the 305th Bombardment Wings at Bunker Hill AFB, Indiana, and the 4040th Air Base Squadron at Richard I. Bong AFB, Wisconsin in 1959. The two bombardment wings flew normal SAC alert patrols and participated in special exercises as required. However, the division lost its bombardment wings and gained missile wings in 1963 and assumed responsibility for Titan and Minuteman missiles in Missouri, Kansas, and later Arkansas. When joined by the 70th Bombardment Wing, on 1 July 1965 with B-52 and KC-135 aircraft, the division reverted to an earlier designation - 17th Strategic Aerospace Division. From 1965 to 1971, the division's subordinate units frequently deployed bomber and tanker resources. Arc <b>Light</b> <b>operations</b> in Southeast Asia, consisting of military operations against enemy forces in Vietnam, drew most of the deployments.|$|E
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was again}} activated in 1955 {{as part of}} the 380th Strategic Aerospace Wing and equipped with the B-47 Stratojet. Flying the B-47, the 528th took a place as part of SAC's nuclear deterrent to war which were designed to carry nuclear weapons and to penetrate Soviet air defenses with its high operational ceiling and near supersonic speed. The squadron flew the B-47 for about a decade when by the mid-1960s it had become obsolete and vulnerable to new Soviet air defenses. The squadron began to send its stratojets to AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB for retirement, being replaced by the B-52G Stratofortress in 1966, receiving its aircraft from the inactivating 70th Bombardment Squadron at Loring AFB, Maine. The 528th was the only squadron assigned to the wing at this time. Crews of the 528th were deployed in support to the war in Southeast Asia on a rotating TDY basis for Arc <b>Light</b> <b>operations</b> in the late 1960s.|$|E

50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, {{coiled tubing}} refers to a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the drilling derrick on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for <b>light</b> <b>operations</b> a mobile self-contained coiled tubing rig can be used.|$|E
50|$|The B-58 Hustler was {{yet another}} {{important}} addition to the Air Force inventory. As America's first supersonic bomber, it could range higher and faster than any other bomber aircraft in the world, flying at twice the speed of sound. Its four J79 engines produced over 41,000 pounds of thrust that could push the sleek bomber at more than 1,300 mph. The first B-58 arrived at Kelly on 15 March 1960 {{to be used for}} training maintenance personnel for the new overhaul workload. On May 26, 1958, SAAMA opened the B-58 Logistics Support Management Office. It became the forerunner of a major area organizational realignment whereby worldwide weapons management functions would be separated organizationally from the internal depot operations. Responsibilities outlined for the weapon system manager included budgeting, funding, computing requirements, and arranging for maintenance.Kelly repaired and overhauled B-52s for over 30 years. In the early 1960s, the B-52 Stratofortress was the major depot-level maintenance workload for SAAMA. Modifications to the B-52s performed at Kelly increased the load capability of each plane and increased the aircraft's range.

40|$|In this {{research}} we investigate {{the applicability of}} autonomous intelligent agents in Urban Traffic Control (UTC), and why these Artificial Intelligent strategies are useful.
