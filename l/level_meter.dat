25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see A-weighting).|$|E
2500|$|Z- or ZERO frequency-weighting was {{introduced}} in the International Standard IEC 61672 in 2003 and was intended to replace the [...] "Flat" [...] or [...] "Linear" [...] frequency weighting often fitted by manufacturers. This change was needed as each sound <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut-offs (3dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured. As well, the C-frequency-weighting, with 3dB points at 31.5Hz and 8kHz did not have a sufficient bandpass to allow the sensibly correct measurement of true peak noise (Lpk) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{better quality}} old-fashioned tube radio sets, a tuning guide {{consisting}} of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was {{also known as a}} [...] "Magic Eye" [...] or [...] "Tuning Eye". Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device. The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} sound <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> can {{be called}} an exponentially averaging sound <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> as the AC signal from the microphone is converted to DC by a root-mean-square (RMS) circuit and thus it must have a time constant of integration; today {{referred to as the}} time-weighting. Three of these time-weightings have been internationally standardized, 'S' (1 s) originally called Slow, 'F' (125 ms) originally called Fast and 'I' (35 ms) originally called Impulse. Their names were changed in the 1980s to be the same in any language. I-time-weighting is no longer {{in the body of the}} standard because it has little real correlation with the impulsive character of noise events.|$|E
5000|$|Live sound covers an {{enormous}} range of levels, {{but this is}} not something that can be demonstrated with a conventional sound <b>level</b> <b>meter.</b> Sound level meters respond quite slowly, even on a [...] "fast" [...] setting: they use a root mean square (RMS) rectifier which by definition must take a slow running average of the square of the input voltage.

40|$|Occupational noise {{exposure}} measurements are usually conducted using a measurement methodology based on sound <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> or noise dosimeters. Various researchers {{have examined the}} relative accuracies of these instruments in both laboratory and field studies: however, a paucity of data exists as to their absolute accuracies {{in relationship to the}} reference position. The reference position, which is the center of the head with the worker absent, mainly stems from the early laboratory research on damage-risk assessments of {{noise exposure}}. Whenever any object enters the sound field, the sound level of the sound field at the measurement location changes. This study makes absolute and relative comparisons between the measuring positions where noise dosimeters and sound <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> are used in assessing noise exposures. This field study concludes that there is no practical difference between the sound levels measured with sound <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> or noise dosimeters as long as the instruments meet type 2 tolerances as defined in the American National Standards Institute standard S 1. 4. Type 2 instruments are generally specified as having an accuracy of + 2 dBA.
