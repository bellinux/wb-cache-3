5|$|In 1896, the British Moss <b>Litter</b> Company was formed, from an {{amalgamation}} of the Hatfield Chase Peat Moss <b>Litter</b> Company, the Griendtsveen Moss <b>Litter</b> Company, {{and most}} of the other companies working on the moors. They gained control of works at Creyke's Siding and Moorends to the west, Medge Hall to the south, Swinefleet to the east, and Old Goole in the north, together with the mill on Hatfield Moors. Old Goole mill closed in 1902, although peat was stored there for another twelve years. The new company did not have complete control of the moors, as there were several small independent peat works on Crowle Moor. The company was restructured in 1899, by winding up the original company and creating a new one with the same name but additional working capital. At the same time, Swinefleet Works was formally purchased, whereas it had been leased by the old company. Sales of peat rose steadily from 39,444 tons in 1893 to 74,948 tons in 1898.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters breed {{throughout}} the year, with no fixed breeding season, {{but a large}} number are born in the summer months. In the wild, three to four litters are produced each year, {{with an average of}} eight offspring per <b>litter.</b> In captivity, females can have between one and 18 litters per year, with one to nine offspring per <b>litter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments {{although}} a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf <b>litter.</b> Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf <b>litter</b> and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, {{and at least one}} species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.|$|E
40|$|<b>Litters</b> {{offered a}} {{concentrated}} milk replacer and the vitamin amino acid, iron-electrolyte supplement, weighed {{the same as}} control <b>litters</b> at day 10, 14, 21, and 28. Blood analysis revealed no difference in packed cell volume, hemoglobin, or plasma protein between <b>litters</b> offered the supplement and control <b>litters.</b> Survival rate from birth to weaning favored the control <b>litters</b> (93. 9 or 85. 3 %), however all nineteen <b>litters</b> {{used in this study}} were healthy with very little scours observed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Litters</b> {{are used}} to rescue victims in {{confined}} spaces, such as inside a ship or a cave network. <b>Litters</b> used in surface water rescue are equipped with floats. <b>Litters</b> used in mountain rescue usually are equipped with a cover or other material to protect the person from falling rocks. <b>Litters</b> used in search and rescue often can be disassembled for easier carrying. Some <b>litters</b> can be mounted on a wheel.|$|R
40|$|Using {{vignette}} experiments, {{this thesis}} examines individuals’ decision-making in various social dilemmas. A {{case study of}} <b>littering</b> behavior amongst university students in Lao People's Democratic Republic is used to investigate whether individual preferences are stable across <b>littering</b> dilemmas and other social dilemmas. This study further investigates if a visual prompt can encourage prosocial behavior in <b>littering</b> situations. The results show that behavior in social dilemmas is dependent on individual preferences. Additionally, the study finds little evidence that visual prompts {{could be used in}} order to efficiently decrease <b>littering</b> in Laos. However, a negative relationship is found between <b>littering</b> behavior and knowledge regarding the consequences of <b>littering.</b> These findings indicate that policy makers could use knowledge increasing campaigns in order to increase prosocial decision making regarding <b>littering.</b> Yet, further studies are needed in order to validate the results. Lastly, we also find differences in what influence <b>littering</b> behavior, depending on the item being <b>littered...</b>|$|R
5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf <b>litter,</b> depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf <b>litter</b> in a region. The leaf <b>litter</b> is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of the leaf <b>litter.</b> Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between environmental participation and <b>littering.</b> Previous empirical work {{in the area of}} <b>littering</b> is scarce as is evidence regarding the determinants of <b>littering</b> behavior. We address these deficiencies, demonstrating a strong empirical link between environmental participation and reduced public <b>littering</b> using European Values Survey (EVS) data for 30 Western and Eastern European countries. The results suggest that membership in environmental organizations strengthens commitment to anti-littering behaviour, thereby supporting improved environmental quality. <b>littering,</b> environmental participation, environmental preferences, environmental outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Analyses of {{recorded}} {{data showed that}} fewer young were born in second <b>litters</b> than in first <b>litters</b> of JU/Fa mice and that {{the reduction in the}} size of the second <b>litters</b> occurred only when lactation was concurrent with gestation.

5|$|The {{gestation}} period for cats is between 64 and 67 days, {{with an average}} of 66 days. The size of a <b>litter</b> usually is three to five kittens, with the first <b>litter</b> usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks old, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males), although this can vary depending on breed. Females can have two to three litters per year, so may produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprophytic}} fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients from}} forest <b>litter</b> and decomposing wood, causing a brown rot {{on the wood}} upon which it grows. A Finnish field study on tree stumps in a forest near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between voluntary participation in environmental organisations and the justifiability of <b>littering</b> behaviour. Previous empirical work regarding determinants of <b>littering</b> and <b>littering</b> behaviour remains scarce, particularly in socio-economic analysis. We address these deficiencies, demonstrating a strong empirical link between environmental participation and reduced public <b>littering</b> in the European Values Survey (EVS) data for 30 Western and Eastern European countries. The results suggest that membership in environmental organisations is related to a stronger commitment to anti-littering behaviour, thereby supporting improved environmental quality...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol (ethanol) {{is among}} some of the {{potentially}} harmful factors that are transmitted directly to the embryo. The present study was aimed to find out the changes in the tissue lipid peroxidation level and organ weight in the <b>litters</b> exposed to prenatal alcohol consumption. Adult female wistar rats (n = 6 /group) were divided into control group (saline treated) and experimental group (ethanol treated 2 g/kg BW). Changes in the body weight, number of <b>litters</b> delivered, birth weight of the <b>litters,</b> organ weight and lipid peroxidation level was evaluated in both the groups. Ethanol intoxication produced a significant increase (P< 0. 0001) in the body weight. The birth weight of the <b>litters</b> (P< 0. 0001) and the number of <b>litters</b> (P< 0. 0001) were significantly (P< 0. 0001) reduced when compared to the saline treated control group. There was {{a significant increase in the}} weight of the liver, brain and the testis in the treated group <b>litters.</b> Also in these <b>litters,</b> a significant elevation in the lipid peroxidation level was observed in the liver, brain, kidneys and testis. The present data suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure might activate the free radical process leading the increase in the lipid peroxidation level and consequent decrease in the organ weight in these <b>litters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cross-fostering {{has been}} {{attempted}} opportunistically with endangered canids {{as a means}} of increasing populations. Due to the usefulness of cross-fostering for conservation, an understanding of factors influencing success rates is essential. Using captive coyotes (Canis latrans) as a model, we assessed the willingness of adult pairs to foster young born to other parents. We assessed the efficacy of fostering pups into existing <b>litters</b> (augmentation) and completely switching <b>litters</b> (replacement). We augmented four <b>litters</b> with two pups of similar age when pups were 3 ̆c 7 days old. In 3 ̆eaddition, we replaced four entire <b>litters</b> when pups were 3 ̆c 10 days old. We also augmented <b>litters</b> with pups 3 ̆e 3 – 4 and 6 – 7 weeks of age. Survival, weight gain, and dominance status of pups were monitored for six weeks and compared to four control <b>litters</b> to determine success [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a <b>litter</b> may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} a <b>litter</b> of four capybara young on average, but may produce {{between one and}} eight in a single <b>litter.</b> Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{characteristics of}} the <b>littering</b> of cigarette butts are investigated, in the campus of University of Fukui and several other public places. It {{was found that the}} distribution of the number of butts <b>littered</b> at one spot follows a power law, cn(x) ~x-a where cn(x) is the number of spots in which more than or equal to x butts are found. We developed a simple model for the <b>littering</b> behavior {{on the basis of a}} well-known principle, “littering attracts littering”. According to our model, the power exponent of cn(x) is equal to, α= 1 /pƒ, where pƒ is defined as the followers rate, the probability that a person <b>litters</b> to spot that already has butts rather than creating a new <b>littering</b> spot. The followers rate determined from the power law found in the <b>littering</b> data, pƒ= 1 /α agrees reasonably well with the attitude survey results of a questionnaire conducted for the students...|$|R
50|$|Reproduction {{is closely}} linked to local {{rainfall}} pattern, and many brown bandicoots breed all year around, giving birth to up to four <b>litters</b> a year. Gestation lasts less than fifteen days, and perhaps as few as twelve, and typically results in the birth {{of two or three}} young, although <b>litters</b> of up to five have been reported; larger mothers tend to give birth to larger <b>litters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Singing voles breed from May to September, {{and each}} female can {{give birth to}} up to three <b>litters</b> in a {{breeding}} season. Gestation lasts 21 days, and typically results in the birth of eight young, although <b>litters</b> of between 6 and 14 young have been reported. Since, like other voles, the female has only eight teats, <b>litters</b> of more than eight young are unlikely to survive.|$|R

40|$|In mice, parity and {{previous}} experience with pups may influence a mother's behavior towards her pups, thus possibly causing postnatal maternal {{effects on the}} subsequent development of the pups. The present experiment addressed the question whether parity also might have prenatal effects. We studied 622 pups from second or third <b>litters</b> that originated from 25 genetically different populations and had been fostered to random-bred lactating females. Development of responses was significantly delayed in mice from third <b>litters,</b> when compared to pups from second <b>litters</b> in 3 out of 5 sensorial and 4 out of 8 motor tests. In addition, pups from second <b>litters</b> initially were slightly heavier than those from third <b>litters.</b> This difference in body weight disappeared after the 10 th day postnatally.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss <b>Litter</b> Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as <b>litter</b> for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E
