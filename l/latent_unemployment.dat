40|$|Most {{transition}} economies {{have gone}} through severe changes in the labour market during the 1990 s. Under the previous socialist regime, unemployment was virtually non-existent due to the pronounced job security, which was also accompanied by low labour mobility. Studies indicate {{that one of the}} cornerstones of previous system was flourishing <b>latent</b> <b>unemployment.</b> The transition to the market economy was therefore connected with the process of revealing <b>latent</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Not unlike other transitional economies, the first phase of transition in Croatia was marked by strong decrease in the rate of employment and simultaneously rising rate of unemployment, as labour market agents were more influenced by market-oriented philosophy. The policies designed to reduce the unemployment in Croatia so far have been concentrated on the overall number in the country. However, the available data indicates that some regions have persistently higher registered number of unemployed persons throughout the whole periods. The paper investigates whether there are differences in the regional development of unemployment between Croatian regions or whether the national demand and supply conditions predominate region-specific determinants. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent 10 years, {{our country}} has {{achieved}} large economic development. The industrial structure changed, and the heavy industry and chemical industry developed, so that the national income has increased rapidly. In {{the face of such}} industrial change, the quality of labor which the firms demand has also changed from physical to mental labor, then the industrial education has become important. The coal-mining industry and textile industry {{will not be able to}} expect the high rate of growth, the physical laborer and female laborer will suffer to find the opportunity to be employed. In such situation, the unbalance of development between district will increase. How to increase the rate of growth in under-developed districts, and remove <b>latent</b> <b>unemployment?</b> To answer this question, we visit Yamagata, Tottori, and Minami-kinki districts at 1959. In Yamagata, the prefectual authorities said as follows, "the employment-opportunity is comparatively rare, then the many laborers has been employed to higher-developed area, e. g. Keihin district. The agricultual production will not increase so large, then the special industry should be developed to increase the employment. " In Tottori district, prefectual authorities say that this district has scarce mineral resources, and the means of transportation has not developed, this is the cause of industrial under-development of this district. In Minami-kinki district, the government has planned to develop this area by disafforestation. Observing these districts, we conclude about economic development as follows, -First, these district are to be developed by manufacturing industry in the long run, but this will be achieved after the hisher-developed area has been saturated economically. In transitory period, the wage-difference between districts will be increased, but this phenomena will disappear in the long run. Second, the industrial-education is very important. The industrial and commercial high school should be increased. On the other hand, the agricultural high school should be decreased. This essay is written to show these opinion in the light of statistical data...|$|E
40|$|There exist many {{indicators}} for corporatism. Using a latent variables approach, we extract common aspects in 29 corporatism indicators {{which have been}} suggested in the literature and find two factors that can be identified as the degree of coordination between employers and trade unions, and the organizational power of labour. Using these factors in the model of Hall and Franzese (1998) employing data for 16 OECD countries, {{we find that the}} organizational power of trade unions does not affect inflation. Likewise, the interaction between central bank independence and coordination does not affect <b>unemployment.</b> corporatism, <b>latent</b> variables, <b>unemployment,</b> inflation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of meaningful leisure activity in reducing <b>latent</b> deprivation during <b>unemployment.</b> Samples of unemployed (N= 201) and employed (N= 128) participants were asked to rate their levels of latent deprivation using the Access to Categories of Experience Scale. They were also asked to complete the Profile of Mood States depression subscale, Adult Self-Perception Profile, Meaningful Leisure Activities Questionnaire, and to rate the frequency with which they engaged in social and solitary leisure activities. Results indicate that unemployed participants engaged in social leisure activities less frequently than employed participants and solitary leisure activities more frequently; and they reported higher perceived latent deprivation, higher depressive affect and lower self-esteem. Overall, these findings suggest that participation in leisure activities that are meaningful, rather than simply frequent, may be a constructive and readily achievable coping response during unemployment. <br /...|$|R
3000|$|... 12 The Family {{expenditure}} data we {{have access}} to contains hours of work, and for those with zero hours of work, {{whether or not they}} are unemployed (i.e. seeking work). We model hours of work as a choice between four discrete alternatives: non-participation, low hours part-time, high hours part-time and full time work. For those who are not unemployed, we assume that they are observed in their most preferred labour market state. For those with zero hours who are unemployed, we assume they reveal themselves to not be in their most preferred labour market state. Note that we are not introducing a new discrete alternative. We use the information on unemployment to distinguish among the preference orderings of those working zero hours: that the unemployed would rather be working at the going wage rate, so zero hours is not the most preferred labour market state for the unemployed. In doing this we follow Blundell et al. (1987) and others who use this information to discriminate between non-participation and unemployment. This is important because women who are unemployed are not observed to be in their most preferred state, and must be classified appropriately in a choice model. For the purposes of labour supply modeling this group is assumed to reveal, by stating that they are searching for work, that some positive hours state is preferred to zero. Furthermore, individuals observed in any positive hours labour market state are assumed to prefer their observed state to all alternatives and are not rationed in exercising this preference. They are distinguished by the following reduced form <b>latent</b> and observed <b>unemployment</b> rationing equations [...]...|$|R
