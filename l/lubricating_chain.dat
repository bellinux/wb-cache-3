5000|$|The single chainline {{allows for}} a full chain {{enclosure}} chain guard, so the chain can be protected from water and grit, and clothing can be protected from contact with the <b>lubricated</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{chains are}} part of the drive train to {{transmit}} the motor power to the back wheel. Properly <b>lubricated</b> <b>chains</b> can reach an efficiency of 98% or greater in the transmission. Unlubricated chains will significantly decrease performance and increase chain and sprocket wear.|$|R
50|$|Shaft drives {{operate at}} a very {{consistent}} rate of efficiency and performance, without adjustments or maintenance, though {{lower than that of}} a properly adjusted and <b>lubricated</b> <b>chain.</b> Shaft drives are typically more complex to disassemble when repairing flat rear tires, and the manufacturing cost is typically higher.|$|R

5000|$|In 1859, {{at the age}} of 23, John Marston's {{apprenticeship}} was competed and {{he bought}} Daniel Smith Lester's japanning business at Bilston which had amalgamated with Fred Walton & Company and Thurston and Company and established his own business John Marston Limited, producing japanned tin goods. He did so well that when Perry died in 1871 Marston took over the business and merged it with his own.John Marston began making bicycles in 1877 with the trademark Sunbeam suggested by his wife. The factory was renamed Sunbeamland and Marston based his production on high build quality, with enclosure <b>lubricated</b> <b>chains,</b> which until 1936 became the best cycles on the market. [...] The top model was the 'Golden' with alloy wheel-rims, epicyclic two- and three-speed gears and real gold-leaf pin-striping. The 'Royal' was of the same quality but had red lining and simpler equipment. These and other models were made at 'Sunbeamland', Pool Street, Wolverhampton until 1937 and subsequently, to the same designs, by AMC and BSA until 1957.|$|R
50|$|From a {{mechanical}} viewpoint, up to 99% {{of the energy}} delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels (clean, <b>lubricated</b> new <b>chain</b> at 400W), although the use of gearing mechanisms reduces this by 1-7% (clean, well-lubricated derailleurs), 4-12% (chain with 3-speed hubs), or 10-20% (shaft drive with 3-speed hubs). The higher efficiencies in each range are achieved at higher power levels and in direct drive (hub gears) or with large driven cogs (derailleurs).|$|R
5000|$|How best to <b>lubricate</b> {{a bicycle}} <b>chain</b> is a {{commonly}} debated question among cyclists. Liquid lubricants penetrate {{to the inside}} of the links and are not easily displaced, but quickly attract dirt. [...] "Dry" [...] lubricants, often containing wax or Teflon, are transported by an evaporating solvent, and stay cleaner in use. The cardinal rule for long chain life is never to <b>lubricate</b> a dirty <b>chain,</b> as this washes abrasive particles into the rollers. Chains should be cleaned before lubrication. The chain should be wiped dry after the lubricant has had enough time to penetrate the links. An alternative approach is to change the (relatively cheap) chain very frequently; then proper care is less important. Some utility bicycles have fully enclosing chain guards, which virtually eliminate chain wear and maintenance. On recumbent bicycles the chain is often run through tubes to prevent it from picking up dirt, and to keep the cyclist's leg free from oil and dirt.|$|R
40|$|Portable {{chainsaw}} {{is a basic}} {{operational instrument}} in forestry. To ensure long-lasting performance of a chainsaw, {{it is necessary to}} perform the necessary maintenance of its cutting system. The basis of this maintenance lies in the lubrication of the chain, which protects it from excessive wearing and deterioration. Various lubricating oils are used for <b>lubricating</b> the <b>chain.</b> Biodegradable oils are promoted nowadays, with their main advantage being shorter decomposition time in the environment, and the same lubricating properties as conventional lubricants. This paper is aimed to evaluate and compare the ability to lubricate and cool the cutting system of a portable chainsaw filled with biodegradable oil and oils commonly used for its operation. Conditions of measurements were specified to simulate the actual operating conditions. During the evaluation no major differences between these oils were observed...|$|R
50|$|A gear case, {{also known}} as a chain case or chainguard, is an {{enclosure}} for the bicycle chain and sprocket assemblages commonly employed by utility bicycles. It serves to protect the cyclist from being soiled or trapped in the chain rings and tends to fully enclose the drive train. It may also contain an oil bath to keep the <b>chain</b> <b>lubricated.</b> Modern examples are usually moulded in plastic. Similar devices may be found in connection with chains used on larger vehicles and machinery.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} motorbike's chain transmission, {{focusing on}} chain lubrication {{and its effect}} on the temperature, efficiency and vibrations of the transmission. Purpose of the paper is to compare transmission's performances under three different lubrication conditions: (i) <b>chain</b> not <b>lubricated</b> at all, (ii) <b>chain</b> <b>lubricated</b> with a spray PTFE addicted lube, and (ii) <b>chain</b> <b>lubricated</b> with a mineral oil at every minute of the test. An experimental campaign has been performed running a chain under the three above lube conditions at different speeds with the purposes of: (A) measuring the effect that each lube conditions has on temperature, on vibrations and on the efficiency of the transmission, and (B) identify the best conditions for practical use. A test rig has been designed and manufactured for the purpose, and temperature, transmission's efficiency and vibrations have been recorded during the tests by using a thermocamera, a dynamometer and an accelerometer respectively. Results showed that a proper lubrication is desirable. Additionally using a continuous lubrication with a mineral oil lubricant leads to better transmission compared {{to the use of the}} spray PTFE from the efficiency and thermal points of view. This work presents an experimental investigation on the effect of two different kind of lubrication form motorbike chain on transmission’s efficiency. The findings are still valid for different applications of chain transmission in dirty environments. Novelty of the paper is following highlighted: 1. this is the first work scientifically facing the important topic of lubrication of chain in dirty environments, particularly of motorbike chain; 2. a complete analysis of thermal and mechanical effect due to presence of lubricant has never been shown; 3. different kind of lubricant have been used and their effect has been separately highlighted...|$|R
5000|$|When winter biking, some cyclists {{regularly}} <b>lubricate</b> the <b>chain</b> {{with a wet}} lubricant. An Ottawa winter biking website {{states that}} lubricant [...] "...may have to be reapplied daily in slush conditions", due {{to the presence of}} water and road salt on streets. The OBLP states that winter cyclists use a [...] "thickish lube" [...] on their chain and derailleurs. An Ottawa bike website states that there is a downside to using oil lubricants: [...] "oil lubes are a quick and dirty way to keep your bicycle running in winter, because oil doesn’t freeze and it does displace water - thus preventing freezing. However, oil collects a lot of dirt and debris - wearing your bicycle’s components faster." [...] The city of Toronto states that some winter cyclists oil the freewheel and put [...] "...a drop of oil {{at the end of each}} wheel spoke" [...] to reduce rusting. A Torontoist article states that winter cyclists [...] "wipe down their bike riding, paying special attention to the brakes, which can corrode easily. And then clean and lubricate the chain" [...] with a wet, oil-based lubricant. The OBLP states that some winter cyclists wash off their bike, to get grime and salt off the components. Some car washes and indoor parking garages have high-pressure hoses that can be used.|$|R
50|$|Sunbeam Cycles {{was founded}} by John Marston, {{who was born in}} Ludlow, Shropshire, UK in 1836 of a minor landowning family.

He did so well that when Perry died in 1871 Marston bought Perry's business and amalgamated it with his own.In 1887 Marston began making bicycles and, on the suggestion of his wife Ellen, he adopted the trademark brand Sunbeam; their Paul Street works were named Sunbeamland.John Marston was a perfectionist, and this was reflected in the high build-quality of the Sunbeam bicycle, which had an enclosure around the drive chain in which an oil bath kept the <b>chain</b> <b>lubricated</b> and clean. Sunbeam bicycles were made until 1936.|$|R
40|$|Elastohydrodynamically {{lubricated}} (EHL) contacts {{are fundamental}} for severalrotating machine elements. For example gears, rolling element bearingsand <b>lubricated</b> <b>chain</b> drives work {{due to the}} principle of EHL. All of these machineelements require maintenance and, as condition based maintenance hasincreased in industry, the need for monitoring techniques has also increased. Inorder to avoid incorrect condition indications, since the 60 ’s researchers haveimproved signal processing of existing monitoring tools and developed newtechniques as a complement to these existing tools. In the past two decadesacoustic emission has been identified as a new complementary tool for monitoringof rolling element bearings and investigated intensively by several researchgroups. However, most of the investigations were carried out at lowrotational speeds. Furthermore, most of the investigations used simple signalprocessing methods like activation counts (AC) or trend analysis of the rootmean square signal (RMS). One reason for using simple experimental conditionsand signal processing methods is the complexity of a rolling elementbearing itself. A rolling element bearing consists of several EHL contacts andeach contact has different operational conditions (film thickness, slide to rollratio, contact pressure, entrainment speed). The measured signal is the summationof all EHL contacts. This complexity is one reason why the high frequencyemissions of an EHL contact are still not fully understood. Therefore, an investigationof the acoustic emission of a single EHL contact was here carriedout within the framework of a PhD project. In this thesis simplified experiments were used to represent either a single EHLcontact or elements of an EHL contact. Both acoustic emissions of tensile testsand ball impacts on a solid plate were studied and analyzed with respect totheir significance for EHL contacts. For all investigations carried out in thisthesis an absolute calibration method developed by McLaskey and Glaser wasused. This calibration method was validated for boundary restricted systems,where a good agreement for zero frequencies was found, however, unsatisfying agreement was discovered for resonances of a boundary restricted system. Theinvestigation found elastic waves in boundary restricted systems consist of twofundamental types. Zero frequencies will be enhanced for cases were excitationsource and elastic wave are independent, while an interaction of sourceand elastic wave results in a pure resonance problem. Furthermore, the time dependency of acoustic emission signals was investigated. As mentioned previously most existing investigations are carried outat low and constant rotational speed. The dependency of acoustic emissionsignals and speed is reported in literature as well as difficulties with acousticemission measurements at elevated rotational speeds. By using ball impactswith different ball sizes and tensile tests with different displacement speeds thetime dependency was analyzed with respect to excitation time (contact time ofball impact) and event frequency (amount of dislocation movement and planeslip movements in a certain time frame). Thereby an indirect quadratic proportionalitybetween acoustic emission amplitude and contact time was found. This proportional relationship is also valid for RMS signals with short averagingwindows if system damping is low. For event frequency and RMS signalsthe results of the tensile tests suggest a direct proportional relationship. Furthermore, Hertzian and EHL contact impacts were studied and compared. Thereby it was observed that the overall amplitude of the signal increases forEHL contacts in comparison to Hertzian contacts. In addition the third zerofrequency disappears, which is most likely due to cavitation effects. Furthermore,the results show a shift of the first and second zero frequency towardshigher frequencies, which is caused by the localised deformation of EHL contactsas a result of the solidification of the lubricant. This behaviour of zerofrequencies was in line with simulation results. However, the agreement betweensimulation and measurement for the location of zero frequencies and thesignal amplitude was not satisfying. This mismatch was most likely caused bythe assumption of the global contact force acting at a single point, causing aperfect elastic deformation in the simulation. Additionally, for the findings regardingzero frequencies, a change in the excitation of resonances above thefirst zero frequency in boundary restricted systems was also found, comparingHertzian and EHL impacts. Finally, full scale tests on a complete rolling element bearing were carried outduring the PhD project to validate findings of the single contact experiments. Magnetite contaminated rolling element bearings and their acoustic emissionsignals were investigated with respect to the use of sulfur additives, contaminationand rotational speed. These tests were executed at varying speed forsingle measurements and constant speed for continuous measurement recording. The results of the full scale tests showed good agreement with previousresults of the component tests, such as bouncing ball and tensile tests. Transientforces are the main source of signals for well lubricated rolling elementbearings or bearings at high rotational speed, while acoustic emission signalsof contaminated bearings at low rotational speed were dominated by plasticdeformation signals. Furthermore, it was found that sulfur additives reducethe plastic deformation signal by up to 70 % in comparison to contaminatedbearings lubricated with plain grease...|$|R
