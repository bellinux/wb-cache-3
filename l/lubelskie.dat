5|$|Sienkiewicz {{was born}} on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, now a village in {{the central part of}} eastern Polish region of <b>Lubelskie,</b> then part of the Russian Empire. His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side {{deriving}} from Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz (1813–96) and Stefania, née Cieciszowska (1820–73). He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during January Uprising), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish Oszyk coat of arms. Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in Grabowce Górne, Wężyczyn and Burzec. In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw, where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house (kamienica) in eastern Warsaw's Praga district. He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{official}} mass-media did not inform about the strikes, events of Lublin became {{known in the}} area. Soon afterwards, strikes began in such towns, as Chełm, Kraśnik, Lubartów, Opole <b>Lubelskie,</b> Puławy, Tomaszów Lubelski, Zamość and in the crucial rail junction of Dęblin. [...] The strikes of the Lublin and Dęblin junctions paralyzed rail links between the Soviet Union and the Red Army garrisons in the German Democratic Republic. The direct reason for railway workers protesting was terrible working conditions. 'We repaired wagons in canals, completely smeared with mud', one of them recollected.|$|E
