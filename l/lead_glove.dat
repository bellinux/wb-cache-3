40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to directly measure the radiation exposure to the orthopaedic surgeon and to measure dose points to the surgeon’s fingers, thyroid gland, and forehead during intraoperative fluoroscopy in periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). In a series of 23 consecutive periacetabular osteotomy procedures, exposure monitoring was carried out using thermo luminescent dosimeters. The effective dose received by the operating surgeon was 0. 008  mSv per operation which adds up to a yearly dose of 0. 64  mSv from PAO. The median point equivalent dose (mSv) exposure under PAO was 0. 009 for the forehead and thyroid gland, 0. 045 for the right index finger, and 0. 039 for the left index finger. The effective estimated yearly dose received by the operating surgeon was very low.

40|$|A {{group of}} radiologists were studied for evidences of {{radiation}} {{damage to the}} skin of their hands. The technics used {{were the same as}} those used for routine hand studies of Argonne National Laboratory personnel and consist of examination of wax impressions of the finger ridges and examination of photographs of the vessels and Papillae in the nail fold. Of the 323 radiologists examined by the first method 48 % were found to have ridge abnormalities. The incidence of abnormality increased with years of exposure to radiation up to 100 % after 35 years. The irregular use of <b>lead</b> <b>gloves</b> does not give adequate protection against damage of the ridges by radiations. Photographs of the nail fold of 152 radiologists were studied and compared to similar photographs of 101 laboratory workers and of 41 persons over 63 years of age. Some of the abnormalities occurred in all 3 groups. All of the changes which were found among the radiologists were found also in the aged. The incidence of abnormality among the radiologists increased with years of exposure to radiation and exceeded the incidence of abnormality in the aged. No radiologist had normal findings after 30 years of exposure. It is concluded that abnormalities of the vessels and of the papillae in the nail fold are induced earlier in radiologists than in persons not exposed to radiation...|$|R

40|$|AIM: Investigation of {{the risks}} of {{radiation}} exposure among an interventionalist, assistant and sonographer during installation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) by assessment of the fractional dose in comparison to dose threshold values. Moreover, an evaluation of additional measures towards radiation shielding protection was undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 30 TIPS, the surface doses were measured using thermoluminescence detectors (TLD) which were attached to the eyebrows, {{both sides of the}} thyroids, backs of the hands, lower legs over the tibia, the breast, umbilicus and symphysis. The values measured were considered to represent a conservative estimation for organs beneath these sites. During the first 15 interventionists, the interventionalist, assistant and sonographer wore only a lead apron, whereas in the next 15 interventionists, they wore a thyroid protecting shield as well. Furthermore, a lead glass plate was positioned between the interventionist and the video amplifier, a protection of {{the lower part of the}} body was placed between the sonographer and the X-ray tube, and the sonographer wore a <b>lead</b> protecting <b>glove</b> on the hand used to hold the accustic header. RESULTS: The highest surface dose without any additional protection was measured among the intervestionalist, the assistant and the sonographer standing to the right of the patient, on the left tibia. The partial body dose of the red bone marrow  considered upon simplification to be represented by the surface dose of the tibia  allowed a dose threshold value compliance of a maximum of 12, 18, 62, that is, 32 TIPS interventions per year. For the interventions with permanent protection, thyroid protection, <b>lead</b> protecting <b>gloves</b> and lower body protection, the highest surface dose for the interventionalist and assistant was measured in the right tibia, and for the sonographer in the left hand. The partial body dose, considered upon simplification to be represented by the surface dose of the tibia, allowed the interventionalist a maximum of 15, and the assistant a maximum of 21 TIPS per year. The sonographer, when standing to the left could have carried out more than 750 TIPS, and when standing to the right, 312 TIPS. By use of the additional protective measures, the stochastic risk of radiation was reduced by 35 % for the interventionalist, 41 % for the assistant, and 65 % for the sonographer. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the lower body had a decisive effect on the compliance of dose threshold values, because without protection of the lower body, tibia bone marrow is subject to a high dose...|$|R
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of x-rays by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in 1895 first reports of detrimental side effects, i. e. death, on living organisms were reported. Ever since {{the reduction of the}} exposure to ionizing radiation has been a topic of discussion in human as well as in veterinary medicine. It is still an up to date topic. The aim of the research is to clarify the exposure to ionizing radiation in veterinary staff during routine x-ray examinations of horses at the “Klinik für Pferde, Allgemeine Chirurgie und Radiologie der Freien Universität Berlin” and at other equine practices. The radiation exposure was measured by using electronic personal dosimeters (EPD). The goal was to create a representative job-exposure-matrix for equine practitioners for each type of x-ray examination, as well as a guideline for working with x-rays. Electronic personal dosimeters were used in 2429 x-ray examinations to determinate the exposure of the staff in 27554 single dosage readings. Dosage readings were taken on all persons who were exposed to radiation (“x-ray shooter”, “cassette holder”, “groom”) at the “Klinik für Pferde der FU Berlin” and at three other equine hospitals. The personal-equivalent-dose [μSv] was measured in 10 mm (Hp(10)) tissue depth. Dosimeters were attached over the thyroid gland, gonads (before the lead apron), gonads (behind the lead apron) and the feet. The personal-equivalent-dose [μSv] in a tissue depth of 0, 07 mm (Hp(0, 07)) was measured on the hands of the cassette holder or on mechanical cassette holders and on the <b>lead</b> <b>gloves.</b> Results show that the exposure to radiation at the torso of staff of the “Klinik für Pferde der FU Berlin” {{as well as the other}} clinics while x-raying the equine distal limb is low (median lies below 2 μSv). Highest doses are expected at the feet of all exposed persons. An exposure of 86 μSv was detected at the feet of the “cassette holder” during x-ray examinations of the equine distal limb. Higher dosage-counts on all persons are expected while x-raying larger volumina such as shoulder, neck, back, thorax and pelvis. The doses varied with the geometric arrangement of the persons to the primary x-ray field and the source of scatter radiation. Dosimeters placed by the thyroid gland and the gonads on the “groom” and the “x-ray shooter” showed that the persons nearest to the different radiation sources had the highest exposure to radiation during examination. While taking radiographs of larger volumina, the scatter radiation is partially absorbed by surrounding tissue so that the “cassette holder”, who mostly stands caudally of the x-rayed region, is lower than assumed. The hands of the “cassette holder” are close to the primary x-ray field during x-ray examinations of the equine distal limb, head, and torso, so that the highest dosage readings should be expected here. Exceeding the annual dosage-borderlines through persons professionally exposed to radiation (category A (RöV 2003)) is unlikely. For low-dose measurement results the careful handling of ionizing radiation according to the “Strahlenschutz in der Tierheilkunde” guidelines (2005) is required. This study is able to show that veterinary staff is exposed to radiation during x-ray examinations. This exposure, even if very low, can lead to stochastic health effects of radiation in the human body. Rising dosages make stochastic health effects of radiation more likely. Applying the standards of precaution while dealing with radiation according to the RöV (2005) and the “Strahlenschutz in der Tierheilkunde” guideline (2005) no negative effects on health should occur in veterinary practice. The evaluation of using EPD´s to measure radiation exposure in equine practice is positive. EPD´s can be worn at the torso without hindering movement. Dose readings can be viewed immediately and linked to a certain x-ray examination. Daily, weekly and monthly dosage readings are possible. The results are in an electronic, non-changeable form. Results are comparable to those of TLD´s...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the x-ray by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen has lead in following years {{to the growth of}} the meaning and using of the x-ray for the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in human and veterinary medicine. The application of the x-ray can be for both human and all life organisms, dangerous as we are unable to detect it through sensation. Obtained by the positioning and fixing of the animals, the problem of radiation exposure has been one hard to combat. Yet, protection of these persons from this exposure can be accomplished with the use of aprons, lead clothes and the dosimeter. In this study the radiation exposure was measured with the aid of active and passive dosimeters, whilst x-rays of two dogs cadavers were being obtained. Also measured, was the exposure of the x-rays to the human during the obtaining of radiographs for the dogs, cats, birds and other pets at the Clinic for small animals, Free University Berlin, Germany and at one private practice in Germany. The single doses were obtained on the lead cloths. The doses obtained by the bias of thermolumineszensdosimeter during the exposure of the cadavers to the conventional x-ray reached up to 50 μSv on the forehead (projection abdomen v/d) and up to 90 μSv by the hand (projection thorax d/v). These findings support the general recommendations {{with the use of the}} necessary means of protection with lead aprons, lead thyroid collars, and <b>lead</b> <b>gloves.</b> At the Clinic for small animals, Free University Berlin, the measurements of the radiation exposure by the Mk 2 active dosimeter, obtained from the diagnostic radiographs of the dogs and cats, used conventional x-ray, resulting in the exposure of the person up to 15 μSv and 25 μSv per radiograph at the torso and by the hand respectively. However, there were a considerable number of excluded doses most of all by the heavier dogs based on the exceedance of the limit of the dose rate linearity (> 1 Sv/Stunde). The reason of these excess´ was mostly due to very short exposure time by this x-ray machine. Compared to these results, the exposure of the person measured within aim of the Mk 2 dosimeter by obtaining of the diagnostic radiographs by use of a digital x-ray machine in one private practice reached up to 10 μSv on the torso as well as by the hands. By this machine, there was no exceedens of the limit of the dose rate linearity (> 1 Sv/Stunde). The measurements of the radiation exposure of the person by obtaining the diagnostic radiographs found the head and extremities of the dogs and cats resulted generally for both in low doses. Occasionally there was the exposure over five μSv per radiograph. These occurred by obtaining of radiograph of the scapula or shoulder. The radiation exposure by diagnostic x-ray of the birds and exotic pets was generally lower. The torso of the person recieved exposure seldom over one μSv per radiograph. According to the very low distance from the origin of the scattered radiation by x-ray of these smaller animals, the exposure of the hands was higher, but normally didn’t overrun five μSv per radiograph. A limitation of the routinely use of the active dosimeter (dosimeter Mk 2 und Comet) for the monitoring of radiation exposure on the person in the small animal veterinary practice, is the relatively low limit of the dose rate linearity of the radiation. This is especially by obtaining of the X-ray of bigger animals by the conventional X-ray machine and by very short exposure time (for instance by high power – X-ray machine by obtaining of Radiograph oft the chest) During the study, there was no exposure to persons without lead clothing, pregnant women, or any person under 18 year of age. The use of the lead glows, the thyroid collar and lead glasses was noted rare. In both organisations, there was preference to the obtaining of two perpendicular projections by examination of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (66, 6 and 89, 2 %). In case of extremities, two perpendicular projections were preferred at the Clinic for small animals, Free University Berlin (63, 9 %). The x-rays in 5, 3 and 8, 1 % were retaken. In the private practice though, where the digital x-ray was used, there was no repetition due to the wrong setting of the machine. By patients under anaesthesia, the x-rays were more frequently retaken in case of poor quality of the radiographs caused by inadequate recumbancy and motion of the animal...|$|R
40|$|Applicants for the {{examination}} {{in becoming a}} pain physician specialist have little interest in radiation safety [1]. Since the C-arm fluoroscope is considered an essential piece of equipment for pain physicians, who are focused on nerve blocks, stricter education and requirement standards are required for pain experts. For the reduction of irradiation exposure to the operator, {{the position of the}} beam generator is important [2]. Pulsed and low-dose modes can reduce the dose of radiation that is absorbed, when compared to the conventional mode [3]. It is suggested that the annual exposure allowance limit is 50 mSv/year, which is for the entire body. However, over 155 cases of percutaneous vertebral kyphoplasty may prescribe a situation where the amount of radiation received by the body of the operator exceeds the annual exposure amount [2]. Moreover, interventional pain physicians may perform more blocks than the number mentioned above, so they should be acquainted with the imaging intensifiers that are used in normal clinical practice. The physicians should also understand the importance of being aware of the dangers of radiation and the methods for radiation safety. Providing education for pain physicians is the most important way to reduce irradiation exposure [1 - 3], but the preparation that is required for the equipment at each of the interventional facilities cannot be disregarded at the same time. The use of the thyroid protector and apron are similar, regardless of radiation safety education, but the use of <b>lead</b> glass and <b>gloves</b> are infrequent, even in educated groups [1]. Protective equipment, procedures and regulations should be prepared and available in all C-arm using facilities, which would serve to prevent and reduce the irradiation exposure that is experienced by pain physicians...|$|R
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Complexes perform {{numerous}} {{hazardous material}} handling operations {{within the confines}} of a glovebox. The DOE is continuing to seek more efficient and safer means of handling these materials inside gloveboxes rather than the conventional, labor-intensive method through <b>lead</b> lined <b>gloves.</b> The use of glovebox automation technology will also be critical to the DOE in its efforts to comply with its mandated ALARA principles in handling the hazardous materials associated with the cleanup process. Operations associated with materials processing in a glovebox are similar to many industrial tasks, but the unique glovebox environment and Plutonium material properties create a unique set of challenges for conventional automation machinery. Such properties include: Low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation, high abrasiveness, corrosiveness, pyrophoric tendencies, rapid dispersal and permeation of environment, diffuses quickly, and possible incompatible material interaction. The glovebox presents the following challenges: existing gloveboxes may not be readily altered or even modified at all, complex mechanical operations for maintenance and repair are difficult or impossible through gloves, failed equipment may not be removed easily or at all. If a broken piece of equipment cannot be bagged-out through a glove port (approximately 216 mm (8 1 / 2 inch) diameter) it must remain in place. Broken equipment obstructs further operations. If it renders the entire glovebox unusable, a significant volume of waste is generated and an expensive system must be disposed of and replaced. A moderate sized glovebox alone costs between $ 250, 000 and $ 500, 000 and an equipment malfunction, which penetrates the glovebox and exposes the room to Plutonium or other toxic materials, is catastrophic. In addition to the human exposure issues, cleanup can easily run into the millions of dollars. A solution to the issues described above is ARM Automation Inc. 's (ARM) modular robotic manipulator technology developed for DOE EM operations, which addresses many of the issues discussed in the previous section. This manipulator system has the capability of custom configurations, which accommodate common glovebox tasks such as materials repackaging. The modular nature and quick connects of this system simplify installations into ''hot'' boxes and any potential modifications or repair therein. In the field of automation and robotics, a very common element is one used to generate motion for precise positioning of loads. One example of such an automation component would be an individual joint within an industrial robotic manipulator. This component consists of a tightly integrated package containing an electric motor, gear train, output support bearings, position sensors, brake, servo-amplifier and communications controller. Within the context of this paper, this key building block is referred to as an actuator module. With regard {{to the needs of the}} EM, [8] and [9] have shown that while each focus area has unique requirements for robotic automation at a system or manipulator level, their requirements at the actuator level are very similar. Thereby, a modular approach to automation which utilizes a small set of versatile actuator modules can be used to construct a broad range of robotic systems and automation cells suited to EM applications. By providing a pre-engineered, pre-integrated motion system to different robotics users within the DOE, new automation systems can be more quickly created without extensive expertise in motion control or the expense of building custom equipment...|$|R
