5|$|Boycott's {{abilities}} in the Test match theatre {{during his career}} of 17 years and 216 days have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of Test cricket records. He is the seventh most capped player for England in Tests, and has the sixth highest career runs total in Tests for an England player, 8114. He was the fourteenth quickest player to reach 8,000 runs, taking 190 innings.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's illness <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} stutter {{and he gave}} up {{any thoughts}} of entering the ministry at that time. In preparation for joining a relative in trade in Lisbon, he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to Aramaic, and Arabic. He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, natural philosophy, logic, and metaphysics through the works of Isaac Watts, Willem 's Gravesande, and John Locke.|$|E

50|$|Henry was a {{striking}} man. Tall, blonde and well-built, {{he had broken}} his nose as a child. The accident <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> adult face that made him look, depending on whom you listened to, like either a terrifying lion or a foolish monkey.|$|R
50|$|The {{incident}} <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unstable phenotype, that is, {{a tendency}} to temporarily switch forms when completely cornered, which causes some excitement. In Maskerade he once more took longer-term human shape, attending the Ankh-Morpork Opera {{in the guise of}} the Le Comte de Gribeau.|$|R
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|He joined South Australia part {{way through}} the 193536 season, and in March 1936, he scored a century (121) on his {{first-class}} cricket debut against Tasmania at the Adelaide Oval. This was to be his only match of the season, which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> debut season average of 121.00. At {{the start of his}} first full season, he followed this up with scores of 16 and four against the touring England team and Victoria and seven and 19 against New South Wales. On Christmas Day, 1936, however, he scored his second first-class century, 104 against Queensland in the first innings. He would go on to score 52 in the second.|$|E
5|$|Though {{this routine}} made his play {{air-tight}} in one way, it simplified opposing captains' field-placing to curb his scoring, it <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> back-foot addict's liability to go leg-before-wicket or be caught behind on either side, and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length... {{he could have}} made more runs since the war as a stroke-player, and won popular backing {{as a candidate for}} the title of world's best batsman, instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out.|$|E
50|$|He had a {{successful}} start to his six-year-old career, however, winning the Chester Cup easily against a good field. He finished second in his next race, the Gold Vase at Ascot, but his final race of the season, the Goodwood Cup, <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injury to his right foreleg.|$|R
5000|$|After the German reunification, between November 1990 and December 1997, he was {{regional}} Minister of Food, Agriculture and Forestry in Brandenburg. [...] His name hit {{the headlines}} in 1997 over the [...] "Bake-oven affair" [...] which ended his ministerial career and eventually, in 2004, <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eleven-month suspended sentence for [...] "Subsidy Fraud" [...] ("Subventionsbetrug").|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} {{fourteen}} years, {{he struggled with}} balance and coordination problems caused by the accident. He eventually regained the ability to jog and ride a bicycle without falling down. He went through six knee surgeries and total reconstruction of his right ankle and right wrist. To this day, nerve damage {{to the right side}} of his body has <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> off-kilter gait.|$|R
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E
5|$|When Britten {{was three}} months old he {{contracted}} pneumonia and nearly died. The illness <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably {{never be able to}} lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He {{was one of the last}} composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his ulna at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the Royal Engineers, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton's recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.|$|E
50|$|Varney had a {{heart attack}} in 1965, and in 1981 he {{suffered}} a more serious one. He then contracted a severe viral infection, which for three years made working difficult for him. In 1989 he suffered <b>a</b> stroke, which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> uneven heartbeat. Subsequently he divided his time between his home in a small village near Dartmouth and a villa in Malta.|$|R

25|$|By his teens, Blount {{suffered}} from cryptorchidism. It <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nearly constant discomfort that sometimes flared into severe pain. Szwed suggests that Blount felt shame {{about it and}} the condition contributed to his isolation.|$|E
25|$|At Talladega, Earnhardt started 28th and led for 31 laps. However, a {{crash on}} the back straightaway when he was turned by Greg Biffle ended his title {{contention}} chances and <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 31st-place finish.|$|E
50|$|In 1844, {{he headed}} a mission near the Red River of the North. With Father Alexandre-Antonin Taché {{he founded the}} famous mission of Île-à-la-Crosse in 1846 where he {{remained}} until 1849 when Pius IX nominated him to be bishop of Arath. However, <b>an</b> illness had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infirmity in his limb, and he asked to be withdrawn from the nomination and be replaced by Alexandre-Antonin Taché.|$|R
50|$|The Wolves {{dropped down}} a {{division}} in 1938 and after {{injury to the}} captain Frank Hodgson in the 1939 season, they announced that Case would be making a combeack to cover for the injured skipper. However, after a fall in his first ride which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injury {{to force him to}} withdraw from the meeting, although he did complete his second ride, he retired from speedway for the final time.|$|R
5000|$|He later {{made his}} first List A {{appearance}} for Buckinghamshire in the 1990 NatWest Trophy against Northamptonshire. He played three further List A matches for the county, the last coming against Leicestershire in the 1993 NatWest Trophy. [...] With the ball he took 6 wickets for Buckinghamshire in List A matches, {{at an average of}} 27.50, with best figures of 3/49. [...] This <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overall List A bowling average of 23.37.|$|R
25|$|As a {{child he}} had {{contracted}} poliomyelitis, which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pronounced limp, but he nevertheless {{went on to}} become an accomplished golfer.

25|$|Dalton {{suffered}} a minor stroke in 1837, {{and a second}} in 1838 <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> speech impairment, although he remained able to perform experiments. In May 1844 he had another stroke; on 26 July 1844 he recorded with trembling hand his last meteorological observation. On 27 July 1844, in Manchester, Dalton fell from his bed and was found lifeless by his attendant.|$|E
25|$|Darin {{suffered}} from poor health his entire life.

During his first heart surgery, in January 1971, he had two artificial valves implanted in his heart. He spent most of that year recovering from the surgery.|$|E
25|$|George Braxton Pegram {{was born}} in Trinity, North Carolina, {{one of the five}} {{children}} of William Howell Pegram, a professor of chemistry at Trinity College (now Duke University), and Emma, daughter of Braxton Craven, the college's founder and first president.

50|$|He {{did many}} {{commercials}} and small movie roles {{before he got}} the opportunity to stand with Amitabh Bachchan in a Mirinda commercial.

25|$|The {{horror and}} revulsion at the cruelty and inhumanity that he {{witnessed}} still <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deep-seated hostility towards Germany; in the late-1980s {{he wrote that}} he would disembark from a lift rather than ride with a German of his generation. Nevertheless, three of his more memorable film roles were as Germans, one {{of them as a}} former SS officer in The Night Porter (1974).|$|E
25|$|Vercingetorix {{had earlier}} been {{expelled}} from Gergovia. In winter 53 BC, whilst Caesar was gathering his forces for a strike against the Gauls, Vercingetorix attacked Gergovia. Caesar states that this <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> difficult decision, between keeping his forces safe {{over the winter}} but showing Roman weakness in defending her allies the Aedui and thus losing their support, or bringing Vercingetorix to open battle but risking running out of supplies—he chose the latter.|$|E
25|$|In the {{military}} Abbey had {{applied for a}} clerk typist position but instead he served two years as a military police officer in Italy. Abbey was promoted in {{the military}} twice but due to his knack for opposing authority, was twice demoted and was honorably discharged as a private.

50|$|Perlman's {{theoretical}} approach was politically detached and {{relied heavily on}} data collection, a model which would dominate labor history well into the 1960s. However, Perlman did show signs of breaking away from the Wisconsin school's emphasis on organizations. His study of Marx had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> understanding {{of the importance of}} class in social movements, although his sense of the concept was limited to an economic understanding and not as broad as British labor historian E.

50|$|The {{fifth and}} final Test was also {{somewhat}} affected by rain, {{but on a}} batsman's wicket at The Oval both sides made large scores, and Catterall's 95 in just 125 minutes was the highest individual score for the South Africans.
