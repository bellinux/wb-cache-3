5000|$|A {{photoresistor}} (or <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistor,</b> LDR, or photoconductivecell) is a light-controlled variable resistor. The {{resistance of}} a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photoresistor {{can be applied}} in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits.|$|E
50|$|Later amplifiers, and {{particularly}} the Fender Blackface amps of the mid 1960s and the later Silverface amps, used a much more complex circuit, producing the kind of effect that was especially popular with surf musicians. Modulation was produced using an optocoupler, a <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> whose pulsating signal (producing a lopsided wave) affects the preamp circuit.|$|E
50|$|A crude {{example is}} a typical {{inverting}} op-amp configuration with a <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> (LDR) in the feedback loop. The gain of the amplifier then depends on the light falling on the LDR, which can be provided by an LED (an optocoupler). The gain of the amplifier is then controllable by the current through the LED. This {{is similar to the}} circuits used in optical audio compressors.|$|E
50|$|Lead {{sulphide}} (PbS) and {{indium antimonide}} (InSb) LDRs (<b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistors)</b> {{are used for}} the mid-infrared spectral region. Ge:Cu photoconductors {{are among the best}} far-infrared detectors available, and are used for infrared astronomy and infrared spectroscopy.|$|R
50|$|Similar to lighting, a {{decrease}} in temperature might be needed for the simulated night periods, thus keeping living species healthy. Such variation need to be coherent {{to those found in}} the natural habitats of the species. Thermo-control systems are often used to regulate light cycles and heating, as well as humidity (coupled to built-in misting or rain systems). <b>Light-dependent</b> <b>resistors</b> or photo-diodes connected to the lighting are frequently used to simulate daytime, evening and nighttime light cycles, as well as timers to switch lighting and heating on and off when necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} opto-isolators, originally {{marketed as}} light cells, {{emerged in the}} 1960s. They employed miniature incandescent light bulbs as sources of light, and cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium selenide (CdSe) photoresistors (also called <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistors,</b> LDRs) as receivers. In applications where control linearity was not important, or where available current was too low for driving an incandescent bulb (as {{was the case in}} vacuum tube amplifiers), it was replaced with a neon lamp. These devices (or just their LDR component) were commonly named Vactrols, after a trademark of Vactec, Inc. The trademark has since been genericized, but the original Vactrols are still being manufactured by PerkinElmer.|$|R
50|$|When a {{photoconductive}} {{material is}} connected {{as part of}} a circuit, it functions as a resistor whose resistance depends on the light intensity. In this context, the material is called a photoresistor (also called <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> or photoconductor). The most common application of photoresistors is as photodetectors, i.e. devices that measure light intensity. Photoresistors are not the only type of photodetector—other types include charge-coupled devices (CCDs), photodiodes and phototransistors—but they are among the most common. Some photodetector applications in which photoresistors are often used include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios, and infrared detectors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, modeling {{and testing of}} an active single axis solar tracker. The compactness of the proposed solar tracker enables it to be mounted onto the wall. The solar irradiance is detected by two <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> (LDR) sensors that are located {{on the surface of}} the photovoltaic (PV) panel. The smart tracker system operates at different modes to provide flexibility to accommodate different weather conditions and preference for different users. The PV panel rotates automatically based on the sun irradiance during the day while at night; the system is in ‘sleep’ mode in order to reduce the energy consumption. A computer model of the standalone solar tracker system is first modeled using MATLAB™/Simulink™. The efficiency over the fixed solar panel, the power generated and the types of PV systems to achieve the required level of efficiency can be determined before actual implementation. The experimental testing shows some agreement with the simulation results...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{optical sensor}} was {{designed}} to measure the fine solid particles concentration contained in a fluid flow. This sensor is composed of four light-emitting diodes and four associated <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistors,</b> allowing the measurement of fluid transparency. Given the small device dimensions, it can be placed close to the particles exit from the specimen. The optical sensor is able to instantaneously measure a large range of clay or silt concentrations in the effluent, without a significant influence of flow rate. The presence of sand grains in fluid flow can be detected. The use of this sensor with a specific triaxial device allows precise characterization of the initiation {{and development of the}} suffusion process on clayey sand specimens. It is shown that suffusion of clay particles induces a decrease of hydraulic conductivity, which is due to a diffuse process of eroded particles filtration. Clay suffusion and filtration processes are influenced by grain-size distribution and also by grain shape of the coarse fraction. Under a high hydraulic gradient, clay suffusion can be accompanied by sand erosion. The critical value of mean pore velocity to initiate clay suffusion was determined for the types of soils...|$|R

Optical performance analysis for parabolic-trough focusing collector with several tracking modes is accomplished. A few of common problems met in work is discussed. This paper sorts tracker controller methodologies in utilization of solar energy into close loop, open loop, and hybrid. By relations between hour angle and the tracking angle of several tracking modes with one axis, selecting for controller methodologies of several tracking modes with one axis are acquired. By using MATLAB to deal with data, tlie figures of relations between hour angel and tlie tracking angle of horizontal N/S tracking can be worked out, and at this time feasibility and applicability of hybrid tracking control system are analyzed. Merits and demerit of several tracker controller methodologies are studied and summarized, and characteristic and applicability of them are researched. In the experimental study, some <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistors</b> that had been used in tlie control system were studied, and a parabolic-trough system of horizontal N/S tracking mode was also constructed and study.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{focuses on the}} development of an electronic control circuit for the tracking mechanism of a solar water heater, and assessing the effectiveness of this control circuit by assessing the thermal performance of the heater. A 10 -litre capacity parabolic dish solar water heater was designed and constructed for use in Kaduna. The heater was designed to heat water from ambient temperature up to 100 oC. For effective performance the heater had to track the sun, and an electronic control circuit using two <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistors</b> was designed and developed for this purpose. The control circuit uses two modes of control, manual mode and automatic mode. Both modes of control use a Superjack, a widely used tracking device in the satellite dish industry. The manual mode uses two switches to track the sun at intervals of time and requires the physical presence of an operator to carry out the operation. Analysis of series of experimental results using the plant indicates that the overall thermal performance of the system under automatic mode is superior to the performance under the manual mode. Improved thermal efficiency of more than 2 % and time reduction of about 4 % were achieved with the automatic mode of control over the manual mode. These two advantages, together with another advantage that it does not require the physical presence of an operator to track the sun, make the automatic mode have more economic potentials than the manual mode...|$|R
40|$|While {{modularity}} {{is thought}} to be central for the evolution of complexity and evolvability, it remains unclear how systems boot-strap themselves into modularity from random or fully integrated starting conditions. Clune et al. (2013) suggested that a positive correlation between sparsity and modularity is the prime cause of this transition. We sought to test the generality of this modularity-sparsity hypothesis by testing {{it for the first time}} in physically embodied robots. A population of ten Tadros — autonomous, surface-swimming robots propelled by a flapping tail — was used. Individuals varied only in the structure of their neural net control, a 2 x 6 x 2 network with recurrence in the hidden layer. Each of the 60 possible connections was coded in the genome, and could achieve one of three states: - 1, 0, 1. Inputs were two <b>light-dependent</b> <b>resistors</b> and outputs were two motor control variables to the flapping tail, one for the frequency of the flapping and the other for the turning offset. Each Tadro was tested separately in a circular tank lit by a single overhead light source. Fitness was the amount of light gathered by a vertically oriented sensor that was disconnected from the controller net. Reproduction was asexual, with the top performer cloned and then all individuals entered into a roulette wheel selection process, with genomes mutated to create the offspring. The starting population of networks was randomly generated. Over ten generations, the population’s mean fitness increased two-fold. This evolution occurred in spite of an unintentional integer overflow problem in recurrent nodes in the hidden layer that caused outputs to oscillate. Our investigation of the oscillatory behavior showed that the mutual information of inputs and outputs was sufficient for the reactive behaviors observed. While we had predicted that both modularity and sparsity would follow the same trend as fitness, neither did so. Instead, selection gradients within each generation showed that selection directly targeted sparsity of the connections to the motor outputs. Modularity, while not directly targeted, was correlated with sparsity, and hence was an indirect target of selection, its evolution a by-product of its correlation with sparsity...|$|R
5000|$|The Fender Twin Reverb has two {{independent}} channels, labeled Normal and Vibrato. The controls have black-skirted knobs numbered from 1 to 10. The Normal channel has two inputs, a [...] "bright" [...] switch (which compensates for loss of brightness through the volume control when the control is set lower than about [...] "6" [...] on its 1-10 scale), a volume control, treble, middle and bass tone controls. The Vibrato channel has a duplication {{of the same}} controls as the normal channel, plus the addition of reverb, vibrato speed and intensity controls. Reverb is accomplished with a tube/transformer driven low impedance spring reverb tank (made by the Hammond company) or its spin-off company Accutronics. [...] The addition of the reverb circuit requires an additional [...] "gain" [...] stage in the preamp, and as such, the Vibrato channel is capable of a bit more distortion when the volume is set high. Vibrato (tremolo) is accomplished with {{what is known as}} a [...] "vibrato bug" [...] by Fender amplifier repairmen. The vibrato bug is a four-wire device consisting of a neon tube and <b>light-dependent</b> variable <b>resistor,</b> packaged in a short section of black tubing. It resembles a water bug, with slender wispy legs. The tube generated vibrato oscillator pulsates the neon light, which varies the resistance on the resistive element. That variable resistance is applied to the audio signal on the Vibrato channel, creating a pulsating increase and decrease of that channel's volume. The speed controls varies the rate of the oscillator. The depth control limits the amount of application the variable resistor has on the audio signal.|$|R
