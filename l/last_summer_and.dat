500|$|Killing Mr. Griffin {{was first}} {{published}} in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. Killing Mr. Griffin, along with I Know What You Did <b>Last</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>and</b> Don't Look Behind You, were the first group of ten different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from AudioFile felt that Sala's narration was effective, although occasionally he [...] "seems to lose concentration and expression." [...] A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio and features the modernized text.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush <b>last</b> <b>summer,</b> <b>and</b> we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E

500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, {{and we had to}} do it in {{different}} stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it <b>last</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{received}} five {{nominations for}} the 1994 American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, Favorite Soul/R Female Artist, Favorite Pop/Rock Album and Favorite Soul/R Album for Janet, and Favorite Soul/R Single for [...] "That's the Way Love Goes". The same year she received two Grammy Award nominations—Best R Vocal Performance, Female and Best R Song for [...] "That's The Way Love Goes"—winning Best R Song. Several critics asserted she was unjustly {{overlooked in the}} Grammy's three major categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated, [...] "Jackson again was denied a nomination for album of the year, even though 'janet' (Virgin) has remained in the Top 10 since its release <b>last</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> has been critically acclaimed." [...] He adds that [...] "the oversight is doubly vexing, because —in a songwriting and production partnership with Jimmy Jam (aka James Harris III) and Terry Lewis—is not just a multiplatinum pop act but an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues over the last decade." [...] Kot laid blame to the oversight {{on the fact that}} many believed her to be a producer-dependent artist—an opinion he found to be in error. Similarly, producer Jimmy Jam stated: [...] "It's easy to say that the two albums she did before she met us weren't successful and when she got with us she became successful... 'Control' was the first album she actually had input. I think that's just as significant as the fact we (Jam and Lewis) did the record." ...|$|E

Writing in 2000, Tim Lucas wrote that Bava's film is [...] "the acknowledged smoking gun behind the 'body count' movie phenomenon of the 1980s, which continues to dominate the horror genre two decades later with such films as Scream, I Know What You Did <b>Last</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>and</b> their respective sequels." [...] According to Gary Johnson, [...] "Twitch of the Death Nerve {{is one of the most}} imitated movies of the past 30 years.

This has been {{named one of the}} catalysts of the 2011 Egyptian protests, as an instance in which people formed a community around opposition to police brutality and, by extension, other government abuses. On 11 February 2011, these protests resulted in the resignation of Hosni Mubarak after 30 years in power. ABC News characterized Saaed in his morgue photo as [...] "The Face That Launched a Revolution". The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Had it not been for a leaked morgue photo of his mangled corpse, tenacious relatives and the power of Facebook, the death of Khaled Said would have become a footnote in the annals of Egyptian police brutality.

2500|$|Similar to Senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, one of {{the more}} widely leveled charges against McCain was the issue of his age—he turned 72 in August and there was {{widespread}} concern about the idea of electing a man who would be 80 years old if he completed two full terms in office (the oldest president, Ronald Reagan, had been a month shy of 78 when he left office in January 1989). In addition, McCain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in North Vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head. His age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful Senator Obama, who was the first Generation Xer to run for president on a major party ticket. McCain for comparison was born before World War II and belonged to the generation preceding the baby boomers. Much like Bob Dole, McCain attempted to counter these charges by releasing all of his medical records, something Obama did not do. McCain's wife Cindy dismissed concerns about his health by arguing that [...] "We went hiking the Grand Canyon <b>last</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> [...] did great and had no trouble keeping up with us." [...] McCain also appeared at several campaign stops with his still-active 95-year-old mother.
