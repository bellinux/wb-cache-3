2500|$|Tina Fey {{has said}} that Liz' {{relationship}} with Jack is [...] "somewhere between Mary Tyler Moore and Lou Grant, and Han Solo and Princess Leia." [...] Fey previously stated that {{there would not be}} a romantic relationship between the two, as it would be [...] "too icky." [...] More recently, however, she admitted there is sexual tension between Jack and Liz. Jack passes Liz off as his girlfriend to make ex-wife Bianca jealous and Bianca tells Liz in one scene that [...] "I can tell from the way he [...] <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> that he's serious". Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, thinks that Liz is a perfect match for Jack. In [...] "Do-Over", Jack and Liz attempt to win over temporary head of GE, Kathy Geiss by pretending to have a soap opera-style real life relationship, escalating to the point where Geiss wants the two to kiss each other (her shouting [...] "KISS!" [...] marks the only time Kathy Geiss has spoken in the entire series); there is a pause, but Jack and Liz refuse.|$|E
2500|$|His next film, K. S. Ravikumar's action {{entertainer}} Aadhavan also achieved commercial success, while Suriya's {{depiction of}} a hitman was praised. A critic from Sify.com labelled it as an [...] "out and out Suriya show", stating that [...] "the film rides on {{the magic of the}} actor, and his zany shenanigans alone makes it worth a watch" [...] and Rediff.com cited that [...] "he sings, dances, and fights with absolute sincerity, but when he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> with tears in his eyes in an emotional scene tailor-made for him, the applause hits the roof", concluding that it is [...] "completely his film". In 2010, he had his 25th release with Singam directed by Hari, in which he played the role of a police officer from a small village going to work in the city. The film received [...] to positive reviews with The Hindu noting that [...] "Suriya shows that be it a performance-oriented role or a formulaic concoction he can deliver", while Sify.com stated [...] "Ultimately it is Suriya who carries the film to the winning post. His passion and the way he brings an ordinary regular larger-than-life hero character alive on screen is lesson for other commercial heroes." [...] The film won Suriya the Vijay Award for Best Entertainer again and saw him nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor– Tamil again, and subsequently {{went on to become the}} second highest-grossing film of the year. He made his Bollywood debut in Ram Gopal Varma's two-part political drama Rakta Charitra in 2010 which was released to highly critical acclaim and became a commercial success. [...] Rakta Charitra is also considered as the Most Violent Film in Indian Film industry. Suriya subsequently went on to appear as himself in three consecutive guest appearances, appearing alongside Trisha and Madhavan in a song in Manmadhan Ambu (2010), before also starring in K. V. Anand's Ko and Bala's Avan Ivan (2011).|$|E
