30|$|In {{conventional}} backcrossing, many {{portions of}} the donor genomes are inserted into both the carrier and non-carrier recipient chromosomes during early cycles. After continued backcrossing, the donor genome segments are gradually replaced by sequences from the recurrent parent at varying rates. In most backcrossing programs, <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> is responsible for long-lasting donor genome segments remaining in the recurrent genome. However, {{there is no difference}} in terms of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> in pseudo-backcrossing schemes. In pseudo-backcrossing BILs, there was only a 1 % reduction in <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> from BC 1 to pseudo-BC 3, and most of this reduction was due to the heterozygous segments of the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> Our results also revealed that the degree of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> is independent {{of the size of the}} target genes/QTLs. When comparisons were made between the selection of single genes or single QTLs, the degree of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> was less for QTLs than for single genes. Of the five single gene selections, SSIIa, Sub 1, xa 5, Xa 21 and TPS, only selection for Xa 21 showed large, persistent <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> Persistent linkage drags when selecting for BB genes have been reported in several backcross breeding programs, such as during the transfer of Xa 4 [*]+[*]xa 5 [*]+[*]Xa 21 from indica ‘IRBB 57 ’ into japonica ‘Mangeumbyeo’ (Suh et al. 2013), and pyramiding of the BB resistance genes Xa 21 and xa 13 and a semi-dwarfing gene (sd- 1) from PR 106 -P 2 into Type 3 Basmati (Rajpurohit et al. 2011). The problem of persistent <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> when selecting for Xa 21 may due to the fact that Xa 21 was derived from IRBB 21, which inherited the chromosomal region containing Xa 21 from the wild species Oryza longistaminata through several cycles of backcrossing with indica rice (Song et al. 1995). The degree of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> may depend on linkage disequilibrium surrounding the target gene to be transferred. Genes inherited from wild species in cultivated strains may be retained within long, stable LD stretches that are difficult recombine. Therefore, selection based on functional markers alone does not guarantee linkage drag-free progeny. More successful single-gene target selection has been reported when markers flanking the gene of interest were also selected for (Rajpurohit et al. 2011). In one of the most comprehensive backcrossing projects, a single gene, sd 1, was integrated into the desirable variety ‘Koshihikari’ using eight cycles of MAB with 51 SSR markers surrounding sd 1 to completely eliminate <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> (Tomita 2009).|$|E

A larger population was used for further verification, and the results confirmed the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> between the blast resistance gene and QTL conditioning spikelet fertility, other than QTL conditioning number of filled grains per panicle. Breakdown or avoidance of the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> could be achieved by selection against the genotype background of a heading-date gene (qHD- 7) that resided in the region between RM 2 and RM 214 on chromosome 7. For further validation, two lines with almost identical genotypes on all chromosomal regions except the Pi 25 (t) region on chromosome 6 were chosen {{to develop a new}} population. The results showed that qSF- 6 could be further subdivided into qSF- 6 - 1 and qSF- 6 - 2. When the genotype of the region between RM 2 and RM 214 was from rice variety Zhong 156, the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> between Pi 25 (t) and qSF- 6 - 2 was detected and the allele of qSF- 6 - 2 from rice variety Gumei 2 reduced the spikelet fertility. When the genotype of the region between RM 2 and RM 214 was from Gumei 2, no <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> was detected. This indicates that the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> between the blast resistance gene and the QTL conditioning spikelet fertility could be broken down or avoided under a certain background genotype selection against heading-date and provides a marker aided solution for high level of blast resistance and yield breeding in rice and other crops as well...|$|E

In tomato, pedicel abscission is an important agronomic factor that controls yield and post-harvest fruit quality. Two non-allelic mutations, jointless (j) and jointless- 2 (j- 2), controlling pedicel abscission zone formation have been documented but only j- 2 has been extensively used in breeding. J was shown to encode a MADS-box protein. Using a combination of physical mapping and gene expression analysis we identified a positional candidate, Solyc 12 g 038510, associated with j- 2 phenotype. Targeted knockout of Solyc 12 g 038510, using CRISPR/Cas 9 system, validated our hypothesis. Solyc 12 g 038510 encodes the MADS-box protein SlMBP 21. Molecular analysis of j- 2 natural variation revealed two independent loss-of-function mutants. The first results of an insertion of a Rider retrotransposable element.

To bring new insights into the role of J and J- 2 in abscission zone formation, we phenotyped the single and the double mutants and the engineered alleles.

30|$|We {{then looked}} into the {{distribution}} of donor genome segments across the six carrier and non-carrier chromosomes. For the carrier chromosomes, linkage drags were identified upstream and/or downstream of the donated target gene/QTL following transmission to the recipient genome. Even considering the stringent MAB on all target genes/QTLs during the BC 1 cycle, linkage drags were still detected for almost every donated locus, both homozygous and heterozygous, on one or {{both sides of the}} target gene/QTL, constituting {{more than half of the}} total donor segments on the carrier chromosomes (Table  2). The largest linkage drags were detected on both sides of the Xa 21 locus (Table  2). However, only a small heterozygous <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> was detected at the xa 5 locus. The contrast between the degree of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> for the two functional genes Xa 21 and xa 5 was unexpected, as the pair of loci was inherited from the same donor, Xa 497. As both xa 5 and Xa 21 were MAB using their functional markers, it is interesting to speculate on the differences in <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> between the two functional genes. The size of the linkage of Xa 21 is much greater than for the two functional genes Sub 1 and TPS, and the other QTLs, qBL 1, qBL 11 and qBph 3. Heterozygous linkage drags were identified for five of the eight target genes/QTLs, including the Xa 21 locus (Table  2), Donor-unlinks—the additional donor segments co-transmitted on the opposite (unlinked) chromosome arms of the target genes/QTLs—were identified on the carrier chromosomes containing Xa 21, qBL 1, qBL 11 and TPS (Table  2). Therefore, the total donor segments transmitted via BC 1 along with Xa 21 were obviously the largest among the target loci under MAB (Table  2).|$|E

Theoretical predictions of proportional genomic contributions, including donor <b>linkage</b> <b>drag,</b> from ancestors used at each generation of crossing after an introgression programme agreed closely with simulated results. The obligate drag, the donor genome surrounding the target locus that cannot be removed by subsequent selection, was also studied.

30|$|Most {{japonica rice}} cultivars exhibit high {{susceptibility}} to BB disease, except to race K 1 in Korea, {{because of their}} narrow genetic diversity. It is imperative to develop new BB-resistant rice cultivars with high yield potential and grain quality using modern tools of biotechnology. However, {{it is often difficult}} to introduce the BB resistance genes from indica germplasm sources into a japonica genetic background by conventional breeding methods due to the unexpected <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> Pyramiding resistance genes is difficult to accomplish using conventional breeding because of the dominance and epistasis effects of the genes controlling disease resistance. Nevertheless, using the tools of biotechnology, it is possible to transfer or pyramid valuable genes of BB resistance into rice without <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> (Rajpurohit et al. 2011; Shanti et al. 2010; Singh et al. 2001; Sundaram et al. 2008). Mangeumbyeo is a japonica cultivar with good grain and cooking quality and high yield potential but it is highly susceptible to BB races. An IRBB 57 NIL carrying Xa 4, xa 5 and Xa 21 genes in an IR 24 genetic background conferred strong resistance to all Korean BB races, including K 3 a (Jeung et al. 2006; Suh et al. 2009 a). We have introduced the three BB resistance genes (Xa 4 [*]+[*]xa 5 [*]+[*]Xa 21) from IRBB 57 into Mangeumbyeo through simultaneous foreground and phenotypic selection. Eventually, it was possible to introduce three BB resistance genes with desirable agronomic traits using marker-assisted backcrossing. All three co-dominant molecular markers linked to the target genes (Xa 4, xa 5 and Xa 21) were used for MAB and the markers were polymorphic between the donor parent IRBB 57 and recurrent parent Mangeumbyeo. The validated markers could thus be used successfully to pyramid and confirm the three resistance genes in advanced backcross lines. Finally, we also analyzed the genetic background of the three selected ABL (BC 3 progenies) with high background genome recovery. Conventional backcross breeding has difficulty in confirming the several resistance genes combined in breeding lines using phenotypic selection with Xoo inoculation (Rajpurohit et al. 2011; Shanti et al. 2010; Sundaram et al. 2008). The best strategy to pyramid or introduce multiple genes and recover a maximum recurrent parent background effect in the shortest time will be to take up the transfer of genes simultaneously, generate a large backcross population and select the target genes through foreground selection and flanking marker analysis to reduce the persistent <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> (Rajpurohit et al. 2011; Ye, 2010). However, if we select backcross lines with target genes using molecular markers, <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> often occurs in indica/japonica. So, we selected the backcross progenies in each backcross and segregating generation through foreground and phenotypic selection simultaneously to reduce the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> This expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming background selection can be avoided and substituted by another backcross with the recurrent parent, if necessary. Final backcross progenies could be confirmed with the substituted chromosome segments by background analysis using genome-wide molecular markers. On the basis of comprehensive foreground selection, phenotypic selection for morphological and quality traits, and background genotyping, three BC 3 F 5 gene-pyramid lines with pyramided genes homozygous at all three target loci were derived from the donor parent. The three R-gene-derived ABL exhibited high resistance upon inoculation with Xoo strains and had nearly the average expected 93.75 % background genome recovery.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two ways}} for genetic {{improvement}} in classical plant breeding: crossing and mutation. Plant varieties can also be improved through genetic modification; however, the present GMO regulations are based on risk assessments with the transgenes coming from non-crossable species. Nowadays, DNA sequence information of crop plants facilitates the isolation of cisgenes, which are genes from crop plants themselves or from crossable species. The increasing number of these isolated genes, {{and the development of}} transformation protocols that do not leave marker genes behind, provide an opportunity to improve plant breeding while remaining within the gene pool of the classical breeder. Compared with induced translocation and introgression breeding, cisgenesis is an improvement for gene transfer from crossable plants: it is a one-step gene transfer without <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> of other genes, whereas induced translocation and introgression breeding are multiple step gene transfer methods with <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> The similarity of the genes used in cisgenesis compared with classical breeding is a compelling argument to treat cisgenic plants as classically bred plants.

The use of flanking markers for recombinant selection may help recover all the important traits of the recipient parent.

The reported <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> of the qDTY QTLs has been successfully broken and individual QTLs have been introgressed into improved genetic backgrounds (Vikram et al. 2015). To identify an appropriate number of plants with positive interactions and high phenotypic expression, MAB requires genotyping and phenotyping of large numbers of plants/progenies in each generation from F 2 onwards. In this case, MAB for more than two genes/QTLs is not a cost-effective approach. The population size to be genotyped and phenotyped for complex traits such as drought increases significantly as two or more QTLs are considered for introgression. To enhance breeding capacity to develop climate-resilient rice cultivars, there is a strong need to develop a novel, cost/labor-effective, and high-throughput breeding strategy. The effective integration of molecular knowledge into breeding programs and making MAB cost-effective enough to be fully adapted by small- or moderate-sized breeding programs are still a challenge.|$|E

They are all {{susceptible to the}} same diseases, have the same biological efficiency on substrates and have very similar quality traits. New varieties with improved traits are only commercially viable if they meet at least the quality standards of the present varieties. Previous and present breeding programs have shown that restoration of quality and agronomic traits while introducing new traits by outcrossing with wild germplasm is very difficult. One {{of the main reasons}} is the extraordinary recombination landscape in the variety bisporus causing substantial <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> Almost all the crossover events locate at the very tips of chromosome ends. These crossovers are often missed in segregation analysis, since covering chromosome ends with suitable markers is difficult for the presence of telomeres and associated repeats (Sonnenberg et al. 2016). Previous researchers thus concluded that recombination is rare in the variety bisporus compared to the burnettii variety, whereas the main differences between these varieties lies in the position of crossovers, i.e., at chromosome ends for the bisporus variety and a more even distributed over chromosomes for the burnettii variety. As a result, introgression breeding is hampered by substantial <b>linkage</b> <b>drag,</b> and QTL mapping is limited to the assignment of QTLs to chromosomes. Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge on the genetic basis of most agronomic and quality traits is a bottleneck for breeding and our research can contribute to its understanding.

Following two successive cycles of marker-assisted pseudo-backcrossing, BC 3 F 3 BILs linkage drags were detected innearly every case, {{with the exception}} of the qBph 3 -SSIIa locus. The total <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> (combined homozygous and heterozygous types) was 8.53 %, which is more than half of the total donor component on carrier chromosomes (Table  3). The unlinkage drag values of the donated segments on the carrier chromosomes were between 5.91 and 40 % of the total donor component on the carrier chromosomes (Table  3). To trace the potential origins of these large donor components, the sum of all donor compositions in the selected BC 1 F 2 lines was compared with those components in the selected BC 3 F 3 BILs. On average, the donor genome content in BC 3 F 3 BILs was not significantly different from that of BC 1 F 2 (Table  2 and Table  3). The same was true for the homozygous components of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> and donor unlinked, whereas the heterozygous components were significantly decreased during pseudo-backcrossing. These results could indicate that high frequency of recombination between donated segments and the recipient genome contents of the carrier chromosomes in the BC 1 cycle was primarily due to the high donor genome content in successive pseudo-backcrossings. Furthermore, the significant reduction in heterozygous donor components for the BC 3 F 3 BILs highlights an advantage of pseudo-backcrossing in gene pyramiding.|$|E

The high recurrent genome recovery observed in many pyramid lines {{may be due to the}} use of more number of polymorphic microsatellite markers. Similar results were obtained in case of Sundaram et al. 2008; Dokku et al. 2013; Suh et al. 2013 suggesting more number of background markers. No genetic <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> was observed for the transfer of genes Xa 21, xa 13 and xa 5 (Figure  5) may be due to mega variety used as the donor source for BB resistance genes. The mega variety, Swarna is a highly adapted variety for the favorable ecology. Results indicated that a broad based highly adapted variety as source of donor may give better performance and less drag as compared to the wild and land races as donor. It is expected that all the favorable genes are accumulated in the mega variety and subsequently transfer of some of these genes is improving further the background of the pyramided lines. The approach used in the study ensured the realization of the major objective resulting in the release of a cultivar with enhanced resistance to BB and accelerated recovery of recurrent genome with better yield.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Detecting a QTL is {{only the}} first step in genetic {{improvement}} programs. When a QTL with desirable characteristics is found, e. g. in a wild or unimproved population, it may be interesting to introgress the detected QTL into the commercial population. One approach to shorten the time needed for introgression is to combine both QTL identification and introgression, into a single step. This combines the strengths of fine mapping and backcrossing and paves the way for introgression of desirable but unknown QTL into recipient animal and plant lines. Methods The method consisting in combining QTL mapping and gene introgression has been extended from inbred to outbred populations in which QTL allele frequencies vary both in recipient and donor lines in different scenarios and for which polygenic effects are included in order to model background genes. The effectiveness of the combined QTL detection and introgression procedure was evaluated by simulation through four backcross generations. Results The allele substitution effect is underestimated when the favourable QTL allele is not fixed in the donor line. This underestimation is proportional to the frequency differences of the favourable QTL allele between the lines. In most scenarios, the estimates of the QTL location are unbiased and accurate. The retained donor chromosome segment and <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> are similar to expected values from other published studies. Conclusions In general, our results show {{that it is possible to}} combine QTL detection and introgression even in outbred species. Separating QTL mapping and introgression processes is often thought to be longer and more costly. However, using a combined process saves at least one generation. With respect to the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> and obligatory drag, the results of the combined detection and introgression scheme are very similar to those of traditional introgression schemes. </p...|$|E

Abstract: Graphical genotyping is a visually attractive and easily interpretable method to represent genetic marker data. In this paper, the method is extended from diploids to a panel of tetraploid potato cultivars. Application of filters to select a subset of SNPs allows one to visualize haplotype sharing between individuals that also share a specific locus. The method is illustrated with cultivars resistant to Potato virus Y (PVY), while simultaneously selecting for the absence of the SNPs in susceptible clones. SNP data will then merge into an image which displays the coordinates of a distal genomic region on the northern arm of chromosome 11 where a specific haplotype is introgressed from the wild potato species S. stoloniferum (CPC 2093) carrying a gene (Ny(o,n) sto) conferring resistance to two PVY strains, PVYO and PVYNTN. Graphical genotyping was also successful in showing the haplotypes on chromosome 12 carrying Ry-fsto, another resistance gene derived from S. stoloniferum conferring broad-spectrum resistance to PVY, as well as chromosome 5 haplotypes from S. vernei, with the Gpa 5 locus involved in resistance against Globodera pallida cyst nematodes. The image also shows shortening of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> by meiotic recombination of the introgression segment in more recent breeding material.

40|$|About 94 % of {{the world}} {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea L.) production comes from the rainfed crop grown largely by resource-poor farmers. Several biotic and abiotic stresses limit groundnut productivity, together causing annual yield losses of over US $ 3. 2 billion. The Arachis species harbor genes capable of improving both seed yield and quality in addition to imparting high levels of resistance to diseases and insect pests. Many of the wild Arachis species are not cross compatible with cultivated groundnut. However, efforts to overcome incompatibility in wide crosses have started to liberate resistance genes in interspecific progenies. But these progenies carry a lot of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> Marker-assisted backcross breeding should minimize the <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> as it greatly facilitates monitoring of introgressed chromosome segments carrying beneficial genes from wild Arachis to cultivated groundnut. Transgenic groundnuts with resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses have been produced and are {{in various stages of}} characterization under containment and/or controlled field conditions. Once favorable genes are introduced into cultivated groundnut through wide crossing and/or genetic transformation techniques, these genes will become ideal candidates for marker-accelerated introgression. DNA marker based genetic linkage map should enable breeders to effectively pyramid genes for good seed quality and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses into agronomically enhanced breeding populations in a much shorter time than would be possible by conventional techniques. To date 110 SSR markers detected genetic variation in a diverse array of 24 groundnut landraces. However, substantial efforts are still required to develop sufficient PCR-based markers, particularly SSRs and SNPs, for the construction of high-density genetic linkage map and for the routine application in the molecular breeding in groundnut. The use of automated technologies will become increasingly important for large-scale germplasm characterization and realistic scale marker-assisted selection in groundnut. An international legume genomics initiative has been formed between USA Universities and the International Agricultural Research Centers of the Eco-Regional Alliance on legumes to translate the benefits of the "consensus legume genome" for rapid impacts on the genetic improvement of tropical legumes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many highly {{beneficial}} traits (e. g. {{disease or}} abiotic stress resistance) {{have been transferred}} into crops through crosses with their wild relatives. The 13 recognized species of tomato (Solanum section Lycopersicon) {{are closely related to}} each other and wild species genes have been extensively used for improvement of the crop, Solanum lycopersicum L. In addition, the lack of geographical barriers has permitted natural hybridization between S. lycopersicum and its closest wild relative Solanum pimpinellifolium in Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile. In order to better understand patterns of S. lycopersicum diversity, we sequenced 47 markers ranging in length from 130 to 1200 [*]bp (total of 24 [*]kb) in genotypes of S. lycopersicum and wild tomato species S. pimpinellifolium, Solanum arcanum, Solanum peruvianum, Solanum pennellii and Solanum habrochaites. Between six and twelve genotypes were comparatively analyzed per marker. Several of the markers had previously been hypothesized as carrying wild species alleles within S. lycopersicum, i. e., cryptic introgressions. Results Each marker was mapped with high confidence (e - 30) to a single genomic location using BLASTN against tomato whole genome shotgun chromosomes (SL 2. 40) database. Neighbor-joining trees showed high mean bootstrap support (86. 8 ± 2. 34 %) for distinguishing red-fruited from green-fruited taxa for 38 of the markers. Hybridization and parsimony splits networks, genomic map positions of markers relative to documented introgressions, and historical origins of accessions were used to interpret evolutionary patterns at nine markers with putatively introgressed alleles. Conclusion Of the 47 genetic markers surveyed in this study, four were involved in <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> on chromosome 9 during introgression breeding, while alleles at five markers apparently originated from natural hybridization with S. pimpinellifolium and were associated with primitive genotypes of S. lycopersicum. The positive identification of introgressed genes within crop species such as S. lycopersicum will help inform conservation and utilization of crop germplasm diversity, for example, facilitating the purging of undesirable <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> or the exploitation of novel, favorable alleles. </p...|$|E
40|$|Modern plant {{breeding}} is {{highly dependent on}} new technologies to master future problems. More traits have to be combined, frequently originating from wild species. Traditional breeding is connected with <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> problems. The crop plant itself and its crossable species represent the traditional breeders gene pool. GM-breeding is {{a new way of}} improving existing varieties. Transgenes originate from non-crossable species and are representing a new gene pool. For release of GM-plants into the environment and onto the market in Europe Directive 2001 / 18 /EC has been developed, primarily based on GM-technology and not on gene source. In society, opposition against GM crops is complicating the implementation of GM crops. In this paper, it is shown that not only transgenes, representing a new gene pool but also cisgenes and intragenes are available, representing the breeders gene pool. Cisgenes are natural genes and intragenes are composed of functional parts of natural genes from the crop plant itself or from crossable species. Cisgenesis is the combined use of only cisgenes with marker-free transformation, mimicking <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> free introgression breeding in one step. Therefore, cisgenesis is a new sub-invention in the traditional breeding field and indicates the need for reconsideration of GM Directives. Inventions are frequently containing not only hardware elements, but also software and orgware elements. For cisgenesis it is foreseen that the technical (hardware) and bioinformatic (software) elements will develop smoothly, but that implementation in society is highly dependent on acceptance and regulations (orgware). It could be made in a step by step approach by specific crop-gene derogations from the Directive, followed by adding cisgenesis to annex 1 b of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC for exemption. At present GM crops can only be introduced by large companies. An open innovation approach for cisgenesis by public private partnership including traditional SMEs has been discussed. Cisgenesis has been exemplified for resistance breeding of potato to Phytophthtora infestans...|$|E
40|$|A major {{bottleneck}} to {{introgressive hybridization}} {{is the lack}} of genome collinearity between the donor (alien) genome and the recipient crop genome. Structural differences between the homeologs may create unbalanced segregation of chromosomes or cause <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> To assess large-scale collinearity between potato and two of its wild relatives (Solanum commersonii and Solanum chacoense), we used BAC-FISH mapping of sequences with known positions on the RH potato map. BAC probes could successfully be hybridized to the S. commersonii and S. chachoense pachytene chromosomes, confirming their correspondence with linkage groups in RH potato. Our study shows that the order of BAC signals is conserved. Distances between BAC signals were quantified and compared; some differences found suggest either small-scale rearrangements or reduction/amplification of repeats. We conclude that S. commersonii and S. chacoense are collinear with cultivated Solanum tuberosum on the whole chromosome scale, making these amenable species for efficient introgressive hybridization breeding...|$|E
30|$|Our {{analysis}} led to {{the development}} of three elite advanced backcross breeding lines (ABL) with three resistance genes by foreground and phenotypic selection in a japonica genetic background without <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> The background genome recovery of the ABL expressed more than 92.1 % using genome-wide SSR marker analysis. The pathogenicity assays of three resistance-gene-derived ABL were conducted under glasshouse conditions with the 18 isolates of Xoo prevalent in Korea. The ABL exhibited very small lesion lengths, indicating a hypersensitive reaction to all 18 isolates of Xoo, with agronomic and grain quality traits similar to those of the recurrent parent. Pyramiding the resistance genes Xa 4, xa 5 and Xa 21 provided a higher resistance to Xoo than the introduction of the individual resistance genes. Additionally, the combination of two dominant and one recessive BB resistance gene did not express any negative effect on agronomic traits in the ABL.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{implication}} of molecular biology in crop improvement {{is now more}} than three decades old. Not surpris-ingly, technology has moved on, {{and there are a number}} of new techniques that may or may not come under the geneti-cally modified (GM) banner and, therefore, GM regulations. In cisgenic technology, cisgenes from crossable plants are used and it is a single procedure of gene introduction whereby the problem of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> of other genes is overcome. The gene used in cisgenic approach is similar compared with classical breeding and cisgenic plant should be treated equally as classically bred plant and differently from transgenic plants. Therefore, it offers a sturdy reference to treat cis-genic plants similarly as classically bred plants, by exemption of cisgenesis from the current GMO legislations. This re-view covers the implications of cisgenesis towards the sustainable development in the genetic improvement of crops and considers the prospects for the technology...|$|E
30|$|An {{effective}} application of MAS in breeding {{is in the}} elimination of <b>linkage</b> <b>drag,</b> the co-introduction of beneficial and undesirable agricultural traits from exotic genetic resources. The durable blast resistance gene pi 21 {{was found to be}} linked with gene(s) associated with inferior eating quality within a 40 -kb distance (Fukuoka et al. 2009). In that study, desirable recombinants between pi 21 and the genes conferring inferior eating quality were successfully selected from a large breeding population by using DNA markers for the region around pi 21. The availability of DNA markers closely linked to the genes of interest enabled a breakthrough in the development of durably resistant cultivars that had not been achieved during 80  years of conventional breeding in Japan. This is a clear example of selection in breeding that could not have been achieved without the use of DNA markers tightly linked to the genes and DNA regions of interest.|$|E
30|$|In marker {{assisted}} backcrossing (MABC), it {{is desirable}} {{to be able to}} rapidly introgress chromosomal regions containing a gene or QTL of interest, {{while at the same time}} selecting for small size of a target introgression to avoid <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> We highlight two examples of tracking introgressions using C 6 AIR: one for the cloned and well-characterized SUB 1 gene and another for the Xa 7 gene. SUB 1 confers submergence tolerance for up to 14  days at the vegetative stage, and the gene responsible for the phenotype has been cloned and characterized (Xu et al. 2006; Septiningsih et al. 2009). Xa 7 is a bacterial leaf blight resistance gene from the aus variety DV 85. It is effective at high temperature, which makes it a promising gene for bacterial leaf blight resistance in areas affected by high temperature (Webb et al. 2009). Xa 7 is located on chromosome 6 between 27.9 – 28.0  Mb, but the candidate gene has not yet been cloned.|$|E
30|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{is the foundation}} for crop improvement. Traditional varieties or landraces of rice harbour a large store of valuable genes {{that can be used}} to develop new varieties with improved yield potential, higher nutritional quality, and higher tolerance of the stresses of future climate. The recent completion of re-sequencing of 3, 000 genebank accessions (The 3000 Rice Genomes Project, 2014) has revealed the allelic diversity of multiple rice genomes. The sequence data provides a “digital library” of the 3, 000 accessions, thus presenting opportunities to identify natural genetic variations in rice. The published SNP database (Alexandrov et al. 2014) has enabled the community to identify rice germplasm carrying favorable alleles simply by data mining. However, the use of landraces for breeding is often hampered by <b>linkage</b> <b>drag.</b> To make use of the diversity, an efficient mating design is needed to break the undesirable linkages and to convert landraces to breeding-ready genetic resources.|$|E
30|$|Selection {{of donors}} with high grain Zn in {{polished}} rice, acceptable yield potential and other desirable traits with minimal <b>linkage</b> <b>drag</b> {{and without any}} crossing barriers is an essential foundation for a successful high Zn breeding program. There is abundant genetic variation for the grain Zn concentration in both brown and polished grains in the rice germplasm. Rice wild relatives, landraces, aus and aromatic accessions, deep water rice and colored rice are the best sources of high grain Zn. Wild species of rice such as O. nivara, O. rufipogon, O. latifolia, O. officinalis, and O. granulata also contain high amounts of Zn, around 2 – 3 fold {{higher than in the}} cultivated rice, with Zn concentration varying from 37  mg/kg to 55  mg/kg in non-polished grains (Cheng et al. 2005; Banerjee et al. 2010; Anuradha et al. 2012 a). Aromatic rice has also shown high Zn compared to non-aromatic rice (Gregorio 2002).|$|E
40|$|Wild {{relatives}} of domesticated crop species harbor multiple, diverse, disease resistance (R) genes {{that could be}} used to engineer sustainable disease control. However, breeding R genes into crop lines often requires long breeding timelines of 5 – 15 years to break linkage between R genes and deleterious alleles (<b>linkage</b> <b>drag).</b> Further, when R genes are bred one at a time into crop lines, the protection that they confer is often overcome within a few seasons by pathogen evolution 1. If several cloned R genes were available, it would be possible to pyramid R genes 2 in a crop, which might provide more durable resistance 1. We describe a three-step method (MutRenSeq) -that combines chemical mutagenesis with exome capture and sequencing for rapid R gene cloning. We applied MutRenSeq to clone stem rust resistance genes Sr 22 and Sr 45 from hexaploid bread wheat. MutRenSeq can be applied to other commercially relevant crops and their relatives, including, for example, pea, bean, barley, oat, rye, rice and maize...|$|E
40|$|Pests and {{diseases}} have become major constraints to smallholder banana {{production in the}} highlands of East Africa. Biotic challenges to banana cultivation include fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes and insects. Host-plant resistance, developed either by conventional breeding or by application of biotechnology, {{is thought to be}} the most economic and sustainable means of managing pests {{and diseases}}. The deployment of host-plant resistance may be confounded by constraints on the process of introgression, such as complicated genetics, inadequate screening protocols and undesirable <b>linkage</b> <b>drag,</b> or by complexities in host plant-pest interactions, such as the occurrence of different strains and R gene specificity. Specific examples derived from both potato and banana pathosystems are described to illustrate progress in the deployment of host-plant resistance, possible problems related to pathogen diversity and R gene specificity, and methodology involved in developing resistant lines. Proactive management and monitoring are required to minimise the effects of changes to the pathosystem because of pathogen evolution or the introduction of exotic strains. Peer Revie...|$|E
