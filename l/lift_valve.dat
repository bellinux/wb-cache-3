This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become more difficult. Gas lift valves and oil well systems have been modeled but system failure modes are not well understood. In this paper a quasi-steady-state fluid-mechanical model is constructed to study failure modes and sensitivities of a gas-lifted well system including the reservoir, two-phase flow within the tubing, and gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> geometry. A set of three differential algebraic equations of the system is solved to determine the system state. Gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve,</b> two-phase flow, and reservoir models are validated with well and experimental data. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the model and sensitive parameters are identified. Failure modes of the system and parameter values that lead to failure modes are identified using Monte Carlo simulation.

In fact, Bucher Hydraulics did invent the electronically controlled <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> in the 1970 s. Since then, Bucher Hydraulics developed a wide line of products for hydraulic elevators, such as valves and power units. In 2012, this valve family included various sizes, pressure ranges, systems with constant motor speeds, inverter-driven motors, energy-efficient solutions with hydraulic counterweight, as well as customized solutions. As the common principle, all these solutions apply an electronic closed-loop control that uses a volumetric flow sensor and a proportional actuator. Since 2012, Bucher Hydraulics is substituting this valve family with a new generation, the iValve. Every iValve uses several self-teaching algorithms to adapt to its environment. Their on-board and cabinet electronics control solenoid currents and measure flow, pressure, and temperature. These features enable the iValve to self-monitor, to adapt to operating parameters, and to analyze and log information about itself and the attached system.

40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through malfunction of gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> assemblies (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well annulus, potentially reaching the wellhead.

40|$|Gas lift {{optimization}} {{is becoming}} more important now a day in petroleum industry. A proper lift optimization can reduce the operating cost, increase the net present value (NPV) and maximize the recovery from the asset. A widely accepted definition of gas lift optimization is to obtain the maximum output under specified operating conditions. In addition, gas lift, a costly and indispensable means to recover oil from high depth reservoir entails solving the gas lift optimization problems. Gas lift optimization is a continuous process; there are two levels of production optimization. The total field optimization involves optimizing the surface facilities and the injection rate {{that can be achieved}} by standard tools softwares. Well level optimization can be achieved by optimizing the well parameters such as point of injection, injection rate, and injection pressure. All these aspects have been investigated and presented in this study by using experimental data and PROSPER simulation program. The results show that the well head pressure has a large influence on the gas lift performance and also proved that smart gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> can be used to improve gas lift performance by controlling gas injection from down hole.

50|$|Air lift uses {{compressed}} air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It {{is also found}} in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a foot valve {{at the bottom of the}} string. Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using {{compressed air}}, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas <b>lift</b> <b>valves</b> that could be used for unloading in stages. Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline sinker bars to change the lift point. Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R.

This project is to study simulation of gaseous fuel injector geometries of multi-hole nozzle by using CNG engine. Three main components are focused on this paper. First, the relation between engine speed and injector pressure in achieving stoichiometric airfuel mixture is investigated. Second, relation between valve lift and injector pressure in obtaining stoichiometric air-fuel mixture is investigated. Lastly the quality of air-fuel mixture in engine cylinder is investigated. Stoichiometric air-fuel mixture leads to good drivability, high combustion efficiency, and avoid internal damage on engine parts. In order to achieve stoichiometric air-fuel mixture, the different engine speeds and valve lift are considered and investigated. Therefore, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method using COSMOS FloWork simulation software is used for this purpose. The simulation of gaseous fuel injector geometries of multi-hole nozzle by using CNG engine is conducted in 1. 78 mm, 3. 55 mm, 5. 33 mm and 7. 1 mm intake valve lift, and also engine speeds at 2000 RPM, 3000 RPM, 4000 RPM and 5000 RPM.

40|$|Abstract. Gas lift is an {{artificial}} lift method which {{is commonly used}} in offshore operation with sufficient gas sources as it consumes minimum space on the platform. Gas lift operates by injecting a high pressure gas down through the tubing casing annulus of a well and the injected gas enters the tubing through a gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> installed on the tubing. Gas lift increases production by two means, density reduction of oil column inside the tubing so that the flowing bottom-hole pressure which {{is affected by the}} hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column is reduced and by providing external energy to the oil as the gas expends. Reducing the bottom-hole pressure will improve the drawdown of the well. A production well is modelled by using a production modelling program, Integrated Production Modeling (IPM) Prosper to analyze the production performance at various conditions. A base case model is developed from the production data of an actual oil field to simulate the performance of the actual well without gas lift system. Later, the gas lift is added to the model and the performance was compared with the base case model. The gas parameter was also studied to determine the optimum injection gas condition for maximum oil production. The gas injected at 1490 m can be achieved by injecting the gas with 1200 psi, l 300 psi or 1400 psi. However, the optimum gas injection pressure was determined to be at 1400 psi as the design shows that the required unloading stage is the least. The optimum gas injection rate was determined at 5 MMscf/d with the estimated net revenue is the highest. For injection gas gravity, the lighter gas was determined to be the optimum selection since it gives significant reduction of FBHP (Flowing Bottom Hole Pressure) with less hydrostatic pressure inside the tubing column...|$|E

40|$|High Pressure Lean Burn (HPLB) engines {{have the}} {{potential}} to achieve high load with high efficiency and low emissions compared to currently available powertrains. Various HPLB concepts have been experimentally studied in the literature, focusing on the combustion event but often neglecting the techniques required to provide appropriate cylinder boundary conditions. This dissertation investigates the interactions between the combustion event, in this case Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), and engine processes occurring externally to the cylinder that are critical for HPLB operation. For that reason, multi-cylinder boosted HCCI engines were simulated and analyzed based on energy and exergy flow considerations. The multi-cylinder engine model included several submodels the most critical of which were the HCCI combustion and heat transfer modules. Both of these were evaluated based on different experimental datasets and their capability to simulate wide range operation was assessed. The calibrated models were subsequently used to explore the synergies between boosting, Variable Valve Actuation (VVA), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and different compression ratio levels for high load HCCI. It was found that utilizing hot intake air is highly beneficial for boosted operation. Hot air can reduce dependence on residual gas for mixture composition and temperature control; it also allows manipulation of the valve strategy so that boosting performance is optimized. In fact, it enables use of regular high <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> events for improving engine efficiency and suppressing pressure rise rates. It was found that the combination of advanced boosting systems with VVA strategies offers significant efficiency benefits and renders HCCI technology more accessible for future powertrain applications. Energy and exergy analysis showed that advanced boosting and VVA enhanced dilution levels, suppressed cylinder temperatures and lowered pumping work. The outcome was high levels of thermal and gas exchange efficiencies. These benefits were enough to outweigh drawbacks from increased cylinder irreversibilities and reduced exhaust flow exergy, both resulting from low temperature combustion. Low heat rejection was also explored and was found to be very beneficial for HCCI. Overall, the engine simulation and analysis framework provides a useful tool for exploration and assessment of HPLB engines employing current or future technology...|$|E

This paper {{explains}} {{about the}} evaluation of intake air flow, volumetric efficiency and noise of a motor-driven engine that used an adaptive <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> and timing mechanism (AVLT) on one intake valve. This system is developed with an aim to produce a more powerful engine through variable <b>valve</b> timing and <b>lift</b> technique. The system made the <b>valve</b> <b>lifts</b> higher without increasing the <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> duration. Therefore, a dynamic <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> profile {{with respect to the}} engine speed can be achieved thus varies the input and output of an engine. As a result of applying the AVLT on a motor-driven engine, the engine noise, emission noise and the mass air flow entering the engine cylinder was increased. When AVLT is employed to a maximum lift, the mass air flow of default intake <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> was improved within a range from 8 % to 46. 64 % in 500 rpm to 2000 rpm speed range. Maximum lift produced engine noise within a range of 2. 57 % to 18. 13 % higher than the default lift throughout all speed. Also, maximum lift produced emission noise within a range of 2. 47 % to 19. 19 % higher than the default lift throughout all speed.
