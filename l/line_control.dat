25|$|Like many early {{missiles}} of the era, the Stooge was boosted to {{the approximate}} altitude of the attacker and then flown onto an intercept course. Flares located in fairings {{on the wing}} tips provided a bright source for the operator to track visually. After launch the missile levelled off and a simple gyroscope-controlled autopilot, located in the forwards portion of the fuselage, kept the Stooge flying in a straight <b>line.</b> <b>Control</b> of first the elevators and then, 3 seconds later, the ailerons were released to the operator - the delay necessary for the gyro control to stabilise first. Using radio control, the operator would fly the missile into a position {{in front of the}} target, and then adjust the path in order to collide with the target. Control was via the ailerons and elevator, the vertical stabilizer did not contain a movable rudder.|$|E
500|$|The railway {{is single}} track, so special {{measures}} {{have to be}} taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a [...] "one engine in steam" [...] policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single <b>line</b> <b>control</b> was introduced. The line is worked by Electric Key tokens, which authorise the driver to enter a section of single line, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. There is a loop at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963. When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop. Between Abergynolwyn and Nant Gwernol the line is controlled by staff and ticket operation, which is controlled by the Abergynolwyn Blockman when on Duty.|$|E
2500|$|On the first-day of Third Ypres, {{in which}} 12 Allied {{divisions}} were engaged, {{it was intended}} that the Liverpool Irish would initially act as [...] "moppers-up", entrusted with the responsibility of neutralising opposition {{on the front of}} the 2/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, before partial dispersal to other battalions and employment as brigade support concentrated on a line between two positions known as Keir Farm and Schuler Farm, east of the village of St. Julien. The two battalions formed the left of the 164th Brigade, which was to secure the 55th Division's third objective [...] the Green Line (Gheluvelt-Langemarck Line) [...] after the capture of the Blue and Black lines by the 165th and 166th. Losses were sustained early in the advance from the battalion's trenches and steadily increased once beyond the Black Line. Various concrete emplacements and fortified positions littered the battleground, representing a constant threat with the heavy fire they directed at the brigade. Some were seized by the [...] "moppers up", at one stage the 8th's [...] "D" [...] Company took upwards to 150 prisoners. By 12:30pm, part of the Liverpool Irish had established itself on the Green Line to reinforce the severely depleted Lancashire Fusiliers in the proximity of Fokker Farm and Wurst Farm. The majority of the 1/8th concentrated near Schuler Farm. For almost two-hours, the newly captured territory was subject to sustained bombardment by German artillery as a precursor to a concerted counter-attack against the Green <b>Line,</b> <b>control</b> of which was made more precarious by the exposure of the 164th's left flank. Unable to rectify the distance between it and the 118th Brigade, the contingent near Schuler Farm organised a fighting retreat with those who had withdrawn from the advanced positions back to the relative security of the Black Line. The remnants of the 1/8th, approximately 163 in strength, were ordered to retire to their starting positions under the command of Captain Monks. Among the dead was the battalion's field commander Major Harry Leech, who was killed along with six officers and 27 other ranks; 200 had been wounded and 88 were believed missing.|$|E
