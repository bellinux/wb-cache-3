25|$|In the 1980s, Ronstadt went to Broadway and {{garnered}} a Tony {{nomination for}} her performance in The Pirates of Penzance, teamed with the composer Philip Glass, recorded traditional music, and {{collaborated with the}} conductor Nelson Riddle, an event at that time viewed as an original and unorthodox move for a rock-and-roll artist. This venture paid off, and Ronstadt remained one of the music industry's best-selling acts throughout the 1980s, with multi-platinum-selling albums such as What's New, Canciones de Mi Padre, and Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> She continued to tour, collaborate, and record celebrated albums, such as Winter Light and Hummin' to Myself, until her retirement in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|The hymn {{uses the}} term vātaraśana (वातरशन) which means [...] "girdled with wind".

The context likely means that the poet is describing the [...] "munis" [...] as moving <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> their garments pressed by the wind.

2500|$|A {{different}} conception may {{be present}} in a yet later essay {{on the origin of}} the Ents which, according to Christopher Tolkien, is likely to derive from 1963 and was included into the published Silmarillion.

50|$|A big system {{often has}} superselection sectors. In a solid, {{different}} rotations and translations {{which are not}} lattice symmetries define superselection sectors. In general, a superselection rule is a quantity that can never change through local fluctuations. Aside from order parameters <b>like</b> <b>the</b> magnetization of a magnet, there are also topological quantities, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> number. If a string is wound around a circular wire, {{the total number of}} times it winds around never changes under local fluctuations. This is an ordinary conservation law. If the wire is an infinite line, under conditions that the vacuum does not have winding number fluctuations which are coherent throughout the system, the conservation law is a superselection rule --- the probability that <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> will unwind is zero.|$|R
