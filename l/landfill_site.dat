Floral characteristics of the vegetation and the species richness and abundance of flower-visiting insect assemblages were compared between nine pairs of restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> and reference sites in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, using standardized methods over two field seasons.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 1 st International White Stork Conference celebrado en Zielona Góra (Poland) del 4 al 6 de septiembre de 2014. White Storks {{from western}} European populations {{have adapted to}} the use of <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> as food source. In the Southwest this has led to {{thriving}} populations and an apparent modification of migratory behaviour. Especially Spanish <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> have also become important stopover and even wintering sites for storks on the western European flyway. To study the use of <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> by central European storks we registered ringed storks at two <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> in south-central Spain (Ciudad Real) in ten day intervals during 24 consecutive months (2012 - 2014). During this period 9, 000 rings belonging to approximately 2, 400 storks were read. Storks with rings from northern or central European countries were present at the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the whole year but were especially numerous in winter. The rings identified were from Spanish, German (57 %), French (21 %), Swiss (12 %) and some from Dutch, Swedish, Czech, Belgian but also Italian and Polish storks. From our results we can determine three groups of storks concerning their migratory behaviour: Some local storks have become residents and do not undertake any migratory movements. The second and probably largest group has significantly reduced the distance and duration of migration, now wintering at Spanish <b>landfill</b> <b>sites.</b> Finally some storks still use the traditional migratory routes and are present at the Spanish landfills only during their southward or northward journey. Central European storks that have been observed at the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the breeding period are probably juveniles, this, however, can only be confirmed when full data on the rings becomes available. Our preliminary data show thus evidence for a change in migratory behaviour in {{a large part of the}} Western stork populations. As the management of <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> in Spain will change progressively in the near future this is expected to again have a significant effect on migratory behaviour of these storks.

The base population comprised people living within 2 [*]km of 9565 (from a total of 19   196) <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> that were operational at some time from 1982 to 1997, with populations living more than 2 [*]km from a landfill as reference. Risks of cancers at the above sites were computed with adjustment for age, sex, year of diagnosis, region and deprivation. National post-coded registers provided a total of 341   856   640 person–years for the adult cancer analyses and 113   631   443 person–years for childhood leukaemia.

40|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} {{has been in}} the forefront of conservation issues worldwide since the last century. Biodiversity conservation through restoring degraded habitats or creating new habitats is advocated in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Newly created grasslands on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> are semi-natural habitats that could support a number of species. However, it is unknown whether these re-created habitats represent a significant resource in terms {{of biodiversity}} conservation though poor quality soil was being used for restoration. A multi-taxon approach was applied to examine the biodiversity potential of these novel habitats. Plants (vascular plants and bryophytes), invertebrates (carabid beetles and land snails), and vertebrates (birds) were studied on nine restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> and paired reference sites in the East Midlands region of the UK during 2007 and 2008. Plant species data were collected by random quadrats along two 100 m transects from each site; carabid beetles were censused by pitfall traps; land snails were investigated by hand searches along the transects; and bird species were assessed using point counts. Effects of restoration were investigated by examining species richness, diversity or abundance of studied taxa and also how habitat quality and landscape factors determined species composition on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites.</b> A total of 170 plant species (162 vascular plants and 8 bryophytes), 37 carabid beetle, 17 land snail and 12 bird species were found in the studied sites. Species richness and diversity or abundance of studied taxa on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> were found to be equal to or above that of reference sites. Compositional differences were found between taxa on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> and their corresponding reference sites. Though vegetation composition including NVC plant communities on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> was rather homogeneous compared to reference <b>sites,</b> restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> were found to support a number of nationally decreasing native plant species and of common species of other taxa and also a number of Red List bird species such as Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Grey partridge (Perdix perdix), Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), Tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Habitat quality and landscape variables were found to be significant predictors for different species. Underlying soils were found to be an important factor in determining the heterogeneity of the plant communities within the study area which in turn dictates suitability of habitat for other taxonomic groups. A lack of congruency between taxa supports the incorporation of a multi-taxa approach into restoration plans. Management in terms of cutting or mowing of these <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> were found to have varying influences on different taxa. Moreover, restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> had less disturbance than reference sites as there was restricted access to dog walkers and for recreational purposes. This {{may be one of the}} main factors that could enhance the richness and abundance of a number of taxa, especially bird species. Management of these <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> should be targeted on species-specific goals as these sites can play a significant role in Local Biodiversity Action Plans. Overall, this study indicates that restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> have potential biodiversity conservation value in a complex modified human landscape. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid decline of {{grassland}} bird species in the UK {{over the last four}} decades. In order to stem declines in biodiversity such as this, mitigation in the form of newly created habitat and restoration of degraded habitats is advocated in the UK biodiversity action plan. One potential restored habitat that could support a number of bird species is re-created grassland on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites.</b> However, this potential largely remains unexplored. In this study, birds were counted using point sampling on nine restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> in the East Midlands region of the UK during 2007 and 2008. The effects of restoration were investigated by examining bird species composition, richness, and abundance in relation to habitat and landscape structure on the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> in comparison to paired reference sites of existing wildlife value. Twelve bird species were found in total and species richness and abundance on restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> was found to be higher than that of reference <b>sites.</b> Restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> support both common grassland bird species and also UK Red List bird species such as skylark Alauda arvensis, grey partridge Perdix perdix, lapwing Vanellus vanellus, tree sparrow, Passer montanus, and starling Sturnus vulgaris. Size of the site, percentage of bare soil and amount of adjacent hedgerow were found to be the most influential habitat quality factors for the distribution of most bird species. Presence of open habitat and crop land in the surrounding landscape were also found to have an effect on bird species composition. Management of restored <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> should be targeted towards UK Red List bird species since such sites could potentially {{play a significant role in}} biodiversity action plannin...|$|R
