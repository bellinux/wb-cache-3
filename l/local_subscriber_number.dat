5000|$|The {{director}} areas used {{a shorter}} area code, {{usually in the}} form 0x1 (01 for London) with a 7-digit <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b> These were: ...|$|E
50|$|Newly {{assigned}} numbers have {{a length of}} eight digits for the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>number,</b> yielding a total length of ten digits (not including the 0 trunk code). This is shorter than the maximum of eleven digits in other areas {{in order to avoid}} local numbers to be longer than eight digits.|$|E
50|$|A caller {{from outside}} Australia must dial the {{international}} call prefix of the originating country, plus the country calling code (61 {{in the case}} of Australia), plus the area code (7 in this case), and then the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b> Therefore a caller in the U.K. must dial 00 61 7 3333 3333, while a caller in the U.S.A. must dial 011 61 7 3333 3333.|$|E
5000|$|The same rule {{applies to}} mobile phone numbers, with the {{addition}} of the mobile prefix 15 {{right in front of the}} <b>local</b> <b>subscriber's</b> <b>number.</b> Using the same example above, to reach a Ushuaia mobile from CÃ³rdoba, one should dial: 0 + 2901 + 15 + xx-xxxx ...|$|R
50|$|Length of {{geographical}} area codes (A) is usually 3 to 5 digits; length of non-geographical area codes is 3. The groups of digits in the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber's</b> <b>number</b> (B) {{are separated by}} dashes ('-'): BBB-BB-BB, BB-BB-BB, B-BB-BB. The area code is included in parentheses, similarly to E.123 local notation: (AAA) BBB-BB-BB, (AAAA) BB-BB-BB, (AAAAA) B-BB-BB.|$|R
50|$|As {{explained}} before, area codes {{can have}} 2, 3 or 4 digits {{and must be}} dialed before the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber's</b> phone <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{local area}} code, {{like the rest}} of Northern Ireland is 028. However all <b>local</b> 8-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> are found in the form 92xx-xxxx. Before the Big Number Change in 2000, the STD code for Lisburn and its {{surrounding}} area was 01846, having previously been 0846.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example for}} calling {{telephones}} in Yerevan, Armenia is as follows: <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (within Yerevan) [...] 0 + 10 + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (within Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh) + 374 + 10 + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (outside Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh) ...|$|R
5000|$|From {{abroad to}} Yerevan, marzes, mobile network, Nagorno-Karabakh fixed tel. network and Nagorno-Karabakh mobile network: + 374 + Destination Code + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (to Yerevan, regions(marzes)) + 374 + Mobile Network Code + Mobile <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (to mobile network) + 374 + 47 + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (to NK fixed {{telephone}} network) + 374 + 97 + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (to NK mobile network) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> were 5- or 6- digits, with {{area code}} plus <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> totalling 7 digits.|$|R

50|$|Fixed-line <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> are six digits in Thailand (except Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan, i.e., {{area code}} 2). Prior to 1980, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> were six digits in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan. In 1980, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in these areas}} were {{expanded}} to seven digits in phases to meet new demands. The first digit of a <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> {{is associated with a}} specific locale within the area code. In Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut Prakan, the second digit of a <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> identifies the service provider, which is almost always Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), as TOT holds a near-monopoly of the Thai fixed-line market.|$|R
50|$|Within {{a single}} code group area there would usually be {{multiple}} exchange buildings in various locations. The smaller exchanges might {{have only a}} few hundred lines with three-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers,</b> e.g. 200-499. Larger exchanges might have a few thousand lines with four-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers,</b> e.g. 2000-5999, or five-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers,</b> e.g. 20000-49999.|$|R
50|$|Fixed line <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are seven}} digits in Peninsular Malaysia (except Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, i.e. area code 3) and six digits in East Malaysia. Until 1995, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> in Peninsular Malaysia were six digits in areas other than area code 3. Prior to 2001, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> were seven digits in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. From 1999 to 2001, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in these areas}} were {{gradually}} expanded to eight digits in phases to meet new demands that resulted from the growing population in the Klang Valley.|$|R
50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> {{starting}} with 0 {{are assigned to}} the former monopoly OTE. In bigger cities like Athens and Thessaloniki, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> {{starting with}} other digits except 0 {{are becoming more and}} more common, especially amongst business subscribers. In this case many people think that the area code is different. For example, a <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> in Athens might start with 211, with people thinking that 211 is a distinct area code from 210 while, in reality, both numbers are in the 21 area code and the third digit of the number belongs to the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Area {{codes in}} Belgium are, {{excluding}} the leading 0, {{one or two}} digits long. Numbers are of variable length; landlines have a seven-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> and a one-digit area code, while smaller cities have a six-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> and a two-digit area code. All Belgian telephone numbers dialed within Belgium must use the leading 0 trunk code.Area codes are separated from the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> by a slash and a space, and <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> digits are in the format xxx xx xx or xx xx xx (sometimes xxx xxx), depending {{on the length of}} the area code.See the table below for examples: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{formatting}} convention for {{phone numbers}} is (NPA) NXX-XXXX, where NPA is the {{numbering plan area code}} and NXX-XXXX is the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b> The prefix NXX of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> is a code {{for the local}} central office, unique in the numbering plan area. The place holder N stands for the digits 2 to 9, as the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> may not begin with the digits 0 and 1.|$|R
5000|$|From Yerevan, marzes {{and mobile}} network to Nagorno-Karabakh fixed tel. network and Nagorno-Karabakh mobile network: 0 + 47 + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (to NK fixed {{telephone}} network) 0 + 97 + <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Number</b> (to NK mobile network) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> in {{most areas}} start with 0. That is the digit that was {{inserted}} between the area code and the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> to form the new ten-digit numbering plan back in 2002. Thus, many Greeks erroneously think that the area codes include this leading 0. For example, they think that Athens's area code is 210 while, actually, Athens's area code is 21, 0 being the first digit of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thus, a full {{national}} {{number is}} 9 digits, including the STD prefix 0. When writing a telephone number {{with the area}} code, the area code and <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> are separated by a hyphen, also {{in the middle of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b> Examples: ...|$|R
5000|$|Calls between nearby exchanges could {{previously}} be dialled using a [...] "short code", often beginning 7, 8 or 9. With rising {{demand for}} more <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers,</b> these codes were scrapped in the late 1990s. After a short delay, 6-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning 7 or 8 began to be issued in these 01xxx areas, and with 5-digits in 01xxxx areas. In the mid- and late -2000s, some of these areas also started issuing <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning 9.|$|R

25|$|The TDMA network {{used the}} 025 mobile prefix, using {{a mixture of}} six- and seven-digit <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers.</b> With the switch to CDMA, Telecom {{migrated}} to the 027 prefix and standardised the <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> to seven digits, adding a 4 {{to the beginning of}} old six-digit numbers.|$|R
50|$|Greek {{telephone}} numbers are ten digits long, and usually written AAB BBBBBBB or AAAB BBBBBB where AAB or AAAB is the 2- or 3-digit national area code plus the first digit of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number,</b> and BBBBBBB or BBBBBB are the remaining digits of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b> The entire number {{must always be}} dialed, even if calling within the same local area, therefore the national destination code is not separated from the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number.</b> According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +30 AAB BBBBBBB or +30 AAAB BBBBBB to include the country calling code.|$|R
5000|$|Six of the four-digit area {{codes are}} known as [...] "mixed" [...] areas as they share those four digits with the twelve five-digit area codes. This leads to a {{restriction}} as to which initial digits {{can be used for}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> within those four-digit area codes, e.g. in the 01387 four-digit area code, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> cannot begin with a 3 because 013873 is a separate five-digit area code; likewise in the 01946 four-digit area code, <b>subscriber</b> <b>numbers</b> cannot begin with a 7 because 019467 is a separate five-digit area code.|$|R
