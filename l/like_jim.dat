He joined Young's trapping expedition of 1829. The leadership of Young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping Carson's early life in the mountains.|$|E

McGuinness guided the county's under-21 {{side to the}} All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championship final in 2010. He {{was appointed to the}} senior management on a four-year term, with a review after two years. His first year in charge brought Donegal the National Football League Division 2 title, promotion to Division 1, the county's first championship win in four years, the county's first provincial title in 19 years, and made Donegal the third team {{in the history of the}} GAA to win a Provincial Title from the Preliminary Round. His second season brought a second consecutive provincial title, also achieved from the Preliminary Round, as well as a defeat of the mighty Kerry at Croke Park and with the win over Cork on 26 August to secure a place in the 2012 All Ireland Football Final, it looks <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> won't have to worry about that review after all.|$|E

25|$|A more {{extensive}} tribute was given {{later that year}} in December at the Southbank in the Queen Elizabeth Hall called The Lady: A Tribute to Sandy Denny with a band composed of members of Bellowhead, the evening featured a mix of young folk acts <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Moray and Lisa Knapp alongside those that had known and worked with Denny such as Dave Swarbrick and Jerry Donahue. These acts were joined by performers from outside the world of folk like PP Arnold and Marc Almond. The concert– which primarily featured songs written by Denny – received a four-star review in The Guardian. In May 2012 the Southbank concert was expanded into an eight date UK tour called The Lady: A Homage to Sandy Denny. The tour showcased Sandy's entire songbook taking in her work with Fairport Convention, Fotheringay, her solo career and the new songs completed by Thea Gilmore on her album Don't Stop Singing.|$|E

In his response to the criticism—an article entitled [...] "Why We Love Bobby Singer"—Williams wrote, [...] "I think it's a shame when people <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Beaver or Eric Kripke have to step forward to address this vocal minority, especially when the minority is {{just a handful of}} people gathering at a certain TV website that's known for being snarky and negative about everything.

500|$|The cover has {{received}} acclaim from international critics. The Calgary Sun stated: [...] " [...] is undoubtedly {{the highlight of}} her English-language recording career.

[...] Toronto's Eye Weekly said Steinman's [...] "fatal absence from the last Meat Loaf record is finally justified here," [...] and The Miami Herald said [...] "Dion knocks a couple out of the ballpark... features seven minutes of Wagnerian bombast, thunderclap piano chords and emoting that would wither an opera diva. Sure, it's over-the-top but it's passionate and musical." [...] Allmusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine marked this song as a standout along with [...] "Falling Into You" [...] and praised it: [...] "Dion shines on mock epics <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Steinman's [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now."

500|$|Crockett's calls {{provoked}} a varied {{response from the}} media, which often ran counter to their state allegiances. The New South Wales journalist Davis felt that Marsh's deliberate throws raised [...] "uncertainty", while the Australasian's cricket writer Tom Horan—a Victorian who went by the pen name Felix—felt that Marsh was a soft target for Crockett, whom he regarded as a suspicious character. Curran's previous calling of Marsh in the Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett's position away from his parochial state base. The Victorian umpire {{was regarded as a}} tough-minded umpire, much <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Phillips, who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket. Crockett was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for doing what others would not. When Marsh bowled from the other end in the second innings of the match, his action was deemed by Crockett's umpiring partner Sammy Jones to be fair. By this time, Marsh's confidence was low. He took his worst ever first-class figures of 1/105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket. His only wicket was Test player Charlie McLeod, bowled for six.|$|E
500|$|... "The Boat" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams called it [...] "another solid late-period episode", praising Rainn Wilson's commitment to Dwight throughout the main plotline. He also complimented the Andy-Erin subplot, and considered it {{superior to the}} previous episode for featuring more consistency in Andy's characterization. He also complimented Dan Sterling and John Krasinski's work on the episode, saying that the script made [...] "good on previous hints that Andy and Erin's story won't end <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> and Pam's" [...] and that Krasinski's direction added [...] "just enough energy not to feel overwhelming". He gave the episode a [...] "B+". IGN writer Cindy White called the episode a [...] "pleasant surprise", for its use of the supporting characters and its development of the season's plotlines. She complimented most of the subplots, and compared Pete and Erin's romance to Jim and Pam's from the early seasons of the series. Her only complaint was Andy's characterization throughout the episode and the ninth season, as a whole, for being [...] "mopey and self-obsessed." [...] Despite this, she gave the episode an 8.0/10, calling it [...] "Great". WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer gave the episode four stars out of five, praising the episode for making the previously unsuccessful Oscar-Senator storyline and the Andy's bankrupt family storyline entertaining. He also complimented the fact that Jim and Pam's bickering from the previous episode was not expanded upon, and praised their prank on Dwight, calling it a [...] "great bit" [...] and [...] "an excellent comedic balance to the more serious story of Andy's inner demons." ...|$|E
500|$|Samuel L. Jackson reprises {{his role}} as Nick Fury, the {{director}} of the super-spy agency, S.H.I.E.L.D. Kenneth Choi appears as Jim Morita, a Japanese-American member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan. About his preparation for the role, Choi said, [...] " [...] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the 'Nisei' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Morita fighting in WWII. I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances." [...] Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier, a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk. JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery Falsworth, a British member of Rogers' squad of commandos. Feild called his part in the film [...] "a very physical job.

2500|$|At {{the urging}} of Charles Cathers' parents, {{the family moved to}} Nebraska in 1883 when Willa was nine years old. The rich, flat {{farmland}} appealed to Charles' father, and the family wished to escape the tuberculosis outbreaks that were rampant in Virginia. Willa's father tried his hand at farming for eighteen months; then he moved the family into the town of Red Cloud, where he opened a real estate and insurance business, and the children attended school for the first time. Some of the earliest work produced by Cather was first published in the Red Cloud Chief, the city's local paper. Cather's time in the western state, still on the frontier, was a deeply formative experience for her. She was intensely moved by the dramatic environment and weather, the vastness of the Nebraska prairie, and the various cultures of the European-American, immigrant and Native American families in the area. <b>Like</b> <b>Jim</b> Burden in My Antonia, the young Willa Cather saw the Nebraska frontier as a [...] "place where there was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the materials out of which countries were made...Between that earth and that sky I felt erased, blotted out".|$|E

He eventually became one of the top wrestlers to compete internationally during the 1960s and 70s and often faced many prominent stars of the era. He was the opponent of many NWA World Heavyweight Champions in bouts outside North America, such as Jack Brisco and Dory Funk, Jr., and was also involved in high-profile matches with The Destroyer, André the Giant, Abe Jacobs and King Kong, the latter billed as [...] "the uncrowned Heavyweight Champion of the World". His bouts in Australia against Killer Kowalski were called [...] "real blood baths". He also wrestled Karl Gotch while touring Canada in 1965 and publicly praised his scientific abilities afterwards as [...] "a true wrestler with all the science that we are led to believe the greats of earlier generations possessed – men <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Londos, Dick Shikat, Stan Zbyszko and others".|$|E

2500|$|In 1977 Gradishar {{assisted}} the Broncos to Super Bowl XII, their very first. He earned Pro Bowl honors {{and was named}} first team All-Pro. Gradishar anchored a defense that led the AFC in fewest points allowed (148 in the 14-game season) and gave up the 6th fewest yards. Gradishar was also voted the AFC Defensive Player of the Year by the Columbus Touchdown Club. The 1977 Broncos season is documented {{in a new book}} by Terry Frei, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age that features Gradishar, Lyle Alzado and others. The 1977 Broncos season began with a 7–0 shutout of the St. Louis Cardinals that {{had been one of the}} NFL's top offenses from 1974–1976 that featured offensive stars <b>like</b> <b>Jim</b> Hart, Terry Metcalf, Mel Gray, Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler. In a 14–7 win against the Kansas City Chiefs the Broncos made a goal line stand as time expired to preserve a win. Denver Post staff writer Terry Frei's book, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age, put it this way, [...] "Gradishar penetrated and stopped two running plays, as Gradishar did time and time again on the goal line in his career. It was the trademark of both Gradishar and the defense overall".|$|E
2500|$|Brace {{then worked}} as a {{civilian}} pilot {{for a number of}} companies before flying for BirdAir, an airline contracted by the Thai Border Patrol Police. [...] BirdAir also supported USAID interests in Southeast Asia. [...] On 21 May 1965, he flew Royal Thai Army Sergeant Chaicharn, as well as other passengers and cargo to a dirt airstrip in the Northern Laotian village of Baum Lao in Muong Houn District. [...] Brace's aircraft, a Pilatus PC-6 Porter, received small arms fire upon landing, rendering it incapable of taking off again. [...] Both he and Chaicharn were immediately taken prisoner (either by the Vietnam People's Army or the Pathet Lao) and force-marched into the jungle from Boum Lao to Muong Hoc to Doi Sai, near Dien Bien Phu. [...] Brace was held in a bamboo cage with his limbs and neck bound to prevent escape. [...] During his captivity he was beaten, interrogated, and faced with a mock execution. He escaped 6 June 1965 for a few days before being caught stealing food from a village. Upon his return to the cage his legs were put in stocks and bolted. He escaped on 17 April 1966, and was recaptured in minutes. Next buried up to his chin for seven days, Brace hit his low point and attempted to hang himself on 10 December 1967. He was sent in October 1968 to a POW camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed The Plantation, where he met John McCain in the cell next to him. Brace re-tells his story in Season 8 of Locked Up Abroad [...] <b>Like</b> <b>Jim</b> Bedinger, he was sequestered from other prisoners because he had been captured in Laos. [...] Before Doug Hegdahl's early release from the captivity, Brace contacted Hegdahl to ensure the outside world knew about the prisoners captured in Laos.|$|E
