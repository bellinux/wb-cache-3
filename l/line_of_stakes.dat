60|$|So {{accurate}} was {{the aim of}} the archers, {{that most}} of the arrows struck the knights on their helmets and vizors. Many fell shot through the brain, and so terrible was the rain of arrows that all had to bend down their heads so as to save their faces. Many of the archers, too, shot at the horses; some of these were killed and many wounded, and the latter swerving and turning aside added to the confusion. And when at length Sir Clugnet and the leaders reached the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> in front of the archers, only about a hundred and fifty of the twelve hundred men were behind them.|$|E
60|$|The horses drew up on {{reaching}} the hedge of stakes. Their riders {{could give them}} no guidance, for without deigning to move from their order the archers continued to keep up their storm of arrows, which at such close quarters pierced all but the very finest armour, while it was certain death to the knights to raise their heads to get {{a glance at the}} situation. The horses, maddened with the pain of the arrows, soon settled the matter. Some turned and rushed off madly, carrying confusion into the ranks of the first division, others galloped off to the right or left, and of the twelve hundred men who charged, three only broke through the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> and these were instantly killed by the bill-hooks and axes of the archers.|$|E
60|$|The spot {{from which}} we looked was {{not far from the}} summit of the highest peak in the range of the {{soapstone}} hills. The gorge in which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. But, for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. The means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. In several spots {{along the top of the}} eastern side of the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth. In these spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen, it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes. I have already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature. This was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose. Of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. There can be no doubt that, by the continuous <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below. The fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty. We alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction. We were the only living white men upon the island.|$|E
50|$|More {{elaborate}} and formidable obstructions could be formed with multiple <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> connected with wire running from side-to-side, back-to-front, and diagonally {{in every possible}} direction. Effective as these obstacles were, their construction took considerable time.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1794 with the marking {{out of the}} route. The {{practice}} was {{to set up a}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> pegs or <b>stakes</b> about 50 yd apart so that their tops would indicate the intended water level. It would then be possible to construct the appropriate embankments and cuttings.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{contribution}} a measurement technique based on video imaging {{has been selected}} {{for the assessment of}} the maximum run-up. Such measurements have been used for the calibration of a numerical model and of an empirical formulation. The on-site run-up measurements have been carried out at “Lido Signorino” beach, near Marsala, Italy. The positions of the swash have been localized on a transect, normal to the shore, constituted by stakes placed at 0. 5 m intervals each other. The video camera was placed orthogonally to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stakes.</b> For the numerical simulations a 1 DH Boussinesq-type of model for breaking waves has been applied which takes into account the wave run-up by a Lagrangian shoreline model. In such simulations monochromatic waves have been propagated in a numerical flume having the same beach slope of the measured transect. The comparison between registered and estimated run-up have underlined an acceptable agreement. In particular, it has been obtained that the numerical model tends to underestimate the run-up, instead the applied empirical formula gives overestimated values...|$|R
5000|$|Wall {{comes from}} Latin vallum meaning [...] "...an earthen wall or rampart set with palisades, a row or <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes,</b> a wall, a rampart, fortification..." [...] while the Latin word murus means a {{defensive}} stone wall.English {{uses the same}} word to mean an external wall and the internal sides of a room, {{but this is not}} universal. Many languages distinguish between the two. In German, some of this distinction can be seen between Wand and Mauer, in Spanish between pared and muro.|$|E
50|$|Because felling {{required}} such {{an extraordinary}} amount of work, if only planks for housing were needed, these would be split from the living tree. The bark was stripped and saved, and two cuts were made at the ends of the planking. Then wedges would be pounded in along the sides and the planks slowly split {{off the side of the}} tree. Trees which have been so harvested are still visible in some places in the rainforest, with obvious chunks taken off of their sides. Such trees usually continue to grow perfectly well, since redcedar wood is resistant to decay. Planks are straightened by a variety of methods, including weighing them down with stones, lashing them together with rope, or forcing them between a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shaunce worked mostly alone but {{received}} some assistance {{from a friend}} named Malcom Smith. They dug with pickaxes and a gad, using gunpowder to loosen the harder rock of the lower layers. Shaunce used a plumb-bob to ensure that he was keeping the shaft perfectly straight, and a windlass to haul out the broken rock. Shaunce calculated where to begin digging the horizontal tunnel by standing across the water and sighting with his rifle directly below {{the top of the}} shaft. He dug in from the riverbank, using a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> to maintain his alignment. When he first broke through from the horizontal tunnel {{to the bottom of the}} shaft, a blast of air knocked Shaunce unconscious and collapsed one of his lungs.|$|E
40|$|It is {{just over}} forty {{years since the}} start of the {{excavations}} of the Ascott-under-Wychwood long barrow (1965 - 69) under the direction of Don Benson. The excavations belonged to the latter part of a great period of barrow digging in southern Britain, which was ending just as, by striking contrast, intensified investigation and fieldwork at causewayed enclosures were beginning. Although a long gap has passed since the excavations took place, they have nonetheless produced a rich and important set of results, and the analysis has been enhanced by more recent techniques. The site now joins Burn Ground and Hazleton North as one of only three Cotswold long barrows or cairns to have been more or less fully excavated. The barrow had been built in two main stages, in a series of bays defined by <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>stakes</b> and stone, and filled mainly with earth and turf, with some stone; it was enclosed or faced by stone walling, the outermost being of very fine quality. The barrow contained two opposed pairs of stone cists, each with a short passage from the long sides of the monument. The cists and passages contained the remains of some 21 people (of all ages and both sexes), probably deposited in a variety of forms from fleshed inhumations to incomplete secondary remains and cremations. The barrow was built in the 38 th century cal BC and was probably one of the earliest such constructions in the region. It was probably in use for only three to five generations, lasting into the 37 th century cal BC. Occupation features from the early fourth millennium cal BC included small pits, hearths and two small timber post structures, and there were finds of pottery, flint, axe fragments, stone querns and animal bone. People used cattle, sheep and pigs, and there is a range of wild species, especially in the midden. The authors of this report not only document the finds and research, but also address wider questions of how the early Neolithic inhabitants viewed their society through the barrow, and how the development of the site reflected memory and interaction with a changing world...|$|R
50|$|The {{next morning}} the island is visited by Yuruzh, chief of the Záva, ostensibly to visit the oracle, but {{actually}} to contest the Daryava invasion, of {{which he has been}} informed by the Virgin of Zesh. He reprimands Kuroki for having withheld the intelligence. Yuruzh is much more human-looking {{than the rest of the}} apelike Záva, and Althea finds herself attracted to him. The invasion fleet is sighted, and she is recruited to set a trap for the enemy. At Yuruzh's direction, she swims out to the flagship pretending to have escaped the chief and claiming that he is on Zesh with just a few followers. Sofkar, the Dasht of Darya, has her bound to the mast with orders that she be killed if her story proves false, and takes his ships into the harbor. They founder on a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> submerged <b>stakes</b> set by Záva hiding in the water, who then swarm aboard. Yuruzh takes the Dasht captive and rescues Althea as his main fleet issues forth from Zá to take the Daryava from behind. After the battle the people of Elysion, having overthrown Kuroki, deliver him to Yuruzh to assuage his displeasure with the colony.|$|R
50|$|In medieval warfare, {{sharp and}} sturdy stakes were buried {{at the bottom}} <b>of</b> long <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> ditches, pointed end up diagonally, {{in order to prevent}} cavalry charges in a given area.

Because the foundation is very soft, the layers of timber are very deep. A, the central oblong portion, consists of a platform of round logs cut in lengths of 1.2m to 1.8m, possibly the floor of the hut B, a collection of stones with marks of fire on them C, a heap of stiff clay; D, the root of a large tree nearly buried in the peat, the surface of the wood bevelled off, so as to form a sort of table, under which was foimd a considerable quantity of bones, apparently those of deer and swine.|$|E
