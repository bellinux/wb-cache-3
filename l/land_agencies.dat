Second, he proposed to discover how federal agencies had respected the Sullivan Line. Catron noted that territorial governments and federal <b>land</b> <b>agencies</b> had all used the Sullivan Line as the Missouri boundary, and that land sales agents in Missouri and the various territories had been equally respectful of the line as the state's border. Third, Catron noted that the United States had respected the Sullivan Line in establishing the borders of the various territories north of Missouri.|$|E
2500|$|Eroding soils or poorly {{maintained}} {{construction sites}} can {{often lead to}} increased sedimentation in runoff. [...] Sedimentation often settles {{to the bottom of}} water bodies and can directly affect water quality. Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil. [...] These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth. [...] Limited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire aquatic ecosystem due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves. Excessive levels of sediment and suspended solids have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well. [...] Sedimentation can increase runoff by plugging underground injection systems, thereby increasing the amount of runoff on the surface. [...] Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoirs. [...] This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public <b>land</b> <b>agencies</b> while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.|$|E
