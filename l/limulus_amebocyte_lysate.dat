The inflammation-induced {{increase in}} permeability of the bronchoalveolar epithelial barrier {{is supposed to}} cause a leakage of pneumoproteins. Therefore, their concentrations are expected to increase in the bloodstream. This study aimed at examining the association between occupational exposure to endotoxin and a serum pneumoprotein, surfactant protein A, to look for nonoccupational factors capable of confounding this association, and examine the relation between surfactant protein A and spirometry. There were 369 control subjects, 325 wastewater workers, and 84 garbage collectors in the study. Exposure to endotoxin was assessed through personal sampling and the <b>Limulus</b> <b>amebocytes</b> <b>lysate</b> assay.

Exposure was fairly high during some tasks in wastewater workers but did not influence surfactant protein A. Surfactant protein A was lower in asthmatics. Interindividual variability was large. No correlation with spirometry was found. Endotoxin {{has no effect on}} surfactant protein A at these endotoxin levels and serum surfactant protein A does not correlate with spirometry.

The virulent isolate of H. pleuropneumoniae had a distinct, adherent capsule. The avirulent isolate had a fragile, easily removed capsule. Capsular material (CM) and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were isolated from each bacterial isolate and were compared biochemically and biologically. CM from both isolates contained carbohydrates, no detectable protein, and no detectable to trace amounts of lipid A. Each LPS contained heptose, hexose, galactose, glucosamine, 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate, and lipid A.

50|$|Currently, {{the method}} of choice for {{endotoxin}} detection is the <b>Limulus</b> <b>Amebocyte</b> <b>Lysate</b> (LAL) test. This test is based on Dr. Frederik Bang's http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/sphheros/default.cfm?detail=17 observation that horseshoe crab blood forms clots when exposed to endotoxins. Amoebocyte extract from horseshoe crab blood is mixed with a sample suspected of endotoxin contamination, and a reaction is observed if endotoxins are present. The FDA has approved four variations of the LAL test: gel-clot, turbidimetric, colorimetric, and chromogenic assay. The differences in these variations refer to {{the characteristics of the}} amoebocyte/endtoxin reaction (e.g. gel-clot produces a precipitate and colorimetric changes color). This test is fast (approx. 30 minutes) and highly sensitive (up to 0.001 EU/ml sensitivity). However, because it only detects LPS endotoxins, some pyrogenic materials can be missed. Also, certain conditions (sub-optimal pH conditions or unsuitable cation concentration) can lead to false negatives. Glucans from carbohydrate chromatography matrices can also lead to false positives.|$|E

Western blots using monoclonal antibodies revealed the presence of pertussis toxin, pertactin, and fimbriae 3. The <b>Limulus</b> <b>Amebocyte</b> Lisate (LAL) assay showed endotoxin levels lower than those reported for whole cell pertussis licensed vaccines, while the Pyrogen Test indicated 75 ng/mL/Kg. The PL showed high protection capacity in mouse challenge models. There was 89. 7 % survival in the intracerebral challenge and total reduction of the number of CFU in the intranasal challenge. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed between mice immunized with B. pertussis PL and the Cuban DTwP vaccine, whichever challenge model used. These results encouraged us to continue the development of the B. pertussis PL as a component of a new combined vaccine formulated with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids or as a booster dose for adolescents and adults. </p...|$|R
