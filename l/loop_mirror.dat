For example, for material processing with high-power lasers, closed <b>loop</b> <b>mirror</b> galvanometer mechanisms are used with servo control systems. These are typically high power galvanometers and the newest galvanometers designed for beam steering applications can have frequency responses over 10 kHz with appropriate servo technology. Closed-loop mirror galvanometers are also used in similar ways in stereolithography, laser sintering, laser engraving, laser beam welding, laser TVs, laser displays and in imaging applications such as retinal scanning with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Almost all of these galvanometers are of the moving magnet type.|$|E
5000|$|G. H. Mead {{said that}} a gesture is {{significant}} when it arouses in the person making it the same response it arouses in others (which explains why gestures occur face-to-face and over the phone but not to a tape recorder). [...] According to Mead's <b>Loop,</b> <b>mirror</b> neurons underwent a [...] "twist" [...] whereby they came to respond to one’s own gestures as if they came from someone else: this is what evolved. The [...] "twist" [...] works because it brings the significance of one’s own gestures into the same {{areas of the brain}} where speech is being orchestrated. Gesture imagery co-opts the orchestration of speech. The result is units of speech and gesture as the GP envisions. Uniquely in the animal kingdom, gestures came to orchestrate movements of the vocal tract, transforming the [...] "vegetative" [...] system of eating and breathing into an organ of speaking. According to Mead's Loop, this role of imagery in speech orchestration is a major reason why we gesture as we speak.|$|E
