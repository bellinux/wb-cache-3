30|$|Lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is defined as}} a clinical symptom complex that includes low back pain, bilateral lower extremity pain, paresthesias, and other neurologic deficits. It occurs due to anatomic narrowing of the neural pathway through the spine, which may be centrally located in the spinal canal or positioned more laterally in the <b>lateral</b> <b>recesses</b> or neuroforamina. It is postulated that degenerative lumbar stenosis occurs in a high-risk spine with some underlying congenital predisposition [18], but this has not been proven. The anatomic changes result from a cascade of events that include intervertebral disk degeneration, facet joint arthrosis, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [1, 3]. As a result, the biomechanical characteristics of the spinal segment are altered, which further perpetuates a cycle of degenerative changes.|$|R

Ultrasonography of knee joints was performed with Diasonics (USA, 1997) by the linear sensor with frequency of 7 MHz. The protocol of ultrasonic examination of knee joints was filled for each pt.

40|$|The shallow lateral rece&ses of the trefoil {{shape of}} the lumbar spinal canal have been implicated in the {{production}} of the spinal stenosis syndrome. In the present study, 485 skeletons of South African Blacks and Whites were examined in order to establish the incidence and possible genesis of the trefoil configuration. The overall incidence was 14 per cent, with lktle variation between the sexes or races. The incidence was not related to increasing age, measured stenosis of the spinal canal or osteophytosis. Of 74 trefoil-shaped vertebrae, 68 (92 per cent) were found at the fifth lumbar level. It is suggested that the trefoil configuration is a common non-pathological condition, usually of the fifth lumbar vertebral canal, and is probably a developmental variation of normal anatomy. The {{shape of the}} human upper lumbar vertebral canal is almost circular and this changes gradually to a triangular shape in the lower lumbar vertebrae (New-man 1 976; Eisenstein 1 977). The lumbar vertebrae thus provide an appropriate transition between the obviously circular shape of the thoracic vertebral canal and the markedly triangular shape of the sacral spinal canal.

5000|$|A {{laminotomy}} {{is typically}} used to relieve {{pressure from the}} spinal canal. Excessive pressure in the spinal canal causes the spinal canal and spinal nerves to be compressed which can be very painful and can impair motor control and/or sensation. A common disorder that causes increased pressure in the spinal canal is lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is formally defined as a decline in diameter length of either the neural foramina, <b>lateral</b> <b>recess,</b> or spinal canal. Stenosis is classified as a decaying disease because it causes the canal to gradually {{become more and more}} narrow which can cause pain or loss of function. Common symptoms of lumbar stenosis are pain, fatigue, weakness of the muscle and numbness. Stenosis can be caused by old age or an injury to the vertebral column and usually requires a CT scan or MRI to diagnose. Performing a laminotomy can relieve pressure in the spinal canal caused by lumbar stenosis and therefore alleviate symptoms.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO. Testar a hipótese de uma reserva anatomofuncional no canal raquidiano que explique as elevadas prevalências de alterações radiológicas na coluna lombar de indivíduos assintomáticos, as diferentes formas de apresentação clínica das lombalgias e lombociatalgias mecânico-degenerativas e as discrepâncias na sua prevalência. CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODOS. Dois grupos de pessoas foram submetidos à tomografia axial computadorizada. Um era de 27 pacientes com lombalgia e/ou lombociatalgia. O outro, de controles pareados, era de 27 indivíduos assintomáticos. Em ambos os grupos, foram medidas as áreas do canal ósseo, do saco dural, a distância interfacetária e a profundidade dos recessos laterais. RESULTADOS. Os assintomáticos tinham canais raquidianos mais amplos que o de pacientes agudos e crônicos. As variáveis, cujas comparações foram responsáveis por essas diferenças estatisticamente significantes nos crônicos, foram as áreas do canal ósseo em L 3 -L 4, L 4 -L 5, as áreas do saco dural em L 4 -L 5, L 5 -S 1 e a profundidade dos recessos laterais em L 4 -L 5; e nos agudos: a área do canal ósseo em L 3 -L 4, L 4 -L 5, L 5 -S 1, área do saco dural em L 4 -L 5, L 5 -S 1, o diâmetro sagital em L 5 -S 1 e a profundidade do recesso lateral direito em L 4 -L 5. CONCLUSÕES. As alterações radiológicas e ausência de sintomas no grupo-controle foram atribuídas a uma maior reserva anatomofuncional no canal raquidiano; a existência de casos agudos e crônicos, a uma reserva menor. Esta reserva, maior ou menor, seria um "fator segurança" que se distribuiria diferencialmente em assintomáticos, agudos e crônicos, e seria o elemento capaz de influenciar a prevalência, a presença ou ausência de dor lombar em indivíduos com alterações radiológicas. OBJECTIVE. To {{test the}} hipothesis of an {{anatomic}} and functional reserve in the spinal canal {{that explains the}} radiological changes in lumbar spine of asymptomatic individuals, the differences in modalities of clinical presentation and the discrepancies in the prevalence of mechanical and degenerative low back pain and sciaticas. CASES AND METHODS [...] Two groups of 27 persons were submitted to computed axial tomography. In one group, the patients presented low back pain and/or sciaticas. The other formed by matched controlls, showed no signs or symptoms. The bony canal area, dural sac area, interfacets distance and <b>lateral</b> <b>recesses</b> depth were quantitative assessed. RESULTS. The asymptomatics ones had larger bony canals than the acute and chronic patients, due to statistical significant differences. The ranges responsible for these differences and whose averages had higher figures in the asymptomatics ones {{in relation to the}} chronic patients, were the bony canal areas at L 3 -L 4, L 4 -L 5, the dural sac area and <b>lateral</b> <b>recesses</b> depth at L 4 -L 5; in relation to acute ones: the bony canal areas at L 3 -L 4, L 4 -L 5, L 5 -S 1, dural sac area at L 4 -L 5, L 5 -S 1, and sagittal diameter L 5 -S 1 and <b>lateral</b> <b>recesses</b> depth at L 4 -L 5. CONCLUSIONS. The radiological changes in asymptomatic ones, the lack of symptoms in the control group, the presence of chronic and acute features and the discrepancies in the prevalence of low back pain were attributed to the existence of an anatomic and functional reserve. This reserve would be determined by the presence of a "safety factor" which would have differential distribution in asymptomatics, acute and chronic.

Many of these non-tumor ABI patients were able to achieve better than 50% recognition of sentences presented in quiet and could even achieve conversational use of the telephone. [...] This result suggested that the ABI device and electrode placement in the <b>lateral</b> <b>recess</b> of the IV ventricle was capable of providing good speech recognition. The limited speech understanding observed in NF2 ABI patients was thus thought {{to be due to}} negative factors related to NF2. However, new results in NF2 ABI patients have also showed excellent speech recognition, suggesting that the cause of improved speech understanding was not related to NF2 alone. Prior to surgery, some NF2 patients have normal hearing and speech recognition in the tumor ear even with a large tumor, suggesting that the presence of the tumor itself does not necessarily cause an auditory deficit. The loss of hearing and speech recognition in most NF2 patients {{may be due to the}} tumor interfering with the blood supply to the cochlea, VIIIn, and/or cochlear nucleus. In addition, physical compression by the tumor of the nerve and brainstem might impair neural excitability. The recently observed improvement in NF2 ABI speech recognition may be due to differences in patient etiology, surgical technique, damage to the brainstem before and during tumor removal, or electrode placement, device design, signal processing, or other factors.|$|E

One hundred patients presenting with low back pain or sciatica were studied with CT. In each of the L 3, L 4 and L 5 vertebra three slices were taken with the following measurements: 1.
