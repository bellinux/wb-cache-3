From 2010 — 2015, an extensive camera-trapping study in the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS) monitored wildlife utilisation of a <b>lowland</b> <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> corridor. This effort, culminating in nearly 600, 000 images, was the longest running cameratrapping study in the Sanctuary, and documented 11 small carnivore species over 24, 506 trap nights. The Malay Civet Viverra tangalunga was the most frequently detected species, followed by the Malay Badger Mydaus javanensis and the Common Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus. The survey also collected the first photographic record of an Otter Civet Cynogale bennettii in the LKWS, which represents a new locality for this little-known Southeast Asian species. Opportunistic sightings of five additional species, including the Endangered Flat-headed Cat Prionailurus planiceps, increased the total count of small carnivores persisting in the LKWS to 16.

Their impacts on ecosystem representation are substantial {{on top of the}} modifications to coastal and lowland environments because of their accessibility and value for agriculture and settlement (Walker et al. 2006). <b>Lowland</b> <b>riparian</b> <b>forests,</b> in particular, are one of New Zealand’s most threatened ecosystems (Park 1983; Anon. 2000).

As a result, > 53 % of the alluvial floodplains are now in pasture up to the river’s edge and only small patches of original forest remain on farmland (Miller 2002). The impacts from agricultural developments were most intensive in the central and northern West Coast (McSweeney 1982), but the steep gorge environment and difficult access has minimised such land-use changes in the Mokihinui gorge and thereby preserved vegetation types that may once have occurred in other catchments.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of global climate {{disruption}} on biodiversity is important to future conservation efforts. While taxonomic diversity is widely studied, functional diversity of plants, and recently animals, is receiving increasing attention. Most studies of mammals are short-term, focus on temperate habitats, and rely on traits described in the literature rather than generating traits from observations. Unlike previous studies, this long-term field study assessed the factors driving the functional and taxonomic diversity of small-mammal assemblages in dry tropical forests using both traits recorded from literature and a demographic database. We assessed the drivers (abundance and biomass, temperature and rainfall) of taxonomic richness and functional diversity for two rain-driven seasons in two adjacent but distinct forests-upland and <b>lowland</b> (arroyo or <b>riparian)</b> <b>forests.</b> Our analysis found that rainfall, both seasonal and atypical, was the primary factor driving functional and taxonomic diversity of small-mammal assemblages. Functional responses differed between {{the two types of}} forests, however, with effects being stronger in the harsher conditions of the upland forests than in the less severe conditions prevailing in the arroyo (<b>riparian)</b> <b>forest.</b> The latter also supports a richer, more diverse, and more stable small-mammal assemblage. These findings highlight the importance of climate to tropical biological diversity, as extreme climate events (hurricanes, droughts and floods) and disruption of rainfall patterns were shown to decrease biodiversity. They also support the need to preserve these habitats, as their high taxonomic diversity and functional redundancy makes them resilient against global climate disruption and local extreme events. Tropical dry forests constitute a potential reservoir for biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide.

40|$|ABSTRACT) <b>Riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are {{integral}} {{components of the}} landscape. The inherent biogeochemical processes that occur in such forests provide numerous benefits to wildlife and society.

This study was implemented on the Savannah River Site, an Environmental Research Park, where several <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> are recovering from thermal disturbances. The streams in these forests were subjected to thermal discharges that increased flows and resulted in removal of soil and a decline in the amount of woody vegetation.

Composition and species richness of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> were studied at 16 sites located along an altitudinal gradient and TSS was determined from water samples collected in each site.

A sugar cane field adjacent to a strip of young <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> bordering an older <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> along a stream was used to study the <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> as a buffer zone to prevent pesticides pollution. Concentrations of the herbicides diuron, hexazinone and tebuthiuron were determined in different soil layers of a Red Yellow Oxisol during 2003 and 2004.

Measurements of hydromorphological conditions and <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> cover across different buffer widths for 59  ×  103 river stretches covering 230  ×  103 km of the French river network were coupled with data for physicochemical and biotic variables taken from the national monitoring network.

Differences were also observed in LWD abundance, volume, frequency of LWD pools with subunits and area and volume of LWD pools.
