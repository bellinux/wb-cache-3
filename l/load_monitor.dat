Referable to the recent growth in the demand for electricity and shortage in production, it is indispensable to develop strategies for effective energy management and system delivery. <b>Load</b> <b>monitoring</b> such as intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring,</b> non-intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and identification of domestic electrical appliances is proposed especially at the residential level {{since it is the}} major energy consumer. The intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> provides accurate results and would allow each individual appliance's energy consumption to be transmitted to a central hub. Nevertheless, there are many practical disadvantages to this method that have motivated the introduction of non-intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. The fiscal cost of manufacturing and installing enough monitoring devices to match the number of domestic appliances {{is considered to be a}} disadvantage. In addition, the installation of one meter per household appliances would lead to congestion in the house and thus cause inconvenience to the occupants of the house, therefore, non-intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> technique was developed to alleviate the aforementioned challenges of intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Non-intrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> (NILM) is the process of disaggregating a household’s total energy consumption into its contributing appliances. The total household <b>load</b> is <b>monitored</b> via a single monitoring device such as smart meter (SM). NILM provides cost effective and convenient means of <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> and identification. Several nonintrusive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> and identification techniques are reviewed. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive system that can identify appliances with small energy consumption, appliances with overlapping energy consumption and a group of appliance ranges at once. This has been the major setback to most of the adopted techniques. In this dissertation, we propose techniques that overcome these setbacks by combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with a developed algorithm to identify appliances ranges that contribute to the energy consumption within a given period of time usually an hour interval...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, viral load is {{routinely}} measured to detect failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and guide switching to second-line ART. Viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> is not generally available in resource-limited settings. We examined switching from nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) -based first-line regimens to protease inhibitor-based regimens in Africa, South America and Asia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicohort study of 17 ART programmes. All sites monitored CD 4 cell count and {{had access to}} second-line ART and 10 sites <b>monitored</b> viral <b>load.</b> We compared times to switching, CD 4 cell counts at switching and obtained adjusted hazard ratios for switching (aHRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects Weibull models. RESULTS: A total of 20 113 patients, including 6369 (31. 7 %) patients from 10 programmes with access to viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring,</b> were analysed; 576 patients (2. 9 %) switched. Low CD 4 cell counts at ART initiation were associated with switching in all programmes. Median time to switching was 16. 3 months [interquartile range (IQR) 10. 1 - 26. 6] in programmes with viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> and 21. 8 months (IQR 14. 0 - 21. 8) in programmes without viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> (P < 0. 001). Median CD 4 cell counts at switching were 161 cells/microl (IQR 77 - 265) in programmes with viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> and 102 cells/microl (44 - 181) in programmes without viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> (P < 0. 001). Switching was more common in programmes with viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> during months 7 - 18 after starting ART (aHR 1. 38; 95 % CI 0. 97 - 1. 98), similar during months 19 - 30 (aHR 0. 97; 95 % CI 0. 58 - 1. 60) and less common during months 31 - 42 (aHR 0. 29; 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 79). CONCLUSION: In resource-limited settings, switching to second-line regimens tends to occur earlier and at higher CD 4 cell counts in ART programmes with viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> compared with programmes without viral <b>load</b> <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R

5000|$|This is {{especially}} important because it allows safe [...] "lights-out machining", in which the operators set up the job and start it running during the day, then go home for the night, leaving the machines running and cutting parts during the night.

When it senses overload condition, which semantically suggests a dull or broken tool, it commands a stop to the machining.

40|$|Existing <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{methods for}} {{induction}} machines are generally effective, but suffer from sensitivity problems at low speeds and non-linearity problems at high supply frequencies. This study proposes a new noninvasive <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> method based on giant magnetoresistance flux sensors to trace stray flux leaking from induction motors. Finite element analysis {{is applied to}} analyse stray flux features of test machines. Contrary to the conventional methods of measuring stator and/or rotator rotor voltage and current, the proposed method measures the dynamic magnetic field at specific locations and provides time-spectrum features (e. g. spectrograms), response time load and stator/rotor characteristics. Three induction motors with different starting loading profiles are tested at two separate test benches and their results are analysed in the time-frequency domain. Their steady features and dynamic load response time through spectrograms under variable loads are extracted to correlate with load variations based on spectrogram information. In addition, the transient stray flux spectrogram and time information are more effective for <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> than steady state information from numerical and experimental studies. The proposed method is {{proven to be a}} low-cost and non-invasive method for induction machine <b>load</b> <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R
