Myocardial contractility was quantitated with load-independent indexes using the end-systolic pressure-dimension relation (Emax) and the relation of rate-corrected velocity of shortening to end-systolic wall stress. Myocardial <b>loading</b> <b>status</b> {{was determined by the}} direct measurement of afterload (end-systolic wall stress) and the functional quantitation of preload (differences between the relation of fractional shortening and velocity of shortening to end-systolic stress). Most patients (55 %) were found to have abnormal ejection phase indexes of ventricular function either before or after entry into dialysis. However, contractility was normal in all subjects at each of their evaluations, and no change in contractility was found after dialysis or transplantation. <b>Loading</b> <b>status</b> was highly variable and usually abnormal before transplantation and accounted entirely for the abnormalities of fractional shortening and velocity of shortening. Transplantation invariably resulted in normalization of <b>loading</b> <b>status</b> and ejection phase indexes of ventricular function. In these children and young adults with uremia, abnormal ejection phase indexes of ventricular function were frequent and caused by associated abnormalities in ventricular loading.

Morphological assessment demonstrated an increase of type I oxidative fiber content and cross-sectional area in ALCAR-treated animals both in normal-loading and in unloading conditions. ALCAR prevented loss of mitochondrial mass in unloaded animals whereas no ALCAR-dependent increase of mitochondrial mass occurred in normal-loaded muscle.

Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trajectory can provide unprecedented insight into many aspects of city life. But analysing these data presents many challenges. Visualization of taxi data is {{an efficient way to}} represent its distributions and structures and reveal hidden patterns in the data.

We examined whether sustained changes in baroreceptor <b>loading</b> <b>status</b> during prolonged postexercise recovery can alter the metaboreceptors’ influence on heat loss. Thirteen young males performed a 1 -min isometric handgrip exercise (IHG) at 60 % maximal voluntary contraction followed by 2 -min of forearm ischemia (to activate metaboreceptors) before and 15, 30, 45 and 60 -min after a 15 -min intense treadmill running exercise (> 90 % maximal heart rate) in the heat (35 °C). This procedure was repeated on three separate days with the application of lower-body positive (LBPP, + 40 mmHg), negative (LBNP, - 20 mmHg), or no pressure (Control) postexercise. Sweat rate (ventilated capsule; forearm, chest, upper back) and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; forearm, upper back) were measured. Relative to pre-IHG levels, sweating at all sites increased during IHG and remained elevated during ischemia at baseline and similarly at 30, 45, and 60 -min postexercise (site average sweat rate increase during ischemia: Control, 0. 13 ± 0. 02; LBPP, 0. 12 ± 0. 02; LBNP, 0. 15 ± 0. 02 mg·min- 1 ·cm- 2; all P 0. 10). LBPP and LBNP application did not modulate the pattern of sweating to IHG and ischemia (all P> 0. 05). At 15 -min postexercise, forearm CVC was reduced from pre-IHG levels during both IHG and ischemia under LBNP only (ischemia: 3. 9 ± 0. 8 %CVCmax; P< 0. 02). Therefore, we show metaboreceptors modulate postexercise sweating in the mid-to-late stages (30 - 60 min) of recovery, independent of baroreceptor <b>loading</b> <b>status</b> and similarly between skin sites.

40|$|The load of a {{computer}} is an important metric and is useful in many applications, such as balancing load across heterogeneous computers. In this paper, a new metric for characterizing the load of a uniprocessor computer is studied. This metric {{is defined as a}} ratio of the average waiting time experienced by computing jobs to the average idle time of the processor. The definition of the new load metric is based on two important observations: 1) the average idle time between serving consecutive computing tasks shrinks as the load becomes heavier; 2) the average waiting time experienced by computing jobs increases as the load becomes heavier. The new load metric aims to being able to compare different <b>load</b> <b>status</b> of a single-server system— the typical abstraction of a uniprocessor computer. The validity of comparing two different <b>load</b> <b>status</b> using the new load metric is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
