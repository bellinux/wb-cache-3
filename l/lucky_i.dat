I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're <b>lucky.</b> <b>I</b> hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} the lyrics, Streisand opens the song by humming the first few lines ("Badodiodiodi / Odiodo"), {{followed}} by the chorus, where she questions, [...] "Gee, whee, wow, how lucky? / How lucky can you get?". The short musical interlude in [...] "How Lucky Can You Get" [...] switches from a four-bar to an eight-bar phrase, just as it [...] "returns to its original key" [...] and the lyrics become [...] "outwardly straightforward". During the final two verses of the song, Streisand talks to herself and questions, [...] "Hey there, gorgeous! / Big success! / What's your secret? / Just <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> guess". James Leve, who wrote the biography book Kander and Ebb, referred to these lyrics as ironic and claimed that the music that accompanies the aforementioned four lines was borrowed from Giacomo Puccini's 1896 opera, La bohème.|$|E

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E
