The first analysis is based on European Social Survey data for the years 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, capturing recent trends in occupational dynamics.

The use of a quasi-experimental design is made possible through the comparison of wages before and after deregulation among drivers in the previously regulated for-hire sector, drivers in unregulated private carriage, and an economy-wide group of male non-driver non-professionals. Deregulation is associated with approximately a 15 percent relative wage decline among drivers employed in the for-hire sector, resulting primarily from decreases in union wages and a shift from high-wage union to <b>low-wage</b> nonunion <b>employment.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to wage losses among for-hire union drivers, losses among nonunion drivers relative to workers economy-wide are small.

40|$|Homecare is a {{major source}} of women’s <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> the UK. Practices of unpaid working time are {{widespread}} and many workers are not paid in accordance with their existing national minimum wage entitlements. On 1 April 2015, a new duty of well-being in social care came into force and local authorities are required to promote the control of care by service-users. As a consequence, homecare workers will increasingly be engaged in complex multi-lateral work relations and subject to multi-party control. This article examines how the national minimum wage entitlements of homecare workers have been legally interpreted and questions if their entitlements might be adversely affected under provisions of the Care Act 2014. There is a legacy of judicial decision-making in which care-giving is not recognised as ‘work’ {{for the purposes of the}} national minimum wage. Yet recent decisions have produced a more satisfactory entitlement framework by establishing that employer control over working time determines ‘work’. However, it seems this framework is put at risk by the statutory promotion of service-user control. As work relations are re-cast, contractual relationships in which care-giving falls outside the protection of national minimum wage law will appear increasingly attractive because they may both enhance service-user control and facilitate very low cost labour. Without innovation in legal treatments of multi-party control and sustained attention to the worth of care-giving as employment, the rights of homecare workers are at risk under the Care Act 2014...|$|E

40|$|Low-wage {{employment}} {{is one of}} the main origins of poverty and social exclusion in Portugal, along with low pensions granted to elder citizens. In this paper our aim is to provide a first approach of the social dimension of <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> Portugal, analysing its incidence and profile among regions, sectors, professions, skill levels and gender. This decomposition analysis will stress the most important factors underlying the phenomenon. At a first stage we shall study wage structure and wage inequality evolution in the last decade. The incidence and evolution of low wages and minimum legal wages will be compared whith average wages, in order to evaluate the situation of the low payed vis a vis the other better paid workers. We proceed analysing low-wage decomposition by the criteria mentioned above, taken separately and in interaction, to identify the main determinants and the cumulative effects of these factors in the explanation and evolution of low wages. The main data set available is "Quadros de Pessoal" (Data base of worker characteristics provided by firms) from the MESS (Employment and Social Security Ministry). In this study we will use directly this data base. Other statistical sources will also be used for complementary aspects. We must say that the data on these area of research are still insufficiently developed in Portugal, and that, in consequence, socio-economic knowledge on low-wage employment as a mechanism of social exclusion is still incipient. Low-wage are but one of the dimensions of social exclusion, closely related with poverty as insufficient economic resources, and is often associated with other dimensions of social exclusion in the labour market, such as unemployment vulnerability and job instability. The crucial role in this triad - low-pay, unemployment, job instability - is played by skill levels, which are particularly low in our country, as we?ll try to demonstrate. Social exclusion must however be analysed at the family unit. As long as income is concerned, wages are far the most important source, particularly for low income active families, and the ?low skills - low pay - low income? chain seems to be the major determinant of social exclusion. The evidence about this mechanism can be found in recent data on Family Budgets. ...|$|E

Second, we examine the determinants of being <b>in</b> <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> for the individual worker, and we analyze whether there exists a type of "poverty trap" as a result of which earnings mobility is lacking and some workers persist in low-paid jobs for a long period of time. To achieve this we use two datasets: the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) for the period 1995 - 2001, and the Arbeidsvoorwaarden Onderzoek (Labor Conditions Survey, AVO) of the Dutch Labor Inspectorate for 2002. We utilize the longitudinal aspect of the ECHP to analyze the evolution of <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> over time, by looking at different individual and job characteristics. Finally, we complete the analysis on <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> with an examination of the role of the firm using the detailed information provided by the AVO...|$|R
40|$|<b>Low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> {{has become}} a matter of concern in many countries, Portugal being among them. In particular, the extent to which <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment</b> is a {{permanent}} or transitory situation is an important issue. This paper examines low-wage mobility in the Portuguese labour market using the bivariate probit model proposed by van de Ven and van Praag (1981), in order to account for the potential endogeneity of the initial state. For this purpose, we use a matched employer-employee panel data for 1996 and 2000. Raw figures show that a significant number of workers are trapped into <b>low-wage</b> <b>employment.</b> We also find that males and the better-educated are more likely to escape from such a situation. Furthermore, initial firm characteristics, such as firm size, age and industry influence mobility. In particular, low-wage workers in larger or in newer firms have better mobility prospects.

The National Coal Board, created in 1947, tried to modernise the Welsh coal industry but the number of pits in South Wales shrank from 115 in 1953, producing almost 21 million tons, to 34 in 1981, producing 7.7 million tons. Pembrokeshire and Swansea Bay became centres of the petrochemical industry and new light industry was attracted to locations throughout Wales. Wales attracted an above average share of the foreign direct investment (FDI) into the UK from the 1970s onwards but many of the new plants established by foreign firms were essentially [...] "branch factory" [...] operations offering <b>low-wage,</b> low-skill <b>employment</b> opportunities. <b>In</b> 1971 Sir Julian Hodge founded the Commercial Bank of Wales (later renamed Bank of Wales) but the company was later taken over by HBOS and the brand dropped in 2002.|$|R
