5|$|Frederic G. Kenyon {{opposed to}} the Burkit's view and argued that Cyril firmly {{believed}} in the Egyptian origin of the codex. A. S. Fulton, the Keeper of the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts (in British Museum), in 1938 re-examined the Athanasius note, and gave it as his opinion that on palaeographical grounds it could be dated 13th to 14th century and that the 17th century was excluded. In 1945 T. D. Moschonas published a catalogue of the library of the Patriarch of Alexandria, in which he printed two Greek notes, both from 10th-century manuscripts of John Chrysostom, inserted by the Patriarch Athanasius III. The two notes must have been written between 1308 and 1316. Although the note in the Codex Alexandrinus is entirely in Arabic, and therefore no identity of hand the Greek notes can be expected, the similarity of wording <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> doubt that this also {{is the work of}} Athanasius III.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and <b>leaves.</b> <b>No</b> other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace State Advocate Program assists {{interested}} <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace {{educators and}} volunteers with their local {{effort to promote}} and teach minimum impact outdoor ethics. These active State Advocate volunteers are {{a key part of}} the <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace program because they coordinate outreach, education and training in their respective states. The State Advocates support volunteers with <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace training, increase on-the-ground awareness and attend events to further the <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace program and mission. The State Advocates have been instrumental in building communities of volunteers and educators, state-by-state.|$|R

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{function}} of chemical nomenclature {{is to ensure}} that a spoken or written chemical name <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> ambiguity concerning which chemical compound the name refers to: each chemical name should refer to a single substance.

25|$|The {{evidence}} is, in fact, absolutely conclusive {{that the}} Standard Oil Co. charges altogether excessive prices where it meets no competition, and particularly {{where there is}} little likelihood of competitors entering the field, and that, on the other hand, where competition is active, it frequently cuts prices to a point which leaves even the Standard little or no profit, and which more often <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> profit to the competitor, whose costs are ordinarily somewhat higher.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} {{there must be}} a minimum of two wrestlers ranked at sekiwake. If {{circumstances}} require, this can rise typically to three or four. The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> obvious candidates to fill the rank. This luck factor is less common than it is for komusubi promotions.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace Master Educator Course is {{typically}} {{five days in}} length and designed {{for people who are}} actively teaching others outdoor skills or providing recreation information to the public. The Master Educator Course provides participants with a comprehensive overview of <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace skills and ethics through practical application in a field-based setting. The first day is spent in a classroom introducing the course and schedule, providing in-depth information on the overall <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace program and the Center for Outdoor Ethics, reviewing gear, and packing. The remaining days are spent in the field on a short backcountry trip learning and practicing the principles of <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace. Each course is staffed with a minimum of two experienced outdoor professionals who are Master Educator Instructors.|$|R
50|$|Since 1994, a <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace {{program has}} been managed by the <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics. The <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, a 501(c)(3) {{non-profit}} organization, {{is dedicated to the}} responsible enjoyment and active stewardship of the outdoors worldwide. The Center's mission is to teach people how to enjoy the outdoors responsibly. This mission is accomplished through education, research, volunteerism and partnerships. <b>Leave</b> <b>No</b> Trace tries to build awareness, appreciation and respect for wildlands. Since its founding in 1994, the Center has provided training in every state in the U.S. and over 25 countries. There are more than 25,000 active volunteers and members who help provide training and outreach that impacts more than 22 million people annually in the U.S. alone.|$|R
25|$|As a {{toxic gas}} that <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> residue on items it contacts, {{ethylene}} oxide is a surface disinfectant that {{is widely used}} in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. It is so extremely flammable and explosive that it {{is used as a}} main component of thermobaric weapons; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.|$|E

25|$|Romania {{is among}} the last {{countries}} in the European Union that does not recognize any form of civil union between people of the same sex. The Constitution of Romania defines the family as a freely consented marriage between spouses, without specifying their gender. Despite this, legislation in effect <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> room for interpretation for representatives of marital status. Marriage can only be the union of one man and one woman, and a same-sex couple can not legally receive state protection as a family.|$|E

25|$|We {{know little}} {{about the timing of}} language's {{emergence}} in our species. Unlike writing, speech <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may tell us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke. While no one doubts that they communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} {{there must be}} a minimum of two wrestlers ranked as komusubi. If {{circumstances}} require this can rise to three or four, for example if both komusubi have winning records and an upper maegashira produces such a good score that he cannot reasonably be denied a promotion. However, this is relatively rare. The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> obvious candidates to fill the rank.|$|E
25|$|It is {{mentioned}} that Washington, D.C., was destroyed, with the capital moved to Denver, Colorado, {{and there were}} also some hits on the East Coast and in Texas. However, the book in effect makes light of it. The US rapidly recovers, refugees from devastated areas move to unharmed places—especially California—and the nuclear war <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> lasting trauma. The 1984 book Warday by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka takes up a limited nuclear attack in precisely the locations mentioned in Heinlein's book and depicts how hugely destructive it could be.|$|E

25|$|Physicist Sean M. Carroll {{has written}} that spoons, like all matter, {{are made up of}} atoms and that any {{movement}} of a spoon with the mind would involve the manipulation of those atoms through the four forces of nature: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Psychokinesis would have to be either some form of one of these four forces, or a new force that has a billionth the strength of gravity, for otherwise it would have been captured in experiments already done. This <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> physical force that could possibly account for psychokinesis.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.|$|E
25|$|The {{cookbook}} {{method of}} teaching introductory statistics <b>leaves</b> <b>no</b> time for history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught as received unified method. Surveys showed that {{graduates of the}} class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors. While the problem was addressed {{more than a decade}} ago, and calls for educational reform continue, students still graduate from statistics classes holding fundamental misconceptions about hypothesis testing. Ideas for improving the teaching of hypothesis testing include encouraging students to search for statistical errors in published papers, teaching the history of statistics and emphasizing the controversy in a generally dry subject.|$|E
