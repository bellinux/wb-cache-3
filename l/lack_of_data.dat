5|$|Due {{to lack of}} studies, it is {{not known}} whether {{increased}} fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness, and there is a similar <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> for the use of heated humidified air.

5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated {{a species of}} least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline. Despite the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> relating to its current population state, it {{is thought to have}} a stable trend, with some isolated populations exhibiting some variation. It has been regionally red-listed in China and Mongolia as a species of least concern, and about 12% of its population in Mongolia is found in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Throughout West Africa, ASL-based sign {{languages}} are spoken by educated Deaf adults. These languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations {{to be the}} official sign languages of their countries, and are named accordingly, e.g. Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language. Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo. Due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> it is still an open question how similar these sign {{languages are}} to the variety of ASL used in America.|$|E

5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} was first detected by a ship on October 17 southwest of Bermuda; in the HURDAT database, this date {{was considered to be}} the formation date, although the entire lifespan of the storm is unknown due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on the system itself. It initially moved east-northeastward, though later began to turn northeastward on October 18. The storm curved slightly towards the east-northeast on October 19, and became extratropical later that day before its dissipation on October 20. The storm maintained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) for most of its lifetime.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
