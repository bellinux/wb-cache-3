40|$|Introduction. One {{common cause}} of <b>low</b> lumbar <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> is {{degenerative}} disc disease. A physiological intervertebral disc has several functions in the axial system. Each disc {{is attached to the}} vertebra above and below and serves as a connector and a spacer. Surgical treatment of <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> becomes more common in medical practice. There are two surgical methods in treating <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> (when replacing intervertebral disc) : spinal fusion and artificial discs. Disadvantage of the fusion is decrease of mobility in dependence on the increasing of adjacent vertebrae and discs load...|$|R
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> is not straightforward. While most <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> (LBP) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. <b>Low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal}} in the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain,</b> and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms-based classifications of pain {{have been}} {{advocated}} for their potential to aid understanding of clinical presentations {{of pain and}} improve clinical outcomes. However, the reliability of mechanisms-based classifications of pain and the clinical criteria upon which such classifications are based are not known. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to assess the inter- and intra-examiner reliability of clinical judgments associated with: (i) mechanisms-based classifications of pain; and (ii) the identification and interpretation of individual symptoms and signs from a Delphi-derived expert consensus list of clinical criteria associated with mechanisms-based classifications of pain in patients with <b>low</b> <b>back</b> (±leg) <b>pain</b> disorders. The inter- and intra-examiner reliability of an examination protocol performed by two physiotherapists on two separate cohorts of 40 patients was assessed. Data were analysed using kappa and percentage of agreement values. Inter- and intra-examiner agreement associated with clinicians’ mechanisms-based classifications of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> (±leg) <b>pain</b> was ‘substantial’ (kappa  =  0. 77; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 57 – 0. 96; % agreement  =  87. 5) and ‘almost perfect’ (kappa  =  0. 96; 95 % CI: 0. 92 – 1. 00; % agreement =  92. 5), respectively. Sixty-eight and 95 % of items on the clinical criteria checklist demonstrated clinically acceptable (kappa ⩾ 0. 61 or % agreement ⩾ 80 %) inter- and intra-examiner reliability, respectively.

5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E

Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. <b>Low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

We provided a systematic review {{on the effectiveness of}} prenatal physiotherapy. Methods: A full search was conducted in three electronic databases (Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE and PEDro), selecting randomized controlled trials concerning prenatal physiotherapy. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: We identified 1249 studies and after exclusions 54 studies were included concerning the evidence of prenatal physiotherapy. The majority of studies indicated a preventative effect for <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain/pelvic girdle <b>pain,</b> weight gain, incontinence and perineal massage. For leg edema, fear and prenatal depression, the efficacy was only based on one study per symptom. No preventative effect was found for gestational diabetes, while literature concerning gestational hypertensive disorders was inconclusive. Regarding the treatment of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain/pelvic girdle <b>pain</b> and weight gain, most therapies reduced respectively pain and weight. Evidence regarding exercises for diabetes was contradictory and for incontinence only minimally researched. Foot massage and stockings reduced respectively leg edema and leg symptoms. Concerning gestational hypertensive disorders, perineal pain, fear and prenatal depression no treatment studies were performed. Conclusions: The majority of studies indicated that prenatal physiotherapy had a preventative role for <b>low</b> <b>back</b> pain/ pelvic girdle pain, weight gain, incontinence and pelvic pain.

40|$|Sickness absence {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} health index in workplace populations. Nowadays, {{it is believed that}} <b>low</b> <b>back</b> - <b>pain</b> is the main cause of absence and disability among people working in bad ergonomic conditions. Also, researchers found that low back-pain is the main cause of disability among mine workers who manually handle heavy loads. This research was conducted into two phases to determine the absence indexes due to all diseases and low back-pain among 1186 coal miners in the Tezerea coal mine, located in the Shahrood district, in north eastearn Iran. In {{the first phase of the}} study, all medical histories of miners were controlled. The data of those workers who had sickness and low back-pain absence for more than 3 consercutive days during Februray 1999 - 2000 have been recorded. Risk factors of low back-pain were determined by the Plible method at second phase. The frequency rate of all sickness and low back-pain absence were 32. 8 % and 6 %, respectively. The incidence rate of all sicknesses and <b>low</b> <b>back</b> - <b>pain</b> were 24 % and 5 %, respectively. The average absence duration for all sicknesses and <b>low</b> <b>back</b> - <b>pain,</b> respectively were 16. 1 and 9. 9 days. We found a significant relation between low back-pain absence and manual handling beyond forearm length (p- 0. 005 and OR= 10. 75). Also, P values and the Odds Ratio (OR) for repetitive manual handling, contractor workers and working in a cold workplace were p- 0. 0005 OR 2. 21, p= 0. 025 OR= 2. 21, and p= 0. 018 OR^ 2. 54, respectively.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain</b> was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time.

In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for <b>low</b> <b>back</b> <b>pain.</b> In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria.

40|$|Evidence of {{validity}} {{is required to}} {{support the use of}} mechanisms-based classifications of pain clinically. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the discriminant validity of 'nociceptive' (NP), 'peripheral neuropathic' (PNP) and 'central sensitisation' (CSP) as mechanisms-based classifications of pain in patients with <b>low</b> <b>back</b> (±leg) <b>pain</b> by evaluating the extent to which patients classified in this way differ from one another according to health measures associated with various dimensions of pain. This study employed a cross-sectional, between-subjects design. Four hundred and sixty-four patients with <b>low</b> <b>back</b> (±leg) <b>pain</b> were assessed using a standardised assessment protocol. Clinicians classified each patient's pain using a mechanisms-based classification approach. Patients completed a number of self-report measures associated with pain severity, health-related quality of life, functional disability, anxiety and depression. Discriminant validity was evaluated using a multivariate analysis of variance. There was a statistically significant difference between pain classifications on the combined self-report measures, (p = . 001; Pillai's Trace = . 33; partial eta squared = . 16). Patients classified with CSP (n =  106) reported significantly more severe pain, poorer general health-related quality of life, and greater levels of back pain-related disability, depression and anxiety compared to those classified with PNP (n =  102) and NP (n =  256). A similar pattern was found in patients with PNP compared to NP. Mechanisms-based pain classifications may reflect meaningful differences in attributes underlying the multidimensionality of pain.

Patients and methodsIn this study, 32 female RA patients with radicular <b>low</b> <b>back</b> and leg <b>pain</b> for at least 3 months were recruited. Electroneuromyographic (ENMG) evaluation was performed in all patients and accordingly grouped: group 1 : normal ENMG (n= 7; 22 %), group 2 : patients with polyneuropathy (n= 8; 25 %) and group 3 : patients with radiculopathy (n= 17; 53 %). Disease activity was assessed by disease activity score (DAS 28) and functional disability by modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ). Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale- 2 was used to assess QoL and Beck Inventory for assessment of anxiety and depression. ResultsThe mean age of the patients was 54. 7 ± 10. 3 years and disease duration 14. 9 ± 8. 3 years. The DAS- 28 and functional disability were significantly increased (p= 0. 005 and p= 0. 01) in group- 2 compared to the other groups. There were no significant differences in the depression and anxiety scores among the 3 groups.
