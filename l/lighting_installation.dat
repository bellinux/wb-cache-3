25|$|Because of {{the power}} that would be lost, {{resistors}} are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a reactance is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, {{on the order of}} 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a <b>lighting</b> <b>installation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} {{electric}} <b>lighting</b> <b>installation</b> in Manitoba was demonstrated at the Davis House hotel on Main Street, Winnipeg, March 12, 1873. In 1880, the Manitoba Electric and Gas Light Company was incorporated to provide public lighting and power, {{and a year}} later absorbed the Winnipeg Gas Company. In 1893, the Winnipeg Electric Street Railway Company was formed, and initially purchased power from Manitoba Electric and Gas, but by 1898, it had built its own 1000-horsepower (750kW) generating plant and purchased Manitoba Electric and Gas.|$|E

The North station was lit up by 60flood lights, 15 on each of four towers; the South station also had four towers, but each held 26flood lights. The Central Electricity Authority justified the use of 194flood lights over the two sites as [...] "economical, safe and much more efficient than lighting the stations at street level".|$|E
2500|$|SS Servia, {{also known}} as RMS Servia, was a {{successful}} transatlantic passenger and mail steamer of revolutionary design, built by J & G Thomson of Clydebank (later John Brown & Company) and launched in 1881. She was the first large ocean liner to be built of steel instead of iron, and the first Cunard ship to have an electric <b>lighting</b> <b>installation.</b> For these and other reasons, maritime historians often consider Servia {{to be the first}} [...] "modern" [...] ocean liner.|$|E
2500|$|Servia was {{the first}} Cunarder to {{introduce}} electric lighting, using Edison's recently invented incandescent lamp, which had been proven successful on ship usage by its first commercial installation on board the American passenger liner Columbia. [...] The lamps were installed in the public rooms and engineering spaces. (A small but practical electric <b>lighting</b> <b>installation</b> had been made on the smaller Inman liner SS City of Berlin a year so earlier. [...] ) Servia was also fitted with {{a new type of}} compass and deep-sea sounding device.|$|E

2500|$|On July 7, 2006, the <b>lighting</b> <b>installation</b> {{designed}} by Leni Schwendinger made its public debut, showcasing {{each of its}} six animated seasonal scenarios (featuring most spectral colors, except for green, which cannot show on the red painted tower). The computer-programmed scenarios reflect a calendar of local significance, such as the Boardwalk season (and non-Boardwalk season), and holidays such as the Mermaid parade, as well as natural phenomena, such as the lunar cycle. A scenario for American patriotic holidays is programmed for said celebrations, and for other holidays there is a sequence entitled [...] "Kaleidoscope".|$|E
2500|$|Semi-resonant start {{circuits}} {{are mainly}} restricted {{to use in}} commercial installations because of the higher initial cost of circuit components. However, there are no starter switches to be replaced and cathode damage is reduced during starting making lamps last longer, reducing maintenance costs. Due to the high open circuit tube voltage, this starting method is particularly good for starting tubes in cold locations. Additionally, the circuit power factor is almost 1.0, and no additional power factor correction is needed in the <b>lighting</b> <b>installation.</b> As the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode striking voltage (or the tubes would erroneously instant-start), this design cannot be used with [...] AC power unless the tubes are at least [...] length. [...] Semi-resonant start fixtures are generally incompatible with energy saving T8 retrofit tubes, because such tubes have a higher starting voltage than T12 lamps and may not start reliably, especially in low temperatures. Recent proposals in some countries to phase out T12 tubes will reduce the application of this starting method.|$|E
60|$|If {{one looks}} into the {{conditions}} of industrial employment specialisation will be found to linger just in proportion as a trade has remained unaffected by inventions and innovation. The building trade, for example, is a fairly conservative one. A brick wall is made to-day {{much as it was}} made two hundred years ago, and the bricklayer is in consequence a highly skilled and inadaptable specialist. No one who has not passed through a long and tedious training can lay bricks properly. And it needs a specialist to plough a field with horses or to drive a cab through the streets of London. Thatchers, old-fashioned cobblers, and hand workers are all specialised to a degree no new modern calling requires. With machinery skill disappears and unspecialised intelligence comes in. Any generally intelligent man can learn {{in a day or two}} to drive an electric tram, fix up an electric <b>lighting</b> <b>installation,</b> or guide a building machine or a steam plough. He must be, of course, much more generally intelligent than the average bricklayer, but he needs far less specialised skill. To repair machinery requires, of course, a special sort of knowledge, but not a special sort of training.|$|E
