5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including <b>Latania</b> loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E

40|$|Aphytis diaspidis Howard is an idiobiont {{parasitoid}} of the invasive (Diaspidiotus perniciosus Comstock) and usual (Hemiberlesia <b>lataniae</b> Signoret) hosts. The {{objectives were}} {{to study the}} effect of host scale species on functional response of A. diaspidis and to answer on the question raised whether the killing efficiency of this parasitoid against the invasive host will differ from that of usual host. The parasitoid showed no host species preference with a type II response when offered both hosts at densities of 10 – 50 insects per patch. The proportion of hosts parasitized exhibited the same characteristic curve for the parasitoid on both hosts: a wave form {{that appeared to be}} a composite of a decelerating (type II) response at low host density and an accelerating and a decelerating (type III) response at medium to high densities. I assume that egg limitation, and/or host feeding rather than parasitism may have induced the modified type II response. The number of host parasitized within a 48 h increased with host density with a maximum of 18. 3 and 18. 6 adults of D. perniciosus and H. <b>lataniae,</b> respectively. However, the proportion of host parasitized significantly decreased with host density. This implies that the wasp seems to be more affective in low host populations. This result has to be considered in rapid population control. Estimated handling times for parasitoid were 0. 98 and 1. 258 h and attack rates were 0. 016 and 0. 02 h− 1 on H. <b>lataniae</b> and D. perniciosus, respectively. Theoretically, the maximum number of hosts that could be parasitized by a single female within 48 h was 38. 16 and 48. 97 of D. perniciosus and H. <b>lataniae,</b> respectively. The longer time in handling D. perniciosus by a parasitoid showed that the host has lower quality than the usual host, H. <b>lataniae.</b> The functional response results have to be considered in both mass rearing quality testing and biocontrol programs...|$|R

40|$|Both {{commercial}} and experimental genotypes of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) exhibit large differences {{in response to}} insect pests. An understanding of the vine's physiological response to insect feeding and its genetic basis will be important in assisting the development of varieties with acceptable levels of pest resistance. This experiment describes transcriptome changes observed in the bark of kiwifruit 2 and 7  days after the commencement of feeding by the armored scale insect pest, Hemiberlesia <b>lataniae.</b> Using a cDNA microarray consisting of 17, 512 unigenes, we measured transcriptome changes and analyzed these into functional ontology categories using MapMan.

This hypothesis was supported by the results of two laboratory experiments.

50|$|The {{palmetto}} weevil (Rhynchophorus cruentatus) is {{an insect}} native to Florida, {{but has been}} found as far as southern Texas {{to the west and}} South Carolina to the north. It is the largest weevil in North America and the only kind of palm weevil in the continental United States. It infests palms and is considered a pest. Its main target is the Canary Island date palm, but date palms (a different species than the Canary Island date palm), sabal palms (the palmetto weevil's traditional target), saw palmetto (the palmetto weevil's traditional alternative target), Washingtonia, Pritchardia, royal palms, <b>Latania,</b> coconut palms, Caryota, and Bismarckia are also susceptible. Distressed palm trees are usually attacked, which makes transplanted trees a frequent target. The Palmetto Weevils mate {{at the base of the}} palm branches where the females deposit their eggs. The grubs then eat into the palm tree, killing it. After the larvae have turned into adult weevils, the damage can be seen, but by then, it is considered to be too late for the tree.

On the basis of radiographs, D. T. Holyoak claimed that the mandible of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested {{that it would have}} fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. G. A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of [...] "strong jawed" [...] parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.|$|E
40|$|Tiny pegs are {{sometimes}} formed {{on the inner}} side of tree bark as a result of plant virus diseases (5). These pegs jut into the wood, forming small pits or depressions, and can be seen easily by the naked eye. Plant virologists often consider the occurrence of such pitting as a preliminary indication of virus diseases. The discovery of such abnormalities in apparently healthy trees, especially fruit trees, therefore warrants bringing them to the attention of orchardists, extension workers and plant scientists. During a survey for avocado virus diseases we discovered bark pegs and corresponding wood pits in the bark of avocado seedlings growing in a nursery. The pegs were quite smooth, about 1 mm deep and 2 mm in diameter (Fig. 1). Subsequently we found similar pegs and pits in a mature, commercial avocado grove. No prior mention of such abnormalities could be found in the literature. Inspection of the affected bark revealed a close correlation between the pitting and the presence of adults of the <b>latania</b> scale, Hemiberlesia lataniae (Signoret) (Homoptera: Diaspididae).

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} growing kiwifruit organically, a kiwifruit vineyard converted to an organic farm was compared to a conventionally farmed vineyard from 1990 through 1992. January or March applications of composted chicken manure (organic system) or NH 4 NO 3 plus CaNH 4 (NO 3) 3 through micro sprinklers {{during the growing season}} (conventional system) were applied to give nearly equal rates of 168 kg N ha- 1. Soil analysis showed a trend toward a higher pH and organic matter over time for the organic system. In 1992, there was a trend for the organic system to have higher NH 4 -N and lower NO 3 -N concentration in the soil. Leaf nitrogen levels from the organic system were consistently lower than those from the conventional system but were not deficient. Leaf concentrations of sodium and chloride increased over the three-year period in the organic system but not to phytotoxic levels. Leaf zinc levels were adequate and increased over time in both systems. Organically grown fruit was as firm as or firmer than conventionally grown fruit at harvest and four months after harvest. No differences were seen in percent soluble solids content. Damage from <b>latania</b> scale and omnivorous leaf roller was small in both systems except scale damage in the organic system in 1992. An economic analysis of the cultural practices showed that the organic system cost almost $ 720 per ha more then the conventional system.
