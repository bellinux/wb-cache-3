40|$|Social {{dynamics}} on {{a network}} may be accelerated or decelerated depending on which pairs of individuals in the network communicate early and which pairs do later. The order with which the links in a given network are sequentially used, which we call the <b>link</b> <b>order,</b> may be a strong determinant of dynamical behaviour on networks, potentially adding {{a new dimension to}} effects of temporal networks relative to static networks. Here we study the effect of the <b>link</b> <b>order</b> on linear coordination (i. e., synchronisation) dynamics. We show that the coordination speed considerably depends on specific <b>orders</b> of <b>links.</b> In addition, applying each single link {{for a long time to}} ensure strong pairwise coordination before moving to a next pair of individuals does not often enhance coordination of the entire network. We also implement a simple greedy algorithm to optimise the <b>link</b> <b>order</b> in favour of fast coordination. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} channel assignment in a metropolitan wireless multi-radio mesh network with directional antennas. We first present a new conflict graph model for capturing the interference between links in a mesh network with a known wireless interface communication graph. Then we present a channel assignment procedure which accounts for interference both between links internal to the mesh network, and from external sources. Key components of the channel assignment procedure are the interference model, the <b>link</b> <b>ordering,</b> and the channel selection metric. We have implemented and evaluated the proposed channel assignment procedure in an actual metropolitan mesh network with link distances from 1. 6 to 5 Km. The experimental results demonstrate how <b>link</b> <b>ordering</b> and the channel selection metric affect performance, {{in terms of the}} average packet delay an...|$|R

It is sound and complete. OSHL has an efficient propositional decision procedure. It solves first order problems by reducing them to propositional problems. It uses natural semantics of an input problem to guide its search. It also incorporates term rewriting to handle equality. The propositional efficiency, semantic guidance and equality support allow OSHL to solve problems that are difficult for many other strategies. The efficiency of OSHL is supported by experimental study as well as complexity analysis.

40|$|Seemingly {{innocuous}} {{properties of}} the environment, such as the contents of system environment variables, or different <b>link</b> <b>orders,</b> can impact the performance of computer programs. Variations in external properties like these can bias programs towards certain configurations. These effects {{have been shown to}} be a significant issue in performance analysis, but unpredictable and difficult to deal with. Abstract This thesis focuses on the underlying reasons for bias effects that can be experienced for example by changing environment variables, or using different <b>link</b> <b>orders.</b> Both of these factors can lead to differences in memory layout of either code or data, which in turn interacts with various hardware mechanisms. Through experimentation and careful measurements using performance counters, we identify several potential sources of bias on the Intel Core i 7 ?Ivy Bridge? architecture. Limitations imposed by the Loop Stream Detector is revealed, along with effects from 4 K address aliasing. We show that bias is in fact not completely unpredictable, and discuss measures for avoiding it. Abstract Our case studies show that even highly optimized Fourier transform and linear algebra libraries are prone to bias. We find that stack alignment significantly affects the performance of FFTW, and that in some cases more than 30 % performance gain can be made by avoiding address aliasing in ATLAS' matrix-vector multiplication. Our results show that an awareness of program layout in memory is important, especially for users and developers of performance critical software...|$|R

Briefly, MIM allows a receiver to disengage from an ongoing reception, and engage onto a stronger incoming signal. Links that otherwise conflict with each other, {{can be made}} concurrent with MIM.

The importance of <b>link</b> <b>order</b> is new in wireless research, motivating MIM-aware revisions to link scheduling protocols.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new class}} of deadlock-free routing algorithms for irregular networks based on <b>ordered</b> <b>links.</b> In this case, the <b>links</b> are <b>ordered</b> by partitioning them into a set of layers, each layer containing a spanning tree (when possible). Deadlock free routes can then be derived by using <b>links</b> with non-decreasing <b>order.</b> The deadlockfreedom property is proved. Two different implementations of the routing algorithm are studied. The resultant performance of these algorithms is then compared to other known algorithms: the shortest-path algorithm (which may result in deadlocks) and the up*/down * algorithm. Various performance metrics are considered, including path-length, network capacity, fault tolerance and time of computation. We argue that network capacity is the most important metric to optimize. It is shown that the proposed algorithms are promising since they usually achieve higher network capacity than up*/down*, while they perform only slightly worse than up*/down * in other metrics. 1...|$|R
