40|$|The Land Use, Air Quality, and Transportation Integrated Modeling Environment (<b>LATIME)</b> {{represents}} an integrated approach to computer {{modeling and simulation}} of land use allocation, travel demand, and mobile source emissions for the Albuquerque, New Mexico, area. This environment provides predictive capability combined with a graphical and geographical interface. The graphical interface shows the causal relationships between data and policy scenarios and supports alternative model formulations. Scenarios are launched from within a Geographic Information System (GIS), and data produced by each model component at each time step within a simulation is stored in the GIS. A menudriven query system is utilized to review link-based results and regional and areawide results. These results can also be compared across time or between alternative land use scenarios. Using this environment, policies can be developed and implemented based on comparative analysis, rather than on single-step future pr [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Spike Jonze has cited ALICE as the {{inspiration}} for his academy award-winning film Her, in which a human {{falls in love with}} a chatbot. In a New Yorker article titled “Can Humans Fall in Love with Bots?” Jonze said “that the idea originated from a program he tried about a decade ago called the ALICE bot, which engages in friendly conversation.” The <b>LATimes</b> reported:Though the film’s premise evokes comparisons to Siri, Jonze said he actually had the idea well before the Apple digital assistant came along, after using a program called Alicebot about ten years ago. As geek nostalgists will recall, that intriguing if at times crude software (it flunked the industry-standard Turing Test) would attempt to engage users in everyday chatter based on a database of prior conversations. Jonze liked it, and decided to apply a film genre to it. “I thought about that idea, and what if you had a real relationship with it?” Jonze told reporters. “And I used that as a way to write a relationship movie and a love story.” ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{states have}} laws {{limiting}} the number of loans a borrower can take at a single time according to <b>LATimes</b> report. This is currently being accomplished by single, statewide realtime databases. These systems are required in Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia States Statues. These systems require all licensed lenders to conduct a real time verification of the customer's eligibility to receive a loan before conducting a loan. Reports published by state regulators in these states indicate that this system enforces all of the provisions of the state's statutes. Some states also cap the number of loans per borrower per year (Virginia, Washington), or require that after a fixed number of loan renewals, the lender must offer a lower interest loan with a longer term, so that the borrower can eventually get out of the debt cycle by following some steps. Borrowers can circumvent these laws by taking loans from more than one lender if there is not an enforcement mechanism in place by the state. Some states allow that a consumer can have more than one loan outstanding (Oklahoma). Currently, the states with the most payday lenders per capital are Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an inside, {{in-depth look at}} how journalists at <b>latimes.</b> com and salon. com came together to create content for their websites over a six month period. It vividly unveils the process of newsmaking by journalists working for organisations whose output is the world wide web. It uses mixed method case studies of two US-based news websites, <b>latimes.</b> com and salon. com, to show how both parentage and net native sites construct a news story. The case studies include direct observation, in-depth interviews and content analysis to deconstruct the process of covering the 2008 Presidential election. The thesis works around Brian McNair‘s cultural chaos paradigm (2006) which explains the emergent nature of news online {{and the lack of}} control by any environmental factors that seek to affect its outcome. The thesis begins by outlining the four crucial changes which occur online that are redefining major tenets of journalism both practically and theoretically. It goes on to explain not only how online news has become a destination for many around the world but also why these two online news websites have found a niche for themselves on the Web. The findings of this research outline not only how the newsmaking process exists in these two environments but also how they are creating a new type of convotelling journalism. The 2008 US Presidential election is used as a story to show the unstructured and chaotic network that now exists in how news is gathered, produced, and disseminated online. It goes on to explain the multitude of changing relationships journalists are grappling with as this convotelling newsmaking process occurs. The contrast between the net native and parentage website is dissected to show just how the two sites vary even though their goal is similar. The research concludes making an argument for a hybrid model of journalism being done online that is distinctive in nature...|$|E
40|$|Bayesian text {{classifiers}} face {{a common}} issue which {{is referred to}} as data sparsity problem, especially when the size of training data is very small. The frequently used Laplacian smoothing and corpus-based background smoothing are not effective in handling it. Instead, we propose a novel semantic smoothing method to address the sparse problem. Our method extracts explicit topic signatures (e. g. words, multiword phrases, and ontologybased concepts) from a document and then statistically maps them into single-word features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three testing collections (OHSUMED, <b>LATimes,</b> and 20 NG) to compare semantic smoothing with other approaches. When the size of training documents is small, the bayesian classifier with semantic smoothing not only outperforms the classifiers with background smoothing and Laplacian smoothing, but also beats the state-of-the-art active learning classifiers and SVM classifiers. In this paper, we also compare three types of topic signatures with respect to their effectiveness and efficiency for semantic smoothing...|$|E
40|$|That racially {{motivated}} conflicts {{occur in}} schools is an indisputable fact that becomes evident upon review of both academic literature and popular media. Events {{such as the}} Jena 6 incident (Maxwell 2 ̆ 6 Zehr, 2007), school wide racially motivated riots (<b>latimes.</b> com), and court rulings (theithican. org) are distressing examples that racial barriers are real and potentially dangerous for many students in this country. However, little is written {{about the nature of}} racial conflicts, including the actual process school leaders engage in when determining how or even whether to intervene in racial conflicts, and the affect those racial conflicts have on the school climate and relevant stakeholders (e. g. directly involved students, other students, and school staff). To address this concern the current study is designed to provide insight into the decision-making process of school counselors in the intervention of racial conflicts that occur between students. The findings of this study will be pertinent and beneficial to all educational professionals as well as students. The following review provides context for understanding racial conflicts in schools, and addresses such issues as prevalence rates, causes, consequences, theories, and interventions to address such conflicts. Finally, the review concludes with a description of limitations in the research and a description of a proposed study...|$|E
