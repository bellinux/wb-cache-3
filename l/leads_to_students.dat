One of the results of this is that it can be a long walk to school in the countryside, in the dark - a walk one way of 2 hours is not uncommon.Parents can be reluctant to send a 6 year old that far on their own or even an older girl - there are safety concerns.If the child does walk a long distance, they are often too tired to pay attention and may even fall asleep in class. The time getting to and from school also cuts into the time to help the family at home. If the parents are relying on the child’s labor, this long walk can be a disincentive to enrollment.

40|$|Extract] Good {{practice}} in assessment feedback {{is a process}} in which students are actively involved and where teacher/peer dialogue is encouraged (Juwah, Macfarlane & Nicol, 2004). Clear, constructive feedback reduces the gap between present and desired performance and {{is considered to be a}} jointly owned system that is reflexive, flexible and dynamic. Results of Course Experience Questionnaires show that Australian university accounting students are generally very dissatisfied with the feedback they receive in their courses. The findings of the present study reveal that many accounting students feel that they receive poor quality feedback on their assessment, as evidenced by the most typical form of feedback being only the mark. Moreover, this feedback is often provided too late to be useful to them. A lack of adequate feedback <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>students</b> feeling disempowered. They consider feedback to sometimes be de-motivating and intimidating. These findings point to something of a crisis in feedback quality in the discipline that needs urgent attention...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of assessment are: • to promote learning and inform students {{of how well}} they are learning (assessment for and as learning); and • to provide evidence of the achievement of learning (certification) as well as assuring standards (quality assurance). Assessment {{is an integral part}} of the learning process. Assessment for and as learning refers to a range of activities that involve academic staff making a judgement of the quality of student work against a standard (Boud & Associates, 2010) and awarding a mark/grade to represent the (level of) achievement of specified learning outcomes. It also involves students learning about criteria, standards and professional judgement and developing their capacity to evaluate their own and other’s work against agreed standards to prepare them to function as independent, life-long learners (Boud & Associates, 2010). Assessments can also inform teachers about their teaching effectiveness. Assessment for certification and quality assurance <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>students</b> being awarded qualifications and can ensure a licence to practice; therefore, quality of assessment is critical (Australian Government Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, 2012) ...|$|E
40|$|Most systems {{analysis}} texts introduce use case diagrams by discussing systems of which many students have no practical knowledge - university registry or library systems, or perhaps sales or appointment scheduling systems.

40|$|Motivational {{techniques}} are often employed by teachers. Many {{of these techniques}} foster extrinsic motivation, meaning that students are either offered rewards or threatened with some type of negative consequence in order {{to lead to a}} desired action or behavior (Viadero, 1999). Although there is much debate on the usefulness of extrinsic motivation, the focus of this review is on intrinsic motivation, or motivation derived from a genuine interest or desire to learn {{on the part of the}} student (Viadero, 1999). While the debate over the effects of extrinsic motivation is beyond the scope of this review, Wilson and Corpus (2005) provide a good discussion of the place of extrinsic motivation in education. Student-centered instruction is a potential method for enhancing intrinsic motivation among students (Hancock, Bray, & Nason 1995). Student-centered instruction attempts to engender active learning by using methods such as cooperative learning, open-ended assignments, critical thinking exercises, simulations, and problem solving activities (Felder & Brent, 1996). The goal of student-centered instruction is to shift student learning away from passive sitting and listening to a more active and dynamic learning experience.

Some elements of probability are seen in the second year. But “statistics requires a different kind of thinking ” (Cobb & Moore, 1997).
