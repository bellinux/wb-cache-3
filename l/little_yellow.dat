5|$|Wild trout {{naturally}} reproduce in Hammersley Fork {{from its}} headwaters downstream to its mouth. Great blue herons {{have been observed}} at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, {{despite the fact that}} they are more commonly found in large river valleys. <b>Little</b> <b>yellow</b> stoneflies also inhabit it. Brown trout first appeared in the stream in the 1920s after being stocked in Cross Fork and in the 1940s the brown trout populations significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|P. (c.) tristis, the Siberian chiffchaff, breeds in Siberia {{east of the}} Pechora River and {{winters in}} the lower Himalayas. It is also {{regularly}} recorded in western Europe in winter, {{and it is likely}} that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds). It is a dull subspecies, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with <b>little</b> <b>yellow</b> in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has a higher pitched suitsistsuisit song and a short high-pitched cheet call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to P. s. sindianus in these respects. Nominate P. c. collybita and P. c. tristis do not recognize each other's songs. Pending resolution of the status of P. (c.) fulvescens, which is found where the ranges of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these, tristis is maintained in P. collybita.|$|E

25|$|The blacktip trevally's {{colouration}} is distinctive, {{with the}} upper body being dark bronze to yellow green while the lower body fades to silvery white below. The caudal fin is bright to olive yellow, with the top half normally black to dark, giving the species its common name. Other fins range from bright yellow to dusky with <b>little</b> <b>yellow</b> at all. The species also lacks the dark spot on the opercular margin that many related species possess.|$|E
500|$|The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Women Washing {{is one of}} van Gogh's most iconic {{and best}} loved paintings, {{acknowledged}} as the first masterpiece of his Arles period. It depicts common canal-side activities. [...] A <b>little</b> <b>yellow</b> cart crosses the bridge while {{a group of women}} in smocks and multicoloured caps wash linen on the shore. [...] Van Gogh skillfully uses his knowledge of color theory and the [...] "law of simultaneous contrasts" [...] in this work. [...] The grass is depicted with alternating brush strokes of red-orange and green. [...] Yellow and blue complementary colors are used in the bridge, sky and river. [...] Use of complementary colors intensifies the impact of each color creating a [...] "vibrant and coloristically unified whole." ...|$|E

Oh yeah; the kids will {{probably}} like it, too." [...] Mavis also praised the voice actors who contributed on the show, and wrote [...] "As funny as the stories are, and in this collection, there are some real gems, I can't stress enough the importance of those voice talents in conveying the unhinged, manic quality that is so integral to the success of SpongeBob SquarePants. In a separate review for the Volume 2 DVD, Mavis only [...] "recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "SpongeBob may, and I repeat, 'may,' be starting to level off."

Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk wrote that the season release is [...] "recommended." [...] He said [...] "Let me state up front that I adore this show. I get a total kick out of watching it with my 4-year-old daughter. We laugh uproariously at SpongeBob's adventures and I'm helplessly reduced to a boy about her age as I beam and giggle at the screen." [...] However, Bovberg called the included audio commentaries [...] "downright boring." [...] Various celebrities—including Lance Bass of 'N Sync, Will Ferrell of Saturday Night Live, singer-songwriter Tom Waits, and Jerry Lewis—admitted they were fans of the show.|$|E

500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the <b>little</b> <b>yellow</b> colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E

In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a <b>little</b> <b>yellow</b> rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Black pod disease starts {{when the}} {{infected}} pod shows some <b>little</b> <b>yellow</b> spots, which eventually turn brown and enlarge {{to a dark}} brown or black lesion within five days. The lesion is fast growing and covers the entire pod after eighth day of infection. The infection does not only occur on the pod surface, but also invades inside the pod affecting the beans. The growth of white mycelia on black pod is visible after 11 days and the sporulation is initiated. The dispersal of sporangia or zoospores through water, ants and other insects occurs at this stage and will infect other healthy pods nearby. Direct contact of a black pod with healthy pods also leads {{to the spread of}} disease. In addition, the infected flower cushion and mummified pods are the locations for P. palmivora survival during dry season, where the pathogen will grow and continue to infect other developing pods ...|$|E
