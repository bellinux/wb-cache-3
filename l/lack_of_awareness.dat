5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1978 Mir Akbar Khyber, {{the chief}} ideologue of the Parcham faction, was killed; he was {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been assassinated by the Daoud government. Khyber's assassination initiated a chain of events which led to the PDPA taking power eleven days later, on 27 April. The assassin was never caught, but Anahita Ratebzad, a Parchamite, believed that Amin had ordered the assassination. Khyber's funeral evolved into a large anti-government demonstration. Daoud, who did not understand the significance of the events, began a mass arrest of PDPA members seven days after Khyber's funeral. Amin, who organised the subsequent revolution against Daoud, {{was one of the last}} Central Committee members to be arrested by the authorities. His late arrest can be considered as proof of the regime's lack of information; Amin was the leading revolutionary party organiser. The government's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>awareness</b> was proven by the arrest of Taraki – Taraki's arrest was the pre-arranged signal for the revolution to commence. When Amin found out that Taraki had been arrested, he ordered the revolution to begin at 9am on 27 April. Amin, in contrast to Taraki, was not imprisoned, but instead put under house arrest. His son, Abdur Rahman, was still allowed freedom of movement. The revolution was successful, thanks to overwhelming support from the Afghan military; for instance, it was supported by Defence Minister Ghulam Haidar Rasuli, Aslam Watanjar the commander of the ground forces, and the Chief of Staff of the Afghan Air Force, Abdul Qadir.|$|E

25|$|The early {{models of}} {{what would become the}} study and concept of {{cognitive}} inhibition were developed by Sigmund Freud. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the repression of experiences from infancy and childhood.

40|$|Women {{continue}} to be objectified by our society and this objectification is often internalized by women and can result in negative psychological consequences such as eating disorders and depression. One postulate of the self-objectification theory is that self-objectification {{can lead to a}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>awareness</b> and this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>awareness</b> may mediate the relationship between self-objectification and mental health problems in women. To test this postulate, undergraduate women completed a number of self-report instruments measuring self-objectification, internal awareness, maladaptive eating behaviors, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that internal awareness does not mediate the relationship between self-objectification and maladaptive eating behaviors or depression. However, both self-objectification and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>awareness</b> independently explaine a significant amount of variance for the mental health variables measured.
