40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that the world is rich with soil data {{resulting}} from the efforts of past soil surveys. However, the majority of these data is largely unused. These <b>legacy</b> soil <b>data</b> {{come in the form of}} soil maps, soil survey reports, soil profile descriptions, and/or in the format of antiquated “card catalogue”. These data provide many benefits including soil information preservation or as a major component of national environmental monitoring or as the only source of meaningful soil information for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) in many of data-scarce countries of the developing world. These benefits call for the rejuvenation of these data. In Nigeria, as one of the data-poor countries in terms of modern soil digital soil databases, there is a preponderance of largely untapped <b>legacy</b> soil <b>data</b> as a result of her rich history of soil surveys. This paper provides an account of the challenges faced in the course of the renewal of the Nigerian <b>legacy</b> soil <b>data</b> for the purpose of DSM. In telling this account, we briefly review the processes involved. We then explore the historical soil surveys in Nigeria leading to the synthesis and discussion of the challenges of the processes used for the capture and renewal of the <b>legacy</b> soil <b>data</b> including how the challenges were overcome. ...|$|R
