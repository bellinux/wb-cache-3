25|$|Flight 5719 {{took off}} over 40 minutes late from Minneapolis-St. Paul. This {{was due to}} a late arrival and the {{replacement}} of <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> bulbs in Minneapolis-St. Paul. The aircraft was further delayed when it was deemed overweight for departure, requiring the removal of one passenger from the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{equipment}} can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, baggage compartment extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, rotor brake, multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable <b>landing</b> <b>light,</b> emergency floatation equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting belly tank, and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear {{seats in the}} cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted {{for a total of}} five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> if approved for nighttime operations. <b>Landing</b> <b>lights</b> are usually of very high intensity, because of the considerable distance that may separate an aircraft from terrain or obstacles. The <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> of large aircraft can easily be seen by other aircraft over 100 miles away.|$|R
50|$|<b>Landing</b> <b>lights</b> are {{typically}} only useful as visibility aids to the pilots when the aircraft {{is very low}} and close to terrain, as during take-off and <b>landing.</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>lights</b> are usually extinguished in cruise flight, especially if atmospheric conditions are likely to make the lights reflect or glare back {{into the eyes of}} the pilots. However, the brightness of <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> makes them useful for increasing the visibility of an aircraft to other pilots, and so pilots are often encouraged to keep their <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> on while below certain altitudes or in crowded airspace. Some aircraft (especially business jets) have lights that— when not needed to directly illuminate the ground—can operate in a flashing mode to enhance visibility to other aircraft. One convention is for commercial aircraft to turn on their <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> when changing flight levels. <b>Landing</b> <b>lights</b> are sometimes used in emergencies to communicate with ground personnel or other aircraft, especially if other means of communication are not available (radio failures and the like). Additionally, <b>landing</b> <b>lights</b> have at times been installed as a vehicle high beam in the hot rod scene, although this is not legal.|$|R

500|$|The Alouette {{was then}} hit and, {{although}} only lightly damaged, forced to withdraw, leaving the ground troops without covering MAG fire. Now {{covered by the}} Rhodesian ground troops and Frantans dropped by Percival Provosts, the South Africans made several unsuccessful attempts to pull back from {{the banks of the}} gully throughout the afternoon which led to two injuries and the death of Constable du Toit. The SAP men were eventually able to withdraw under cover of darkness, while Rhodesian and South African injured were uplifted by helicopter in an action described by Southey as [...] "sheer brilliance". [...] "Norman Walsh and Peter Nicholls [...] faced great difficulty because of steep mountainsides and the blackness of the night in conditions of thick haze," [...] writes Peter Petter-Bowyer, then an RRAF flight lieutenant. [...] "Visual contact with [...] ground [...] impossible until dangerously low and close." [...] Flying at such low altitude, each pilot was blinded by the reflection of his own <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> when he looked towards the ground. Walsh noticed that he could clearly see the ground beneath the other helicopter's light, and so instructed Nicholls to turn off his <b>landing</b> <b>light</b> and allow him to illuminate the landing site for him. [...] "This worked like a charm," [...] says Petter-Bowyer. Guided by Walsh's <b>landing</b> <b>light,</b> Nicholls safely landed and collected some of the casualties, then did the same for Walsh as he picked up the rest. Flares were dropped during the night to help the ground troops search for guerrilla movement but none was seen.|$|E

5000|$|Henderson {{felt that}} <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> was [...] "starting {{to get a}} bit tired of jumping and maybe a bit knowing" [...] and decided to {{campaign}} the horse on the flat in 2003. Four {{and a half years}} after finishing unplaced at Saint-Cloud, <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> returned to flat racing at York Racecourse in May 2003. Assigned top weight of 140 pounds and ridden by Kieren Fallon, he started a 25/1 outsider for a handicap race over fourteen furlongs. He made steady progress in the straight to take the lead near the finish and won by half a length from the Michael Jarvis-trained Hambleden. The gelding was again given top weight of 140 pounds when he started at odds of 7/1 for the Ascot Stakes over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot and finished second of the twenty-seven runners behind Sindapour. On 28 June, <b>Landing</b> <b>Light</b> started the 9/2 favourite for the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle, but finished tenth behind Unleash.|$|E
