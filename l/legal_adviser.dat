5|$|To {{bolster the}} new amendment, Grant {{relied on the}} army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce federal laws in the South. Where the attorney general had once been only a <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a solicitor general to argue on the government's behalf in court. Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not very aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T. Akerman, was more zealous.|$|E

5|$|Although Mariano Moreno was a criollo, a Spanish citizen {{born in the}} Americas, he did {{not work}} with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote {{political}} changes against the privileges of the Spanish-born. Unlike the criollo politicians Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, he did not support viceroy Liniers or the Carlotist project, which sought the coronation of Carlota of Spain in the Americas. He joined mayor Martín de Álzaga instead, which allowed him to serve as <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> of the Cabildo. In that capacity, he wrote a petition to the King of Spain, so that the Buenos Aires Cabildo was named Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. As a result, all petitions from local cabildos to the King or the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital.|$|E
5|$|Most {{official}} {{records show}} Davies's birth date as November 1886, {{but he is}} widely {{thought to have been}} born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, <b>legal</b> <b>adviser,</b> and vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm advocate of the Soviet Union, a position he maintained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|A {{barrister}} {{and former}} amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering, a racing car constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters {{for the company}} between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with Bernie Ecclestone, he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated {{the first version of}} the Concorde Agreement, which settled a long-standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One. Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA's parent body, in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now {{attained}} a dominant {{position in the}} Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.|$|E
5|$|The CIA {{operation}} was complicated by a premature coup on 29 March 1953, with a futile raid against the army garrison at Salamá, {{in the central}} Guatemalan department of Baja Verapaz. The rebellion was swiftly crushed, {{and a number of}} participants were arrested. Several CIA agents and allies were imprisoned, weakening the coup effort. Thus the CIA came to rely more heavily on the Guatemalan exile groups and their anti-democratic allies in Guatemala. The CIA considered several candidates to lead the coup. Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, the conservative candidate who had lost the 1950 election to Árbenz, held favor with the Guatemalan opposition but was rejected {{for his role in the}} Ubico regime, as well as his European appearance, which was unlikely to appeal to the majority mixed-race mestizo population. Another popular candidate was the coffee planter Juan Córdova Cerna, who had briefly served in Arévalo's cabinet before becoming the <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> to the UFC. The death of his son in an anti-government uprising in 1950 turned him against the government, and he had planned the unsuccessful Salamá coup in 1953 before fleeing to join Castillo Armas in exile. Although his status as a civilian gave him an advantage over Castillo Armas, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1954, taking him out of the reckoning. Thus it was Castillo Armas, in exile since the failed 1949 coup and on the CIA's payroll since the aborted PBFORTUNE in 1951, who was to lead the coming coup.|$|E
