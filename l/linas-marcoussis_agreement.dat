These two military forces were to serve as peacekeepers and were later tasked to keep the factions {{of the civil war}} separated while the January 2003 <b>Linas-Marcoussis</b> <b>Agreement</b> was implemented.

40|$|The just-ended Ivorian socio-political crisis (2002 - 2011) {{calls on}} the need to put into {{perspective}} the obstacles facing the country in its efforts {{to get out of a}} security deadlock. The dynamic that governed the settlement of the conflict failed to lead to the disarmament of the rebel groups who took up weapons against the democratic institutions of the country. This stems from an interpretation of the international management devices of this crisis. As a matter of fact, since the <b>Linas-Marcoussis</b> <b>Agreement</b> is perceived as institutional procedures towards a validation of the armed violence in Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa), it remains the symbol of a biased political compromise. In fact, Ivorian rebel groups never proved able to disarm until a military solution was found to the crisis, thus turning the former aggressors into new leaders of the country...|$|E
