5|$|Miller's {{research}} was assisted {{by a set}} of Hubbard's personal papers obtained by Gerry Armstrong, a disaffected former employee of the Church of Scientology. Armstrong had been preparing material for an official biography of Hubbard, but <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> in 1981 after finding that Hubbard's claims about his life conflicted with independent sources. The Church of Scientology obtained an injunction in California to prevent Armstrong from further distributing the documents. However, English courts refused to enforce this order.|$|E

5|$|Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> at {{his coming}} of age. His travels to Israel {{and the greater}} Middle East as a young adult helped form his {{political}} views. Wilders worked as a speechwriter for the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie – VVD), and later served as parliamentary assistant to party leader Frits Bolkestein from 1990 to 1998. He {{was elected to the}} Utrecht city council in 1997, and one year later to the House of Representatives. Citing irreconcilable differences over the party's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, he left the VVD in 2004 to form his own party, the Party for Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Smith's death {{resulted}} in a succession crisis. Smith had proposed several ways to choose his successor, but had never clarified his preference. Smith's brother Hyrum, had he survived, {{would have had the}} strongest claim, followed by Smith's brother Samuel, who died mysteriously a month after his brothers. Another brother, William, was unable to attract a sufficient following. Smith's sons Joseph III and David also had claims, but Joseph III was too young and David was yet unborn. The Council of Fifty had a theoretical claim to succession, but it was a secret organization. Some of Smith's chosen successors, such as Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1942, in {{its most}} {{significant}} schism, at least 250 members <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church.</b> Tensions began to build after Joaquín's birthday, when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday. This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members, including some pastors. Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which Joaquín was accused of having enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the faithful. Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members of La Luz del Mundo of committing immoralities with young women. Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission. Members of La Luz del Mundo attribute this episode to the envy and ambition of the dissidents, who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor (The Good Shepherd) under the leadership of José María González, with doctrines and practices similar to those of La Luz del Mundo. The leader is considered a prophet of God. As of 2010, El Buen Pastor Church has a membership of 17,700 in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|No major {{alterations}} {{have been}} made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, {{but there have been}} many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{claims that the}} ghosts of some {{previous}} occupants haunt the building.

25|$|Armstrong {{has written}} {{extensively}} and humorously of her struggle with depression, entering a mental health hospital, {{as well as her}} pregnancies, parenthood, and her experiences with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

25|$|The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Mormon {{fundamentalist}} denominations and one of the largest organizations in the United States whose members practice polygamy.

The split occurred largely because of the LDS Church's suspension of the practice of polygamy and its decision to excommunicate its members who would continue the practice.|$|E
