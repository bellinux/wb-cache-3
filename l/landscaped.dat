40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore how <b>landscape</b> {{dynamics}} and past <b>landscape</b> developments can contribute to current <b>landscape</b> planning. Through a literature review and {{a case study of}} the <b>landscape’s</b> historical development on the Bjäre peninsula, approaches for investigating and understanding past <b>landscape</b> developments and <b>landscape</b> dynamics are presented. Contemporary <b>landscape</b> planning challenges, such as the European <b>Landscape</b> Convention and the Swedish environmental objectives, are reviewed to outline the context in which <b>landscape</b> planning is practiced today, as well as to discuss how an analysis of historical <b>landscapes</b> can be used in current <b>landscape</b> planning. In the case study, changes in land use, <b>landscape</b> functions and driving forces are investigated, and furthermore discussed with the terminology of time-geography and the <b>landscape</b> as a budget frame. Some of the conclusions are that knowledge about <b>landscape</b> dynamics and the <b>landscape’s</b> past can contribute to the search for <b>landscape</b> identity, and the understanding of the <b>landscape’s</b> dependence on history, as well as its significance for the future. Identifying driving forces of <b>landscape</b> change can furthermore facilitate the task of reaching the goals in the European <b>Landscape</b> Convention and the Swedish environmental objectives. The <b>landscape</b> as a budget frame approach can by revealing the power struggle linked to <b>landscape</b> development, be used to discuss priorities in <b>landscape</b> planning, as well as their consequences...|$|R

40|$|<b>Landscape</b> {{is usually}} {{classified}} into cultural and natural part. <b>Landscape</b> {{can be defined}} on more general level as a unit operating {{on the basis of}} interaction between phisically existing plane, i. e. <b>landscape</b> as an organism, and plane interpretational, which is result of reading the <b>landscape</b> by its elements. Interdependence of the two <b>landscape</b> levels follows the definition of <b>landscape</b> memory.

40|$|Human {{attribution}} of multiple values to <b>landscapes</b> {{is not well}} understood owing to the variability and complexity of both the <b>landscape</b> concept and the human valuation process. In this study, we extend psychophysical analysis of <b>landscapes</b> by examining the relationships between multiple <b>landscape</b> values and physical <b>landscape</b> character. Previous <b>landscape</b> research has {{tended to focus on}} the relationship between a single value such as <b>landscape</b> aesthetics and a single physical <b>landscape</b> component, such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected eight <b>landscape</b> values collected through a regional public participation GIS (PPGIS) process with <b>landscape</b> components and classes from the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant spatial associations. The results indicate that the general public associate particular values with specific <b>landscape</b> components at a regional scale. Greater than expected <b>landscape</b> values were associated with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains. Fewer than expected <b>landscape</b> values were associated with flatter, agricultural <b>landscapes.</b> We discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods for <b>landscape</b> assessment in New Zealand, {{and in the absence of}} PPGIS data to directly measure <b>landscape</b> values, whether <b>landscape</b> components should be used to interpolate values for <b>landscape</b> assessment. We urge replication of the method in other regions to increase the external validity of the <b>landscape</b> value–physical <b>landscape</b> associations described herein...|$|R

40|$|<b>Landscape,</b> {{people and}} {{identity}} <b>Landscape</b> {{is about the}} interaction of a place or an area with people, which {{is reflected in the}} material interaction of people creating or shaping the <b>landscape</b> as well as in their mental perception, valuation and symbolic meaning of that <b>landscape</b> (Cosgrove 1998). This mutual and dynamic interaction forms the fundamental principle of the concept of <b>landscape</b> identity. <b>Landscape</b> identity has been described in scientific literature as a concept to bridge the physical, social and cultural aspects of <b>landscapes.</b> Also policy documents related with <b>landscape</b> and heritage (for example the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, the European <b>Landscape</b> Convention, the Faro Convention) are mentioning identity and <b>landscape</b> as key concepts. In those examples, <b>landscape</b> identity can refer to either the <b>landscape</b> itself - its features that makes the <b>landscape</b> unique (thus the <b>landscape</b> character), or to the social and personal construction.
