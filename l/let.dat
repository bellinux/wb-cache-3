The first permanent new guide, <b>Let's</b> Go: Britain and Ireland, was published in 1976. After excellent sales, <b>Let's</b> Go: France and <b>Let's</b> Go: Italy soon followed. All four were updated every year thereafter. Indeed, for much of its history, <b>Let's</b> Go was the only travel guide to update each of its titles every single year.|$|R
