50|$|John Rylands Library {{archives}} {{show that}} {{the roots of the}} Christy company date from at least 1833, when the Stockport firm of W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd - established by banker and hatter William Miller Christy - was manufacturing cotton goods. Christy's son, the noted collector and ethnologist Henry Christy, discovered the product that would make the company famous. While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the <b>looped</b> <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> that is known today as terry towelling, but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'.The company found a method of weaving the <b>looped</b> <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt, who patented the design. The first Christy towels factory opened in Droylsden in 1850. A year later, Christy towels were displayed at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace, Queen Victoria became an early client. By 1891, the company's Fairfields Mill in Droylsden had 310 looms and 30,000 spindles, according to Worrall's Cotton Spinners Directory.|$|E
50|$|Moquette, {{derived from}} the French word for carpet, {{is a type of}} woven <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> in which cut or uncut threads form a short dense cut or <b>loop</b> <b>pile.</b> As well as giving it a {{distinctive}} velvet-like feel, the pile construction is particularly durable, and ideally suited to applications such as public transport. Its upright fibres form a flexible, non-rigid surface, which are constantly displaced to give durability and anti-stain benefits. Traditional moquette fabrics are made from a wool nylon face with an interwoven cotton backing.|$|R
50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> and cut pile in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|R

40|$|Wastewater {{from the}} dye {{industry}} contains {{high level of}} organic nitrogen derived from urea. Thus, an effective nitrogen removal process is needed to reduce effluent nitrogen concentration. We have developed a new nitrogen removal process using non-woven biomass carriers. In this study, we used <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which are products of the local industry in the Wakayama prefecture, instead of non-woven materials as biomass carriers to improve nitrification rates. Several <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were then used for nitrification and continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments. The specific NOx-N production rate using an acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> was 3. 4 times {{higher than that of}} non-woven carriers. About 75 % nitrification efficiencies were obtained under a T-N loading rate of 0. 5 kg-N/m 3 /day and a HRT of 10 hours during continuous nitrification using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore, continuous nitrification/denitrification experiments were carried out using acrylic <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> in a base cloth with a mesh structure to improve the diffusion rates. Little biomass accumulated on the <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> surfaces so a high diffusion rate through the pile was maintained for long periods. Denitrification efficiencies of 56 and 77 % were achieved at HRTs of 12 and 19 hours, respectively, with influent concentrations of 200 mg/l T-N and 450 mg/lTOC...|$|R

50|$|Polar fleece {{originated}} in Massachusetts in 1979 when Malden Mills, (now Polartec LLC), and Patagonia developed Synchilla (synthetic chinchilla). It was a new, light, strong <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> meant to mimic—and {{in some ways}} surpass—wool. Aaron Feuerstein intentionally declined to patent Polar fleece, allowing the material to be produced cheaply and widely by many vendors, leading to the material's quick and wide acceptance.|$|R
5000|$|Mockado (also moquette, moucade) is a woollen <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> made in {{imitation}} of silk velvet from the mid-sixteenth century. Mockado was usually constructed with a woollen pile on a linen or worsted wool warp and woollen weft, although the ground fabric could be any combination of wool, linen, and silk. Mockado was used for furnishings and carpeting, and also for clothing such as doublets, farthingales, and kirtles.|$|R

40|$|BF-T 9 P, a {{nonwoven}} fiber material, {{can be used}} as {{an effective}} biomass carrier for yeast (UY 7 strain) in the treatment of wastewater generated during the production of seasoned salty plums. However, the cost is a major problem in small and medium scale companies. We investigated the feasibility of using a <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> biomass carrier that can be produced at low cost with existing equipment. The TOC removal rate of E-pile, a polyester <b>pile</b> <b>fabric,</b> was as high as that of the nonwoven material under a volumetric loading rate of 4 to 15 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. A packing ratio of 0. 17 m 3 -carrier/m 3 -reactor was sufficient for TOC removal if the volumetric loading rate was less than 8 kg-TOC/m 3 /d. In a system using a biomass carrier, the decrease in TOC removal caused by a temperature drop from 25 to 5 ℃ was slower and the increase in TOC removal upon raising the temperature to 10 ℃ was faster, compared with a system without a biomass carrier. These results may be attributed to the stable retention of yeast in the reactor by entrapment inside the biomass carrier...|$|R
2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist <b>pile,</b> velvet, or <b>loop</b> <b>pile.</b> Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. <b>Loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R
50|$|The term frieze {{can also}} be used for the curly nap frieze fabrics have, as well as the action of raising the nap, which differs from {{standard}} methods. Today, frieze is also a term applied to a textile technique used in modern machine-loomed carpeting, as well as the textile produced. Carpets made with this technique are known for their resilience, due to a high twist rate, outperforming standard cut or <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpets.|$|R

50|$|Pile weave {{is a form}} of textile {{created by}} weaving. <b>Pile</b> <b>fabrics</b> used to be made on {{traditional}} hand weaving machines. The warp ends that are used for the formation of the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by raising alternate threads) during weaving. The pile ends lie in loops over the inserted rods. When a rod is extracted the pile ends remain as loops on top of the base <b>fabric.</b> The <b>pile</b> ends lying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or velvet.|$|R
50|$|The {{roller cover}} is a {{cylindrical}} core with a <b>pile</b> <b>fabric</b> covering secured to the cylindrical core. Foam rubber rollers are also produced. There are both foam and fabric rollers that are individually available (without a handle), made to replace worn out rollers, once an old roller is removed the new roller can be fitted onto the handle section for use. An innovation of the cylindrical core has {{allowed it to}} contain paint inside, with the cover absorbing paint from the inside and filtering it through (naturally by wicking) to be applied externally, when the roller is rolled.|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in an experimental room to measure the effect of human activity on airborne dispersal of settled fungal spores from carpet and vinyl tile flooring. A series of experiments were conducted in which commercial <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpet, residential cut pile carpet, or vinyl tile installed in the experimental room were contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The flooring materials were contaminated to two different levels (106 and 107 colony forming units per square meter [c. f. u. /m 2] of flooring surface). Airborne culturable and total P. chrysogenum concentrations were measured using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers and Burkard personal slide impactor samplers, respectively. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured at floor level, 1 meter, and the adult breathing zone (1. 5 meter) heights before and after human activity consisting of walking in a prescribed pattern for 1 minute in the room. Airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were greater with the higher surface loading for all three flooring materials. For all flooring materials {{there was no significant}} difference between sampler locations, although the data from the 1 -meter location were the highest, followed by the floor level and the breathing zone locations, respectively. The data from these experiments indicate that while a very small fraction of culturable P. chrysogenum spores present on flooring materials were aerosolized by walking, relatively high airborne concentrations of spores maybe re-entrained from contaminated materials. The airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were significantly higher after walking on cut pile carpet than with the other two flooring materials at both contamination levels, with the differences in concentration often ≥ 2 orders of magnitude. No differences were measured in airborne culturable P. chrysogenum between vinyl flooring and <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpet at both contamination levels. Total spore data from the experiments with the 107 c. f. u. /m 2 contamination level indicated that walking on <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpet produced higher airborne spore concentrations than similarly contaminated vinyl tile although no significant difference was observed at the 106 c. f. u. /m 2 level...|$|R

25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} woven <b>fabric.</b> The <b>pile</b> can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber carpet is a <b>loop</b> <b>pile.</b> There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|R
50|$|Modern industrialized Berber carpets are {{distinguished}} by a <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> construction type {{that gives a}} similar appearance to the distinct knot of traditionally woven Berber carpets. The modern carpets usually contain small flecks of dark color on lighter shades of background colors resembling a natural undyed version of the traditional carpets. They generally consist of a plain color mix with no pattern, and are relatively cheap and durable. Popular for areas with significantly heavy use such as offices. The distinctive knot texture and appearance of traditional hand-woven Berber carpets today are generally woven in brightly colored designs that are different from other oriental rugs.|$|R

30|$|Current {{residential}} mattresses use a {{wide range}} of tickings, including <b>pile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> knits, woven fabrics and jacquard designs. To address issues of physiological comfort, fire safety, and the growing incidence of allergies within the U.S. population, a variety of functional coatings, including water-proof, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and/or flame retardant finishes, are applied to the ticking of the mattress. The majority of modern ticking materials have a high polypropylene and/ or polyester fiber count, with the fiber content varying significantly with the fabric structure and design pattern. While cotton, polyester and polypropylene fibers dominate the ticking industry, blends of luxury fibers, such as wool and silk, are becoming more prevalent. Renewable resources like corn, soybean and bamboo fibers are also gaining popularity as more environmentally friendly alternatives. Viscose rayon derived from bamboo is of particularly high interest because of its inherent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties and its good breathability and moisture absorption. However, very {{little is known about the}} flammability of these green alternatives.|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{coatings}} {{in actual}} use {{are subject to}} wear and tear. In this experiment, we look into the dewetting instability of more realistic polymer coatings wherein topographical fluctuations pre-existed. The topographical defects, produced by rubbing the film surface with a <b>piled</b> <b>fabric,</b> could be varied for the density by changing the number of rubbings, N. First, the dewetting mechanism was determined by comparing the dewetting morphology between the unrubbed and rubbed films. Nucleation dewetting was ascribed to samples wherein the characteristic wave vector, q{*}, of the final dewetted morphology increased with increasing N, whereas spinodal dewetting was ascribed to samples wherein was affected little. Second, the evolution of dewetting was compared between the unrubbed and rubbed films. Our, result shows that perturbations from rubbing do not produce changes in the free energy, of the films that will alter the prevailing dewetting mechanism or the characteristic wave vector in spinodal dewetting. Nonetheless, the rubbing-induced defects do affect the rupturing process, in manners depending on the dominating dewetting mechanisms...|$|R
