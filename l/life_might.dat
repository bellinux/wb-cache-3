5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex <b>life</b> <b>might</b> not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that <b>life</b> <b>might</b> have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E
5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her <b>life</b> <b>might</b> have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Detailed {{environmental}} characterization {{is important}} to understanding what about a habitat might be driving life’s evolution and, in turn, how <b>life</b> <b>might</b> be changing that niche. It includes and is not limited to, temperature, light, pH, salinity, concentration of specific molecules like oxygen, and the biologic community.|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} {{the feasibility of}} extraterrestrial life, astronomers had long focused their attention on stars like the Sun. However, since planetary systems that resemble the Solar System are proving to be rare, {{they have begun to}} explore the possibility that <b>life</b> <b>might</b> form in systems very unlike our own.|$|E

25|$|Thought {{on where}} in the Solar System <b>life</b> <b>might</b> occur, was limited {{historically}} by the understanding that life relies ultimately on light and warmth from the Sun and, therefore, is restricted to the surfaces of planets. The three most likely candidates for life in the Solar System are the planet Mars, the Jovian moon Europa, and Saturn's moons Titan, and Enceladus.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien <b>life</b> <b>might</b> differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings. Perhaps human mathematics is parochial to Earth and not shared by other life, though others argue this can only apply to abstract math since the math associated with physics must be similar (in results, if not in methods).|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10mph maximum, limited battery <b>life)</b> <b>might</b> be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.|$|E

25|$|Locations {{within the}} Solar System where <b>life</b> <b>might</b> exist today include the ocean of liquid water beneath the icy surface of Europa, the {{interior}} of Enceladus which is currently sending water into space, and the possible ocean of liquid water which some astronomers believe might exist {{beneath the surface of}} Titan (its surface has oceans of liquid ethane / methane, but it may also have liquid water below the surface and ice volcanoes).|$|E
25|$|The {{attraction}} {{was built}} on the former site of Horizons, a dark ride that offered optimistic visions of what <b>life</b> <b>might</b> be like in the future. Horizons closed permanently in 1999 after a few years of sporadic operation; construction began on Mission: Space shortly thereafter. Industry estimates put the cost of developing the new attraction at US$100 million. The pavilion, like others at Epcot, features a VIP lounge for HP employees called The Red Planet Room.|$|E
25|$|New <b>life</b> <b>might</b> {{commonly}} die out due to runaway heating or cooling {{on their}} fledgling planets. On Earth, {{there have been}} numerous major extinction events that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the extinction of the dinosaurs is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as gamma-ray bursts. It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species is able to develop the technology to communicate with other species.|$|E

25|$|Extremophiles, organisms able {{to survive}} in extreme environments, are a core {{research}} element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include biota which are {{able to survive}} several kilometers below the ocean's surface near hydrothermal vents and microbes that thrive in highly acidic environments. It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and {{in a range of}} other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how <b>life</b> <b>might</b> evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the bacterium Bacillus safensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade.|$|E

(Ox's and his assistant's names combine to make Oxygėne, the French name for Oxygen.)` The opera explores the conflict between Ox's advocacy of modernity and scientific and political change and Ygène's [...] belief that liberation and the accompanying loss of the traditional rhythms of <b>life</b> <b>might</b> bring unhappiness.|$|E
500|$|The Songlines {{features}} a narrator named Bruce whose biography is {{almost identical to}} Chatwin's. The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines. As the book goes on, it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was [...] "for me, the question of questions: {{the nature of human}} restlessness." [...] Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text: [...] "I had a presentiment that the 'travelling' phase of my <b>life</b> <b>might</b> be passing... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me..." [...] Following this statement in The Songlines Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.|$|E

500|$|When Allen {{left the}} Order, Hoshino {{said that the}} {{character}} had become difficult to write. Allen is a philanthropist, and Hoshino said wryly {{that she was not}} equally kind. Because of Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) young male audience, Hoshino said that she wanted to characterize Allen as a cheerful person rather than a troubled teenager. However, she found it difficult because his life became more complicated as the series progressed. Hoshino tries to balance Allen between [...] "strength and sorrow", and has required an occasional hiatus. She said that the most challenging part of Allen's face was his smile; he often smiles, sometimes when he is lying or unhappy. After Allen left the Order, Hoshino told readers that his <b>life</b> <b>might</b> be arduous and joked that he would cheat at gambling (learned while training with Cross Marian).|$|E
500|$|In {{astrobiology}} {{and planetary}} astrophysics, the galactic habitable zone is {{the region of}} a galaxy in which <b>life</b> <b>might</b> most likely develop. More specifically, {{the concept of a}} galactic habitable zone incorporates various factors, such as metallicity and the rate of major catastrophes such as supernovae, in order to calculate which regions of the galaxy are more likely to form terrestrial planets, initially develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance. According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may [...] favor the birth and development of habitable planets more than smaller galaxies such as the Milky Way. In the case of the Milky Way, its galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center (with both radii lacking hard boundaries).|$|E
500|$|Free Collars Kingdom {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from English-speaking audiences.
