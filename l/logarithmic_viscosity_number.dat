40|$|Ester interchange, alcoholysis, and {{acidolysis}} of polypivalolactone (PPVL) {{were studied}} by melting PPVL with bisphenol diacetates, 1, 4 -butanediol, or aromatic diacids. Interchange of PPVL with the diacetates and the diol occured readily, {{in particular in}} the presence of a titanium catalyst. Melting PPVL with 10 mol-% of bisphenol-Adiacetate {{in the presence of}} 0, 5 wt. % tetrabutylorthotitanate resulted in an incorporation of 33 % of the diacetate in the polymer chains, whereas the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>number</b> decreased by 81 %. The ester interchange was suggested to proceed by an initial cleavage of ester bonds in the polymer chain of PPVL, resulting in the formation of shorter chains, followed by a reaction between the newly formed ester end-groups and initially present hydroxyl chain ends. The acidolysis of PPVL with the diacids proved to be less effective; in the case of the acidolysis of PPVL with 10 mol-% isophthalic acid, less than 1 % of the diacid was incorporated in the polymer chains and a decrease in the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>number</b> of only 22 % was found. Both the high stability of the ester bond in PPVL towards acids in general and the heterogeneity of these systems were supposed to cause the behaviour of PPVL with respect to acidolysis.

40|$|Perturbation viscometry is a {{recently}} developed method which measures the logarithmic gradient of the viscosity-composition curve for gas mixtures using {{a variant of}} capillary-tube viscometry. A gas mixture flowing through a capillary has its composition perturbed {{by the addition of}} a small flow of gas, normally one of the pure components of the gas mixture. Two pressure changes, the first due to the change in flowrate and second due to the change in viscosity are seen at the capillary. The <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradient is calculated from the ratio of these two pressure changes. Integration of <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradients measured for the full composition range yields the mixture viscosity relative to the viscosity of either component of the gas mixture. This method is attractive because, for measurements of equal precision, integration of the gradients is potentially much more precise than conventional methods that measure the absolute viscosities directly. Integration of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradients could be accomplished either by application of the trapezium rule or numerical integration of a polynomial fitted to the data. Here a method with better theoretical foundations is presented. The method fits a differential form of the Sutherland equation to the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradients. The fitted parameters of the equation are then used to generate the viscosity ratios by substitution into the normal form of the Sutherland equation. The quality of fit obtained may be used to test of the consistency of the experimental data. Experimental data gathered for the mixtures argon-nitrogen, helium-argon and helium-nitrogen at 98. 5 °C are analysed using this procedure. The internal consistency of the data is checked by direct comparison of calculated values for the gradients generated from the fitted Sutherland parameters with actual experimental data. The calculated relative viscosities are compared with extant data and theoretical predictions and show good agreement. Also the calculated Sutherland parameters are well within the scatter of the parameters obtained from alternative sources...|$|R

40|$|A {{perturbation}} viscometer is a differential {{capillary viscometer}} that measures the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradient of the viscosity–composition curve for gas mixtures. Measurements are made at different gas mixture compositions. Integration of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradients measured over the full composition range gives the mixture viscosity {{relative to the}} viscosity {{of one of the}} pure components of the gas mixture. This method is attractive because, for measurements of equal precision, integration of the gradients is potentially an order of magnitude more precise than measurement of the viscosities directly. It can also work at high and low temperatures and perhaps high pressures. The perturbation viscometer has been used to make measurements on ideal gas mixtures at ambient and elevated temperatures. The situation is more complicated when the gas mixtures are non-ideal. Extra effects due to density differences, molar volume change on mixing and differential thermal expansion may be measured in addition to the desired viscosity change producing systematic errors in the results. Thus, a more sophisticated apparatus is required. The standard perturbation viscometer has been modified to separate out the extra effects to permit measurement of the true change in viscosity. In addition, the theoretical operation of the modified apparatus has been revised to account for the design changes to permit calculation of the viscosity–composition profiles from the results. The apparatus has been tested using helium–HFC- 125 mixtures and two new viscosity–composition profiles are presented for these mixtures at 23 and.

Viscosity-concentration studies for solutions of cellulose triacetate in the solvents chloroform, methylene chloride, tetrachloroethane, formic acid and m-cresol were carried out. Molecular weight determinations were carried out osmometrically (Mechro-lab Model) using chloroform as a solvent, for cellulose triacetate samples in the molecular weight range of 30, 000 - 150, 000. The Mark-Houwink viscosity-molecular weight relationship for cellulose triacetate in the above solvents and the Huggin's viscosity-concentration relationship were investigated and the respective values of alpha, K and k 1 constants were determined.

The solubility parameters of the diepoxies and the curative calculated from Fedors's method suggest miscibility of PPO with the components, and this was observed at the processing temperature; however, some of the blends were not transparent at room temperature, indicating phase immiscibility and/or partial PPO crystallization. The steady shear and dynamic viscosities of the systems agreed well with the Cox–Merz relationship and the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosities</b> decreased approximately linearly with increasing amounts of DGEBA 381, DGEBA 340 or MCDEA, thus causing a processability enhancement of the PPO.

Dynamic mechanical analysis of blends with varying PPO:DGEBA ratios showed that the main glass transition temperature (Tg) of the blends decreased continuously with increasing epoxy content, with a slightly higher plasticizing efficiency being exhibited by DGEBA 340 compared to DGEBA 381.

40|$|A {{perturbation}} viscometer is a flux response technology {{device that}} measures gradients on the viscosity-composition curve of a binary mixture or more generally on the viscosity-composition surface. It provides {{a method of}} calculating relative gas viscosities very precisely. In conventional perturbation viscometry a small perturbation flow of one component of the gas mixture is added to a main flow of known composition flowing through a capillary. The pressure upstream of the capillary changes sequentially due to the change in flowrate and viscosity of the mixture. The ratio of these pressure changes gives the gradient of the viscosity-composition curve. Integration of the viscosity gradients across the composition range yields the relative viscosities of the mixtures. This present paper gives new theoretical treatments for large perturbation flows up to 150 % of the main flowrate. Corrections to the theory for small finite perturbations are proposed that account for the differences observed when larger perturbations are used. These correction terms are used to demonstrate how the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> gradient-composition curve can be found by adding progressively bigger perturbations {{to each of the}} two pure components.

40|$|The shear {{behaviour}} of {{cohesive soil}} material {{is known to}} be dependent on the rate of shear. The impact of the rate of shear on the undrained shear strength must not be neglected. In tests, the rate of shear is in most cases significantly larger than the rate of strain in situ. Based on the results of soil mechanical classification tests, the dredged and sewage sludges under consideration are comparable with soft cohesive soil materials. When landfilling these sludges, the test measurements of the shear strength have to be reduced in order to properly determine the stability of landfill sites. The approaches described in technical literature, show linear and non-linear dependencies between the shear strength and the rate of strain. For the evaluation of the velocity-dependent material characteristics of dredged and sewage sludges, power functions have been applied as well as a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>viscosity</b> law. The results of the analyses were evaluated against published findings. Dependent on the chosen velocity quotient, the correlation between the rotary velocity and the vane shear strength is deduced from the ascertained correlation between the rotary velocity and the respective ratio value of the vane shear strength by using approaches in the form of power functions.
