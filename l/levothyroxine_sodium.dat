40|$|Thyroid hormones exert many {{effects on}} the {{cardiovascular}} system. Thyroid abnormality enhances atherosclerosis not only through general risk factors (dyslipidemia) but also via {{a close relationship with}} hemodynamic parameters; <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> modulates some elements of the fibrinolytic system, though the relationship is not completely clear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> on fibrinolytic parameters such as plasminogen activator (PA) in rat heart, plasma levels of PA and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), plasma glucose, and the serum lipid profile. Rats were given 50 μg 100 g– 1 body weight <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> for one week. Rat heart PA activity was significantly greater in the treated animals than in controls. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups of rats in PA, PAI or plasma glucose.

40|$|<b>Levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> {{is a drug}} with {{a narrow}} {{therapeutic}} index for which an individual patient must have his or her dose carefully titrated to achieve the necessary therapeutic effect. In addition, exogenous levothyroxine cannot be distinguished from the endogenously produced hormone. Since 2004, generic formulations have been approved for the most frequently prescribed brands of <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium.</b> This review examines the methodology and statistical acceptance criteria and summarizes findings of a previously published relative bioavailability study that brings into question the use of standard criteria to assess bioequivalence of <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium.</b> The key findings reviewed were the following: (1) {{in the absence of}} baseline correction for endogenous T 4 levels, products that differed by as much as 25 % to 33 % would be declared bioequivalent; (2) the use of baseline correction reduced the likelihood of declaring products bioequivalent when they actually differed by 25 % to 33 %; (3) even with baseline correction, products that differed by 12. 5 % would be declared bioequivalent; and (4) there was evidence of significant carryover from one dosing period to the next even with washout periods of up to 53 days. In conclusion, the current recommended methodology in the United States to assess bioequivalence for <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> products is inadequate to differentiate products that differ by 12. 5 %, a clinically relevant difference. Recommendations are made for modifications to the criteria that could improve the likelihood that products that differ by a clinically significant amount in their bioavailability would not be accepted as bioequivalent...|$|E

The mean <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> dose was 111 ± 6 μg/d, and the mean duration of treatment was 7. 5 ± 5. 3 years (range, 1 to 24 years). Dietary calcium intake was similar in both groups, as were serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine index, and thyrotropin levels. Women receiving the levothyroxine treatment had normal total body BMD levels but had significantly lower BMD levels at the femoral neck (- 5. 7 %), femoral trochanter (- 7. 0 %), Ward's triangle (- 10. 6 %), both arms (right, - 7. 8 %; left, - 8. 9 %), and pelvis (- 4. 9 %). In contrast, lumbar spine BMD levels were similar in the two groups. There was no correlation between the total body or different regional BMD levels and the duration or dosage of levothyroxine treatment or thyroid function test results. However, the z score of the femoral neck of these patients showed a significant negative correlation with their serum free thyroxine index levels. We conclude that patients receiving physiological doses of levothyroxine may have decreased bone density. Thyroid functions in patients receiving long-term levothyroxine treatment should be closely monitored and bone densitometry should be performed in patients at risk for osteoporosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In clinical practice, we found that patients treated with I- 131 often exhibit TAO; therefore, we aimed to establish a novel thyroid function fluctuated animal model of TAO by simulating the clinical treatment process. We treated SD rats with I- 131 to damage the thyroid and then used <b>sodium</b> <b>levothyroxine</b> (L-T 4) to supplement the thyroid hormone (TH) levels every seven days, leading to a fluctuating level of thyroid hormones that simulated the status of clinical TAO patients. Rats administered normal saline were considered as a control. The weight, intraocular pressure, and serum T 3, T 4, TSH and TRAb levels of the rats were measured, and the pathological changes were analyzed by H&E staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The experimental rats (TAO group) exhibited significantly reduced weight and elevated intraocular pressure compared with the control rats. Meanwhile, the serum levels of T 3 and T 4 were up-regulated in the TAO group, but the TSH level decreased during the 10 -week study.

An extensive survey of the literature and investigation of 83 liquid dosage forms revealed that stability considerations were of concern for only 7. 2 % of these liquid dosage forms, extemporaneously prepared from the following commercially available products: captopril, hydralazine hydrochloride, isoniazid, <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium,</b> phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride and tetracycline hydrochloride. Inclusion of the antioxidant, sodium ascorbate in the liquid dosage form for captopril resulted in improved stability at 4 ºC.

Due to the unreliability of Levothyroxine-based commercial products, in the present study we decided to follow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines* and use a Levothyroxine solution as reference product. The bioavailability of the <b>Levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> tablet formulation THYROHORMONE (R) /Ni-The Ltd (0. 2 mg/tab) and that of a reference oral solution (0. 3 mg/ 100 ml) under fasting conditions were compared in an open, randomized, single-dose two-way crossover study. Twenty four healthy Caucasian volunteers (M/F= 15 / 9, mean age= 32. 9 +/- 7. 4 yr) participated in the study. Bioavailability was assessed by pharmacokinetic parameters such as the area under plasma concentration-time curve from time zero up to the measurable last time point (AUC(last)) and the maximum plasma concentration (C-max). Hepatinized venous blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to a 48 -hour period post-dose. <b>Levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> in plasma samples was assayed by a validated electrochemiluninescent immunoassay technique. Statistical analysis showed that the post-dose thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels decreased significantly (p < 0. 05). Regarding Levothyroxine (T 4), the point estimate of the test formulation to the reference formulation ratios (T/R) for AUC(last) and C-max was 0. 92 with 90 % confidence limits (0. 90, 0. 94) and 0. 93 with 90 % confidence limits (0. 91, 0. 94), respectively.

Group 1 animals received only 3 ml normal saline orally as control group, group 2 was treated with (L-T 4) 0. 3 mg?kg b. w as hyperthyroidic. The 3 rd group hyperthyroidic rabbits were post-treated with green tea catechins extract (200 mg?k g b. w) while the 4 th group hyperthyroidic rabbits were post-treated with carbimazole (5 mg ? kg b. w). The results indicated high significantly increased (p< 0. 001) in serum level of total triiodothyronine (TT 3), total thyroxine (TT 4) and high significantly stimulating hormone in hyperthyroid rabbit...|$|E
40|$|Sheehan’s syndrome, {{which is}} {{pituitary}} necrosis after severe postpartum hemorrhage and hypovolemia, may cause hypopituitarism immediately or several years later, {{depending on the}} degree of tissue destruction. We report an unusual case, in which a 55 -year-old woman with Sheehan's syndrome got worse symptoms after spontaneous labor. In 1998, she had severe postpartum hemorrhage and pituitary necrosis during the third delivery, thus it was diagnosed as Sheehan’s syndrome by clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and magnetic resonance imaging. She was treated by replacement therapy including hydrocortisone and <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium.</b> However, she had the fourth spontaneous pregnancy in 2000 and got worse symptoms after delivery. We carefully concluded that pregnancy provided no evidence against the diagnosis of Sheehan’s syndrome because pregnancy might improve hypopituitarism by stimulating the pituitary remnant to undergo hyperplasia and irritating the placenta to secrete hormone. However, pregnancy might aggravate the symptoms by inducing autoimmunity as well. All in all, early diagnosis and adequate medical treatment are important to provide a good prognosis of Sheehan’s syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Research {{on animals}} and humans {{requires}} much consideration in regards to ethics, facilities, cost, and time. More then 205, 000 drugs are marketed worldwide every year. The current system of drug testing places consumers in a dangerous situation. The fourth {{leading cause of death}} in the United States is adverse reaction to prescription drugs. For instance, Evicromila, a drug administered to asthmatics caused liver damage in 20 % of clinical trial participants. Accordingly, this raised questions as to whether an alternative to using human or animal test subjects {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} new pharmaceuticals could be found through the use of plants. Problem (Purpose) This research experiment explores the effects of human medication, namely ASA, iron, and <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> (LTS) on Lepidium Sativum (curly cress) and Raphanus Sativus (radishes) to determine whether the use of plants for testing pharmaceuticals is a viable complementary testing method to the experimentation performed on humans and animals. Hypothesis It is anticipated the plants will exhibit signs of response to the medication they ar...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{idiopathic}} thrombocytopenic purpura with Hashimoto' s thyroiditis. A 67 -year-old female was admitted to our hospital for bleeding tendency in December 1992. Laboratory findings were as follows : platelet count was 3, 000 /mm 3, PA -IgG was 605 ng/ 10 ^ 7 cells, megakaryocyte count in bone marrow examination was 117 /μl, free T 3 was 68. 8 ng/dl, free T 4 was 1. 8 μg/dl, TSH was 395. 7 μu/ml, anti-thyroglobulin antibody was × 400, and anti-microsome antibody was × 25, 600. The patient was diagnosed as having idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Prednisolone was administered for ITP, and <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> for Ha- shimoto's thyroiditis. The platelet count increased. Anti-thyroglobulin antibody and anti -microsome antibody were × 400 and × 25, 600 respectively in December 1992. They became depressed to under × 100 and 25, 600 in January 1993, and to under × 100 and under × 100 in July 1997. This case suggests that a common immunological mechanism exists between ITP and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and that prednisolone is effective for both thrombocytopenia due to ITP and hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} {{is to determine the}} pathologic significance of a recurrent nodular goiter {{on the basis of the}} follow-up results analysis after the operations on the thyroid gland. Materials and methods. 64 patients (58 females and 6 males) aged 32 — 63 years (46. 4 ± 8. 3 years) with a recurrent nodular goiter after the operations on the thyroid gland have been included into the study. The follow-up period was 5 years. Results. The absolute reoperation indications were revealed only in 9 patients (14. 1 %). They underwent thyroidectomy. A transitory unilateral laryngoparesis developed in 2 patients in a postoperative period. During the follow-up period euthyroidism persisted in patients with a recurrent nodular goiter required no operative intervention. Only 4 of 13 patients needed to take <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> required a substitution therapy correction. No significant increase of the node size was observed according to the ultrasonoscopy data. The average indicator of life quality corresponded to a good result (10. 1 ± 0. 4 points). Conclusion. A recurrent nodular goiter after thyroid tissue preserving operations has no clinical manifestations in the majority of patients...|$|E

Physicians, pharmacists, and patients must be aware that although there are a number sf com-mercially available branded and generic levothyroxine tablet products, questions re-main as to whether these products are bio-equivalent and therapeutically equivalent. While numerous studies to determine the bio-equivalence of levothyroxine products have been published (including the one referenced above), results have been conflicting and no consensus has been reached as to the appropri-ate design to study the bioequivalence of levothyroxine products using the generally ac-cepted pharmacokinetic parameters of AUC, C, and T,, for total thyroxine (T 4), total triiodo-thyronine (IT 3), free thyroxine index (FTJ), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), stan-dard measures of thyroid function.

40|$|Objective To {{discuss the}} {{histological}} characteristics, immunohistochemical phenotypes, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of one case of primary hypothyroidism presenting as pituitary hyperplasia concurrent with hyperprolactinemia.   Methods and Results A 29 -year-old female presented menoxenia for one year, galactorrhea for 3 months, and headache for one week. Head MRI demonstrated a sellar space-occcupying lesion and a pituitary adenoma was suspected. Therefore, the patient underwent an exploratory surgery via transnasal-sphenoidal approach under general anesthesia. During the surgery the lesion {{was located in}} {{the right side of}} sella turcica. It was hard, tough and gray with poor blood supply. Under optical microscopy, the acinar cells showed a diffuse hyperplasia, with focal nodular expansion. The boundary between hyperplastic and normal acinus was ill-defined. By using immunohistochemical staining, the hyperplastic cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin (Syn) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), partially positive for prolactin (PRL), and negative for thyoid transcription factor- 1 (TTF- 1). Lymphocytes were scatteredly positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA). Ki- 67 labeling index was less than 1 %. Pathological diagnosis was pituitary hyperplasia. The final clinical diagnosis was hypothyroidism. The patient took <b>levothyroxine</b> <b>sodium</b> (Euthyrox) 100 μg/d continously, and was well during the 13 -month follow-up.   Conclusions Preopertive diagnosis of pituitary hyperplasia is difficult．Definite diagnosis could be made by clinical history, typical histopathological characteristics and immunohistochemical phenotypes. Differential diagnosis from pituitary adenoma, especially microadenoma, should be paid attention.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2016. 04. 009 </p...|$|E
