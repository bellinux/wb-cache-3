40|$|Background: Household <b>living</b> <b>arrangement,</b> {{whether an}} {{individual}} lives alone, with family, or with unrelated persons, may predict {{quality of life}} in adults with mental illness, as it influences social interactions and availability of immediate resources. Objective: To assess the relationship between <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> and {{quality of life in}} adults with mental illness. Design: Secondary analysis of 294 community-dwelling adults with mental illness. Linear regression was used to estimate the association between <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> and quality of life. Results: Initially, linear regression analysis did not suggest a strong association between quality of life and living arrangement; however, further analysis suggested that social support mediates the relationship between <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> and quality of life in adults with mental illness. Conclusion: Future research should address the limitations of the current study to advance the understanding of the association between <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> and quality of life in this population...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which publicly provided formal (paid) home care substitutes for unpaid care provided informally by family and friends. Unlike most previous research, we recognize that the choice among alternative combinations of formal and informal care depends on the type of <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> chosen, and that these <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> choices in turn are influenced by the public provision of formal home care. Using data from a social experiment, we find that a generous public home care program significantly increases the probability that unmarried persons will live independently and reduces the probability of living in shared households or in nursing or personal care homes. However, any substitution effects-either direct effects on provision of informal care given <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> or indirect effects due to <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> changes-appear to be small. ...|$|R

5|$|By the 14th century, castles were {{combining}} defences with luxurious, sophisticated <b>living</b> <b>arrangements</b> and landscaped {{gardens and}} parks. Early gunpowder weapons {{were used to}} defend castles {{by the end of}} the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle. The economics of maintaining castles meant that many were left to decline or abandoned; in contrast, a small number of castles were developed by the very wealthy into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture. Smaller defensible structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat. By the late medieval period, town walls were increasingly less military in character and more often expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance: many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes.|$|E

40|$|It has {{frequently}} {{been shown that}} the never married, divorced and widowed have higher rates of self-reported morbidity than married people. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess to what extent morbidity differences by marital status can be explained by differences in <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> (i. e. <b>living</b> with a partner or not). If <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> plays a major role, one expects to find that: 1. people who live with a partner have lower morbidity rates than those who live alone; 2. morbidity differences by marital status decrease substantially after controlling for <b>living</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Data from the GLOBE study, a large prospective cohort in the Netherlands, on 18, 973 people from Eindhoven and its surroundings, aged 15 - 74, were used to test the hypotheses. The measures for morbidity were perceived general health, subjective health complaints, chronic conditions and work disability. Multiple logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios for morbidity by <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> (question 1) and for morbidity by marital status, firstly without control and subsequently with control for <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> (question 2). In all models we controlled for other sociodemographic variables (age, sex, educational level, degree of urbanization, religion and country of birth). Our analyses showed that people who live with a partner have lower morbidity rates than those who live alone. They further showed that the excess risks of the never married, widowed and divorced decreased by 40 - 70 % for all health measures (except subjective health complaints) after controlling for <b>living</b> <b>arrangement.</b> (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population.

The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex <b>living</b> <b>arrangements,</b> in keeping with American college conventions.

During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

Since care for the sick and elderly is often provided informally by family members, parental illness may have important implications for the labour supply of adult children. Although previous studies show a negative relationship between hours worked and caregiving, they do not account for the potential endogeneity of the parental <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> to the child's labour supply. Using panel data and controlling for such endogeneity, I find that caregiving and cohabiting with a sick, elderly parent appear to have smaller effects on labour supply than the past literature suggests. Nonetheless, since cohabiting with a sick elderly parent does have negative effects on the labour supply of women and given that this form of <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> is relatively common, the aggregate costs associated with informal caregiving in an intergenerational <b>living</b> <b>arrangement</b> are considerable. aging; labour supply...|$|R
