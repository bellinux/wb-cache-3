40|$|In {{order to}} realize {{alternative}} fueling for military and commercial use, {{the industry has}} set forth guidelines that must be met by each fuel. These aviation fueling requirements are outlined in MIL-DTL- 83133 F(2008) or ASTM D 7566 Annex (2011) standards, and are classified as "drop-in" fuel replacements. This report provides combustor performance data for synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene- (SPK-) type (Fischer-Tropsch (FT)) fuel and blends with JP- 8 + 100, relative to JP- 8 + 100 as baseline fueling. Data were taken at various nominal inlet conditions: 75 psia (0. 52 MPa) at 500 degF (533 K), 125 psia (0. 86 MPa) at 625 degF (603 K), 175 psia (1. 21 MPa) at 725 degF (658 K), and 225 psia (1. 55 MPa) at 790 degF (694 K). Combustor performance analysis assessments were made for the change in flame temperatures, combustor efficiency, wall temperatures, and exhaust plane temperatures at 3, 4, and 5 percent combustor pressure drop (DP) for fuel:air ratios (F/A) ranging from 0. 010 to 0. 025.

40|$|Alternate {{aviation}} fuels {{for military}} or commercial use {{are required to}} satisfy MIL-DTL- 83133 F(2008) or ASTM D 7566 (2010) standards, respectively, and are classified as "drop-in" fuel replacements. To satisfy legacy issues, blends to 50 % alternate fuel with petroleum fuels are certified individually {{on the basis of}} processing and assumed to be feedstock agnostic. Adherence to alternate fuels and fuel blends requires "smart fueling systems" or advanced fuel-flexible systems, including combustors and engines, without significant sacrifice in performance or emissions requirements. This paper provides preliminary performance (Part A) and emissions and particulates (Part B) combustor sector data. The data are for nominal inlet conditions at 225 psia and 800 F (1. 551 MPa and 700 K), for synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene- (SPK-) type (Fisher-Tropsch (FT)) fuel and blends with JP- 8 + 100 relative to JP- 8 + 100 as baseline fueling. Assessments are made of the change in combustor efficiency, wall temperatures, emissions, and luminosity with SPK of 0 %, 50 %, and 100 % fueling composition at 3 % combustor pressure drop. The performance results (Part A) indicate no quantifiable differences in combustor efficiency, a general trend to <b>lower</b> <b>liner</b> and higher core flow temperatures with increased FT fuel blends. In general, emissions data (Part B) show little differences, but with percent increase in FT-SPK-type fueling, particulate emissions and wall temperatures are less than with baseline JP- 8.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of a 2. 4 l {{direct injection}} diesel engine {{has been investigated}} to identify how the fuel consumption penalty associated with operation during warm–up can be minimised. A version of PROMETS (Programme for Modelling Engine Thermal Systems) was developed to support the investigations. The developments improved the representation of thermal-friction conditions in the oil circuit, extended the piston heat transfer sub-model {{to account for the}} effects of piston cooling jets and introduced a main bearing thermal-friction model to predict friction and oil film temperatures. Computational studies were complemented by an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of pre-heating the oil feed to the bearings. Results show that heat transfer from the oil film to the bearings shells and crankshaft journal reduces the benefit in friction savings. Other measures considered were exhaust gas heat recovery, repositioning of the oil main gallery within the block, thermal energy storage, reductions in engine thermal capacity and a novel split-EGR cooler able to cool the EGR gases and heat either the coolant or oil streams. All of the above measures were investigated in isolation, but where appropriate different measures were adopted in conjunction to achieve even greater fuel savings. During warm-up the energy available to raise fluid temperatures is small. As a result, over the New European Drive Cycle, thermal energy storage showed the greatest benefits. Given an available source of thermal energy which can be transferred to the oil over a chosen time, simulations indicate that a higher power input over a shorter period is most beneficial. This reflects the increased sensitivity of oil viscosity to temperature changes at colder temperatures which in turn means that the potential to reduce friction is highest in the first minutes after engine start up but drops rapidly hereafter. Results also show how the balance of energy transfers out of the oil changes as the engine warms up and point to the importance of oil interaction with components in the lower parts of the engine which have a large thermal capacity, such as elements supporting the main bearings, the crankshaft and the <b>lower</b> <b>liner</b> which limit the rate of temperature rise of the oil. A combination of supplementary heat introduction into the oil circuit from a thermal store and an elimination of heat losses from the oil to the lower parts of the engine resulted in a fuel consumption saving close to that achieved by starting the engine fully warm, which equates to around 6 % improvement.

40|$|We report X-ray fluxes in the 2 – 10 keV {{band from}} LINERs (low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions) and low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies {{obtained}} with the ASCA satellite.

We found that X-ray luminosities in 2 – 10 keV of LINERs with broad Hα emission in their optical spectra (LINER 1 s) are proportional to their Hα luminosities. This correlation strongly supports the hypothesis that the dominant ionizing source in LINER 1 s is photoionization by hard photons from low-luminosity AGNs.

40|$|The {{foreseeable}} {{opportunity for}} LTFT jet fuel has spurred an initiative for Sasol Technology Fuels Research {{to increase the}} level of gas turbine expertise within the mechanical group. This included gaining an intimate familiarity with the jet fuel business, and all relevant aspects of gas turbine technology and jet fuel combustion performance. This project formed {{a component of the}} research activity. ObjectivesThe primary focus of the project was to ascertain the extent to which reducing aromatic content would a ect the performance of a gas turbine. However, since no facilities existed at the Sasol Advanced Fuels Laboratory (SAFL) for jet fuels research, the rst objective was to establish a working test cell with which to complete the research. Once operational, the engine was instrumented to study the thermal loading on the combustor, and a database of soot emissions measurements was populated while operating on a matrix of fuels. Experimental SetupA T 63 -A- 700, Model 250 -C 18 B gas turbine was installed in a test cell at the Sasol Advanced Fuels Laboratory. The engine was instrumented to determine the performance implications of jet fuels with varying aromatic contents. Synthetic Para nic Kerosene (SPK) containing zero aromatics, and a petroleum{derived Jet A- 1 fuel containing 19. 0 % aromatics were the two test fuels incorporated to determine the e ect of aromatics on engine performance. Liner temperature measurements were attained via an instrumented combustor liner, as well as exhaust gas sampling employed to determine engine soot emissions. Discussion of ResultsThe results showed a mean improvement in engine e ciency of 1. 17 % when operating at cruise conditions on SPK versus petroleum{dervied Jet A- 1. The e ciency was attained via four means; an improvement in the thermodynamic properties of the combustion products, an increase in combustione ciency, a reduction in the viscosity of the combustion products and a reduction in the liner pressure loss, also linked to viscous e ectsThere was an 86. 8 % reduction in soot emissions at cruise conditions, and a 95. 3 % reduction in soot emissions at idle conditions with operation on SPK versus petroleum{derived Jet A- 1. The reduction in soot was attributed to the reduction in aromatic content of the fuel. There was a consistent reduction in liner operating temperature at cruise conditions measured with operation on SPK. The liner temperature reduced by 20 C {{in the vicinity of the}} primary combustion zone, and about 5 C at the turbine end of the combustor liner. The reduction in operating temperature was primarily attributed to the reduction in soot, and the resultant reduction in thermal radiation heat transfer. ConclusionsThe soot formation tendency of aromatics were seen during experimentation, with an 86. 8 % and 95. 3 % reduction in soot formation measured during operation on aromatic free SPK versus a petroleum{derived Jet A- 1. The reduction in soot within the combustor resulted in a large reduction in the thermal radiation heat transfer to the combustor liner, and caused a <b>lower</b> combustor <b>liner</b> operating temperature to result. The greater H/C ratio of SPK with respect to petroleum{derived Jet A- 1 caused the thermodynamic properties of the combustion products to change directionally toward improving energy extraction via a turbine. The H/C ratio e ect was due to the reduction of aromatic molecules in the fuel, and the inclusion of more para nic molecule with a greater H/C ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of green house gases and other pollutant emissions is of highest interest in modern engine development. This {{can be achieved}} by increasing the engine efficiency. For this, new combustion processes are needed. Another possibility to decrease green house gas emissions is the combustion of biofuels. However, these new methods as well as the efficient combustion of bio-fuels require an understanding of the highly three-dimensional flow field inside the combustion chamber. In this study the non reacting flow in two different research engines is measured. The measurements in the first research engine focus on the understanding of the highly three-dimensional structure of the flow field inside the combustion chamber. For this, holographic and tomographic particle-image velocimetry (PIV) have been applied to gain information on the intake and compression stroke of the research engine. The holographic PIV measurements show the feasibility of the technique to measure the highly unstable volumetric flow field. The analysis of the tomographic PIV measurements is based on the analysis of the flow field at 80 °, 160 °, and 240 ° after top dead center(atdc) such that the velocity distributions at the intake, the end of the intake, and the compression stroke at an engine speed of 1, 500 rpm are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the influence of an internal exhaust gas recirculation is analyzed at a crank angle of 240 ° atdc. The flow fields are analyzed by distributions of the velocity fields, the turbulent kinetic energy, and the Г 1 vortex identification function. The tomographic measurements enable the instantaneous resolution of the large scale three-dimensional vortical structures of the in-cylinder flow. Through this, the U-shaped structure of the tumble vortex core and the development of an elliptic ring vortex below the pent roof could be confirmed. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy with high values below the intake valves could be shown. The analysis of the exhaust gas recirculation shows the tumble vortex to decompose at earlier crank angles. Furthermore, compared to the standard configuration, a higher turbulent kinetic energy could be shown. After that, the interaction of the liquid phase of ethanol and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) injected with an A-type fuel injector is investigated in the second engine by means of Mie scattering imaging (MSI). The results show the flow field to strongly influence the spray behavior. Especially for late injection during the compression phase a strong interaction of tumble vortex and spray is visible. Compared to ethanol, MEK shows <b>lower</b> piston and <b>liner</b> wetting effects and a reduced influence of the flow field on the injection behavior. Finally, time-resolved stereoscopic PIV measurements have been performed to investigate the influence of ethanol fuel injection on the flow field behavior at an engine speed of 1, 500 and 2, 000 rpm. For this, ensemble averaged velocity fields, turbulent kinetic energy, and the Г 1 vortex identification criterion are used. Through the Г 1 vortex identification criterion, a change in the propagation of the tumble vortex core could be shown. Furthermore, a {{reduction of}} spatial mean vorticity is evident. Additionally, the turbulent kinetic energy is reduced by the injection process. Finally, a stabilizing impact of higher engine speed is evident...|$|R
