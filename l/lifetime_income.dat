5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and <b>lifetime</b> <b>income</b> rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of inheritances and gifts {{received}} {{on the distribution of}} wealth among older households in England, and the implications for inequality in <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes.</b> Whereas previous work has looked only at marketable wealth, we consider broader measures including public and private pensions. We find that once pension wealth is included, inheritances and gifts no longer have an equalising impact on the distribution of wealth. Without pension wealth, including transfers takes the wealth share of the top 10 % from 40 % to 38 %; with pension wealth, the impact is near zero. This has important implications for {{the impact of}} inheritances and gifts on the distribution of <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes.</b> Exploiting a link with administrative data on lifetime earnings, we show that savings rates are significantly increasing in <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes</b> when pension wealth is excluded, but less so when it is included. Our results thus indicate that the impact of intergenerational transfers on the distribution of <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes</b> among these individuals is likely to be negligible or inequality-increasing, rather than inequality-reducing...|$|R

40|$|In Italy large work career gender gaps {{currently}} exists, particularly regarding {{wages and}} activity rates. The paper investigates the issue looking at <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes,</b> where {{from the one}} side all the career gaps tend to accumulate, from the other the redistribution acted by the pension system may mitigate the differences. Exploiting an original database on the entire work careers, we document how the pay gap constantly opens with age and how women tend to cumulate lower seniority. Both gaps have an impact in the pension calculation, so that the day after retirement gender differences are even higher. By means of a microsimulation model we show that the pension system partially countervails labour market outcomes, implying lower differences in <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes.</b> However, due to the current transition to an actuarially neutral system, the effect is going to vanish in following decades, posing some concerns about future prospects of gender income inequality. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{heated debate}} {{about how to}} reform Social Security {{has come to a}} {{standstill}} because the view of most Democrats (that Social Security must be a defined benefits plan similar in spirit to the current system) seems irreconcilable with the proposals supported by many Republicans (to create a defined contribution system of personal accounts holding marketed assets). We describe a system of "progressive personal accounts" that preserves the core goals of both parties, and that is self-balancing on an ongoing basis. Progressive personal accounts have two critical features: (1) accruals into the personal accounts would be exclusively in a new kind of derivative security (which we call a PAAW for Personal Annuitized Average Wage security) that pays its owner one inflation-corrected dollar during every year of life after his statutory retirement date, multiplied by the economy wide average wage at the retirement date and (2) households would buy their new PAAWs each year with their social security contributions, augmented or reduced by a government match that would add to contributions from households with low <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes</b> by taking from households with high <b>lifetime</b> <b>incomes.</b> PAAWS define benefits and achieve risk sharing across generations, as Democrats would like, yet can be held in personal accounts with market valuations, as Republicans propose. ...|$|R
