5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} divisor, it must be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> the greatest common divisor g. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E
5|$|Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, {{and he made}} {{distinct}} {{contributions to}} Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function φ(n), the number of positive integers <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem {{to what is now}} known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas {{paved the way for the}} work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new {{elements}} will continue {{the pattern of the}} current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the elements of atomic number <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 172.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the polynomial time version, in short <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(T) (P) -introreducibility, {{of the notion}} of introreducibility studied in Recursion Theory. We give a simpler proof of the known fact that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(T) (P) -introreducible if and only if it is in P. Our proof generalizes to virtually all the computation bounded reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r), showing that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) -introreducible if and only if it belongs to the minimum <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) -degree. It also holds for most unbounded reducibilities like <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(m), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(c), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(d), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(p), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(tt), etc., but it does not hold for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(T). A very strong way for a set L to fail being <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) -introreducible is that L is not <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) -reducible to any coinfinite subset of L. We call such sets <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) -introimmune. It is known that <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(T) -introimmune sets exist but they are not arithmetical. In this paper we ask for which reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) there exist arithmetical <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(r) -introimmune sets. We show that they exist for the reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(c) and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to(m) (N).
