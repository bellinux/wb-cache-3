5|$|ZnO is a {{promising}} anode material for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> {{because it is}} cheap, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly. ZnO has a higher theoretical capacity (978 mAh g−1) than many other transition metal oxides such as CoO (715 mAh g−1), NiO (718 mAh g−1) and CuO (674 mAh g−1).|$|E

This new hybrid system aims to enrich the hybrid powertrain performance experience. The hybrid battery will be a <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> instead of a nickel-metal-hydride battery which {{was used in the}} LS 600h and LS 600h L.|$|E
50|$|Nanoarchitectures for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are {{attempts}} to employ nanotechnology {{to improve the}} design of <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> Research in <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> focuses on improving energy density, power density, safety, durability and cost.|$|R
50|$|Since 2017, nickel-hydrogen {{batteries}} are {{being replaced by}} <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> On January 6, a multi-hour EVA began the process of converting some of the oldest batteries on the ISS to the new <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> There is a number of {{differences between the two}} battery technologies, and one difference is that the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> can handle twice the power, so only half as many <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are needed during replacement. Also, the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are smaller than the older nickel-hydrogen batteries. Although they are not quite as long lasting as nickel-hydrogen, they can last long enough to extend the life of ISS.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are quickly}} {{becoming}} the dominant {{product in the}} rechargeable battery industry. As global production of these batteries increases, so does {{the rate at which}} the materials used to make them is depleted. Upon reaching end-of-life, most <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> make their way into the municipal waste stream, their components wasted. Others saw this problem and have developed exceptional processes by which <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> can be recycled. Despite these processes being available, the incentive to recycle is not, and the lack of supply to recycling companies renders the processes unprofitable. This project endeavors to provide the framework by which incentives to increase the recycling of <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> can be implemented. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> problems. The <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
50|$|Research in <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> has {{produced}} many proposed refinements of <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> Ideas used {{have focused on}} improving energy density, safety, charge time, cycle durability, flexibility, and cost. As of 2014 few of these innovations had appeared in commercial products.|$|R
40|$|All {{solid state}} <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> have the {{advantages}} of high safety, long cycle life and high energy density, {{as compared with the}} conventional <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries,</b> and have been attracting more and more research interest. Solid electrolyte is a crucial component of all solid state <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries,</b> which largely determine the performance of the batteries. In this work, a polymer-lithium-ceramics complex was designed and synthesized. The structure and dynamics of the polymer-ceramic interface was studied with solid-state NMR techniques...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the fact}} that <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are widely {{distributed}} on the demand side and their characteristics well qualify the requirements of the market participation, <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are chosen as desirable distributed batteries with which to perform the analysis in this study.|$|R
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Full {{production}} of the i-MiEV started in July 2009 and Mitsubishi expected initial sales volume to be small, to sell up to 1,400 vehicles by March 2010, but expected sales to rise to 5,000 vehicles in the following twelve months, once retail sales had started. Mitsubishi decided to target sales to corporate customers in Japan at first to allow local governments and businesses to set up recharging stations around the country. The company said initial sales were constrained by production capacity but expects production to ramp up quickly from 2,000 units in 2009/10 to 30,000 vehicles within three years as it expands {{production of}} <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> through Lithium Energy Japan, {{a joint venture with}} GS Yuasa Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation. Production was projected to increase to 9,000 units in its fiscal year 2010/11, and to 18,000 in the following twelve months.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
40|$|Environmental issues {{triggered}} by emissions from conventional vehicles have accelerated {{the adaptation of}} electric vehicles (EVs) for urban transportation. The most favorable battery technology which can closely fulfill the minimum goals of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) for commercialisation of EVs are the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> Although there are various types of <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have been widely used}} to power the EVs, the performance characteristics of these batteries are not clearly specified in a more comparable way. Therefore, this paper reviews four types of commonly used <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> and based on their specifications analysis to access capabilities and suitability as the energy source in EVs. Results can be used as benchmarks for selecting <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> for battery management system (BMS) design in EVs...|$|R

50|$|Common battery {{types of}} are {{nickel-cadmium}} (NiCd) <b>batteries</b> and <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries,</b> with each holding {{about half the}} market share. NiCd batteries have been around longer, so they are less expensive (their main advantage), but have more disadvantages compared to <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> NiCd disadvantages are limited life, self-discharging, environment problems upon disposal, and eventually internally short circuiting due to dendrite growth. <b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are becoming more common because of their short charging time, longer life, absence of memory effect, and low weight. Instead of charging a tool for {{an hour to get}} 20 minutes of use, 20 minutes of charge can run the tool for an hour. <b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> also hold a charge for a significantly longer time than nickel-cadmium batteries, about two years if not used, vs. 1 to 4 months for a nickel-cadmium battery.|$|R
