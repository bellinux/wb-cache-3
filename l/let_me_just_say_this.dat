I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit.

5000|$|However, on May 8, 2007, {{during an}} {{interview}} by NPR radio host Diane Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of Opus: The Last Christmas by saying, Uh, the better question is, 'Is there an Opus movie going to come out?' {{and the answer is}} 'no.'

Uh, the Weinstein brothers at Miramax tried for five years to develop an Opus movie, their first animated film, and it was, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say,</b> it probably wasn't destined to be, as ... as it probably shouldn't.

They never, never do that. Yeah, um, they just don't trust us. So without that control there probably shouldn't be an Opus movie. In a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was [...] "dead", but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film: There'll only be a movie if I'm writing it, which will probably keep him off the big expensive screen ... probably just as well.|$|R
40|$|Calling on the Government of Germany to take {{immediate}} action to combat sex trafficking {{in connection with}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and for other purposes. One of the tragedies of modern day slavery is that so much of the demand for trafficking comes from countries that espouse commitment to human rights. As the world watches the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a showcase of world-class athleticism and teamwork, Germany, despite its professed commitment to fight the abuse and exploitation of women and girls through trafficking, by certain policies it is facilitating and even encouraging, it aids the very crime it professes to abhor. In December 2001, the German Government legalized prostitution, which is not only inherently harmful and dehumanizing, but also fuels trafficking because it provides a facade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate. The essential legalization of prostitution also places a greater burden on law enforcement as officials try to distinguish ‘‘legal pimps’’ from human traffickers. In Germany, there are about 400, 000 women in prostitution, 75 percent of whom are foreigners. A 2001 report by the Germany Federal Criminal Investigation Office reported that of the 414 women and girls in prostitution that were surveyed, 45 percent were forced into prostitution through violence, torture, rape or intimidation. Further research conducted by Melissa Farley at Prostitution Research and Education found that 71 percent of women surveyed were physically assaulted while engaged in prostitution and a staggering 89 percent wanted to escape prostitution. Rather than preventing the abuse of women, any kind of legalization of prostitution appears to condone an act that almost half of the time will result in the physical abuse of women. Regrettably, according to the 2003 U. N. report, Germany is the top destination country for trafficking in women and children for prostitution, with most victims trafficked from the former Soviet republics and Central and Eastern Europe. The German Government should be outraged by this and immediately take a look at their policies which makes Germany such an inviting country for traffickers. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say,</b> finally, a couple of points. This legislation has 30 cosponsors. It calls on fans, players, and all citizens to boycott the brothels and calls on the Government of Germany to take {{immediate action}} to halt state sponsorship of commercial sexual exploitation that leads to sex trafficking of women {{in connection with the}} World Cup games...|$|R
40|$|I vividly {{recall a}} {{time in my life}} [...] {{especially}} my late teens and early 				twenties [...] when I thought I could be anyone but had no idea which anyone to be. For 				this I blame (or credit) my liberal arts education, which convinced me that there 				was really nothing I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t master but gave me little or no indication of what I 				should do (beyond platitudes like 2 ̆ 2 discover myself 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 do good 2 ̆ 2). So I thrashed 				about, armed with an ounce of knowledge and a ton of arrogance. I was insufferable. 				I won 2 ̆ 7 t go into details, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> my quest to discover who I was ended 				rather badly, albeit not in the long term. Life taught me what my liberal arts 				education couldn 2 ̆ 7 t: that I was who I was and not much more. Having read Rosamund 				Bartlett 2 ̆ 7 s excellent Tolstoy: A Russia Life (Houghton Mifflin, 2011), I 2 ̆ 7 m left 				wondering if Tolstoy ever came to this realization. Throughout his life, he searched 				for his true self. His launching pad was not a liberal arts education, but rather an 				aristocratic background, a flock of tutors, and a remarkable talent. The first 				taught Tolstoy that he could do anything he wanted (which was largely true as it 				concerned the serfs that Tolstoy 2 ̆ 7 s family owned); the second gave him the cultural 				tools he needed to conduct his search; and the third gave him the ability to rise 				above all the other Russian aristocrats who were {{trying to figure out what}} they 				should do and where Russia should go. Tolstoy tried on Russian identities the way 				you try on cloths at a department store. He was, by turns, a student, a slacker, 				an enfant terrible, a rake, a soldier, a pianist, a slave master, a gambler, a 				journalist, a teacher, a bee-keeper, a patriarch, a national poet, a peasant, a 				pundit, and a child-of-nature. At the end of his life he became a holy fool, or 				monk, or cult leader [...] take your pick. Some see this identity as his final 				destination, his moment of Buddha-like enlightenment. I don 2 ̆ 7 t think so. Had he lived 				another five years he would have become someone else. Tolstoy [...] perpetual 				adolescent. Thankfully for us, the common thread in his loosely woven life was 				writing. He was a always a writer, and one with preternatural descriptive and 				dramatic gifts. Rosamund Bartlett is also a writer with considerable gifts, which 				explains why her grasp of Tolstoy is so solid and why her ability to vividly portray 				him so great. If you want to know Tolstoy, read Bartlett...|$|R

40|$|Whenever {{research}} is launched {{under a new}} paradigm for studying an old set of mental phenomena, researchers joining the new armada of explorers hope, at best, to discover new uncharted mental territories and, at worst, to provide new mental maps of previously charted territories that amend errors of the old maps. This has been I believe, the experience of cognitive psychologists studying mental abilities. Although {{they may not have}} revolutionized our map of the mind (yet), neither have they left the old maps standing. What is critical is that at least the flaws and incompleteness’s of the new methods are {{different from those of the}} old. One can therefore be provided with some new insights about the mental phenomena being studied. Consider an analogy to polar and Cartesian coordinates: Each provides a different and useful view of a world that is not quite so simple as either coordinate system would have us believe. Seeing the mental world in two ways can tell us more than seeing it in just one way. In the language of Gamer, Hake, and Eriksen (1956), we have provided 2 ̆ 2 converging operations 2 ̆ 2 to view a unitary phenomenon. I have divided my analysis of the contribution of cognitive psychology to test construction into four main parts dealing, respectively, with the contributions of cognitive psychology to: (1) content for construction of tests; (2) validation of tests; (3) scoring and interpretation of tests; and (4) modification of tests. Before discussing these contributions, however, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>just</b> what are the characteristics that define 2 ̆ 2 cognitive psychology 2 ̆ 2 and what psychologists do in the cognitive- psychological investigation of intelligence. Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind in terms of the mental (cognitive) representations and processes that underlie observable behavior. In particular, I find that cognitive researchers tend to address five main questions: 1. What are the mental processes that constitute intelligent task performance? 2. How rapidly and accurately are these processes performed? 3. Into what strategies for task performance do these mental processes combine? 4. Upon what forms of mental representation do these processes and strategies act? 5. What is the knowledge base that is organized into these forms of representation, and how does it affect and become affected by the processes, strategies, and representations that individuals use? These questions have been asked of performance on a rather wide range of cognitive tasks...|$|R
