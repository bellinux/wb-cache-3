Duplication events that occurred <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> the history of various evolutionary lineages {{can be difficult to}} detect because of subsequent diploidization (such that a polyploid starts to behave cytogenetically as a diploid over time) as mutations and gene translations gradually make one copy of each chromosome unlike the other copy. Over time, it is also common for duplicated copies of genes to accumulate mutations and become inactive pseudogenes.|$|E

One night, when the proprietor of the soy sauce shop went out on a job, he heard some bustling music from {{a place where there}} should have been no people around. When he looked, there were several cats gathered, and there in the center was a strange sight: the shopkeeper's pet cat, wearing a napkin on its head and dancing. That explained why his napkins had been going missing.|$|E
25|$|Tolstoy's actions became {{instrumental}} {{in the life of}} the Seventh. Stalin read Pravda closely and he generally trusted Tolstoy's comments. He remained highly suspicious of spontaneous outpourings of mass enthusiasm both before and after the war, seeing them as veiled instances of oppositionist feelings. However, he also realized squelching such mass expressions in wartime could be unwise, and he had Tolstoy's comments to give them credence in the case of the Seventh Symphony. Tolstoy's interpretation of the Seventh, in fact, lined up with Stalin's stated support of nationalism and patriotism. At least as important was that without the help of the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union would not overcome Nazi Germany. The Soviets had been seen not <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> the Western press as godless villains and barbarians. Now the Americans and British had to believe that the Soviet Union was helping protect the values those countries cherished from fascism for the Soviets to continue receiving those countries' support.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence Brown wrote: [...] "Spielberg's {{decision}} {{to present the}} invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which {{did not exist in}} the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E

An arrest warrant read, [...] "Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama and additionally stated that he would specifically use a sniper rifle and high powered scope, and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama." [...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything like that ...

At the same time they tried to strike up relations with Turkey and sought the assistance from the Turks from Elisavetpol, and Germany – from Tiflis. In August, when the Cossacks and Ossetians captured Vladikavkaz, the Ingush intervened and saved the Soviet Board of Commissioners of Terek, but sacked the city and captured the state bank and mint.

Following the [...] "dissolution" [...] of SSSP, Hayata has settled down and had a family, with a son named Shinjiro Hayata. When Shinjiro was a 5-year-old child, Hayata discovered his son's abnormality when the boy fell from a great height and finally regained his lost memories after Ide showed him the footage of Bemular attacking an airplane. Hayata also inherited the Ultraman Factor (which also passed to Shinjiro) and unknowingly had his entire family protected by his former teammates from being the government's test subjects. Due to this, Hayata enlisted into the reformed SSSP once more and had a hand in developing the Ultraman Suits. Hayata wore the prototype of the Ultraman Suit, called the Proto Suit and first used it to fight Bemular when he threatened Shinjiro's safety. But as the suit was in fact a prototype, Hayata was defeated by Bemular until Shinjiro returned with the finalized Ultraman Suit, using it to fend off against Bemular before he retreated. Hayata would later oversee his son and the entire SSSP's activities after finally passing the [...] "Ultraman" [...] title to Shinjiro but once again returned to action when the Ace Killer Squad strikes.

2500|$|The liberal {{retreat into}} the immanent plenum of sensory {{experience}} (with its related Christology of Christ as purely an outstanding [...] "servant of God"), was as unacceptable as Bultmann's accidental denigration of transcendent Truth into something purely mythical (totally ahistorical). [...] Theologie der Auferstehung was his manifesto on the subject, and he updated it many years later, with {{a chapter on}} eschatology and the aeon of aeons, {{as well as more}} arguments aimed at Bultmann. He also included a new, need discussion on the nature of Time (something Augustine had noted as problematic <b>long</b> <b>ago),</b> <b>in</b> which (predictably) he rejected the dichotomy between eternity and earthly time: [...] "This positing of an exclusive antithesis between time and eternity makes impossible any union of the eternal God with temporal man" [...] (p.182). Theologie der Auferstehung is tightly argued, copiously footnoted, and conceived with vision : {{it is no accident that}} he shares an affinity with Eastern theology on this point (regardless of their emphasis on the Incarnation), noting that the Evangelical Churches in Russia have [...] "a profound grasp of the Easter Act of Jesus Christ" [...] (p.19). Moltmann may have emphasized the cross, and the Catholic Church the Incarnation, but it is true to assert that for Künneth, the Resurrection is the Archimedean point of eschatology, the meaning of time, history, miracles, dogma, and all else beside. Anything else, he believes, undercuts the early Christian emphasis on Jesus as the risen Kyrios (Lord), who is [...] "risen indeed!".
