5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A. Young to assert that inducement to invest is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> size of the market. The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith, who stated that division of labour (as against inducement to invest) is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> extent of the market.|$|E

The Navy ordered several ironclad warships from shipyards in Britain and France, though the program was <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire's restricted finances.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the {{theoretical}} {{range of the}} jet-forming dispension is enclosed at its lower <b>limit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Weber-number and at its upper <b>limit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> critical Reynolds-number. For practical applications, a high kinetic energy in the fluid jet is not desirable, because the jet probably would burst and spatter tiny droplets around the target point.

5000|$|The Bramble Bank, {{otherwise}} {{known simply as}} [...] "The Brambles" [...] is an arrowhead-shaped sandbar in the central Solent which is uncovered at low water spring tides.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of fuel.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2004 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference determined its champion via round-robin play {{during the course}} of the regular season and there was no conference championship game. In 2004, the Atlantic Coast conference added two teams—Virginia Tech and Miami—expanding the league to 11 teams. At the time, {{college football}} teams were <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NCAA to 11regular-season games, three or four of which typically featured teams outside the home team's conference. Following the 2004season, the league added a 12th team—Boston College—and became eligible to hold a championship game at the conclusion of the 2005 season.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E

As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E

A crane's discharge rate is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E

The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E

Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy {{a larger number of}} consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
