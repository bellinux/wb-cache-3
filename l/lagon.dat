2500|$|The title {{character}} is a mysterious warrior {{with the head of}} a leopard. He stumbles upon Rinda and Remus being attacked by soldiers and defeats the entire unit single-handedly. He remembers nothing of his past, knowing only his fighting instincts, what he believes is his name, and a word: Aurra. Guin is often put in position where he will suddenly have a skill he doesn't know he has. He understands the language of the Sem. [...] As of Prisoner of the <b>Lagon,</b> he starts to realize that he really is part of the Destiny reshaping the land. Guin is inhumanly strong and knowledgeable about battle strategies, causing the Mongauli army to fear and respect him as a warrior, as he often will set up battle scenarios and jump into battle himself with inhuman skill.|$|E

50|$|The Yogyakarta and Surakarta {{traditions of}} wayang each {{have their own}} {{repertory}} of sulukan. The standard Yogyakarta listing is contained in Mudjanattistomo's Pedhalangan Ngayogyakarta (1977), and divides the repertory into the following categories: <b>lagon,</b> (equivalent to pathetan in the Surakarta style), kawin, sendhon, suluk, bawaswara and ada-ada. <b>Lagon,</b> kawin and suluk are used to introduce whole scenes, while sendhon and ada-ada are used to introduce particular types of action within a scene, and bawaswara are used as introductions to specific gamelan pieces. The Surakarta tradition is covered by Nojowirongko's Serat tuntunan padalangan (1954), which also forms {{the foundation of the}} account of sulukan in English given by Brandon. In the Surakarta tradition, only pathetan, sendhon and ada-ada are recognised as forms. A further distinction between types is between those accompanied by a small group an instruments including gendér, gambang, rebab and suling (such as <b>lagon</b> and suluk), and those accompanied by gender alone or with the addition of kempuls and gongs (such as kawin, sendhon and ada-ada).|$|E
50|$|All sulukan have a {{specific}} pathet designation relating both to the mode of the gamelan and the act of the wayang performance, many also have a functional specification relating to {{their role in the}} drama, which either specifies the scene in which they are used or their particular occasion. For example: <b>Lagon</b> Sl 9 wêtah tumrap badhe gara-gara - in this title <b>Lagon</b> is the type, Sl 9 specifies the mode as being slendro sanga, wêtah indicates the metre, and tumrap badhe gara-gara indicates its use {{at the opening of the}} gara-gara section which introduces the clowns (punokawan).|$|E
50|$|The US 45th Division's {{objectives}} {{were to be}} the village of <b>Lagon</b> {{and several of the}} peaks that dominated the village and the road to St Elia. Key to these was peak 769, and several days of combat around peak 769 followed, between elements of the 179th US Infantry Regiment and 2 Kompanie 131 Regiment, with the summit changing hands. Finally the Americans secured the summit for good and the 2/131 withdrew from its last positions on the reverse slopes with only 12 men and one officer remaining in the company. On 9 December the US Division attacked the Germans in <b>Lagon,</b> capturing the village two weeks later.|$|E

5000|$|The {{book was}} largely well {{received}} in the popular press, with the New York Review of Books praising it as [...] "compelling" [...] and a [...] "powerful statement in defense of pragmatism". [...] Likewise, Foreign Affairs recommended the book, noting its [...] "vivid detail". [...] The journal Parameters gave a mixed review, praising the detail of the book but lamenting its limited scope. [...] Mark <b>Lagon,</b> in the journal Perspectives on Political Science, savaged the book, calling it gossip-filled and a [...] "slim" [...] contribution to scholarship.

50|$|The {{founders of}} the princely state of Ballabgarh had come from village of Janauli.

Once they joined Finley in high school they met fellow schoolmate Aldon <b>Lagon</b> who was working at a local McDonald's in Atlanta & added him due to his deep bass voice. They then met a gifted high tenor vocalist Marvin Scandrick they sang with in the school chorus. Known as [...] "Forte" [...] at the time, the group performed talent shows and performed at churches and schools around Atlanta. After Wales was able to secure an audition for the group outside of Atlanta's Club 112 in the Buckhead of town the boys sang for Combs & impressed him & after another audition for Combs in front of Bad Boy producer Chucky Thompson, Bad Boy Records artist Faith Evans & Combs protégé Usher & a co-sign from Thompson & Evans, Combs signed the now quartet of Michael Keith, Marvin Scandrick, Daron Jones, & Quinnes Parker to Bad Boy Records.

40|$|Mollusques et faune benthique du <b>lagon</b> de Takapoto. At least 93 {{species of}} Molluscs (58 Gastropods, 34 Bivalves, 1 Cephalopod) exist within the closed lagoon of the Takapoto atoll. The {{distribution}} by biotop and by bathymetric level is studied {{for the most}} abundant species; they are Area ventricosa, Chama imbricata and Tridacna maxima for the endofauna, Rhinoclavis fasciatus, Vexillum cadaverosum, Fragum fragum and Lioconcha philippinarum for the epifauna. The Tridacna (14 million individuals — 530 tons of living matter) and the Area (38, 5 millions — 340 tons) constitute most of the exemples of the malacological fauna, but the Mother-of-pearl, Pinctada margaritifera, intensively exploited in French Polynesia, is also the subject of quantitative estimates and breeding tests. Along with Molluscs, Corals (mainly Porites, Millepora, Montipora), Echinoderms (Halodeima atra) and Crustaceas (Brachiurs) represent {{a significant amount of}} the marine Invertebrates, while the sciaphil fauna (a few species of Sponges) is scarce compared to what is located on the outer slope. In this case we have a fauna typical of a closed atoll, where the uniformity and proliferation of 2 or 3 species in each zoological phylum is opposed to heterogeneousness and wealth of species found in open lagoons like Rangiroa and Mururoa.
