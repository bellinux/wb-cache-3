40|$|Abstract—To {{meet the}} <b>linearity</b> <b>requirements</b> of novel {{wireless}} communication standards using varying-envelope modulations, the class A power amplifier (PA) {{in the traditional}} transmitters must be highly backed off {{to work in the}} linear region where power efficiency drops rapidly. As for the PA linearization technique, linear amplifier with nonlinear components (LINC), achieves linear amplification without power backoff. However, the combiner power efficiency of the LINC system degrades sig-nificantly for signals with a high peak-to-average power ratio. In this paper, we propose a multilevel out-phasing (MOP) scheme to achieve high combiner efficiency by reducing the signal dynamics. Furthermore, based on the MOP, we design two architectures: envelope-adjusting MLINC (EA-MLINC) and gain-adjusting MLINC (GA-MLINC). Under the WCDMA system <b>linearity</b> <b>requirements,</b> the simulations show that 3 -level EA-MLINC and 3 -level GA-MLINC enhance the LINC system power-added efficiency from 16. 5 % to 33. 4 % and 23. 6 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{pattern of the}} out-of-band (oob) radiation from large arrays with nonlinear hardware {{is different from the}} {{radiation pattern}} of the beamformed inband signal. This is the main difference between the oob radiation from large arrays and from well-studied legacy systems. Beamforming might focus the oob radiation in certain directions but also significantly reduce the total power that has to be transmitted. For cost and power-consumption reasons, large arrays might have to be built from low-complexity hardware without advanced precompensation for linearization, which increases the relative amount of oob radiation. Given that large arrays will be used in future base stations, a correct understanding of the oob radiation is crucial to specify appropriate <b>linearity</b> <b>requirements</b> for the hardware. We show that the oob radiation from large arrays varies little between coherence times; it is isotropic in many cases; and, when it is beamformed, it is directed towards the served user in a very narrow beam with an array gain equal to or less than that of the in-band signal.

EESA is implemented for the polarization-amplitude-phase modulation (PAPM) in the channel with polarization mode dispersion (PMD). In this scheme, the PA energy efficiency is optimized by distributing the PA input power on each subcarrier.
