40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{objective}} of this thesis work is to obtain the optimum gas injection rate which yields the maximum oil production. Obtaining the optimum gas injection rate is important because excessive gas injection rate reduces oil production rate and increases operation cost. To obtain the optimum gas injection rate for achieving the maximum oil production, all wells had been modelled by Prosper program and network solver calculation had been performed by Gap program. Flash data of recombined reservoir fluid had been used for PVT matching. All available well test data including current well test data had been considered for quality checking. Since the reservoir parameter is continuously changing from inception of production, current well test data was the focus for using in the well model. It was found that current well test data for all wells had been matched nicely with calculated data in Prosper. Deviation range was below 3 %. For correlation comparison of VLP, Petroleum Expert 2 was found very close to well test data for all well models. Parameter 1 and 2 was close to unity. While matching surface flow line in Gap program, Duckler Flanning was found the best fit correlation for production and test flow line. Calculated manifold pressure was compared with the measured well head pressure and found very close results. Currently oil is producing from eight wells of Varg field on which seven wells are producing with gas lift system. Presently average oil production rate of Varg field is around 2500 Sm 3 /day with gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> rate around 600 x 103 Sm 3 /day. From simulation result of GAP program, maximum oil production rate was achieved 2867. 0 Sm 3 /day at gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> rate of 661. 4 x 103 Sm 3 /day. At 500 x 103 Sm 3 /day gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> rate, Gap calculates 2686 Sm 3 /day oil production rate. It has been observed from the simulation result that well A- 05 A is producing without gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> due to low water cut. Production optimization and lift gas allocation rates achieved by this thesis work shows quite close results with current status of all producing wells. In Varg field, all produced oil is processed by both production and test separators. For finding out the best combination for obtaining the maximum oil production, producing wells had been passed through different combinations of wells and separators. From this work, maximum oil production had been achieved by flowing well A- 05 A and well A- 07 through the test separator and remaining six wells through the production separator...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach for scheduling and forecasting {{oil and gas}} production by integrating models of the entire value chain, from the reservoirs to the sales points. The methodology ensures maximum oil production at each time step of the reservoir simulator while honoring all operational constraints of the system. The proposed method is applied to a small North Sea offshore field consisting of two oil reservoirs with API gravities of 37 and 39. 3 gas-lifted wells are producing in each reservoir. They are arranged in a production network connected to a surface process. Control variables include individual well choke opening (early stage) and gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> rate (later stage). The system is subject to numerous operational constraints (e.g., maximum field liquid production, maximum gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> rate). The proposed solution is built in a commercial IAM platform that connects the models and orchestrates the software execution and optimization. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. The well and flowline performance curves are approximated with piecewise linear functions. Results show that such an integrated approach can significantly affect the production profile (up to 15 % difference against traditional “silo” approach). The proposed integrated solution is two-to-three times faster than traditional non-linear optimization methods, guarantees convergence towards the global maximum and it represents with an appropriate level of accuracy the original black-box model. This allows to run a lot of different scenarios making it a suitable tool for field development and planning optimization. The proposed method is used to optimize the field design and schedule. Optimal surface capacities are determined by brute force exploration of net present value function.|$|E

The appeal of this solution has been growing thanks to the parallel advancement in the technology of the injection hardware and in the knowledge of the physics involved in the spray formation and combustion. In the present thesis, the effect of partial needle <b>lift</b> and <b>injection</b> rate shaping has been investigated experimentally using a multi-orifice Diesel injector. Injection rate shaping is one of the most attractive alternatives to multiple injection strategies but its implementation has been for long time impeded by technological limitations. A novel direct-acting injector prototype made it possible to carry out the present research: this injector features a mechanical coupling between the nozzle needle and the piezo-stack actuator, allowing a fully flexible control on the nozzle needle movement and enabling partial needle lift as well as the implementation of alternative injection rate shapes typologies. Different optical diagnostics were applied to study the spray development and combustion in a novel continuous flow test chamber that allows an accurate control on a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (up to 1000 K and 15 MPa). In addition, hydraulic characterization tests were carried out to analyze the fuel flow through the injector nozzle. Partial needle lift has been found to affect the injection event, reducing the mass flow rate (as expected) but also causing a reduction in the effective orifice area and an increase on the spreading angle. Moreover, at this condition, higher hole-to-hole dispersion and flow instabilities were detected. Needle vibrations caused by the needle interactions with fuel flow and by the onset of cavitation in the needle seat are likely the causes of this behavior. Injection rate shaping has a substantial impact on the premixed phase of the combustion and on the location where the ignition takes place. Furthermore, the results proved that the modifications in the internal flow caused by the partial needle lift are reflected on the ignition timing. On the other hand, the analysis of the experimental data through a 1 D spray model revealed that an increasing mass flow rate (e. g. ramp or boot injection rate profiles) causes an increase in the fuelair equivalence ratio at the lift-off length and a consequent higher soot formation during the diffusive phase of the combustion. Finally, the wide range of boundary conditions tested in all the experiments served to draw general conclusions about the physics involved in the injection/combustion event and, in some cases, to obtain statistical correlations.

The challenges of huge investment, high cost, and high risk promote research into production optimization for EOR methods. As early as in 1972, Gottfried (1972) proposed a nonlinear programming model for a cyclic steam injection process. He maximized the net present value by optimizing steam injection volume and cycle length. Ramirez et al. (1984) and Fathi and Ramirez (1984) tried to maximize oil production at the minimum injection costs based on the calculus of variations and Pontryagin’s weak minimum principle. They optimized development strategies for waterflooding, carbon dioxide (CO 2) flooding, and surfactant flooding. Amit (1986) formulated a two-phase dynamic optimization model which incorporated the relationships between extraction rates, investment decisions, and cumulative oil recovery. Wackowski et al. (1992) applied rigorous decision analysis methodology to find the optimal development strategy for a 20  years CO 2 flooding project. The control variables included CO 2 recycle capacity, CO 2 purchase contract, processing rate, water-to-gas ratio, and slug size. Wu (1996) found that chemical flooding performance was sensitive to operational parameters such as chemical slug size, concentration and adsorption, price of oil and chemicals, annual discount rate, and reservoir permeability. Results showed that the optimal design was a large slug injection of low concentration surfactant and polymer, followed by a small slug of subsequent polymer injection.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{undertaken to}} establish {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of using high pressure common rail fuel injection systems with multiple injection capabilities. The areas covered are detailed as follows. Oscillations in the rail pressure due to the opening of the injector can affect the quantity of fuel injected in subsequent injection events. The source of these oscillations has been investigated. A method of damping or reducing the oscillations has been defined and was applied. This successfully reduced the level of unpredictability of the quantity of injected fuel in subsequent injection events. A relationship between needle <b>lift,</b> <b>injection</b> pressure and the quantity of fuel injected was established. The effects of fuel injection parameters (main injection timing, split main separation and ratio) and engine operating parameters (boost pressure and EGR level) on emissions formations and fuel economy have been investigated at five operating points. Design of Experiments techniques were applied to investigate the effect of variables on pollutant emissions and fuel consumption. The sensitivity and linearity of responses to parameter changes have been analysed to assess the extent to which linear extrapolations will describe changes in smoke number (FSN) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx); and which parameters are the least constricting when it comes to adjustments of parameter settings on the FSN-NOx map. Comparing results for split main and single injection strategies at the five operating conditions shows that split main injection can be exploited to reduce NOx or FSN values at all conditions and both NOx and FSN simultaneously at high load conditions. The influence of changing engine speed and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) on FSN and NOx emissions with given fixed values of parameter settings has been investigated. This established how much of the operating map could be covered by discrete calibration settings. Finally the variation in parameter settings required to maintain fixed FSN and NOx values across the operating map, near the optimum trade-off on the FSN-NOx map, was analysed. Combining the information gained from the individual investigations carried out highlighted some techniques that can be used to simplify the calibration task across the operating map, while also reducing the amount of experimental testing required.

40|$|For heavy oil, {{artificial}} lift {{can be applied}} to increase and stabilise production flow. How the gas kinetics, i. e. the lift-gas composition will influence this increase {{is the subject of this}} thesis and will be described in relation to multiphase flow, pressure drop and pressure-temperature-volume (PVT) -theory. A vertical pipe flow was studied, simulating the pressure drop coupled with the accompanying multiphase flow and PVT-information. The simulations were run in MATLAB, supported by NeqSim, a non-equilibrium simulation tool. NeqSim was used to acquire the local fluid parameters in order to calculate the local pressure drop. To study the gas lift efficiency, four different simulation variations were performed. Different lift-gas compositions were applied to the reservoir to observe the response. The bubblepoint pressure was altered by adjusting the composition, the bottomhole flowing pressure (BHFP) was lowered by adjusting the reservoir pressure, and a pressure delay was applied to simulate solution above the bubblepoint pressure and a dissolution process below the bubblepoint pressure. Two different pressure delays were implemented; one with equal delay, another with different delays. These simulations were run on a well system with a heavy oil composition and a set geometry. The boundary conditions were the inlet and outlet pressures, set by the reservoir pressure, 120 bar, and the separator pressure, 15 bar. This locks the BHFP at 105 bar, but it was also adjusted for one of the simulation variations. The varying parameter was the gas injection rate, which is set by a for-loop in the code and input flow rate found by using the bisection method for each simulation. From running the simulations and analysing the results it has been found that gas lift has a generally positive effect on the deliverability and stability of an oil field, though with an exceeding amount of gas <b>lift</b> <b>injection</b> the friction pressure drop will have a negative effect on production. A denser gas seems to give an increased gas lift efficiency due to the higher solubility rate. This makes optimising the injection rate imperative in order to have the highest possible production efficiency. There is a higher efficiency for an undersaturated reservoir, though requiring an increased gas injection rate. As for the composition of the lift-gas, it will have an impact on efficiency and should be taken into account. An increased solution effect implemented by a pressure delay will have positive effect on the lift efficiency. A denser gas will dissolve at a higher rate into the liquid, decreasing the density of the wellbore column for higher gas injection rates than for the lighter gas. The delays occurring in a mass transfer situation between the phases will also influence the production, more so if the solution rate is higher than the dissolution rate, this should be studied further...|$|E

This paper reports on the modeling of the high-pressure part of a research type Heavy Duty Common Rail (CR) {{fuel injection}} system. More specifically, it reports on the observed dynamics of the injection system and the capability of the model to capture this. For that reason, the total high-pressure part of the injection system, i. e. the fuel pump, rail and injector, has been modeled using the AMESim code (Imagine S. A., 2004). The reliability of the resulting hydraulic model is tested through a comparison between numerical results and actual injection measurements.

For accurate numerical results, it is vital that the stiffness of the injector needle assembly and the discharge coefficients of the different flow restrictions in the injector (e. g. nozzle holes) are correctly modeled. Assuming a rigid injector needle results in a too early start of injection. Discharge coefficient values found in literature shows a wide spread. This makes it very difficult to simulate the injected mass flow rate accurately on the basis of literature data.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{introduction}} by the Norwegian government of the CO 2 tax for hydrocarbon fuels, a challenging process started aiming at improving the performance of off-shore power systems. An oil and gas platform typically operates in island (stand-alone system) and the power demand is covered by two or more gas turbines. In order to improve the plant performance a bottoming cycle unit can be added to the gas turbine topping module, thus constituting a combined cycle plant. This paper aims at developing and testing numerical models simulating the part-load and dynamic behavior of a novel power system composed by two gas turbines and a combined gas turbine and air bottoming cycle plant. The case of study is the Draugen off-shore oil and gas platform, located in the North Sea, Norway. The normal electricity demand is 19 MW and it is currently covered with two gas turbines generating each 50 % of the power demand while the third turbine is on stand-by. During seawater <b>lifting,</b> water <b>injection</b> and oil export the demand increases up to 25 MW. The model of the new power plant proposed in this work is developed in Modelica language using basic components acquired from ThermoPower, a library utilized for power plants modelling. The dynamic model of the gas turbine and the air bottoming cycle turbogenerator includes dynamic equations for the combustion chamber, the shell-and-tube recuperator and the turbine shafts. Turbines are modelled by the Stodola equation and by a correlation between the isentropic efficiency and the non-dimensional flow coefficient. Compressors are modelled using quasi steady-state conditions by scaling the maps of axial compressors employing a similar design point. The recuperator recovering the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is modelled using correlations relating the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop at part-load with the mass flow rate. Thermodynamic variables and dynamic metrics such as rise time and frequency undershooting/overshooting are predicted. Considering a load ramp of 0. 5 MW/s an undershooting of 4. 9 % and an overshooting of 3. 0 % are estimated. The rise time is approximately 30 s. Moreover, findings suggest that decreasing the core weight of the recuperator consents to limit the frequency fluctuations, thus minimizing the risk of failure of the power system...|$|R

40|$|This study proposes the {{development}} of a new integrated reservoir-network compositional simulator with asphaltene modeling in production pipelines. Reservoir and network simulators are developed with a fully-implicit formulation, allowing stand-alone runs to analyze specific areas of interest for reservoir and production engineers. The same simulation platform allows to perform tightly-coupled runs to assess mutual interaction between subsurface and surface components. Fluid phase behavior is modeled through phase equilibria calculations, using Peng-Robinson equation of state with volume translation. Rigorous vapor/liquid/liquid-dense equilibria calculations are performed to model asphaltene precipitation in network pipelines using a thermodynamically consistent sequential approach. Asphaltene deposition in the internal pipe walls is estimated through a mechanistic solid transport model. Compositional delumping is performed from reservoir to network fluid descriptions to improve fluid characterization for asphaltene modeling in pipelines. The proposed combination of tight coupling with fully-implicit formulation for oil, gas, water flow in reservoir and network, and sequential approach for solid precipitation and deposition in the pipeline system, provides a robust and flexible methodology for additional applications of solid deposition, e. g. hydrates and waxes. This approach also enables evaluation of inhibitor injection and artificial gas lift installation on asphaltene deposition and production performance. Integrated reservoir-network modeling provides more representative reservoir performance forecasts than conventional stand-alone methods, as it allows to simulate complex interactions between reservoir and surface facilities. Solids precipitation and deposition in networks have a negative impact on production rates, pressure management, and field operations. Flow assurance techniques based on adequate estimates of potentially blocking phases (hydrates, waxes, asphaltenes) are crucial to achieve good production performance.

Several parameters can be considered in production optimization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, including drilling schedule, number of producer and injector wells, pattern of well placement, production rate and surface facilities (Guyaguler and Gumrah 1999). Usually, these parameters are optimized using simple reservoir models as well as mathematical or programming techniques involving economic strategies. Take the work done by Lee and Aronofsky in 1958 as one of the early studies in this field. They maximized crude oil production from homogeneous and simple reservoir models using a developed linear programming for the optimization problem (Lee and Aronofsky 1958). Bohannon in 1970 optimized efficiency of a designed system having several oil reservoirs producing in one or more gathering systems named as “multi-reservoir pipeline system”. He presented a linear programming model to define the optimum 15 -years development plan for this designed system (Bohannon 1970). Also, the optimal type, location and trajectory of an unconventional well for the different reservoir types and fluid systems were determined by Yeten et al. in 2002. They applied an optimization procedure including genetic algorithm for their goal (Yeten et al. 2002). Furthermore, Onwunalu and Durlofsky in 2011 developed a new well pattern optimization procedure for large-scale field development by utilizing particle swarm optimization technique (Onwunalu and Durlofsky 2011). In 2016, Nozohour-leilabady and Fazelabdolabadi maximized the Net Present Value for designed scenarios with multiple injector and producer wells and cases with deviated wells in a real reservoir model. Artificial bee colony optimization technique was used in their study (Nozohour-leilabady and Fazelabdolabadi 2016). Recently, a comprehensive production optimization study for an oil field located in the Middle East was done by Izadmehr et al. In their study, different factors influencing oil production such as artificial <b>lift</b> model, water <b>injection</b> flow rate, drilling new producer and injector wells and gas injection were examined in different scenarios through reservoir simulation to choose the optimized plan (Izadmehr et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{consequences of}} P 2 X receptor activation on peripheral sensory neurones {{have been investigated}} in vivo. Behavioural indices of acute nociception were monitored in the conscious rat following subplantar injection of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), α,β-methylene ATP, adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine. Signs of overt nociception, i. e. hindpaw lifting and licking, were apparent in animals injected subplantar with the P 2 X receptor agonist, α,β-methylene ATP. Nociceptive behaviours continued for 15 [*]min following administration of α,β-methylene ATP (200 [*]nmol) and were dose-related (0 – 5 [*]min hindpaw <b>lifting</b> times after <b>injection</b> of α,β-methylene ATP 100 [*]nmol and 1000 [*]nmol were 89 ± 26 [*]s and 232 ± 11 [*]s, respectively). Subplantar ATP evoked a modest response only at the highest dose tested (1000 [*]nmol; 0 – 5 [*]min hindpaw lifting time 66 ± 19 [*]s) whilst ADP or adenosine (both 600 [*]nmol) elicited negligible spontaneous nociceptive activity. Morphine (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) abolished hindpaw licking behaviour induced by subplantar injection of either α,β-methylene ATP (600 [*]nmol) or bradykinin (1 [*]nmol) and substantially reduced (88 ± 5 %) paw licking in formalin (0. 5 %, 0. 1 [*]ml) injected animals. In contrast, hindpaw lifting was only modestly inhibited (34 ± 11 %) in morphine-pretreated animals that had received subplantar bradykinin and was unaffected in rats in which the noxious stimulus was either subplantar α,β-methylene ATP or formalin. Pretreatment of hindpaws with subplantar bupivacaine (1 % w/v, 0. 1 [*]ml) abolished α,β-methylene ATP-evoked nociceptive behaviours. Hindpaw lifting and licking mediated by α,β-methylene ATP (600 [*]nmol, subplantar) were inhibited (72 ± 15 % and 95 ± 5 %, respectively) by 30 [*]min local pretreatment with 600 [*]nmol α,β-methylene ATP. Subplantar α,β-methylene ATP pretreatment did not inhibit behaviour stimulated by subsequent bradykinin (1 [*]nmol) or formalin (0. 5 %, 0. 1 [*]ml) injection into the hindpaw. Desensitization of small diameter sensory neurones with a single subplantar injection of capsaicin (100 [*]μg) abolished all behaviours indicative of spontaneous nociceptive sensation in animals subsequently injected with α,β-methylene ATP (600 [*]nmol), bradykinin (1 [*]nmol) or formalin (0. 5 %, 0. 1 [*]ml). We conclude that activation of P 2 X receptors present on small diameter (capsaicin-sensitive) primary afferent neurones in the rat hindpaw mediates behaviour indicative of acute nociception...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigated a novel combustion {{system for}} {{gasoline direct injection}} spark ignition (DISI) engines. This combustion system burned an unthrottled, stoichiometric, homogenous charge at part load, {{in comparison to the}} unthrottled,lean, stratified charge burned by conventional DISI engines. Unthrottled homogeneous operation, enabled by the use of variable valve timing. allowed high fuel efficiencies to be achieved while addressing the particulate emissions, poor combustion stabilities and NOx after-treatment issues associated with stratified charge DISI engines, when compared to the port fuel injection (PFI) engines they are replacing. Experiments were performed to quantifY the bulk in-cylinder air motions, determine their effect on the fuel spray, and examine the resulting air-fuel mixture preparation of various early inlet valve closing (EIVC) and late inlet valve opening (LIVO) strategies that were suitable for controlling engine load under homogeneous engine conditions. A broad matrix of engine conditions has been investigated, with engine speeds ranging from idle (750 rpm) to 5000 rpm, and engine loads ranging from 2. 7 bar indicated mean effective pressure (!MEP) to wide open throttle (WOT). Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to record mean in-cylinder flow fields in the tumble and swirl planes for a range of engine conditions and valve profiles. This included measurements at higher engine speeds (3500 rpm) than previously published. Air flows in the difficult-to-access cylinder head were measured with Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and the effect of these air flows on the fuel spray produced by a latest generation multi-stream fuel injector was investigated with Mie imaging. The resulting mixture preparation was then investigated over a crank angle period ranging from the start ofinjection (SOl) to the time of spark with Laser Induced Exciplex Fluorescence (LIE F). Supporting data from a thermodynamic sister engine with identical combustion chamber geometry was recorded at University College London. Unthrottled, homogeneous operation with low lift EIVC valve profiles improved engine fuel consumption by up to 20 % compared to throttled operation with conventional, full-lift profiles. This was a consequence of a reduction in the throttling losses and improvements in air-fuel mixing. The intake air momentum was more significant than the fuel spray momentum from the injection system in determining the air-fuel mixing process. This resulted in engine performance being strongly affected by engine speed, intake valve <b>lift</b> and <b>injection</b> timing. The greatest benefits in ISFC occurred when only one of the two inlet valves was operated. This was attributed to an overall increase in the level ofin-cylinder swirl. However, the choice of which inlet valve was opened was critical, with greater gains occurring if the fuel spray from the centrally mounted injector was directed towards the spark plug than when the spray was directed away from the plug. EIVC combustion also exhibited significantly longer burn times than throttled operation. This was due to lower cylinder pressures that reduced the laminar flame speed and lower levels of turbulence around the spark plug at the time of ignition. Flame front measurements on the optical engine showed that during the longer early heat release phase (0 - 10 % mass fraction burned), the flame kernel was transported away from the spark plug and towards the combustion chamber wall beneath the inlet valves. Investigations into the fuel mixture preparation using Laser Induced Exciplex Fluorescence (LIE F) demonstrated that, under high load conditions, a source of particulate emissions from PFI engines was large droplets {{in the vicinity of the}} spark plug around the time of ignition. These fuel rich regions were precursors in the generation of soot and were all but eliminated with direct injection fuelling strategies. Late Intake Valve Opening (LIVO) valve strategies generated a sub-atmospheric cylinder pressure of between 0. 5 to 0. 3 bar (absolute). Spray images obtained under these conditions showed greater penetration of the fuel spray and a poorly defined spray cone boundary. Due to the increased momentum and increased shear forces of the inducted air, and the cylinder pressure falling below the saturation vapour pressure of some components of the gasoline fuel at the temperature of the mixture, flash evaporation of those components was seen to occur. The improvement in atomisation and faster burn rate with LIVO compensated to some extent for the increase in irrecoverable pumping work of this operating strategy over conventional EIVC. However, a practical disadvantage of LIVO was poor control of the trapped air mass, arising from the intake air momentum supercharging the engine cylinder at the conditions tested.

40|$|The Wintershall’s Maria subsea project {{consists}} of three main pipelines to be installed. The scope of this thesis is to identify and evaluate different approaches to subsea commissioning of Maria’s three pipeline systems and select a commissioning mythology for each pipeline system and identify points for optimization. The pipeline commissioning in this thesis {{is defined as the}} dynamic part of making a system ready for operation. The three pipeline systems are a gas <b>lift,</b> a water <b>injection,</b> and a production pipeline system. Gas is intended for a well-lifting purpose, injected into the well stream downhole to decrease the density of produced oil. Water is injected to maintain reservoir pressure, increase production rate and extend field operating life. The production pipeline transports hydrocarbons to the Kristin production unit for processing. The pipeline systems are presented in this order with suggested commissioning procedures. To evaluate the different commissioning procedures, chemicals used and necessary equipment is also identified. An evaluation sheet has been designed for visualization and summation of evaluated points. This was used both to evaluate commissioning procedure and to identify points of optimization. Gas lift pipeline system The main objective to the gas lift system review was to find a suitable de-watering procedure. De-watering should be as cost effective as possible while achieving the specified dryness inside the pipeline. Three options of drying technique were identified, discussed, and evaluated. It was found necessary to divide the de-watering procedure into two steps for optimization. The two steps of the de-watering procedure are pig-sweep train combined with following nitrogen drying. A calculation has been performed to optimize the volumes used in the pig-sweep train. The selected procedure will optimize the drying efficiency and maintain integrity. Water injection pipeline system The main objective related to the water injection system was to identify and evaluate a procedure to remove air trapped in the pipeline. The main criteria are time efficiency and a good result. Two options were identified, displacement by foam pigs, and direct flushing. Both procedures were found viable, but the selected method for optimization is direct flushing. The necessary flow velocity for flushing has been calculated, and pump capacity is evaluated. The calculation found that the velocity of flushing should be at least 1. 2 m/s to provide a plug flow that will flush trapped air out of the pipeline. The flow calculation shows that one of the two pumps intended for use is sufficient to achieve the plug flow criteria. For optimization, both pumps should be run together for a more effective flushing effect. Production system The main objective to the production pipeline commissioning was to identify a commissioning procedure efficient on time and still preserve the integrity of the system. The main criterion is to perform a safe start-up and cause as little influence on the Kristin process system as possible. Four methods of commissioning were identified as viable. The preferred option of commissioning is to use a 250 m³ slug of diesel between displacement pigs to displace the production line and drive out residues of water. The diesel slug and pig train are suggested to be displaced by the first production of hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} oil well {{engineering}} applications {{has revealed that}} the frequent operational problems are still common in oil well practice. Well blowouts, stuck pipes, well leakages are examples of the repeated problems in the oil well engineering industry. The main reason why these unwanted problems are unavoidable can be the complexity and uncertainties of the oil well processes. Unforeseen problems happen again and again, {{because they are not}} fully predictable, which could be due to lack of sufficient data or improper modelling to simulate the real conditions in the process. Traditional mathematical models {{have not been able to}} totally eliminate unwanted oil well problems because of the many involved simplifications, uncertainties, and incomplete information. This research work proposes a new approach and breakthrough for overcoming these challenges. The main objective of this study is merging two scientific fields; artificial intelligence and petroleum engineering in order to implement a new methodology. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Model-Based Reasoning (MBR), two branches of the artificial intelligence science, are applied for solving complex oil well problems. There are many CBR and MBR modelling tools which are generally used for different applications for implementing and demonstrating CBR and MBR methodologies; however, in this study, the Creek system which combines CBR and MBR has been utilized as a framework. One specific challenging task related to oil well engineering has been selected to exemplify and examine the methodology. To select a correct candidate for this application was a challenging step by itself. After testing many different issues in the oil well engineering, a well integrity issue has been chosen for the context. Thus, 18 leaking wells, production and injection wells, from three different oil fields have been analysed in depth. Then, they have been encoded and stored as cases in an ontology model given the name Wellogy. The challenges related to well integrity issues are a growing concern. Many oil wells have been reported with annulus gas leaks (called internal leaks) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) area. Interventions to repair the leaking wells or closing and abandoning wells have led to: high operating cost, low overall oil recovery, and in some cases unsafe operation. The reasons why leakages occur can be different, and finding the causes is a very complex task. For gas <b>lift</b> and gas <b>injection</b> wells the integrity of the well is often compromised. As the pressure of the hydrocarbon reserves decreases, particularly in mature fields, the need for boosting increases. Gas is injected into the well either to lift the oil in the production well or to maintain pressure in the reservoir from the injection well. The challenge is that this gas can lead to breakdown of the well integrity and cause leakages. However, as there are many types of leakages that can occur and due to their complexity it can be hard to find the cause or causal relationships. For this purpose, a new methodology, the Creek tool, which combines CBR and MBR is applied to investigate the reasons for the leakages. Creek is basically a CBR system, but it also includes MBR methods. In addition to the well integrity cases, two complex cases (knowledge-rich cases) within oil well engineering have also been studied and analysed through the research work which is part of the PhD. The goal here is to show how the knowledge stored in two cases can be extracted for the CBR application. A model comprising general knowledge (well-known rules and theories) and specific knowledge (stored in cases) has been developed. The results of the Wellogy model show that the CBR methodology can automate reasoning in addition to human reasoning through solving complex and repeated oil well problems. Moreover, the methodology showed that the valuable knowledge gained through the solved cases can be sustained and whenever it is needed, it can be retrieved and reused. The model has been verified for unsolved cases by evaluating case-matching results. The model gives elaborated explanations of the unsolved cases through the building of causal relationships. The model also facilitates knowledge acquisition and learning curves through its growing case base. The study showed that building a CBR model is a rather time-consuming process due to four reasons: 1. Finding appropriate cases for the CBR application is not straightforward 2. Challenges related to constructing cases when transforming reported information to symbolic entities 3. Lack of defined criteria for amount of information (number of findings) for cases 4. Incomplete data and information to fully describe problems of the cases at the knowledge level In this study only 12 solved cases (knowledge-rich cases) have been built in the Wellogy model. More cases (typically hundreds for knowledge-lean cases and around 50 for knowledge-rich cases) would be required to have a robust and efficient CBR model. As the CBR methodology is a new approach for solving complex oil well problems (research and development phase), additional research work is necessary for both areas, i. e. developing CBR frameworks (user interfaces) and building CBR models (core of CBR). Feasibility studies should be performed for implemented CBR models in order to use them in real oil field operations. So far, the existing Wellogy model has showed some benefits in terms of; representing the knowledge of leaking well cases in the form of an ontology, retrieving solved cases, and reusing pervious cases.
