Chapter 3. 1 : S&T and the Cotonou Agreement Under the Cotonou Agreement, ACP states can receive {{support for the}} {{development}} of S&T policies and programmes. From a review of the Country Strategy Papers (CSP), however, it appears that few ACP countries have used this opportunity or, indeed, even refer to S&T. The CSPs of only five countries mention S&T in relation to agriculture, and in each of these cases it plays a minor role: Belize: introduction of technology in general; Ghana: capacity building for organizations involved in post-harvest research; Guinea: technical education in agriculture; Madagascar: improve the criteria for assessing technical viability in hydro agriculture; Vanuatu: ongoing research and development programmes The priority given to S&T in the 52 countries is strikingly low, particularly in view of the importance attached to it in the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Declaration,</b> issued by the Heads of State and Government of the ACP States in 1997 which called for ‘a new ACP-EU cooperation arrangement to respond to and cater for the changing and diverse development requirements of ACP States [that] places greater emphasis on … enhanced access to science and technology, especially on information technology and the financing of research … [and] reinforces human capacity in the agriculture sector; this {{plays a key role in}} the reduction of poverty and promotion of socio-economic development, especially in the least-developed countries. In this context, it is necessary to strengthen and reinforce the role of the CTA in ACP institutional capacity development, particularly information management in order to improve access to technologies for increasing agricultural productivity, commercialisation, food security and rural development …’ Various ACP–EU policy dialogues on S&T have been organized, as reported at the conference ‘Demanding Innovation’, held in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in October 2001. Yet, even countries involved in such dialogues, like Ghana, Senegal and Uganda, have not prioritized S&T. This is indicative of a serious discontinuity of effort. The overall conclusion is that science and technology play a subordinate role in ACP–EU cooperation, despite initial lip service to its importance. The subjects addressed in the various documents were categorized as follows: 18 : [...] S&T general 18 : [...] S&T agriculture 11 : [...] Science 2 : [...] Biotechnology 2 : [...] Others Note that some documents fall into more than one category, e. g. biotechnology and agriculture. Most of the 18 documents referring to S&T in agriculture concern National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS). For the full text of the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Declaration,</b> see Louk Box et. al.

40|$|Ms Tsakani Ngomane is Director for Regional Services in the Department of Agriculture, Land and Environment of the Northern Province of South Africa. She sees {{a central}} role for {{agricultural}} home economists {{in the struggle for}} gender equity in her nation's agriculture. Currently vice-chair of CTA's Advisory Committee, she is a clear voice in the 'post-Lomé' debate about relationships between the 71 ACP States and the European Union after the existing Lomé Convention expires early in 2000. As we try to define future co-operation and partnership options for EU and ACP States, we must emphasise the important role that women can play in agriculture. Basically survivors, women are central to the agenda as the primary processors and labourers in a sector still dominated by men. We have to make gender mainstream, and establish gender-sensitive management {{as an integral part of}} agricultural development initiatives. The EU's 'Green Paper' of September 1997 gave several opportunities for change, referring to new instruments and partnerships, and to more active participation by non-governmental players. It embraced several complementary objectives, including combating poverty, promoting sustainable development and the progressive integration of ACP agriculture into the world economy. Whilst urging economic growth through competition and private sector development through regional integration and trade development, the Paper tried to merge economic, environmental and societal interests, while respecting various stages of development of the ACP States ? that is, it sought to differentiate. The response of the ACP Group, in the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Declaration</b> of November 1997, called for greater unity and solidarity, and a focus on three priority areas: growth, competitiveness and employment; social and cultural policies; and regional integration. The guiding principles were institutional support and capacity building; a gender sensitive approach; and sustainable environmental management. This strategic position was reaffirmed in May 1998 by the ACP Committee of Ambassadors, and the ACP NGO Forum. Both emphasised the eradication of poverty, the promotion of gender equity in project cycles, and of women as participants and beneficiaries. One fundamental area where differentiation is not ? or should cease to be ? an issue is women in development. Targets have been set to ensure that gender issues are fully mainstreamed by 2000, but they will not be reached unless deliberate steps are taken to implement the guiding principles of co-operation. Correcting the obvious: targetting women I believe that correcting the obvious gender imbalance is the major entry point for developing social and economic empowerment programmes. Women, especially resource-poor rural women, are important stakeholders. In the agricultural sector alone, their productive roles surpass by far their reproductive role. As invisible actors in development, their contribution to socio-economic development and poverty alleviation is poorly understood and most often deliberately under-estimated. Globally, women produce more than half the food that is grown. In sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, they produce up to 80 % of basic foodstuffs but receive less than 5 % of extension resources. The importance of targeting the real clients in agricultural development whether on primary production, resource conservation, training, technology development, land matters, and access to credit cannot be overemphasized. It's not a power struggle Development institutions need to move away from regarding gender issues as a power struggle between men and women, because that is not the case. The question to ask is who is the primary client, the end-user of services provided? Responding to this question will shape our staffing policies, capacity building programmes, allocation of agricultural resources (land, farm inputs), development of appropriate technologies and extension service delivery strategies. The Post-Lomé debate provides clear guidance and direction for gender mainstreaming. I recognise gender issues as a cross ? cutting phenomenon which should be approached holistically within the larger context of agricultural development in general. However, leading institutions in the sector need to take deliberate steps to involve women at all levels if the target of 2000 is to mean anything real. Let us see more capable women at the policy-making level, more women extension officers and home economists in research stations, training institutions, on the farms in the villages, at the processing plant, the boardroom, yes, at all levels of the agricultural chain. Women: help the men! To the women out there 1, I urge you to reinforce our organisational efforts and assist our male partners in development to implement gender-sensitive management programmes. The agreements between the EU and ACP countries prove their commitment to ensure visibility of the role of women and of the potential to turn the poverty situation of ACP countries around. CTA's mandates in information management are aimed at improving access to technologies for increasing agricultural productivity, commercialisation, food security and rural development, as the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Declaration</b> stated. Central to these mandates is the empowerment of women in agriculture and rural development. We recently decided to strengthen CTA's work in the analysis of specific needs for supporting rural women's organisations, in the emphasis of extension services and in prioritising cooperation with institutions that have specific programmes on the role of women and poverty alleviation in agricultural and rural development. I hope this work addresses the issue of targeting the right client and will serve as an example for ACP national institutions to follow. 1 A recent readership survey showed that more than 90 % of Spore readers are male.

40|$|The Cotonou Agreement and Support for S&T Under the Cotonou Agreement, ACP {{countries}} can receive {{support for the}} implementation of their agricultural S&T policies. For that, an ACP government has to include S&T as a policy priority in its Country Strategy Paper, the policy framework for obtaining financial support from the EU. From a review of 52 Country Strategy Papers (2002 – 2007), S&T features strikingly low on the list of development policy priorities of ACP states. Considering the importance attached to S &T in the <b>Libreville</b> <b>Declaration,</b> issued by the Heads of State and Government of the ACP Group of States in 1997, one would have expected differently. Only a handful of countries actually refer to S&T, and of these, only five mention S&T in relation to agriculture. In all cases, the programmes to be supported play a minor role in the countries’ development efforts e. g. ‘capacity building for organizations involved in post-harvest research’ (Ghana), ‘technical education in agriculture’ (Guinea) and for ‘ongoing research and development programmes’ (Vanuatu). This subordinate role of S&T in programmes designed for obtaining support under the ACP–EU development cooperation agenda contrasts sharply with the EC’s high-profile S&T policy initiatives. For instance, in 2001, the Commission recognized the importance of Agricultural Research for Development (ARD) and developed a strategy to promote the European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD), the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), as well as regional research networks such as CORAF, ASARECA, SACCAR, CIRDES, and ICIMOD. In 2002, the Commission published a strategy document, ‘Support to ARD at sub-regional level’, which focused on support to National Agricultural Research Systems. Organizations identified to participate in and benefit from this initiative were regional networks e. g. the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and global networks e. g. the Global Forum for Agricultural Research (GFAR). Another EC initiative is the ‘Competitive Grant Scheme for Agricultural Research for Development in Sub-Saharan Africa’, which identified major challenges for the Framework Programme (2002 – 2006) to establish an integrated European Research Area. The activity with the highest political profile was an ACP–EU Ministerial Forum on Research for Sustainable Development, held in Cape Town in July 2002, at the initiative of European Commission Research Directorate General (DG) in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development. The Forum considered agriculture as part of general environmental issues. The Forum’s conclusions and recommendations were summarized in the Cape Town Declaration on Research for Sustainable Development and in a Plan of Action, defining strategic areas in agriculture and agro-industry. This Plan may therefore be considered as a first step in the generation of a coherent S&T policy in the framework of the Cotonou Agreement. There appears to be a total disconnect between these high-profile S&T policy initiatives by the EC and development policy priorities set by ACP countries themselves. The Commission has an instrument for S&T cooperation with ACP countries. Even though limited reference is made to S&T in the Country Strategy Papers, research programmes in agriculture could benefit from support through the Framework Programme coordinated by DG Research. The ACP–EU Ministerial Forum on Research for Sustainable Development in Cape Town therefore represents a first step towards the organization of an S&T policy dialogue within ACP countries, and to a further internationalization of European research aimed at global sustainable development. In view of the steady decline in the priority given to S&T for agricultural research among bilateral donors, multilateral agencies such as the European Commission and the World Bank are likely to become ever more important in the rescue of agricultural research and development in ACP countries. The ACP–EU Ministerial Forum in Cape Town was therefore a valiant effort of the Commission’s DG Research to resuscitate support for attracting investments in S&T for development. CTA could take the initiative and assist in rebuilding constituencies, for supporting the design and implementation of agricultural S&T policies, strategies and programmes or indeed for S&T policies in general in ACP countries and between ACP and Europe. In the process, ACP initiatives could also be linked to other international activities such as those of the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank. Maastricht, 15 November 2003 Agriculture plays {{a central role in the}} economies of most ACP countries. Although agricultural innovations are likely to increase agricultural productivity, ACP governments have given low priority to investing in Science and Technology (S&T) for agriculture. In fact, investment in agricultural research and technology development appears to have steadily declined over the 1980 s and 1990 s, reflecting decreasing donor interest. One may therefore wonder to what extent investment in agricultural science and technology development is surviving as a global public good...|$|E
