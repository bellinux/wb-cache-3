5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan <b>Lapper.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The lava bear (also {{known as}} sand <b>lapper,</b> dwarf grizzly, and North American sun bear) is {{a variety of}} American black bear (Ursus americanus) found in the lava beds of south central Oregon. [...] The animal was {{described}} as a very small bear with wooly light brown fur. [...] The few lava bears that were killed or captured were a little larger than a badger. It was once thought to be a separate species. [...] However, scientists who examined the specimens determined that the animals were stunted due to the harsh environment in which they lived. [...] Today, it is acknowledged that lava bears never existed as a unique species.|$|E

McKendree killed a small bear near Fossil Lake. Originally, McKendree thought it was a black bear cub, but upon further inspection he found the animal was a very small adult bear. He had the animal mounted by a taxidermist. The mounted lava bear was exhibited in The Dalles and later in Lakeview. [...] A photograph of the mounted bear was published in Oregon Sportsman magazine in October 1917. [...] Eventually, the mounted specimen was sent to Washington, D.

2500|$|Since the 15th century, the Sami {{people have}} {{traditionally}} been subjects of Sweden, Norway, Russia and for some time Denmark. In the 16th century Gustav I of Sweden officially claimed that all Sami should be under Swedish realm. However, the area was shared between the countries (i.e. only Sweden and Norway—at that time the Baltic-Finnic tribes of the region that is now Finland were also subjects of Sweden) and the border {{was set up to}} be the water flux line in Fennoscandia. After this [...] "unification", the society, a structure with a few ruling and wealthy citizens called birkarls, ceased to exist, especially with the new king Charles IX who swore by his crown to be the [...] "... <b>Lappers</b> j Nordlanden, the Caijaners" [...] king 1607.

5000|$|Shaker oval {{boxes are}} {{constructed}} using swallowtail projections on the box during the shaping process. These projections are incorrectly referred to as [...] "fingers" [...] or <b>lappers.</b> The swallowtail projections were added for practical purposes in the construction as they allowed the wood to expand and contract without splitting during temperature and humidity changes. Most of the boxes {{were made by the}} Shaker religious leaders, the male Elders. However, the oval bentwood box had no special religious significance and in fact was being made in Europe over a century before the Shakers even existed. Their particular style of oval [...] "Shaker boxes" [...] had certain technological steps to assemble. The various parts had jigs and fixtures to assist in making. For example, the outside elongated [...] "swallowtails" [...] had templates for tracing their distinctive shape. The steamed rims were put around a form called a [...] "follower" [...] until they dried to develop their permanent shape. They had machines aid with other parts to help in mass production. In 1829 they built a new machine shop where the machinery was operated by a twenty-six foot diameter water wheel. They were known to have bought newly invented machines that assisted in making certain board pieces that were created by hand up until then.|$|R
60|$|As for Janet, {{she was as}} one brought {{suddenly}} to the realization of a miracle in whose presence she had lived {{for many years and}} never before suspected; the miracle of machinery, of the triumph of man over nature. In the brief space of an hour she beheld the dirty bales flung off the freight cars on the sidings transformed into delicate fabrics wound from the looms; cotton that only last summer, perhaps, while she sat typewriting at her window, had been growing in the fields of the South. She had seen it torn by the bale-breakers, blown into the openers, loosened, cleansed, and dried; taken up by the <b>lappers,</b> pressed into batting, and passed on to the carding machines, to emerge like a wisp of white smoke in a sliver and coil automatically in a can. Once more it was flattened into a lap, given to a comber that felt out its fibres, removing with superhuman precision those for the finer fabric too short, thrusting it forth again in another filmy sliver ready for the drawing frames. Six of these gossamer ropes were taken up, and again six. Then came the Blubbers and the roving frames, twisting and winding, the while maintaining the most delicate of tensions lest the rope break, running the strands together into a thread constantly growing stronger and finer, until it was ready for spinning.|$|R

60|$|Others add a fourth, {{which is}} a clause of indulgence, that these reduced divines may be {{permitted}} to follow any lawful ways of living, that will not call them too often or too far from their spiritual offices (for unless I misapprehend, {{they are supposed to}} have episcopal ordination). For example, they may be <b>lappers</b> of linen, bailiffs of the manor, they may let blood, or apply plasters, for three miles round; they may get a dispensation to hold the clerkship and sextonship of their own parish in commendam. Their wives and daughters may make shirts for the neighbourhood, or if a barrack be near, for the soldiers. In linen countries, they may card and spin, and keep a few looms in the house: they may let lodgings, and sell a pot of ale without doors, but not at home, unless to sober company, and at regular hours. It is by some thought a little hard, that in an affair of the last consequence, to the very being of the Clergy, in the points of liberty and property, as well as in their abilities to perform their duty; this whole reverend body, who are the established instructors of the nation in Christianity and moral virtues, and are the only persons concerned, should be the sole persons not consulted. Let any scholar shew the like precedent in Christendom for twelve hundred years past. An act of parliament for settling or selling an estate in a private family, is never passed till all parties give consent. But in the present case the whole body of the Clergy is, as themselves apprehend, determined to utter ruin, without once expecting or asking their opinion, and this by a scheme contrived only by one part of the convocation, while the other part which hath been chosen in the usual forms, wants only the regal permission to assemble, and consult about the affairs of the Church, as their predecessors have always done in former ages; where it is presumed, the Lower House hath a power of proposing canons, and a negative voice, as well as the Upper. And God forbid (say these objectors) {{that there should be a}} real separate interest between the bishops and Clergy, any more than there is between a man and his wife, a king and his people, or Christ and his Church.|$|R
