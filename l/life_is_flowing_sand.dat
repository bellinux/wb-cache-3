60|$|The tide of <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>flowing</b> in the town. The {{streets were}} awash with wave on wave of humanity, sucked into a {{thousand}} crossing currents.

And everywhere amongst this sea of men and women could be seen their shadows, meandering like streaks of grey slime stirred up from the lower depths by some huge, never-ceasing finger. The innumerable roar of that human sea climbed out above the roofs and trees, and somewhere in illimitable space blended, and slowly reached the meeting-point of sound and silence--that Heart where Life, leaving its little forms and barriers, clasps Death, and from that clasp springs forth new-formed, within new barriers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overview {{on the state}} of the art of applicable casting technology for applications in the field of repairing Aluminium Alloy components. Repair process on the Aluminium sample using similar metal has been carried out to investigate the micro-structural effect. Joining occurs as a result of convection heat transfer of molten <b>flow</b> into the <b>sand</b> mold which melts the existing base metal inside the mold and subsequent solidification. The analytical model has been developed to describe aluminium component repair by Turbulence Flow Casting. The model built is based on heat transfer principle that can handle the phenomena of heat flow. The experimental result and analytical model analyses pointed out that joint quality are greatly affected by parameters of preheating temperature and duration of molten metal flow in the mold. To obtain a desired metallurgical sound at the joint, the optimum temperature and time were adjusted in order to obtain a similarity of microstructure between filler and base metal. This model is aimed to predict the use of the process parameter ranges in order to have the optimum parameters when it is applied to the experiment. The fixed parameters <b>are</b> <b>flow</b> rate, <b>sand</b> ratio, and pouring temperature. The process parameters are preheating temperature and pouring time.

40|$|The Alaska {{earthquake}} at 0530 on April 7, 1958 (150 ° WMT) was {{the largest}} (Richter scale 7 - 7 {) {{of a series of}} shocks centered in an area near Huslia, Alaska. The field epicenter located at 65 ° 45 'N, 155 ° 45 tW lies in the Koyukuk Basin where arrested sand dune deposits cover a part of the near-level alluvium deposited by the Koyukuk River. Extensive fracturing oc-curred in the lake and river ice in the epicentral area and the sand dune deposits were heavily fissured. The most severe damage occurred in a zone approximately 10 miles wide by 40 miles long trending northeast from Huslia. Associated with the sand dunes in this zone were large deposits of silt and <b>sand</b> which <b>flowed</b> to the surface from the alluvium beneath the dunes. Because of the distinctive characteristics of these <b>flows</b> they have <b>been</b> termed <b>sand</b> <b>flows</b> to distinguish them from mud <b>flows</b> and <b>sand</b> blows.

40|$|Numerical {{sediment}} quality guidelines (SQGs) {{are frequently}} used to interpret site specific sediment chemistry and predict potential toxicity to benthic communities. These SQGs {{are useful for}} a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multi-chemical hazard quotient methods (PEC-Qavg, PEC-Qmet and PEC-Qsum) and a novel (Hazard Score; HZD) approach were {{used in conjunction with}} a consensus based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high <b>flow</b> <b>sand</b> and silt. For high <b>flow</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel, no significant dose-response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose-response relationships were observed for Chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low <b>flow</b> <b>sand</b> and silt habitats. For silt habitats the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of Chironomid abundances compared to various PEC-Q methods according to goodness of fit tests. For low <b>flow</b> <b>sand</b> habitats, PEC-Qsum followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of Chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent Chironomid toxicity between the two habitats suggest habitat specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an index of biological integrity (IBI) method, the HZD, PEC-Qavg and PEC-Qmet approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low <b>flow</b> <b>sand</b> habitats but not for gravel or high <b>flow</b> <b>sands.</b> Computation differences between the various multi-chemical toxicity scoring metrics and how this contributes to bias in different estimates of chemical mixture toxicity scores are discussed and compared...|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{interesting}} to know to what extent the work of authors is influenced by their private affairs. If <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>flowing</b> smoothly, <b>are</b> the novels they write in that period of content coloured with optimism? And if things are running crosswise, do they work off the resultant gloom on their faithful public? If, for instance, Mr. W. W. Jacobs had toothache, would he write like Hugh Walpole? If Maxim Gorky were invited to lunch by Trotsky, to meet Lenin, would he sit down and dash off a trifle in the vein of Stephen Leacock? Probably the eminent have the power of detaching their writing self from their living, work-a-day self; but, for my own part, the frame of mind in which I now found myself had a disastrous effect on my novel that was to be. I had designed it as a light comedy effort. Here and there a page or two to steady the reader and show him what I could do in the way of pathos if I cared to try; but in the main a thing of sunshine and laughter. But now great slabs of gloom began to work themselves into the scheme of it. A magnificent despondency became its keynote. It would not do. I felt that I must make a resolute effort to shake off my depression. More than ever the need of conciliating the professor was borne in upon me. Day and night I spurred my brain to think of some suitable means of engineering a reconciliation.|$|R

50|$|The flame chub is {{extremely}} vulnerable, as stated previously, to any human activity that disturbs their habitat. One topic of interest {{when trying to}} learn more about the ecology of the flame chub is what it eats. Although there have been little to no published studies done about the stomach contents of the flame chub, we can learn from sister species to get a good educated guess about what the flame chub might eat. A study done in western New York examined the river chub, or Nocomis micropogon. The main predators for small river fish such as this are other bigger fish and birds. The diet of these fish, as conducted from the New York study, showed that out of a sample size of 308 young to old adult river chubs, 70% of the food volume found was various insects. The other 30% of the stomach contents were found to be various Crustacea, Mollusca, plants, and other various small organic materials. Information about the specific or preferred habitat for the flame chub can be taken from information given in a very rich area of Northern Alabama. The water was recorded to contain a pH level of about 7-8. The stream would be fed by numerous other smaller streams spanning its entire length.

The systems were {{used to compare the}} nitrification/denitrification efficiency in a tropical climate which has temperatures above an average of 25 °C throughout the year. The effluent from a biogas digester of pig farm wastewater with TKN and COD concentrations of approximately 400 and 1, 000 mg/L was fed every 4 hours intermittently. The effluent was recycled to the system with the ratio of 1 : 1 and the hydraulic loading rate was increased from 3 to 6 and 12 cm/d including recycled water. At higher hydraulic loading rates, nitrogen COD and BOD removal efficiencies were lower. The SS, TP and fecal coliform bacteria removal efficiencies were not clearly affected by the high hydraulic loading or the different layout of the system. Nitrogen uptake by plants was very low in relation to the nitrogen loading of the systems.
