The impetus for the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
5|$|The Lubrański Academy, an {{institution}} of higher <b>learning,</b> <b>was</b> established in Poznań in 1519. The Reformation resulted {{in the establishment of}} a number of gymnasiums, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the Protestant denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The Catholic reaction was the creation of Jesuit colleges of comparable quality. The Kraków University in turn responded with humanist program gymnasiums of its own.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} {{holistic}} online course design framework that {{is drawn from}} theory and empirical research-based principles. This framework is aimed at assuring pedagogical consistency in course design at higher education level and facilitation that maximises the potential of contemporary technology for student <b>learning.</b> It <b>is</b> organised into complementary and often overlapping principles about <b>learning</b> that <b>are</b> drawn from published research. The principles discussed in this chapter included: learning occuring within a community of practice; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> learner-centred; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> flexible and based on individual needs; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> resource-based, and technology-mediated; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> both individual, and networked; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated when new, and valued knowledge <b>is</b> created; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> cognitive, affective, social and sensory-motor; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best supported through constructive alignment of assessment, curriculum and pedagogy; and <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best when activities are purposeful and aligned with assessment...|$|R

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Middle Ages, Greek {{classical}} <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> all {{but lost}} to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive spate of Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, {{as well as to}} Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of the scholastic school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079 – 1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being.|$|E

5|$|Schools and {{hospitals}} are mentioned in records {{and these were}} built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu Matha, Jain Palli and Buddhist Vihara. These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (Saraswati Bhandara). <b>Learning</b> <b>was</b> imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called Brahmapuri (or Ghatika or Agrahara). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen. The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (Vartta), Political Science (Dandaniti), Veda (trayi) and Philosophy (Anvikshiki), subjects that are mentioned as early as Kautilyas Arthashastra.|$|E
5|$|When Alfred the Great became King of Wessex in 871, {{learning}} in southern England {{was at a}} low level, {{and there were no}} Latin scholars. He embarked on a programme of revival, bringing in scholars from Continental Europe, Wales and Mercia, and himself translated works he considered important from Latin to the vernacular. His grandson, Æthelstan, carried on the work, inviting foreign scholars such as Israel to England, and appointing a number of continental clerics as bishops. In the 930s the level of <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> still not high enough to supply enough literate English priests to fill the bishoprics. The generation educated in Æthelstan's reign, such as the future Bishop of Winchester, Æthelwold, who was educated at court, and Dunstan, who became Archbishop of Canterbury, went on to raise English learning to a high level.|$|E

50|$|Rote <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> memorizing {{information}} {{so that it}} can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard.

Rote <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion.
