One important factor, which considerably influences {{the results of}} pushover analysis, is the pattern of distribution of lateral loads along the height of struc-tures.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{development}} of lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> for the conceptual seismic design of moment-resisting frame structures. The proposed lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> are based on inelastic behavior and are a fundamental component of a proposed seismic design methodology to limit the extent of structural damage in the system and distribute this damage uniformly along the height. These <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> are expected to provide a uniform distribution of story ductility ratios when compared to the distributions obtained with moment-resisting frames designed based on the code-compliant design lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns.</b> The implementation of the aforementioned methodology would not only distribute damage along the height of the frame, but also help avoid undesirable dynamic responses that occur once structural damage is concentrated in one or in a few stories, e. g., story drift amplifications caused by P-delta effects. The family of structural models used in this study is composed of six to eighteen-story moment resisting frame structures with fundamental periods of vibration that vary from 0. 6 s. to 3. 0 s. On the input side, two basic types of ground motions are used: far-field and near-field ground motions. The proposed design lateral <b>load</b> <b>patterns</b> are a function of the fundamental period of the structural system, the target level of inelastic behavior (or damage), the total height of structures, and the frequency content of the ground motions...|$|R

30|$|This study {{indicates}} that for structures responding primarily in the first mode, pushover methods may be a reliable choice to estimate inelastic demands. However, the validity depends {{on the level of}} expected inelastic behavior and the number of stories. On the other hand, the results show that in low-rise structures, all load patterns provide fairly accurate estimation of the global and inter-story demands. By increasing the number of stories the MMC appears to be promising in terms of better estimating peak values of critical inelastic response quantities such as inter-story drifts. It is shown that considering sufficient number of modes, inter-story drifts estimated by MMC is generally similar to trends resulted from NTHA. Moreover, studying all results shows that due to the pulse like near-fault ground shakings, the MMC method could be used as an appropriate <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> in calculating distributed inelastic demands of structure over the height. However, the accuracy of this <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> is dependent on the inter-story ductility level. Finally, this paper indicates that special care should be taken when using pushover procedures since the lateral <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> used to estimate demand could have a significant influence on the computed demands (each <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> has an inherent capability to estimate specific response). The comparison of the NTHA and NSPs results reveals that the pushover methods tend to underestimate demands at the upper levels, signifying the relevance of higher mode effects in mid to high-rise structures except the result of MMC. Moreover, each <b>load</b> <b>pattern</b> has a different result of capacity curve with different elastic and inelastic stiffness. Therefore, using the MMC cannot guaranty the unique ultimate capacity curve of the structure and this is the main disadvantage of this method.|$|E
