40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe Holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser is the standard lithotrite for ureteroscopy. This {{paper is}} to {{evaluate}} a Ho:YAG laser with a novel effect function in vitro, which allows a real-time variation of pulse duration and pulse peak power. MethodsTwo types of phantom calculi with four degrees of hardness were made for fragmentation and retropulsion experiments. Fragmentation was analysed at 5 (0. 5  J/ 10  Hz), 10 (1  J/ 10  Hz), and 20 (2  J/ 10  Hz) W in non-floating phantom calculi, retropulsion in an ureteral model at 10 (1  J/ 10  Hz) and 20 (2  J/ 10  Hz) W using floating phantom calculi. The effect function was set to 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % of the maximum possible effect function at each power setting. Primary outcomes: fragmentation (mm 3), the distance of retropulsion (cm); ≥ 5 measurements for each trial. ResultsAn increase of the effect feature (25 % vs. 100 %), i. e., an increase of pulse peak power and decrease of pulse duration, improved Ho:YAG <b>laser</b> <b>fragmentation.</b> This effect was remarkable in soft stone composition, while there was a trend for improved fragmentation with an increase of the effect feature in hard stone composition. Retropulsion increased with increasing effect function, independently of stone composition. The major {{limitations of the study}} are the use of artificial stones and the in vitro setup. ConclusionChanges in pulse duration and pulse peak power may lead to improved stone fragmentation, most prominently in soft stones, but also lead to increased retropulsion. This new effect function may enhance Ho:YAG <b>laser</b> <b>fragmentation</b> when maximum power output is limited or retropulsion is excluded...|$|E

The electronic degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically within the time-dependent Kohn–Sham formalism, while the ions are handled classically. All quantities are expanded in a regular mesh in real space, and the simulations are performed in real time.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate <b>laser</b> <b>fragmentation</b> to form nanosuspensions in aqueous solution of the insoluble model drug megestrol acetate (MA) using very little quantities of the drug. <b>Laser</b> <b>fragmentation</b> was obtained by focusing a femtosecond (fs) or nanosecond (ns) laser radiation on a magnetically stirred MA suspension in water or aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent. The size distribution and physicochemical properties of the drug nanoparticles were characterized, and the in vitro dissolution and in vivo oral pharmacokinetics of a laser fragmented formulation were evaluated. A MA nanosuspension was also prepared by media milling for comparison purpose. For both laser radiations, smaller particles were obtained as the laser power was increased, but at a cost of higher degradation. Significant nanonization was achieved after a 30 -min fs laser treatment at 250 mW and a 1 -h ns laser treatment at 2500 mW. The degradation induced by the laser process of the drug was primarily oxidative in nature. The crystal phase of the drug was maintained, although partial loss of crystallinity was observed. The in vitro dissolution rate and in vivo bioavailability of the laser fragmented formulation were similar to those obtained with the nanosuspension prepared by media milling, and significantly improved compared to the coarse drug powder.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a five-year effort to understand the mechanisms and develop models that predict the corrosion of refractories in oxygen-fuel glass-melting furnaces. Thermodynamic data for the Si-O-(Na or K) and Al-O-(Na or K) systems are reported, allowing equilibrium calculations to be performed to evaluate corrosion of silica- and alumina-based refractories under typical furnace operating conditions. A detailed analysis of processes contributing to corrosion is also presented. Using this analysis, a model of the corrosion process was developed and used to predict corrosion rates in an actual industrial glass furnace. The rate-limiting process is most likely the transport of NaOH(gas) through the mass-transport boundary layer from the furnace atmosphere to the crown surface. Corrosion rates predicted on this basis are in better agreement with observation than those produced by any other mechanism, although the absolute values are highly sensitive to the crown temperature and the NaOH(gas) concentration at equilibrium and {{at the edge of the}} boundary layer.

40|$|Recoil-ion and {{electron}} momentum spectroscopy is a rapidly developing technique that {{allows one to}} measure the vector momenta of several ions and electrons resulting from atomic or molecular fragmentation. In a unique combination, large solid angles close to 4 and superior momentum resolutions around a few per cent of an atomic unit (a. u.) are typically reached in state-of-the art machines, so-called reaction-microscopes. Evolving from recoil-ion and cold target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS), reaction-microscopes—the `bubble chambers of atomic physics'—mark the decisive step forward to investigate many-particle quantum-dynamics occurring when atomic and molecular systems or even surfaces and solids are exposed to time-dependent external electromagnetic fields. This paper concentrates on just these latest technical developments and on at least four new classes of fragmentation experiments that have emerged within about the last five years.

In this intense-field ultra short-pulse regime one can both measure and manipulate dynamics on the femtosecond timescale. To probe the dynamics of laser-matter interactions in this regime, we have chosen to start from the simplest possible molecule - H+ 2, which can either dissociate into H + p or ionize into p + p + e. We have designed and employ a coincidence three-dimensional momentum imaging technique which allows us to measure ionization and dissociation of a molecular ion beam target simultaneously, while completely separating the two channels from each other. By varying the laser intensity and the pulse duration, we measure the intensity and pulse length dependent momentum distributions for <b>laser</b> induced <b>fragmentation</b> of H+ 2 at 790 nm. These dissociation measurements are in agreement with the phenomena predicted using the adiabatic Floquet picture, e. g. bond softening, in addition to more sophisticated calculations done by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in the Born-Oppenheimer representation. Furthermore, the structure seen in ionization in our measurements and soon after by others is explained via a unified diabatic Floquet picture, which includes both ionization and dissociation in a single intensity and wavelength dependent picture that includes nuclear motion. Additionally, we use the same experimental techniques and apparatus to probe the laser-induced dynamics of multi-electron diatomic molecules, e. g. O+ 2, N+ 2, and ND+. The most probable dissociation and ionization pathways producing the features seen in these measurements are discerned using the angular and kinetic-energy-release distributions in conjunction with the diabatic Floquet picture. Finally, we extend these experimental techniques and interpretive models to the simplest polyatomic molecule - H+ 3, whose fragmentation presents challenges both in our first-of-their-kind experiments and in physical interpretation...|$|R

Nevertheless complications of Pneumatic Lithotripsy were higher in multiple aspects of 19. 05 percent stone retropulsion, 21. 43 percent re-quiring auxillary introduced double- J ureteric stent insertion, 2. 38 percent urosepsis and 2. 38 per-cent incidentally sustained severe postoperative pain. In conclusion, Laser Lithotripsy and Pneumatic Lithotripsy were not different in efficacy of stone fragmentation but serious complications were found higher in the Pneumatic Lithotripsy group...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGas phase {{photodissociation}} electronic {{spectra of}} protonated azobenzene (ABH +) and 4 -(dimethylamino) azobenzene (dmaABH +) were measured in a cryogenically-cooled ion trap at temperatures {{of a few}} tens of Kelvin. Experimental results were complemented with electronic structure calculations in the ground state at the MP 2 /cc-pVDZ level of theory, and in the low lying excited states using the RI-CC 2 method. Calculated energies revealed that only the trans isomers of the azoniummolecular ions (protonation site on the azo group) will likely exist in the trap at the temperatures achieved in the experiment. The first transition of trans-ABH + was found ππππ* in character, and the absorption band in the spectrum appears strongly red-shifted {{from that of the}} neutral molecule. The calculations showed that upon excitation the quasi-planar ground state (S 0) transforms into a chair-like excited state (S 1) by twisting the CNNC dihedral angle about 96 degrees. A 41 cm  1 active vibrational progression found in the ABH + spectrum may be associated with the twisting of the azo bond. Conversely, the electronic spectrum of dmaABH + exhibits a steep and unstructured S 1 S 0 absorption corresponding to a less distorted S 1 state. The next two quasi-degenerate bands in the ABH + spectrum evidence sharper onsets and a charge transfer character. Using a second <b>fragmentation</b> <b>laser</b> and an additional He cooling pulse in the trap, it was possible to measure the UV spectrum of cold benzenediazonium fragments...|$|R
