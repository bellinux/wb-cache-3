50|$|The next {{model to}} be built was a three-seat cabin {{monoplane}} to Ministry Specification 16/29, in which the all-moving tips were replaced by conventional ailerons.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the open-loop stability analysis and an active control strategy for an airbreathing hypersonic vehicle. The 14 -XB, a bidimensional flow airframe {{derived from the}} Brazilian 14 -X Aerospace Hypersonic Vehicle, is adopted as study platform. In order to perform such analyses, a simulation mathematical model of the airframe longitudinal forces and moments is obtained using perfect gas equations, after considering {{the relevance of the}} real gas hypotheses for the expected Mach number range and verifying that the simpler formulation is sufficient. An all-moving horizontal tail is designed in order to enable the aircraft trimming. The horizontal tail design considered simple constraints based on static analysis, and the same gas equations as those used for the airframe study. In order to analyze the aircraft';s dynamic behavior, a Six-Degree-of-Freedom set of equations of motion considering a spherical, rotating Earth is presented in detail, and the necessary conditions to have adequate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trimming</b> in this scenario are discussed. The open-loop stability of the 14 -XB with the designed horizontal tail is assessed through eigenvalue analysis and numerical flight simulations with the horizontal tail fixed at a trim position. Having observed that the aircraft presents unstable long-term natural modes, an active control strategy is suggested in order to stabilize the vehicle and track a desired flight path angle, assuming that thrust is constant and the control surface is an all-moving horizontal tail. The suggested control structure presents pitch stability augmentation system and flight path angle compensator. Optimal gains are calculated using linear quadratic design, along with a gain-scheduling strategy based on simultaneous control design, and the resulting controller presents proper results...|$|R

40|$|Historical {{data for}} Leydig cell tumors from {{untreated}} or vehicle treated rats from carcinogenicity studies {{collected in the}} RITA database are presented. Examples are given for analyses of these data for dependency on variables considered to be of possible influence on the spontaneous incidence of Leydig cell tumors. In the 7453 male rats available for analysis, only one case of a Leydig cell carcinoma was identified. The incidence of Leydig cell adenomas differed markedly between strains. High incidences of close to 100 % {{have been found in}} F 344 rats, while the mean incidence was 4. 2 % in Sprague-Dawley rats and 13. 7 % in Wistar rats. Incidences in Wistar rats were highly variable, primarily caused by different sources of animals. Mean incidences per breeder varied from 2. 8 to 39. 9 %. Analyses for the dependency on further parameters have been performed in Wistar rats. In breeders G and I, the Leydig cell tumor incidence decreased over the observation period and with increasing mean terminal body weight. The incidence of Leydig cell tumors increased with mean age at necropsy and was higher in studies with dietary admixture compared to gavage studies. These parameters had no effect on Leydig cell tumor incidence in breeders A and B. Animals from almost all breeders had a considerably higher mean age at necropsy when bearing a Leydig cell adenoma than animals without a Leydig cell adenoma. Studies with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trimming</b> of the testes had a higher incidence than studies with transverse trimming. The observed dependencies and breeder differences are discussed and explanations are given. Consequences for the use of historical control data are outlined. With the retrospective analyses presented here we were able to confirm the published features of Leydig cell adenomas and carcinomas. This indicates that the RITA database is a valuable tool for analyses of tumors for their biological features. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the RITA database is highly beneficial for the definition of reliable historical control data for carcinogenicity studies on a scientifically solid basis...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} via the {{initiative}} of the NATO RTO-AVT- 161 Task group. The group is aimed at assessment of Stability and Control Prediction Methods for NATO Air and Sea Vehicles (essentially complex configurations). The assessments need to include the absolute values of forces and moments {{as well as the}} various symmetric and asymmetric stability derivatives, both steady and unsteady. This paper relates to the topic of the canard-delta X- 31 Vector aircraft. Low speed experimental data is available on an X- 31 model tested by DLR. The main focus of this paper is in the use of linear theory and Surface Singularity methods (Panel codes). Results are compared with experiment and other CFD methods. The main emphasis is on longitudinal stability aspects with component contributions. However, selected asymmetric effects are also considered. For the symmetric cases, the predictions have shown good agreement for Lift with experiment and CFD up to α about 15 o. For pitching moment, agreement with other CFD results is good up to α of 15 o. The experiments show a more discontinuous behaviour beyond α about 10 o. A series of longitudinal stabilty derivatives have been derived from the results. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>Trimming</b> aspects are briefly discussed. For the asymmetric cases with sideslip, a limited set of stability derivatives have been obtained. These look reasonable but need to be compared with experimental data eventually. Further work is needed for estimation of roll and yaw derivatives. The work so far has been interesting and encouraging. It has led to an improved understanding of the complex configurations with strongly interacting and separating / vortical flows. It is remarkable that low-order theories apply reasonably well up to α of 15 o or so, with results being comparable with high-order CFD solvers. In the wider perspective, for the future, an understanding has evolved for either exploitation or avoidance of the complex flows. This is an important motivation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustics parametric {{study of the}} effect of varying lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> rotor <b>trim</b> flapping angles (tip-path-plane tilt) on noise radiated by an isolated 26 -ft diameter proprotor, {{similar to that of the}} AW 609 tiltrotor, in edgewise flight. Three tip-path-plane angle of attack operating conditions of - 9, 0 and 6 deg, at 80 knots, were investigated. Results showed that: 1) minimum noise was attained for the tip-path-plane angle of attack value of - 9 deg, and 2) changing the cyclic trim state (i. e., controls) altered the airloads and produced noticeable changes to the low-frequency (LF) and blade-vortex interaction (BVI) radiated-noise magnitude and directionality. In particular, by trimming the rotor to a positive (inboard) lateral flapping angle of 4 deg, further reductions up to 3 dB in the low-frequency noise sound pressure level were attained without significantly impacting the BVI noise for longitudinal tip-path-plane angles of - 9 and 6 deg...|$|R

It had essentially the same wing as the P.111 in the latter's greatest span configuration, an unclipped delta; the wing tips of the P.120 were not removable or replaceable, but they could be rotated differentially or together for lateral or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim.</b> Just inboard of these tips the P.120 gained a pair of wingfences.

50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to trim an elevator to hold the nose down, the elevator's trim tab will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} trim tab surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim,</b> a supplementary trim tab is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|E
50|$|Some gliders {{not only}} use flaps when landing, {{but also in}} flight to {{optimize}} the camber of the wing for the chosen speed. When thermalling, flaps may be partially extended to reduce the stalling speed so that the glider can be flown more slowly and thereby reduce the rate of sink, which lets the glider use the rising air of the thermal more efficiently, and to turn in a smaller circle to make best use of {{the core of the}} thermal. At higher speeds a negative flap setting is used to reduce the nose-down pitching moment. This reduces the balancing load required on the horizontal stabilizer, which in turn reduces the trim drag associated with keeping the glider in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>trim.</b> Negative flap may also be used during the initial stage of an aerotow launch {{and at the end of}} the landing run in order to maintain better control by the ailerons.|$|E

40|$|The unique {{capabilities}} of the tilt-rotor configuration are generally accepted to provide significant potential when applied to numerous civil and military operations. A vital stage {{in the development of}} any tilt-rotor design is the simulation of its basic flying qualities which are essentially defined by the vehicle's response to a range of control inputs and the trim states it adopts. In order to carry out this simulation satisfactorily, an accurate generic mathematical model is required, however, the author is unaware of any existing tilt-rotor simulations which utilise the latest modelling techniques. A generic tilt-rotor simulation model (GTILT) which includes individual blade modelling to describe the behaviour of the rotor has been developed during this research. One of the most significant attributes of individual blade models is that they portray the oscillatory nature of the forces and moments produced by a lifting rotor. The resulting trimmed flight path of the vehicle is periodic rather than steady in nature and consequently existing trimming algorithms, formulated for use with rotor disc representations, are inappropriate when applied to individual blade simulations. A specialised trimming algorithm capable of rapidly trimming rotorcraft simulations to a specified periodic trim state has been developed and incorporated into the GTILT model. Individual blade modelling provides a higher level of fidelity than is possible when using a rotor disc representation but this benefit is obtained at the expense of computational burden. Hence, most sequential computing facilities are unable to provide the performance necessary to make such models practical. In order to reduce computational run-times to an acceptable level GTILT has been parallelised and implemented on a custom designed transputer network. GTILT has been configured using XV-IS data in order to investigate the fidelity of its predicted trim states and vehicle response to a range of control inputs. During the course of this investigation, the trim algorithm is shown to be robust and capable of producing rapid convergence {{to a wide range of}} <b>trim</b> states. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>trims</b> predicted by GTILT are verified against those of the similarly configured Bell C 81 for a range of nacelle incidences and good correlation obtained in all cases. A qualitative verification of the trim states adopted in turning flight reveals no anomalies and the results obtained are very encouraging. The dynamic response of the vehicle is demonstrated to be qualitatively valid when a range of control inputs are applied at various nacelle incidences with the behaviour of the vehicle being explicable in all cases...|$|R
