50|$|Even {{earlier than}} Bravais, the Italian {{scientist}} F. Venturi experimented with pointed water-filled prisms {{to demonstrate the}} <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc.</b> However, this explanation was replaced later by the CZA's correct explanation by Bravais.|$|R
5000|$|Both arcs are brightly {{coloured}} ring segments {{centred on}} the zenith, but in different {{positions in the}} sky: The <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> is notably curved and located high above the Sun (or Moon) with its convex side pointing downwards (creating the impression of an [...] "upside down rainbow"); the circumhorizontal arc runs {{much closer to the}} horizon, is more straight and located at a significant distance below the Sun (or Moon). Both arcs have their red side pointing towards the sun and their violet part away from it, meaning the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> is red on the bottom, while the circumhorizontal arc is red on top.|$|R
500|$|The {{crescent}} moon {{shape in the}} middle of the sky looks very much like a <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> which is parallel to the horizon but centred at and located near zenith. [...] However, they only form when the sun is located lower than 32.2° and are at their brightest when the sun is located at 22°, which is not consistent with other haloes depicted in the painting. [...] Furthermore, one of the most striking features of <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arcs</b> is their rainbow colours, and the shape in the painting is perfectly devoid of any colours. It is however not a complete circle (see Kern arc), and it is facing the sun, which are both correct properties for this phenomenon.|$|R
5000|$|A {{water glass}} {{experiment}} (known {{at least since}} 1920, cf. image on the right, or even longer) {{may be used to}} create an artificial <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc.</b> Illuminating (under a shallow angle) the top air-water interface of a nearly completely water-filled cylindrical glass will refract the light into the water. The glass should be situated {{at the edge of a}} table. The second refraction at the cylinder's side face is then a skew-ray refraction. The overall refraction turns out to be equivalent to the refraction through an upright hexagonal plate crystal when the rotational averaging is taken into account. A colorful artificial <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> will then appear projected on the floor. Other artificial halos can be created by similar means.|$|R

50|$|The Kern arc is an {{extremely}} rare atmospheric optical phenomenon belonging {{to the family of}} ice crystal halos. It is a complete and faint circle around the zenith, in contrast to the related and much more common <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> which is only ever a partial circle.|$|R
50|$|The {{intensity}} distribution along the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> requires consideration of several effects: Fresnel's reflection and transmission amplitudes, atmospheric attenuation, chromatic dispersion (i.e. {{the width of}} the arc), azimuthal angular dispersion (ray bundling), and geometrical constraints. In effect, the CZA is brightest when the sun is at about 20°.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} halos, the CZA {{can be caused}} by light from the moon {{as well as from the}} sun: the former is {{referred}} to as a lunar <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc.</b> Its occurrence is rarer than the solar variety, since it requires the moon to be sufficiently bright, which is typically only the case around full moon.|$|R
5000|$|The circumhorizontal arc is {{sometimes}} referred to by the misnomer [...] "fire rainbow". In order to view it, the Sun or Moon {{must be at least}} 58° above the horizon, making it a rare occurrence at higher latitudes. The <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> visible only at a solar or lunar elevation of less than 32°, is much more common, but often missed since it occurs almost directly overhead.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{the true}} sun, two mock suns (parhelia) and an {{anthelion}} were seen, with halos at 22° and 46°, and topped with an upper tangent <b>arc</b> and a <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> respectively. Of particular interest to modern scientists were the mention of three further mock suns, one {{at the intersection of}} the 22° halo and the upper tangent arc, and two others at 90* to the sun, also at the intersections of an immense but incomplete halo.|$|R
5000|$|This {{approach}} {{employs the}} fact that in some cases the average geometry of refraction through an ice crystal may be imitated / mimicked via the refraction through another geometrical object. In this way, the <b>Circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> the Circumhorizontal arc and the suncave Parry arcs may be recreated by refraction through rotationally symmetric (i.e. non-prismatic) static bodies. A particularly simple table-top experiment reproduces artificially the colorful <b>circumzenithal</b> and circumhorizontal <b>arcs</b> using a water glass only. The refraction through the cylinder of water turns out to be (almost) identical to the rotationally averaged refraction through an upright hexagonal ice crystal / plate-oriented crystals, thereby creating vividly colored circumzenithal and the circumhorizontal arcs. In fact, the water glass experiment is often confused as representing a rainbow and has been around at least since 1920.|$|R
5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|R
50|$|A supralateral arc is a {{comparatively}} rare {{member of the}} halo family which in its complete form appears as a large, faintly rainbow-colored band in a wide arc above the sun and appearing to encircle it, at about twice the distance as the familiar 22° halo. In reality, however, the supralateral arc does not form a circle and never reaches below the sun. When present, the supralateral arc touches the (much more common) <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> from below. As in all colored halos, the arc has its red side directed towards the sun, its blue part away from it.|$|R
50|$|Confusion {{with other}} members of the halo family, such as sun dogs or the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> may also arise, but these are easily {{dismissed}} by their entirely different positions in relation to the Sun or Moon. More difficult is the distinction between the circumhorizontal arc and the infralateral arc, both of which almost entirely overlap when the Sun or Moon is at a high elevation. The difference is that the circumhorizontal arc always runs parallel to the horizon (although pictures typically show it as a curved line due to perspective distortion), whereas the infralateral arc curves upward at its ends.|$|R
50|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky.

Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|R
50|$|To {{tell the}} {{difference}} between a 46° halo and the infra-/supralateral arcs, one should carefully observe sun elevation and the fluctuating shapes and orientations of the arcs. The supralateral arc always touches the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> while the 46° halo only achieves this when the sun is located 15-27° over the horizon, leaving a gap between the two at other elevations. In contrast, supralateral arcs cannot form when the Sun is over 32°, so a halo in the 46°-region is always a 46° halo at higher elevations. If the Sun is near the zenith, however, circumhorizontal or infralateral arcs are located 46° under the Sun and can be confused with the 46° halo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{experimental studies}} on halo phenomena {{have been attributed}} to Auguste Bravais in 1847. Bravais used an equilateral glass prism which he spun around its vertical axis. When illuminated by parallel white light, this produced an artificial Parhelic circle and many of the embedded parhelia. Similarly, A. Wegener used hexagonal rotating crystals to produce artificial subparhelia. In a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal BK7 glass crystals. Simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments. Unfortunately, using glass crystals one cannot reproduce the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> or the circumhorizontal arc due to total internal reflections preventing the required ray-paths when [...]|$|R
5000|$|The {{observation}} {{most likely}} occurred in Auspitz (Hustopeče), Moravia on October 31, 1533. The original {{was written in}} German and is from a letter originally sent in November 1533 from Auspitz in Moravia to the Adige Valley in Tyrol. The Kuntz Maurer and Michel Schuster mentioned in the letter left Hutter on the Thursday after the feast day of Simon and Jude, which is October 28. The Thursday after was October 30. It {{is likely that the}} [...] "two rainbows with their backs turned toward each other, almost touching" [...] involved two further halo phenomena, possibly a <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> (prone to co-occur with sun dogs) together with a partial 46° halo or supralateral arc.|$|R
50|$|The same plate shaped ice {{crystals}} that cause sun dogs are {{also responsible for}} the colorful <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> meaning that {{these two types of}} halo tend to co-occur. The latter is often missed by viewers, however, since it is located more or less directly overhead. Another halo variety often seen together with sun dogs is the 22° halo, which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the sun dogs, thus appearing to interconnect them. As the Sun rises higher, however, the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane, causing their angle of deviation to increase and the sun dogs to move farther from the 22° halo, while staying at the same elevation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the static 46° halo, {{the shape of a}} supralateral arc varies with the elevation of the sun. Before the sun reaches 15°, the bases of the arc touch the [...] (oriented sidewise) sides of the 46° halo. As the sun rises from 15° to 27°, the supralateral arc almost overlaps the upper half of the 46° halo, which is why many reported observations of the latter most likely are observations of the former. As the sun goes from 27° to 32°, the apex of the <b>arc</b> touches the <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc</b> centered on zenith (as does the 46° halo when the sun is located between 15° and 27°). In addition, the supralateral arc is always located above the parhelic circle (the arc located below it is the infralateral arc), and is never perfectly circular.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc,</b> {{also called}} the circumzenith arc (CZA), {{upside-down}} rainbow, and the Bravais arc, is an optical phenomenon similar in appearance to a rainbow, but belonging {{to the family of}} halos arising from refraction of sunlight through ice crystals, generally in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, rather than from raindrops. The arc is located at a considerable distance (approximately 46°) above the sun and at most forms a quarter of a circle centered on the zenith. It has been called [...] "a smile in the sky", its first impression being that of an upside-down rainbow. The CZA is one of the brightest and most colorful members of the halo family. Its colors, ranging from violet on top to red at the bottom, are purer than those of a rainbow because there is much less overlap in their formation.|$|R
5000|$|The halo {{was first}} {{described}} by Sir William Edward Parry (1790-1855) in 1820 {{during one of}} his Arctic expeditions in search for the Northwest Passage. On April 8, under harsh conditions while his two ships were trapped by ice forcing him to winter over at Melville Island in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago, he made a drawing of the phenomenon. The drawing accurately renders the parhelic circle, a 22° halo, a pair of sun dogs, a lower tangent arc, a 46° halo, and a <b>circumzenithal</b> <b>arc.</b> He did, however, get the upper tangent arc slightly wrong. On the other hand, he added two arcs extending laterally from the bases of the 46° halo, for long interpreted as incorrectly drawn infralateral arcs, but, as thing were, probably correctly drawn subhelic arcs. (both produced by the same crystal orientation but with light passing through different faces of the crystals.) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>circumzenithal</b> and circumhorizontal <b>arcs</b> are {{two related}} optical {{phenomena}} similar in appearance to a rainbow, {{but unlike the}} latter, their origin lies in light refraction through hexagonal ice crystals rather than liquid water droplets. This means {{that they are not}} rainbows, but members of the large family of halos.|$|R
5000|$|Artificial ice {{crystals}} have been employed to create halos which are otherwise unattainable in the mechanical approach via {{the use of}} glass crystals, e.g. <b>circumzenithal</b> and circumhorizontal <b>arcs.</b> The use of {{ice crystals}} ensures that the generated halos have the same angular coordinates as the natural phenomena. Other crystals such as NaF also have a refractive index close to ice and {{have been used in}} the past.|$|R
