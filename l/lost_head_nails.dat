50|$|Nail guns use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full <b>head</b> <b>nail</b> guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped <b>head</b> so the <b>nails</b> can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round <b>Head</b> <b>nails</b> and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R

5000|$|The largest {{sizes of}} {{conventional}} collated fastenings are the clipped head and full <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> {{which are used}} in framing, fencing {{and other forms of}} structural and exterior work. These nails generally have a shank diameter of 0.11 to 0.13 in. (2.9 to 3.1 mm) although some manufacturers offer smaller diameter nails as well. General lengths are in the range 2 in to [...] in (50 to 90 mm). Shank styles include plain, ring annular, twisted, etc. and a variety of materials and finishes are offered including plain steel, galvanized steel, sherardised steel, stainless steel, etc. depending on the pull-out resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. required for the given application. These sizes of fastenings are available in stick collated form (often 20° to 21° for full head, 28° to 34° for clipped head) or coil form (for use in pallet/roofing nailers) depending on the application. Full-head nails have greater pull-out resistance than clipped <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> and are mandated by code in many hurricane zones for structural framing.|$|R
50|$|On 23 February, Maria, Haqvin, Ingeborg, and Karin {{were found}} guilty and {{sentence}}d to death. They were all decapitated, with some variations. Maria was decapitated and burned, Haqvin was decapitated and had his <b>head</b> <b>nailed</b> to a pole, Ingeborg had her hand cut off, and was then decapitated and burned. Karin was simply decapitated, and buried. The sentence was carried out on 14 April 1725.|$|R

50|$|A pin is {{a device}} used for {{fastening}} objects or material together. Pins often have two components: a long body and sharp tip made of steel, or occasionally copper or brass, {{and a larger}} head often made of plastic. The sharpened body penetrates the material, while the larger head provides a driving surface. It is formed by drawing out a thin wire, sharpening the tip, and adding a <b>head.</b> <b>Nails</b> are related, but are typically larger. In machines and engineering, pins are commonly used as pivots, hinges, shafts, jigs, and fixtures to locate or hold parts.|$|R

Once the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> are exposed, water running down the roof can seep into the building around the nail shank, resulting in rotting of underlying roof building materials and causing moisture damage to ceilings and paint inside.|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after its}} completion, the pier started {{to suffer from}} damage caused by gribble worms {{resulting}} in the foundations needing to be rebuilt in 1838. In an attempt to prevent further gribble damage the pier's pilings were covered in large <b>headed</b> <b>nails</b> which it was hoped would rust and provide the pier with a protective coating. In 1847 a horse-drawn tramway was constructed to link the pier to Southampton Terminus railway station. In 1871 the tramway was extended {{to the end of}} the pier with a single platform station being built there. In 1876 the trams switched from being horse-drawn to using light steam locomotives. In 1888 the pier was given a new gatehouse.|$|R

40|$|Soil nailing {{has been}} widely used for {{improving}} slope stability {{over the last three}} decades around the world and is currently the predominant method used for upgrading the stability of existing soil cut slopes in Hong Kong. Although interaction between soil and nails has been investigated widely, only few studies were conducted on the role of <b>nail</b> <b>heads.</b> Therefore, the objectives of this research are to further improve the fundamental understanding of the behaviour of nailed slopes and to investigate the role of <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> in improving slope stability and reducing ground deformation. In this research, a series of CDG dense fill model slopes reinforced with different sizes of <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> including grillage were destabilized by controlling long-term transient seepage in centrifuge. The prototype slope angle and height were 650 and 15 m, respectively. Pore water pressures, slope deformation, axial nail forces and contact pressures between soil and <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> were measured. Pore water pressure transducers were modified into tensiometers to measure high suction in centrifuge. A four-stage procedure was developed to saturate the tensiometers. Furthermore, an experimental framework was estabilished to identify whether a tensiometer had been desaturated or not. Three-dimensional coupled numerical simulations using ABAQUS were conducted to back-analyse the centrifuge test results. The three-dimensional numerical simulations considered the coupled effects of soil deformation and pore water pressure changes. It is found that, a global failure was evident in the unreinforced slope after being subjected to long-term transient seepage. Installation of soil nails prevented the formation of the global failure but not a tension crack at the crest. The presence of <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> prevented the global failure and the formation of the crack after even over two years of transient seepage. With the greater sizes of <b>nail</b> <b>heads,</b> (a) crest settlements decreased, (b) the mobilised axial force at the <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> on each <b>nail</b> and a total of each mobilised maximum axial nail force (Tmax) increased, (c) the location of the Tmax shifted towards the slope surface, and (d) the normalized contact pressures increased at the quasi-steady state. The global failure which occurred in the unreinforced slope in centrifuge was reasonably consistent with numerical simulations. General trends in crest settlements and axial forces at the quasi-steady state were also captured in the numerical simulations...|$|R
