40|$|This work {{presents}} the experimental {{evaluation of the}} energy performance of a modified single-stage CO 2 transcritical refrigeration plant with an internal heat exchanger (IHX) based on vapour injection in suction line. This modification, which {{is only applicable to}} refrigeration plants with an expansion process divided in two stages with a <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> between them, consists of extracting saturated vapour from the <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> in order to: decrease the vapour quality at the evaporator inlet, and reduce the superheating degree at the compressor suction by means of the expansion and following injection of the extracted refrigerant. Three different injection points have been evaluated experimentally: before the IHX, after the IHX and just before the suction chamber of the compressor. The experimental measurements show that the cooling capacity and COP can be enhanced in 9. 81 % and 7. 01 %, respectively. Furthermore, a reduction in the discharge temperature of the compressor up to 14. 7 °C has been measured inside the evaluation range...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} interest in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{systems and the}} large number of cycle models proposed in the literature, charge-based ORC models are still almost absent. In this paper, a detailed overall ORC simulation model is presented based on two solution strategies: condenser subcooling and total working fluid charge of the system. The latter allows the subcooling level to be predicted rather than specified as an input. The overall cycle model is composed of independent models for pump, expander, line sets, <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> and heat exchangers. Empirical and semi-empirical models are adopted for the pump and expander, respectively. A generalized steady-state moving boundary method is used to model the heat exchangers. The line sets and <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> are used to better estimate the total charge of the system and pressure drops. Finally, the individual components are connected to form a cycle model in an object-oriented fashion. The solution algorithm includes a preconditioner to guess reasonable values for the evaporating and condensing temperatures and a main cycle solver loop which drives to zero a set of residuals to ensure the convergence of the solution. The model has been developed in the Python programming language. A thorough validation is then carried out against experimental data obtained from two test setups having different nominal size, working fluids and individual components: (i) a regenerative ORC with a 5 kW scroll expander and an oil flooding loop; (ii) a regenerative ORC with a 11 kW single-screw expander. The computer code is made available through open-source dissemination...|$|E

The purpose of the test was to provide operational and design experience for application to a flight prototype design. It also provided test evaluation {{of several of the}} actual components which were {{to be used in the}} flight prototype hardware. Several changes were made in the flight prototype design due to these tests including simpler line routing, relocation of remote operated valves to a position upstream of the expansion valves, and shock mounting of the compressor. The concept of heat rejection control by compressor speed reduction was verified and the <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver,</b> accumulator, remote control valves, oil separator and power source were demonstrated as acceptable.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> metal reflux <b>receivers</b> (LMRRs) {{have been}} {{designed}} to serve as the interface between the solar concentrator dish and the Stirling engine of a dish Stirling power system. Such a receiver has undergone performance testing at Sandia National Laboratory to determine cold- and hot-start characteristics, component temperatures, throughput power, and thermal efficiency, for various times of day and year. Performance modeling will {{play an important role in}} the future commercialization of these systems since it will be necessary to predict overall energy production for potential installation sites based on available meteorological data. As a supplement to numerical thermal modeling, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been investigated for their effectiveness in predicting long-term energy production of a LMRR. Two types of data were used to train ANNs, actual on-sun test data, and ersatz data. ANNs were trained on both the raw on-sun test data and on pre-formatted versions of the data to determine if pre-formatting of the input data would improve network training efficiency and predictive abilities. Usable on-sun test data were available for only a few days of performance testing. Therefore, a set of year-long ersatz data was generated using a transient numerical model driven by one-minute meteorological data from the Solar Energy Meteorological Research and Training Sites (SEMRTS) data base for Davis, CA. The ersatz data were used to train ANNs based on warm-month data, cool-month data, and year-long data to investigate the impact of using seasonal test data on long-term predictive capabilities. The findings indicated that a network trained on data from a limited time span could successfully predict annual energy output of a <b>liquid</b> metal <b>receiver...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractLiquid metals {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{in the past as}} high temperature heat transfer media in concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. Until the mid 80 s test facilities were operated with <b>liquid</b> sodium-cooled central <b>receivers.</b> After a period of reduced interest in that approach, several new efforts have been reported recently, particularly from the US, South Africa and Australia. In addition, several recent publications have highlighted the attractive properties of liquid metals for CSP applications. A new contribution to this topic has been launched by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Solar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), combining their experience in CSP and liquid metal technology. The overall goals of this project are planning, design, construction and operation of a small concentrating solar power system in the 10 kW thermal range (named SOMMER) using liquid metal as heat transfer fluid for re-gaining operation experience and validating design methodology and providing a complete design concept for a large pilot CSP plant based on liquid metal technology, up to evaluation of O&M cost and levelized cost of electricity.

40|$|IHX is probably, one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} alternative used to improve cooling capacity and COP in a CO 2 refrigerating plant working in supercritical conditions. The “classical” position at gas-cooler exit has been analyzed by several authors with positive results. The aim of this work is to compare, from experimental approach, the energetic behavior of a refrigerating plant working with several IHX configurations: gas-cooler exit (classical position), <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> exit, and in both positions at the same time. The energetic behavior includes: cooling capacity, power consumption and COP. Moreover, the discharge temperature reached on each position has been analyzed. From the experimental results, a general improvement in COP and cooling capacity has been observed regardless the position of the IHX. A maximum increment of 13 % on COP has been registered working with two IHX at the same time...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{behavior of}} the new refrigerant R 723, an azeotropic mixture of 60 % Ammonia and 40 % Dimethyl Ether, was investigated for use in adsorption heat pumps and refrigeration systems. The potential use of this refrigerant blend in adsorption systems with components made of copper instead of stainless steel provides with a motive for experimental investigation. In this work the experimental results of an activated carbon – R 723 pair generator are presented when operating with driving temperatures ranging from 100 oC up to 170 oC and condensing temperatures of 20 oC and 35 oC.

40|$|Intercellular {{communication}} {{within an}} organism, between populations, or across species and kingdoms {{forms the basis}} of many ecosystems in which organisms coexist through symbiotic, parasitic, or predator–prey relationships. Using multistep airborne communication and signal transduction, we present synthetic ecosystems within a mammalian cell population, in mice, or across species and kingdoms. Inter- and intrakingdom communication was enabled by using sender cells that produce volatile aldehydes, small vitamin-derived molecules, or antibiotics that diffuse, by gas or <b>liquid</b> phase, to <b>receiver</b> cells and induce the expression of specific target genes. Intercellular and cross-kingdom communication was shown to enable quorum sensing between and among mammalian cells, bacteria, yeast, and plants, resulting in precise spatiotemporal control of IFN-β production.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{an answer to}} the need of finding the optimal {{solution}} for the throttling system in refrigerating machines using CO 2 as working fluid; such a solution must combine reliability, low installation cost and high energy efficiency. To this purpose, different expansion systems are compared by means of a simulation programme, including a new one, operating with a differential valve, a <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> and a thermostatic valve. The typical compression refrigerating cycle performed by CO 2 involves transcritical operations and therefore the upper pressure needs to be adjusted to the optimal value, that, unlike the traditional cycle, is not determined by heat transfer. The innovative system here proposed shows an intrinsic self-adjusting capability that leads to COP values quite close to the maximum ones when a fixed suitable value of the differential pressure is chosen, even if the temperature of the secondary fluid varies to a large extent...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} one component two-phase flow inside horizontal tubes, with bends using refrigerant R 600 a (Isobutane) as the working fluid. Two-phase refrigerant enters the evaporator and exits as a superheated vapour. As vapour quality increases with evaporation, the vapour velocity also increases causing increased interfacial tension forces and the two-phase flow experiences different flow patterns. The phase change flow patterns {{that occur in the}} tubular evaporator, which forms part of a typical refrigeration plant, were observed recorded and discussed here. The evaporator was a 16 -row trombone shaped transparent glass coil with return bends of 180 degrees and was connected to a refrigeration unit consisting of a hermetic compressor, air-cooled condenser, <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver,</b> and finally connected to a hand expansion valve.

40|$|The {{classical}} substances as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) used {{as working}} fluids in the vapour compression plants {{have to be}} replaced by new substances because of their ozone depletion potential and their greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is non-toxic, non-flammable, has zero ozone depletion potential and negligible global warming potential as refrigerant. Referring to a transcritical CO 2 cycle working as a classical ‘‘splitsystem’’ to cool air in residential applications, the aim of this paper is the evaluation of the energy performances using an internal heat exchanger. The experimental plant employs a semi-hermetic compressor, plate-finned tube type heat exchangers, a back pressure valve electronically controlled and an expansion valve. Besides it is possible to control the flash gas produced in the <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> thanks to another semi-hermetic compressor linked to an inverter. An increase of the coefficient of performance has been found using the internal heat exchanger.

40|$|Background: Pheochromocytomas (PHEO) and paragangliomas (PGL) {{are derived}} from paraganglia of the {{sympathetic}} and parasympathetic nervous system. Most of the sympathetic PHEO/PGL secrete either catecholamine or their metabolites, metanephrines, whereas parasympathetic PHEO/PGL are nonsecretory. We assessed the utility of plasma free 3 -methoxytyramine (3 MT), normetanephrine (NM), and metanephrine (MN) for the diagnosis of PHEO/PGL. Materials and Methods: Sixty-five patients referred to endocrine/ENT clinics were enrolled. Twelve patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes were excluded. Remaining 53 patients (39 patients with adrenal, abdominal, cervical and thoracic PHEO/PGL and 14 patients with head and neck PGL (HNPGL) were taken for this study. Sixty-five age- and sex-matched subjects were taken as controls. Plasma levels 3 MT, NM, and MN were measured using high-performance <b>liquid</b> chromatography. <b>Receivers</b> operating characteristics was plotted and cut-off levels were established. Results: When compared with controls, there was a 36 -, 8. 7 - and 9. 5 -fold increase in levels of NM, 3 MT and MN in the patients with PHEO/PGL and 7. 2 - and 2. 7 -fold increase in 3 MT and NM, in the patients with HNPGL, respectively. In malignant PHEO/PGL, there was a 99 -, 16 - and 20 -fold increase and in benign PHEO/PGL, there was 19 -, 6. 8 - and 6. 4 -fold increase in levels of NM, 3 MT, and MN, respectively. NM in combination with MN was high in 97 % of the patients with PHEO/PGL. All three metabolites in combination were high in 83 % of patients with HNPGL. In malignant PHEO/PGL, 50 % subjects had increased levels of both NM and 3 MT. Conclusions: Measurement of plasma-free NM along with 3 MT and MN provides a better tool for the diagnosis of PHEO/PGL as well as HNPGL. Further, NM in combination with 3 MT {{can be used for}} the diagnosis of malignant PHEO/PGL...|$|R
40|$|Three {{concepts}} of direct absorption receivers for {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP) systems are compared. They are characterized by advantages like simple design, high working temperatures and good storage possibilities leading to a potential reduction of the levelized electricity costs. The design of the first concept, the <b>liquid</b> film <b>receiver,</b> {{is based on a}} face-down cylindrical barrel, whose inner surface is cooled by a directly irradiated molten salt film. Detailed investigations regarding film stability and system management strategies reveal increased receiver efficiency by implementing a slow rotation and inclined receiver walls. The second concept resembles the first one, but instead of molten salt small ceramic particles are used as heat transfer medium. The solar radiation is directly absorbed by a falling particle curtain whereas appropriate recirculation strategies of the particles can lead to high receiver efficiencies for all load conditions. While the above described systems are suitable for the 50 to 400 MWth power range the third concept – also a particle receiver – can be applied in decentralized small-scale CSP plants ranging from 100 kWth to 1 MWth as well as in larger systems with up to 200 MWth. Due to centrifugal acceleration the particles are forced against the cylindrical receiver wall where they form a thin layer which is directly heated up by incoming radiation. The particle retention time and with it the mass flow can be adjusted to all load conditions by regulating the rotation speed. Heliostat field layout calculations for different design power levels were carried out comparing the annual performance and levelized cost of heat for a face-down receiver and a receiver with an optimized inclination angle. Only small differences between both concepts could be noticed. However, simplified assumptions regarding thermal receiver losses were made neglecting e. g. convection losses. Thus, in order to give reliable information about the thermal efficiency of the introduced concepts, computational models considering the main heat loss mechanisms are developed. The models are accompanied by experimental validation and support the numerical findings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} control of waste heat {{recovery}} Organic Rankine Cycle systems. A dynamic simulation model of the system was developed under Modelica language. This model associates the sub-models of the different components of the system: the evaporator, a scroll expander, the condenser, the <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> and the pump. Both the speeds of the expander and of the pump are controlled in order to adjust the evaporating pressure and maintain the superheat at the outlet of the evaporator. Two types of controllers were implemented: Proportional Integral (PI) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) controllers. The PI controller on the expander speed is able to adjust the evaporating pressure with a high accuracy. It is also shown that the MPC controller on the pump speed maintains the superheat close to the set point value with a much better performance than the PI controller. Hence, {{the use of a}} MPC controller allows decreasing the set point value on the superheat without any risk of feeding the expansion machine with liquid droplets. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Heat pumps provide cooling in {{summers and}} heating in winters. It is {{inevitable}} that the capacity and COP {{of the heat}} pumps degrade significantly {{in the case of}} high ambient temperatures in summers and low ambient temperatures in winters, when the maximum capacity is desired. Refrigerant vapor-injection technique has been well justified to improve the performance of systems in refrigeration applications, however, it has not received much attention for air conditioning applications, particularly with air-conditioning for hot climates and heat pumps for cold climates. The performance degradation of conventional residential equipment at extreme weather conditions warrants further investigation of the vapor-injection technique. This dissertation is focused on the experimental and theoretical investigations of a two-stage heat pump system with an innovative vapor-injected scroll compressor. Unlike other research, a heat pump system without a <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> has been studied in this research. A 3 -ton R 410 A heat pump equipped with a conventional scroll compressor has been built, and tested to serve as a baseline. The heat pump has been modified to be a two-stage system with the cycle options of flash tank and internal heat exchanger configurations, and been tested under the same ambient conditions to the baseline. Both compressors have the same displacement volume. The operating options of the two-stage system have been compared, and analyzed. The vapor-injection effects on the subcomponents of the system have been addressed. The vapor-injected compressor has been modeled using compressor-mapping method. A simulation model of the two-stage system has been built using VapCyc and CoilDesigner software packages developed by CEEE, and been validated using the experimental data. The model is able to predict the system performance with ± 5 % of deviation to the experimental results for most performance variables. The results show that the vapor-injection technique can effectively increase the system performance. A cooling capacity gain of around 14 % with 4 % COP improvement at ambient 46. 1 °C, about 30 % heating capacity improvement with 20 % COP gain at - 17. 8 °C and about 7 % HSPF improvement in U. S.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis is concerning the theoretical and experimental analysis of heat pumps. In {{the first section}} of this study a design tool for predicting steady-state cooling and heating performance of vapor compression refrigerating machines is developed. In order to achieve correct results, accurate thermodynamic models are implemented to predict heat transfer coefficients, pressure drops and refrigerant mass charge. The software has been firstly developed for charge inventory purpose, and, as a consequence, it also has the capability to predict performance in off-design conditions given a fixed refrigerant charge. Moreover it can be useful for the <b>liquid</b> <b>receiver</b> dimensioning in reversible heat pumps, or for subcooling degree optimization at the condensers. In the present work the methodologies used for the calculation of the performance of each component are presented. The second part of the work is concerning gas absorption heat pumps, working with the refrigerant mixture water-ammonia. A theoretical design procedure is carried out and again verified by means of experimental measurement on a prototype. The last part of the study is concerning the estimation of the possible advantages of combined heating plants including solar collectors, air source heat pump and a condensing boiler. The investigation is carried out in collaboration with the manufacturers of the machines, allowing to have precise information about all the components. Investigations are carried out to compare the proposed systems with a standard solution with a condensing boiler only. Three different locations are considered in the present study. Comparisons are made regarding primary energy consumption, equivalent CO 2 emission, percentage of renewable energy used and possible economical saving.
