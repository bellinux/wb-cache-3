40|$|A {{new design}} for a 64 -electrode cell plate for {{combinatorial}} electrochemical studies of electrodes for Li-ion cells is described. This plate, made using circuit board technology, has advantages over previously used plates made by sputtering electrode pads onto glass. It eliminates spurious capacity from the sputtered <b>lead</b> <b>pattern</b> exposed to electrolyte, it can be easily and economically produced in quantity, and it is more robust. This plate design was tested using a sputtered silicon wedge. With these improved plates, the irreversible capacity if LixSi {{was measured to be}} less than 70 mAh/g or less than 2 % of the reversible capacity. VC 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{discrete}} goal-directed {{movements are}} characterized by a well known coordination pattern between the gaze and the hand displacements. The gaze always starts prior to the hand movement and reaches the target before hand velocity peak. Surprisingly, {{the effect of the}} target size on the temporal gaze-hand coordination has not been directly investigated. Moreover, goal-directed movements are often produced in a reciprocal rather than in a discrete manner. The objectives of this work were to assess the effect of the target size on temporal gaze-hand coordination during fast 1) discrete and 2) reciprocal pointings. Methods Subjects performed fast discrete (experiment 1) and reciprocal (experiment 2) pointings with an amplitude of 50 cm and four target diameters (7. 6, 3. 8, 1. 9 and 0. 95 cm) leading to indexes of difficulty (ID = log 2 [2 A/D]) of 3. 7, 4. 7, 5. 7 and 6. 7 bits. Gaze and hand displacements were synchronously recorded. Temporal gaze-hand coordination parameters were compared between experiments (discrete and reciprocal pointings) and IDs using analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results Data showed that the magnitude of the gaze-hand <b>lead</b> <b>pattern</b> was much higher for discrete than for reciprocal pointings. Moreover, while it was constant for discrete pointings, it decreased systematically with an increasing ID for reciprocal pointings because of the longer duration of gaze anchoring on target. Conclusion Overall, the temporal gaze-hand coordination analysis revealed that even for high IDs, fast reciprocal pointings could not be considered as a concatenation of discrete units. Moreover, our data clearly illustrate the smooth adaptation of temporal gaze-hand coordination to terminal accuracy requirements during fast reciprocal pointings. It will be interesting for further researches to investigate if the methodology used in the experiment 2 allows assessing the effect of sensori-motor deficits on gaze-hand coordination. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leading</b> <b>patterns</b> of {{observed}} monthly extreme rainfall {{variability in}} Australia are examined using an empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT) method. Extreme rainfall variability is {{more closely related}} to mean rainfall variability during austral summer than in winter. The leading EOT patterns of extreme rainfall explain less variance in Australia-wide extreme rainfall than is the case for mean rainfall EOTs. The authors illustrate that, as with mean rainfall, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has the strongest association with warm-season extreme rainfall variability, while in the cool season the primary drivers are atmospheric blocking and the subtropical ridge. The Indian Ocean dipole and southern annular mode also have significant relationships with patterns of variability during austral winter and spring. <b>Leading</b> <b>patterns</b> of summer extreme rainfall variability have predictability several months ahead from Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and as much as a year in advance from Indian Ocean SSTs. Predictability from the Pacific is greater for wetter-than-average summer months than for months that are drier than average, whereas for the Indian Ocean the relationship has greater linearity. Several cool-season EOTs are associated with midlatitude synoptic-scale patterns along the south and east coasts. These patterns have common atmospheric signatures denoting moist onshore flow and strong cyclonic anomalies often to the north of a blocking anticyclone. Tropical cyclone activity is observed to have significant rela tionships with some warm-season EOTs. This analysis shows that extreme rainfall variability in Australia can be related to remote drivers and local synoptic-scale patterns throughout the year. © 2014 American Meteorological Society...|$|R
40|$|In Flint; MI; USA; {{a public}} health crisis {{resulted}} from the switching of the water supply from Lake Huron to a more corrosive source from the Flint River in April 2014; which caused lead to leach from water lines. Between 2010 and 2015; Flint area children&# 039;s average blood lead patterns display consistent peaks {{in the third quarter}} of the year. The third quarter blood lead peaks displayed a declining trend between 2010 and 2013; then rose abruptly between the third quarters of 2013 from 3. 6 % blood lead levels ≥ 5 µg/dL to a peak of about 7 % {{in the third quarter of}} 2014; an increase of approximately 50 %. The percentage of blood lead level ≥ 5 µg/dL in the first quarter of 2015 then dropped to 2. 3 %; which was the same percentage as the first quarter of 2014 (prior to the Flint River water source change). The Flint quarterly blood lead level peak then rose to about 6 % blood lead levels ≥ 5 µg/dL in the third quarter of 2015; and then declined to about 2. 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2015. Soil lead data collected by Edible Flint food collaborative reveal generally higher soil lead values in the metropolitan center for Flint; with lower values in the outskirts of the city. The questions that are not being asked is why did children&# 039;s blood lead levels display a seasonal blood <b>lead</b> <b>pattern</b> before the introduction of the new water supply in Flint; and what are the implications of these seasonal blood lead patterns? Based upon previous findings in Detroit and other North American cities we infer that resuspension to the air of lead in the form of dust from lead contaminated soils in Flint appears to be a persistent contribution to lead exposure of Flint children even before the change in the water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River...|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we report}} {{the results on}} the {{fabrication}} and performance of dozens of Pd nano-submicron-stripe thin-film temperature sensors. By using a better fabrication procedure, we have squeezed the total width of the smallest dual-beam sensors down to 430  nm, {{less than half of}} the previous record [20]. Calibrated with two different methods, these sensors showed repeated sensitivity, which depended mainly on the width configuration of the two stripes and was consistent with previous results [20]. We also demonstrated that these sensors could be made into practical testing devices as built-in sensors by using a combined fabrication technique, where the submicron sensors made with e-beam lithography could be overlapped on large <b>lead</b> <b>patterns</b> made with photolithography technique. In such a hybrid device, these sensors remained a stable and repeatable sensitivity for sensing a weak surface temperature difference of 0.1 – 0.2  K over a local area of 10 – 100 -μm scale.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of the ENFSI Expert Working Group Firearms/GSR a novel proficiency test on the Forensic Determination of Shooting Distances – FDSD 2015 – was implemented. This proficiency test was developed out of collaborative studies which were previously carried out by a number of pre-selected ENFSI laboratories. The aim of this test was to assess the laboratories’ performance in visualizing the <b>lead</b> <b>patterns</b> on a shot object, and compare the questioned patterns with provided test shot patterns. The participating laboratories were requested to estimate the presumed shooting distance following their individual laboratory specific methods (SOPs) for shooting distance/muzzle-to-target determination. The submitted results were compiled by means of z scores according to the IUPAC and EURACHEM guidelines, and an extended statistical evaluation was performed. This {{is one of the first}} proficiency tests in the field of qualitative forensic methods where z scores were successfully utilized.

When a racehorse {{begins to}} gallop, it must use either the right <b>lead</b> stride <b>pattern</b> (RLSP) or the left <b>lead</b> stride <b>pattern</b> (LLSP). When racehorses make a trot-to-gallop transition, 91 % start with their RLSP and 9 % start with their LLSP (n= 209). When breaking {{from the gate}}, 90 % of all racehorses use their RLSP and 10 % use their LLSP (n= 9, 116). When individual horses were observed breaking from the gate in five to seven races, they used the same lead 94 % of the time (n= 32). When {{a mirror image of}} the hoofprints from a RLSP was superimposed on the hoofprints of a LLSP for the same racehorse, the placement of the hoofprints was not identical. This suggests that running efficiency might be different in the RLSP and the LLSP. The preference of stride patterns, along with a potential differences in efficiency, could have important consequences for racehorse performance...|$|R
