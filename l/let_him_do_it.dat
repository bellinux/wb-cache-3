25|$|Alfie throws Kat {{out of the}} pub and Derek persuades her to go {{home with}} him, believing they can stay a couple but she insists she loves Alfie. Kat discovers that Derek has saved all her {{messages}} and is determined to play Alfie the last voicemail she left, in which she told Derek to leave her alone. Derek persuades her to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but he plays a different message and claims Kat has been pursuing him. Alfie punches Derek and gives him his wedding ring. Derek then tells Kat that Alfie is not interested and hands her the ring. On Christmas Day, Alfie tells Kat that he has moved on from her. Kat attends a Branning family dinner with Derek. She discovers Derek played Alfie the wrong message and has now deleted them all, so slaps him. Derek has a huge argument with Max and Jack and they force {{him out of the house}} with the help of Derek's son Joey Branning (David Witts), while Kat watches on. He then suffers a heart attack on the street as everyone walks away, and dies. Kat and Alfie eventually divorce but reunite when his new wife, Roxy, realises he still loves Kat.|$|E
500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I {{think it might be}} barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
2500|$|Giving {{responsibility}} to the Scouts is a keystone of the Scout method: [...] "Expect him {{to carry out his}} charge faithfully. Don't keep prying to see how he does. <b>Let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> his own way. Let him come a howler over it if need be, but in any case leave him alone." [...] The Patrol is almost independent, while the Troop is run by the Patrol Leaders in the Patrols' Leaders Council and Court of Honour.|$|E

If it pleases him to surrender her who, I take it, is a witch or a cunning worker of tricks, to her betrothed and her kindred, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> so. <b>It</b> {{is not for}} Pharaoh to judge of the fate of private slaves." ...|$|R

2500|$|After Limp Bizkit {{finished}} a tour {{with the band}} Deftones, Durst and DJ Lethal were asked by Max Cavalera, formerly of the band Sepultura, to appear on [...] "Bleed", a song from the self-titled debut of his new band Soulfly. Cavalera stated that producer Ross Robinson recommended that he work with Durst. Durst also made an appearance on Korn's album Follow the Leader. Jonathan Davis had intended to write a battle rap with B-Real of Cypress Hill, but the latter's label wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and Durst was tapped instead. Davis and Durst wrote the lyrics for [...] "All in the Family", which featured the two vocalists trading insults. Davis and Durst would often offer suggestions for each other's lyrics; a lyric written by Durst as [...] "tootin' on your bagpipe" [...] was changed to [...] "fagpipes" [...] by Davis, who stated [...] "I helped him bag on me better".|$|E
2500|$|Lisa makes {{friends with}} Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) and moves in with Mark Fowler (Todd Carty). Although Mark has {{feelings}} for her, Lisa does not notice, having a fling with Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman) and {{a relationship with}} Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), resulting in Lisa's pregnancy. Phil asks her {{to have an abortion}} but she refuses so he asks her to move in after coming round to the idea but she miscarries and blames Phil. Lisa loses her job when Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) reports her for being absent, so she become dependent on Phil. He is happy with the situation but she loses her confidence and becomes jealous of Phil's former wife, Kathy Mitchell (Gillian Taylforth) and son Ben Mitchell (Morgan Whittle), hiding letters and a video from them. This irritates Phil and he has sex with Melanie when she is upset, following a fight with Lisa on Christmas Day. Regretting this, Melanie agrees not to tell Lisa but does when Lisa says she intends to get pregnant again. Devastated, Lisa ends her relationship with Phil and moves in with Mark but she is already pregnant. She keeps this secret as Phil keeps belittling her, and on Melanie and Steve Owen's (Martin Kemp) wedding night, Phil says that he never loved her and suggests Melanie give her tips in the bedroom. In revenge, Lisa steals a gun from the e20 nightclub and shoots Phil. He survives and confronts her after leaving hospital but realises that he drove her to it and frames his enemy Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) instead. Wanting to keep Phil away from her child, Lisa and Mark marry, claiming that he is the baby's father. Everyone believes it and their romance becomes real. Lisa gives birth to baby Louise, and Lisa tells Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), that Phil is Louise's father. Sharon, however, tells Phil that Louise is his daughter and he forces them to accept he will be part of Louise's life. Despite initial animosity, when Lisa sees Phil with Louise, old feelings resurface and they eventually reconcile. However, Phil wants Louise, not Lisa, and when she realises, she and Louise emigrate to Portugal. Phil finds her and brings Louise home after blackmailing Lisa about shooting him and making her think she is unstable and an unfit mother. [...] Phil leaves her standing {{on the edge of a}} cliff, and she is presumed dead. On Phil's wedding day to Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny), Lisa returns to reclaim her daughter. He is difficult, leading her to plan to shoot him again but Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) persuades her to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He and his son, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), frame Phil for armed robbery and Lisa reclaims custody when he is imprisoned. She leaves the Square with Louise.|$|E

Yes, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or die by the girl, he and those with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{never mind}} me," [...] he said earnestly. [...] "I am all right, Miss Hannay; I never {{expected}} anything, you know, so I am not disappointed, {{and it has}} been awfully good of you talking to me as you have, and not getting mad with me for interfering. But I can hear them coming down from the terrace, and I must be off. I am on duty there, you know, now. Bathurst has undertaken double work in that hole. I didn't like it, really; it seemed mean to be getting out of the work and <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all, but he said that he liked work, and I really think he does. I am sure he is always worrying himself because he can't take his share in the firing on the roof; and when he is working he hasn't time to think about it. When he told me that in future he would drive the tunnel our shift himself, he said, 'That will enable you to take your place on the roof, Wilson, and you must remember you are firing for both of us, so don't throw away a shot.' It is awfully rough on him, isn't it? Well, goodby, Miss Hannay," [...] and Wilson hurried off to the roof.|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can <b>do</b> something about <b>it.</b> [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Bulletproof" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. One author of Pitchfork Media called it [...] "a catchy-as-hell electro-pop smash", and another, Joshua Love, {{called it the}} best song on La Roux. Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine gave the song five stars and described it as [...] "a bright, bouncy slice of Yazoo-ish electropop with a chorus every bit as immediate as 'In For The Kill'", adding that [...] "Jackson's vocals are less shrill this time around, but she comes off just as formidable, informing a useless sod who's messed her about that she won't be <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog, who also awarded the song five stars, stated that [...] "the one sentence that crops up most often goes something like this: [...] "...yes, 'Bulletproof' is brilliant, but...", hinting {{that this might be}} a song which possesses magical powers of persuasion." [...] He went on to give five points on why the song is good: marvellous verses, marvellous chorus, the music serves the song brilliantly, less shrill to the singing, and the vocoder breakdown. Adam R. Holz of Plugged In opined [...] "Homage isn't a strong enough word to capture just how uncannily La Roux has repackaged the that vibe of yore popularized by the likes of Erasure, The Human League, Depeche Mode and Eurythmics." ...|$|R

50|$|Eventually, {{the witch}} sadly informs Lynette that Lucius is dying. Lynette is {{completely}} horrified, and decides {{that she will}} seek out the Holy Grail, so that Lucius {{can use it to}} save himself. She sets out with her traveling companions from before, and after a very long and decidedly strange journey, she actually manages to retrieve the Grail. She hurries back with it to Lucius, resolving that she will <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> with <b>it</b> as he pleases. Upon receiving the Grail, Lucius wishes for sight rather than life, so that he can finally see Lynette. Upon opening his eyes, he cries out with delight, telling the startled (and heartbroken) Lynette that she's beautiful over and over.|$|R

It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says: ...|$|R

It {{means that a}} decent, self-respecting chap has got to listen to himself saying things which, if spoken on the silver screen, would cause him to dash to the box-office and demand his money back. <b>Let</b> <b>him</b> attempt to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on orange juice, and what ensues?

60|$|In the advertised 'Blackwood,' {{do you see}} {{an article}} called 'Poetic Aberration'? It came into my head {{that it might be}} a stone thrown at me, and Robert went to Monaldini's to glance at it. Sure enough it is a stone. He says a violent attack. And <b>let</b> me <b>do</b> <b>him</b> justice. <b>It</b> was only the {{misstatement}} in the 'Athenæum' which overset him, only the first fire which made him wink. Now he turns a hero's face to all this cannonading. He doesn't care a straw, he says, and what's more, he doesn't, really. So I, who was only sorry for him, can't care. Observe, Isa, if there had been less violence and more generosity, the poems would obviously have been less deserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor {{would you}} take it.

If he wants it, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> earn <b>it</b> honestly. <b>Let</b> <b>him</b> <b>do</b> something for <b>it,</b> so {{that the man who}} pays it to him may get its value. But to think that it may be got by gambling, to hope to live after that fashion, to sit down with your fingers almost in your neighbour's pockets, with your eye on his purse, trusting that you may know better than he some studied calculations as to the pips concealed in your hands, praying to the only god you worship that some special card may be vouchsafed to you,--that I say is to have left far, far behind you, all nobility, all gentleness, all manhood!

50|$|Meanwhile, Max meets up {{with his}} old friend Jill (Tara Shelley) to egg the sheriff's house. However, the eggs were {{actually}} hard-boiled and break right through the window. While everyone else runs off, Max stays, knowing he deserves to be punished. The sheriff tells him about a high school prank gone wrong, resulting in the entire school burning down. His father tried {{to send him to}} a military academy, but he ran away to go on an amateur music tour. When he got back, he wanted to tell his father that he had learned that he was acting in his son's best interest, but his father had died. He ends the story by letting Max off the hook after telling him that, though his parents have <b>let</b> <b>him</b> down, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not mean that they <b>do</b> not love <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{the affair}} {{did not end}} so; the next day came {{a great number of}} the country people to the town gates, and in a most {{outrageous}} manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their priests and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertsinkay were at first in a great consternation, for they said the Tartars were already no less than thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them, assuring them that he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison been abroad, so that it could not be from anybody there: but if they could <b>let</b> <b>him</b> know who <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> they should be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily, that all the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image but some Christian miscreant; and they therefore resolved to denounce war against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.|$|R
60|$|Well; {{after his}} astonishment {{was a little}} over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but staid some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good way off from {{the place where she}} fell; however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I had {{perceived}} his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not <b>let</b> <b>him</b> see me <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> that I might he ready for any other mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time; so I brought home the kid; and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could, and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth; after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own month, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt; but <b>it</b> would not <b>do,</b> he would never care for salt with meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a very little.|$|R
