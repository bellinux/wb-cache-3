40|$|ABSTRACT The methods {{developed}} for determination of <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> (LR) {{are based on}} widely accepted principles. However, the formulas used for calculation have evolved little over recent decades, {{and in some cases}} there are indications of their inadequacy. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> calculated by three classic formulas and three algorithms, defining those most appropriate for supplying Ca and Mg to coffee plants and the smaller possibility of causing overliming. The database used contained 600 soil samples, which were collected in coffee plantings. The LR was estimated by the methods of base saturation, neutralization of Al 3 +, and elevation of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + contents (two formulas) and by the three calculation algorithms. Averages of the <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> were compared, determining the frequency distribution of the 600 <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> (LR) estimated through each calculation method. In soils with low cation exchange capacity at pH 7, the base saturation method may fail to adequately supply the plants with Ca and Mg in many situations, while the method of Al 3 + neutralization and elevation of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + contents can result in the calculation of application rates that will increase the pH above the suitable range. Among the methods studied for calculating <b>lime</b> <b>requirements,</b> the algorithm that predicts reaching a defined base saturation, with adequate Ca and Mg supply and the maximum application rate limited to the H+Al value, proved to be the most efficient calculation method, and it can be recommended for use in numerous crops conditions...|$|R

Additional benefits of pond classification are discussed. Functional relationships pertaining to a particular management practice [...] the application of lime [...] are examined for seven classes of acid soils.

The study determined soil P sorption, <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> {{and the effects of}} lime on soil pH, Al levels and available P on the main maize growing acids soils in the highlands east and west of Rift Valley (RV), Kenya. Burnt lime containing 21 % calcium oxide was used. The soils were strongly to extremely acid (pH 4. 85 - 4. 07), had high exchangeable Al 3 + (> 2 cmol Al kg - 1) and Al saturation (> 20 % Al), which most maize germplasm grown in Kenya are sensitive to. The base cations, cation exchange capacity and available P (- 1 bicarbonate extractable P) were low, except at one site in the highlands east of RV indicative with history of high fertilizer applications. Highlands east of RV soils had higher P sorption (343 - 402 mg P kg - 1) than the west (107 - 258 mg P kg - 1), probably because of their high Al 3 + ions and also the energies of bonding between the soil colloids and phosphate ions.

40|$|Surface {{coal mining}} and hard rock mining {{operations}} often expose iron sulfide minerals (e. g. pyritic sulfur) and organic sulfur containing substances {{to a new}} oxidizing environment. Acid generation from the oxidation of these materials often inhibits the revegetation of mine spoils.

Traditional agricultural lime rate determination methods are not appropriate for mined land situations {{where the majority of}} acid production is from the weathering of relatively insoluble minerals such as pyrite. Because of this limitation, acid-base accounting has become the standard in the reclamation industry for the estimation of lime requirements for acid mine spoils.

40|$|Successful variable-rate {{applications}} of agricultural inputs such as lime {{rely on the}} quality of input data. Systematic grid soil sampling is the most common method used for creating variable rate prescription maps. The insufficient number of point measurements usually obtained using this method has been primarily responsible for the typical inaccuracies seen in lime prescription maps. To increase sampling density, on-the-go sensing technology was developed for the mapping of soil pH and other relevant attributes. In this study, five fields in eastern Nebraska were mapped using both on-thego sensing technology and systematic grid sampling. Ten calibration points per field were selected to relate sensor data and laboratory test results (soil pH and buffer pH). Also, at least nine validation points per field were used to compare soil pH, buffer pH, and <b>lime</b> <b>requirement</b> estimates predicted using different mapping strategies and those derived from the laboratory measurements. The data collected were used to compare three soil acidity management scenarios: 1) uniform rate liming; 2) variable rate liming based on systematic grid sampling, and 3) variable rate liming prescribed using sensor-based mapping. In general, sensor-based maps were better predictors of soil pH, buffer pH, and <b>lime</b> <b>requirement</b> than field average or grid-based maps.

Experience has shown that soils across Nebraska differ greatly in their capacity to supply these elements. The amount of each element supplied by a soil depends on several factors. Two important ones are: (1) the type of material from which the soil was formed, and (2) the treatment the soil has received since being placed under cultivation.

There is also little information on how deep lime reacts in pond sediment over time, and whether the depth of reaction is different when liming materials are applied to the water or to the soil. Therefore, three techniques for treating fish ponds with agricultural limestone were evaluated in ponds with clayey soils at a commercial fish farm. Amounts of agricultural limestone equal to the <b>lime</b> <b>requirement</b> of bottom soils were applied to each of three ponds by: direct application over the pond water surface; spread uniformly over the bottom of the empty pond; spread uniformly over the bottom of the empty pond followed by tilling of the bottom.

Agricultural limestone also reacted quickly to increase total alkalinity and total hardness of pond water to acceptable concentrations within 2 weeks after application. The reaction of lime to increase soil pH was essentially complete after one to two months, and lime had no effect below a soil depth of 8 cm.

This applied to species studied in the 2 main sub-families in the Proteaceae while similar findings were indicated for other Australian genera. A range of optimum N requirements in the Proteaceae was found – lowest needs for Protea which also had the greatest tolerance of very low fertiliser additions, compared to Grevillea robusta with much higher N requirements and strong foliage growth inhibition if nutrient levels are very low. Proteoid root growth on Grevillea rosmarinifolia only occurred at low nutrient levels and was not required for satisfactory foliage growth of container grown plants. Pot plants and seedlings, especially tomato, responded strongly to N and often there were positive NK interactions influencing foliage growth. <b>Lime</b> <b>requirements</b> were studied and in erica increasing lime rates depressed foliage growth. Comparative nutrition studies indicate that general or broad spectrum container media may be unsuitable for some groups of nursery plants and that they could be replaced by potting mixes designed to meet the widely differing needs of the species often grown. The number of specialist mixes would depend on the range of plants and be governed by management considerations...|$|R
40|$|Soil pH {{is a key}} {{parameter}} for crop productivity, therefore, its spatial variation {{should be}} adequately addressed to improve precision management decisions. Recently, the Veris pH ManagerTM, a sensor for high-resolution mapping of soil pH at the field scale, has been made commercially available in the US. While driving over the field, soil pH is measured on-the-go directly within the soil by ion selective antimony electrodes. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the Veris pH ManagerTM under farming conditions in Germany. Sensor readings were compared with data obtained by standard protocols of soil pH assessment. Experiments took place under different scenarios: (a) controlled tests in the lab, (b) semicontrolled test on transects in a stop-and-go mode, and (c) tests under practical conditions in the field with the sensor working in its typical on-the-go mode. Accuracy issues, problems, options, and potential benefits of the Veris pH ManagerTM were addressed. The tests demonstrated a high degree of linearity between standard laboratory values and sensor readings. Under practical conditions in the field (scenario c), the measure of fit (r 2) for the regression between the on-the-go measurements and the reference data was 0. 71, 0. 63, and 0. 84, respectively. Field-specific calibration was necessary to reduce systematic errors. Accuracy of the on-the-go maps was considerably higher compared with the pH maps obtained by following the standard protocols, and the error in calculating <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> was reduced by about one half. However, the system showed some weaknesses due to blockage by residual straw and weed roots. If these problems were solved, the on-the-go sensor investigated here could be an efficient alternative to standard sampling protocols as a basis for liming in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{resources}} are spent on counteracting {{the effects of}} acidification, mainly by liming. Due to lower S and N deposition in Europe and North America, authorities are changing directives and strategies for remediation and reducing liming. However, as the acid-base buffer capacity differs in different water bodies, the desirable reduction of the lime dose is variable. In this study, a geochemical model is used to predict pH and inorganic monomeric Al (Ali) when liming is reduced and finally terminated in the 3000 Swedish lakes currently treated with lime. To estimate Ca and Mg concentrations not affected by liming {{for use in the}} model, the Ca/Mg ratio in nearby unlimed reference lakes was used. For the modelling of pH and inorganic Al the Visual MINTEQ program including the Stockholm Humic Model recently calibrated for Swedish fresh water was used. The predictions were validated with modelling results from six monitored lakes, in which liming had been terminated. The use of geochemical modelling appeared to be a promising tool for the calculation of accurate <b>lime</b> <b>requirements</b> in acid waters. For simulations in which liming was completely terminated, the pH value decreased by, on average, 1 pH unit to pH 5. 7, whereas Ali increased by 17 mu g L (1) to 32 mu g L (1). If liming was reduced by half, the pH would drop only 0. 3 pH units and Ali would increase by 2 mu g L (1). Lakes in the south-western part of Sweden were predicted to reach a lower pH and higher Ali, which would be expected due to their greater historical S deposition. The results indicate that liming can be terminated in certain areas and in other areas be reduced without increases in the lake acidity. QC 20130823 </p...|$|R
