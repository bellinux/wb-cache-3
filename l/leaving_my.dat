Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in <b>leaving</b> <b>my</b> friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] {{suggests}} celebrities {{involved in}} sexual scandals {{should not be}} forced to undergo rehabilitation and public acts of contrition. The scene in which the celebrities start shaking and dancing, proclaiming [...] "Look, the sex addiction is <b>leaving</b> <b>my</b> body!", demonstrates the insincerity and ridiculousness of these public steps. The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States. This is particularly prevalent when Kenny, Kyle and Butters are misdiagnosed with sexual addiction based on an inaccurate test of simply presenting an image of a naked woman to them and testing whether they could identify a handkerchief in the woman's hand and specify its color. The rehabilitation courses themselves are also mocked as ineffective and unnecessary, particularly because the most important lesson taught in them is how to avoid getting caught.|$|E

500|$|Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku {{said that}} the game's low {{barriers}} to entry and similarity to Agar.io explained Slither.io popularity. She noted the game's fast pace. Boing Boing compared the game's core mechanic {{to that of the}} 2009 game Osmos. Brandt Ran, writing for Business Insider, said that [...] "despite running into some technical hiccups—the game can lag heavily at times—I doubt Slither.io will be <b>leaving</b> <b>my</b> home screen anytime soon." [...] Harry Slater, writing for Pocket Gamer, defined the game as [...] "interesting"; the gameplay as a [...] "compulsive experience"; and the structure as simple and similar to Agar.io, although it did not have a large replay value. TechCrunch Felicia Williams praised the designs, getting [...] "pleasantly surprised" [...] with the variety of skins for customization. Lian Amaris of Gamezebo found the game to be [...] "far more interesting than Agar.io" [...] because it involved [...] "an ever-growing languid body rather than just a flat circle," [...] and praised [...] "the dark environment with neon worms," [...] which gave the game a [...] "retro arcade feel." [...] Amaris also compared the concept of Slither.io to that of Agar.io and stated that Slither.io was reminiscent of the classic arcade game Snake.|$|E
500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with <b>leaving.</b> <b>My</b> hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E

500|$|Maryland {{started the}} 2010 season against Navy, which {{intentionally}} kicked {{away from the}} elusive return man. In the home opener against , Smith scored on a 24-yard pass from backup quarterback Danny O'Brien and a five-yard pass from starter Jamarr Robinson. Smith scored two touchdowns of 60and 80yards in Maryland's failed comeback attempt at 21st-ranked West Virginia, 31–17. After the West Virginia game, Sports Illustrated considered Smith a rising prospect for the 2011 NFL Draft and described him as [...] "a true vertical threat who has NFL size and home-run hitting speed." [...] Redshirt freshman Danny O'Brien secured the starting quarterback position after Jamarr Robinson suffered a shoulder injury, and the rookie soon [...] "found great chemistry" [...] with Smith. Against Florida International, Smith made eight receptions for 159yards, including a 68-yard touchdown catch and a 32-yard catch that set up another score. He limped off of the field after his touchdown catch, but later said, [...] "I was fine. I was Jim Brown-ing." [...] The following week, he was limited in practice, but started against Duke and caught a 44-yard reception during a first-half scoring drive. However, the lingering ankle ailment continued to bother Smith, and head coach Ralph Friedgen considered using punt returner Tony Logan for kickoff returns until he fully healed. Smith had four receptions for 55yards in the 31–7 loss to Clemson, but was hindered by his sore ankle which {{kept him out of}} practice. Smith said, [...] "I don't like sitting out [...] I feel like I'm <b>leaving</b> <b>my</b> teammates out to dry. I didn't battle with them all week." [...] After the game, Friedgen said in the future he would sit players who could not practice by the Thursday before a game.|$|E

2500|$|These {{actions were}} deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became {{inflamed}} against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks {{that they were}} willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the Punic Wars, said to his companions: [...] "What a wrestling ground we are <b>leaving,</b> <b>my</b> friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans." ...|$|E
