5|$|Much of our {{information}} about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th-century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 – c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's trumpeters at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal of My <b>Life</b> <b>inside</b> the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, {{on the state of}} the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.|$|E

In spite of the raid's failure, the resulting publicity surrounding Boyce's trial brought considerable recruits and funding for the organisation.

25|$|Hu's {{position}} as Party general secretary {{was taken by}} Zhao Ziyang, who continued many of Hu's economic and political reforms.

A week later, the day before Hu's funeral, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, leading to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Following the government's suppression of the 1989 protests, the Chinese government censored the details of Hu's <b>life</b> <b>inside</b> mainland China, but it officially rehabilitated his image and lifted its censorship restrictions on the 90th anniversary of Hu's birth, in 2005.|$|E

Tánh then went in and blew himself up. Following Tánh's death, one of his generals, Ngô Tòng Châu, drank poisoned wine and another, Nguyễn Tấn Huyên, self-immolated. Afterwards, the citadel defenders surrendered to the Tây Sơn and Trần Quang Diệu spared all the Nguyễn captives. Moreover, Dieu ordered his men to build a tomb for Võ Tánh and his generals.|$|E

25|$|Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald {{stated that}} the basic problem is that through {{intensive}} studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones. Given the multi-trillion-dollar expense {{of some of the}} proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), {{they will not be able}} to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's <b>life</b> <b>inside</b> a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.|$|E
25|$|The Colditz Story (Hodder & Stoughton, 1952) was Reid's {{memoir of}} his time in Colditz, which later became the basis for the 1955 film The Colditz Story, {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton, with John Mills playing Reid. Although focusing mainly upon <b>life</b> <b>inside</b> Colditz and the development of an 'escape academy', the final chapters of the book are devoted to Reid's own escape. The book chronicles everyday prison life, in which characters such as Douglas Bader and Airey Neave appear with no special mention, reporting events in an anecdotal and almost comical style. On 14 October 1942 Reid, along three other British officers, escaped and made their way to neutral Switzerland. What Reid does not mention in his book is that he escaped using Hans Larive's Singen route. Larive, a Dutch naval lieutenant, attempted his first escape from Oflag VI-A in Soest in 1940, but was caught at the Swiss border. The interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border. Larive memorized the information, and many prisoners later escaped using this route.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, HarperCollins {{publishers}} {{confirmed that}} Elissa Wall {{was writing a}} [...] "tell-all" [...] memoir that {{was scheduled to be}} released in April of that year.

The book provided the background for Wall's <b>life</b> <b>inside</b> of the FLDS and focused on her marriage to Allen Steed, whom she portrayed as [...] "boorish and odd". She further discussed her opinions on polygamy and the difficulties it caused in her early childhood.|$|E

[...] Interiors are painted and designed to demarcate the differences between home, school, and the workplace. In designing the prison's interiors, the architects tried to separate the internal buildings to have prisoners walking, to strengthen their bond with the outside world. The hallways are tiled with Moroccan tiles or have large-scale photographs, such as daffodils or Parisian streets.|$|E
