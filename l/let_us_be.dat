500|$|In 1976 a {{friendly}} at Aston Villa was abandoned owing to hooliganism. This included Rangers fans attacking a pub {{that had been}} bombed by the IRA three years prior, which drew particular criticism from the Orange Order in newspapers. The Orange Order stated [...] "How many of us saw the cruel irony in {{the fate of the}} Tavern on the Town public house – the one bombed three years ago by the IRA – smashed and devastated by the crazed minds who sang Orange songs. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>be</b> perfectly blunt. The same examples of low animal life who force their support on Glasgow Rangers {{are one and the same}} with the foul-mouthed drunks who cause us great embarrassment every July when they turn up to 'support' our annual rallies". In response, the Rangers manager Willie Waddell declared an intent to change the media perception of Rangers being a sectarian club. While he denied the existence of the signing policy, he stated that [...] "no religious barriers will be put up at this club regarding signing of players" [...] and pledged to remove supporters from Ibrox Stadium who did not accept it. Despite this, no Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it.|$|E
500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>be</b> honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E
