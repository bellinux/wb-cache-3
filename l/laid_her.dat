5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of the}} wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
5|$|U-28s second war patrol {{took place}} from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was {{instructed}} to lay a minefield near {{the port city of}} Swansea. En route to Bristol, U-28 sank two ships; the 5,000ton Dutch tanker MV Sliedrecht and the 5,100ton British freighter SS Royston Grange. U-28 then <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600ton British freighter SS Protesilaus 60 days after it was laid.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces into {{the lobby of the}} library to lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of Bel Air Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> head on it. After the family left, the doors of the presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E

25|$|The {{civilian}} merchant freighter Bungaree was requisitioned by the RAN in October 1940, and {{was commissioned}} into the RAN on 9 June 1941 after being {{converted into a}} minelayer. Following her conversion, HMAS Bungaree had a capacity of 423 naval mines. She was later modified to carry 467 mines. Bungaree <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> first minefield off Port Moresby in August 1941 and, as Australia's only minelayer, laid over 10,000 mines in defensive minefields in Australian and New Zealand waters during World War II. Bungaree was present in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack on 31 May 1942. As the Allies moved onto the offensive the need for defensive minefields lessened, with Bungaree re-tasked as a survey ship from January 1944 and a store ship from August 1944.|$|E

25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks. He also {{saw one of the}} accused (Avinash Treebhoowoon) on two occasions within a number of minutes the day his wife died. McAreavey said that he had gone back to the hotel room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room to eat with their cups of tea. He found her unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E
25|$|Polygyny {{in birds}} occurs {{infrequently}} {{when compared to}} mammals, as monogamy is most commonly observed. Evolutionarily speaking, polygyny in birds might have evolved because many females do not require male support {{to care for their}} offspring. Because females do not need extra help raising their nests, males can afford to invest in multiple females. Nonetheless, male parental care is often found in many polygynous territorial bird species, leading to female competition for male assistance. Most often, males will seek a second female to impregnate, once the first female has <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> eggs. Strongly polygynous or monogamous species display increased female-female aggression. Many factors affect female aggression including predator density, habitat quality, nest spacing, and territory size. Oftentimes females will fight for resources from the male, such as food and nest protection. The female disadvantages of mating with an already-mated male bird can be overcome with ample resources provided by the male, resulting in female choice.|$|E
25|$|Mediator sailed for Barbados {{towards the}} end of the 1785 {{hurricane}} season, but was becalmed off La Désirade for a night. The following day she was struck by a sudden squall that <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> on her beam ends. Further damage occurred when A terrible crash took part in the fore part of the ship, accompanied by a tremendous explosion and stench of sulphur, deep groans followed, - sixteen men upon the main deck were knocked down, some were apparently dead and others groaning; relief was instantly afforded, and in about four hours after all were apparently well again. A lightning ball had struck the fore topmast, passed into the pigsty, and through the galley into the waist, where it burst and overthrew seventeen men; eleven pigs in the sty before the mast were killed, belonging to the Captain; the silver buckles in the shoes of the gunner were melted into wire, and himself was knocked out of the roundhouse forward. Despite the dramatic nature of the lightning strike, no one was killed, except for the pigs, which Collingwood gave to the crew as a reward for their work in repairing the foremast. Collingwood took Mediator back to English Harbour to be careened in early 1786, and then returned to England to be paid off in August 1786.|$|E

500|$|When World War I began, Bayan was {{assigned}} to the First Cruiser Brigade. Shortly after the start of the war, in December 1914 Bayan was modified to carry up to 110 mines. She <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> first mines in early December when she was {{one of a group of}} ships that mined the northern and western entrances to the Gulf of Danzig. The following month, she provided cover as other cruisers laid minefields in the western Baltic Sea, near Bornholm and Rügen Islands on the night of 12 January 1915. Together with her sister [...] and two protected cruisers, she fought a brief and inconclusive action with the light cruiser [...] during the night of 6/7 May while covering a minelaying sortie off Libau.|$|E
500|$|After Nancy Reagan {{accepted}} the flag, {{she approached the}} casket and spent several minutes patting and stroking it.

[...] While she cried, she kissed the casket and said [...] "I love you". Her children surrounded her, and attempted to console her. Nancy then walked away with her military escort, clutching the folded flag. The military band began to play the Victorian hymn [...] "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" [...] as the Reagan children said their goodbyes. Funeral attendees had an opportunity to file past the coffin.|$|E

I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly."
