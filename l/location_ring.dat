40|$|The {{discovery}} that the centaur (10199) Chariklo possesses a ring system opens {{questions about their}} origin. We here asses the plausibility of different scenarios for {{the origin of the}} observed ring system. We first consider the possibility that the material of the ring originated in the disruption of a satellite that had reached a critical distance from the centaur. We discuss the conditions for the putative satellite to approach the centaur as a consequence of tidal interaction. A three-body encounter is also considered as a transport mechanism. In addition, we study the case in which the ring is formed by the ejecta of a cratering collision on the centaur and we constrain the collision parameters {{and the size of the}} resulting crater of the event. Finally, we consider that the ring material originates from a catastrophic collision between a background object and a satellite located at a distance corresponding to the the current <b>location</b> of the <b>ring.</b> We compute the typical timescales for these scenarios. We estimate that in order to be tidally disrupted a satellite would have had to be larger than approximately 6. 5 km at the <b>location</b> of the <b>rings.</b> However the tidal interaction is rather weak for objects of the size of outer solar system bodies at the <b>ring</b> <b>location,</b> therefore we considered other more effective mechanisms by which a satellite migt have approached the centaur. Collisonal scenarios are both physically plausible for the formation, but semianalytical estimations indicate that the probability of the corresponding collisions is low under current condition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOxidation-induced {{stacking}} fault rings in polished Cz silicon samples {{before and after}} thermal wet oxidation are investigated by use of photoluminescence imaging. Currently the standard procedure for OSF ring detection is to expose the samples to a toxic preferential etchant, e. g. a Wright solution, after a thermal oxidation. This solution primarily attacks the regions with {{stacking fault}}s, allowing detection by visual inspection. Samples from the seed end of p-type Cz silicon ingots with resistivities of approximately 1 Ohm-cm were measured by PL imaging before and after a thermal oxidation process. Subsequently, Wright-etching {{was performed on the}} oxidized samples to expose stacking faults. The lifetime variations in the PL images were correlated with the <b>location</b> of the <b>rings</b> in the preferentially etched surfaces, and good agreement was found. The results show that for this crystal pulling process, even the PL images of unpassivated polished samples can be used to detect the OSF <b>ring</b> <b>location.</b> The thermal oxidation at 1100 °C enhanced the contrast between the OSF ring {{and the rest of the}} sample in the PL image...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of axially compressed, circular cylindrical shells with intermediate ring supports. The simple Timoshenko thin shell theory and the more sophisticated Flügge thin shell theory have been adopted in the modeling of the cylindrical shells. We used these two representative theories to examine the sensitivity of the buckling solutions to the different degree of approximations made in shell theories. By dividing the shell into segments at the <b>locations</b> of the <b>ring</b> supports, the state-space technique is employed to derive the solutions for each shell segment and the domain decomposition method utilized to impose the equilibrium and compatibility conditions at the interfaces of the shell segments. First-known exact buckling factors are obtained for cylindrical shells of one and multiple intermediate ring supports and various combinations of boundary conditions. Comparison studies are carried out against benchmark solutions and independent numerical results from ANS YS and p-Ritz analyses. The influence of the <b>locations</b> of the <b>ring</b> supports on the buckling behaviour of the shells is examined...|$|R

40|$|A {{switch in}} the <b>location</b> of FtsZ <b>ring</b> {{structures}} from medial to polar {{is one of}} the earliest morphological indicators of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. This switch can be artificially caused during vegetative growth by induction of an active form, Sad 67, of the transcription regulator, Spo 0 A (P. A. Levin and R. Losick, Genes Dev. 10 : 478 – 488, 1996). We have used immunofluorescence microscopy to show that the switch in FtsZ <b>ring</b> <b>location</b> during vegetative growth caused by Sad 67 induction is blocked by a spoIIE deletion mutation. The spoIIE mutation also impaired polar FtsZ ring formation during sporulation. These results suggest that SpoIIE mediates the Spo 0 A-directed formation of polar FtsZ rings. A central issue in developmental biology is how the progeny of a single cell division assume dissimilar fates. An attractive experimental system in which this problem can be addressed is sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, in which the formation of an asymmetrically positioned septum partitions the developing cell into a prespore and a mother cell (12, 25, 26, 30). The smaller compartment, the prespore, becomes the spore, whereas the larger compartment, the mother cell, participate...|$|R

We have used polymer brush micro-engineering to generate a stratified micro-epidermis with fewer than 10 human keratinocytes. Epidermal stem cells are captured on 100  μm diameter circular collagen-coated disks. Within 24  h they assemble a stratified micro-tissue, in which differentiated cells have a central suprabasal <b>location.</b> For <b>rings</b> with a non-adhesive centre of up to 40  μm diameter, cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesive interactions together result in correct micro-epidermis assembly. Assembly requires actin polymerization, adherens junctions and desmosomes, but not myosin II-mediated contractility nor coordinated cell movement. Squamous cell carcinoma cells on micro-patterned rings exhibit disturbed architecture that correlates with the characteristics of the original tumours.

40|$|The first-known {{investigation}} is reported for free vibration of circular and annular Mindlin plates with intermediate concentric ring stiffeners. The total potential energy functional is first derived for the stiffened circular and annular plates. The Mindlin first-order shear deformation plate theory {{is used to}} account for the effects of plate shear deformation and rotary inertia, while the Engesser theory is used to consider the shear deformation and torsional effects in stiffeners. A set of trial functions is proposed for the displacement fields to satisfy the geometric boundary conditions of the plate at outset.
