The algorithm uses <b>an</b> ensemble <b>of</b> agents, which scan the search space and exchange information concerning <b>a</b> fitness <b>of</b> their current position.

This is an unwelcome feature, because it diminishes the performance of the algorithm. Additionally, in the case of parallel processing, this feature can lead to unbalanced loads. This paper presents simple modifications of the original algorithm, which improve performance of the algorithm by limiting situations, in which the agent cannot move.

This stage had two different aims: to assess the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> student engagement, and document the educational outcomes achieved through digital storytelling. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> engagement is <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> that can be measured with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scoring rubric. According to Sadik, it is appropriate to use an assessment instrument, such as a scoring rubric, to evaluate ICT-based learning projects (Sadik [2008]). Therefore, the role of digital storytelling was assessed by means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evaluation rubric. An evaluation rubric created by the University of Houston ([2011]) was chosen as a guide to create the rubric for this research (Additional file 1 : Appendix C). The evaluation rubric included nine criteria; these are: Purpose, Plot, Pacing of Narrative, Dramatic Question, Story Content, Grammar and Language Usage, Technological Competence, Emotional Content and Economy <b>of</b> Content.

40|$|Marsden and Scheurle [1993] studied Lagrangian {{reduction}} {{in the context of}} momentum map constraints—here meaning the reduction of the standard Euler-Lagrange system restricted to <b>a</b> <b>level</b> set <b>of</b> <b>a</b> momentum map. This provides a Lagrangian parallel to the reduction of symplectic manifolds. The present paper studies the Lagrangian parallel of Poisson reduction for Hamiltonian systems. For the reduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lagrangian system on <b>a</b> <b>level</b> set <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conserved <b>quantity,</b> <b>a</b> key object is the Routhian, which is the Lagrangian minus the mechanical connection paired with the fixed value of the momentum map. For unconstrained systems, we use a velocity shifted Lagrangian, which plays the role of the Routhian in the constrained theory. Hamilton’s variational principle for the Euler-Lagrange equations breaks up into two sets of equations that represent <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> Euler-Lagrange equations with gyroscopic forcing that can be written in terms of the curvature of the connection for horizontal variations, and into the Euler-Poincar´e equations for the vertical variations. This new set of equations is what we call the reduced Euler-Lagrange equations, and it includes the Euler-Poincaré and the Hamel equations as special cases. We illustrate this methodology for a rigid body with internal rotors and for a particle moving in a magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} method which attempts {{to improve the}} stability properties of periodic orbits in hybrid dynamical systems by shaping the energy. By taking advantage of conservation of energy and the existence <b>of</b> invariant <b>level</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conserved <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> energy corresponding to periodic orbits, energy shaping drives a system to a desired level set. This energy shaping method is similar to existing methods but improves upon them by utilizing control Lyapunov functions, allowing for formal results on stability. The main theoretical result, Theorem 1, states that, given an exponentially-stable limit cycle in a hybrid dynamical system, application of the presented energy shaping controller results in a closed-loop system which is exponentially stable. The method {{can be applied to}} <b>a</b> wide class <b>of</b> problems including bipedal locomotion; because the optimization problem can be formulated as a quadratic program operating on a convex set, existing methods can be used to rapidly obtain the optimal solution. As illustrated through numerical simulations, this method turns out to be useful in practice, taking an existing behavior which corresponds to <b>a</b> periodic orbit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hybrid system, such as steady state locomotion, and providing an improvement in convergence properties and robustness with respect to perturbations in initial conditions without destabilizing the behavior. The method is even shown to work on complex multi-domain hybrid systems; an example is provided of bipedal locomotion for a robot with non-trivial foot contact which results in a multi-phase gait...|$|R
40|$|The Green Paper {{on teacher}} {{education}} in Europe (Buchberger, 2002) highlights {{the crucial role}} of designing learning situations in which students can find opportunities to develop structures of meaning, knowledge and activities for <b>a</b> didactical reconstruction <b>of</b> the disciplinary contents, integrated with pedagogical competencies, methodologies and teaching practices. The epistemic role of models in physics (Hestenes, 1996) suggests that models can be included in teaching/learning methodologies and cannot be omitted in a cultural base {{in the education of}} teachers <b>of</b> all <b>levels.</b> Being models cognitive tools and not simple representations of phenomena, they cannot be transferred either as ready-to-use examples or taught as rules to apply; to favour interpretation teachers have to offer situated experiences of model building starting from experimental activities. A previous research showed that some elementary recurring basic model structures represent “syntactic elements” <b>of</b> <b>a</b> language oriented to modelling. For instance in the evolution toward equilibrium of different systems is possible to identify the flow <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extensive <b>quantity</b> which is conservative and whose flux intensity depends on the difference <b>of</b> the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding intensive <b>quantity</b> experiencing <b>a</b> resistance. The key role of the group investigation in a cooperative learning environment is implemented in <b>a</b> proposal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> research-based learning pathway based on modelling starting from experiments in <b>a</b> community <b>of</b> perspective primary teachers. The research aims to investigate how the modelling activity takes place during the individual and group exploration of experimental activities and how the collaborative work affects the ability to design models to interpret the observed phenomena. Moreover we analyze the role of single elementary model structure when building complex models with a qualitative modelling software such as VnR. A training pathway was designed, with specific activities and monitoring tools, and tested with <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> perspective primary school teachers of University of Udine (23 students) and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (73 students). The training pathway was organized in two main activities organized in 4 phases according with tutorial for inquiry learning. Each thematic activity started with the design <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experiment for the exploration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon followed by building and testing <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> the observed phenomena, first individually then in small groups. The first activity consisted in the study of phenomena evolving towards equilibrium; the second was in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thought experiment concerning dynamical equilibrium. A final plenary discussion, chaired by the conductor, aimed at analysing to what extent the various model structures are consistent with the observed phenomena as well as to reflection on models comparison (similarities and differences). The software VnR was chosen due o its specifications of icon-based design and representation of simple relations between variables without the use of formulas. VnR is assumed to be an effective tool to let the participants to learn how {{to think in terms of}} variables and relations, to identify elementary structures as components of more complex models, to recognize similarities between different phenomena and to develop a dynamical approach to phenomena as processes evolving over time. The data collected during the activities, comprising specific tutorials, based on inquiry learning for all the activities, and models produced by the participants, both alone and in groups, were analysed according to the research questions...|$|R
