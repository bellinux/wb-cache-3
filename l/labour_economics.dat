40|$|AbstractThe {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the development of labour market economic theory. It shows the increase in relative importance of institutions and the rising relevance of the institutional theories for the <b>labour</b> market <b>economics.</b> The <b>labour</b> market <b>economics</b> was established on the base of the neoclassical paradigm, the fundamental elements are competitive markets with internal forces capable of reaching effective solutions, and rational subjects, maximizing utilities, profits and rents according to their preferences. The Smith's “invisible hand” was restricted by institutions – governments, corporations, and unions with legislation, personal policy, and collective bargaining. The expanding regulations and interventions into labour markets and the effort to explain the reality inevitably leads to the incorporation of more and more institutional theories into the modern <b>labour</b> market <b>economics.</b> The contribution formulates the conclusion that the institutional content is entering into the neoclassical paradigm...|$|R

40|$|The growing role of {{institutions}} and {{their influence on}} the labour market outcomes, i. e., wage rates and labour allocation, {{has been among the}} most significant characteristic features of labour markets in recent decades. The <b>labour</b> market <b>economics</b> built its paradigm on the principles of marginalism, which brought suitable instruments for the analysis of market agents’ individual decisions capable of achieving effective solutions. Smith’s “invisible hand” has gradually been limited by institutional interventions – by governments, corporations and trade unions with government legislation, corporate personnel policies and collective bargaining. The expanding regulatory interventions in the labour market and the effort to explain the reality leads inevitably {{to the fact that the}} modern <b>labour</b> market <b>economics</b> incorporates more and more institutional theories. The contribution outlines the gradual invasion of neoinstitutional topics and theories into the neoclassical labour market paradigm and it analyses the differences between the neoclassical and institutional interpretation of labour market functioning.

5000|$|Surplus labour (German: Mehrarbeit) is {{a concept}} used by Karl Marx in his {{critique}} of political economy. It means labour performed {{in excess of the}} labour necessary to produce the means of livelihood of the worker ("necessary labour"). The [...] "surplus" [...] in this context means the additional labour a worker has to do in his/her job, beyond earning his own keep.

The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory.

[...] This range of approaches is indicative of what Roger Backhouse and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings.
