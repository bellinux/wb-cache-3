The act itself is physically straightforward, merely involving the system 2 ̆ 7 s center of mass and achieving a static equilibrium between the opposing torques caused by gravity and the normal force between the container and the surface on which it balances.

However, the trade-offs to these benefits are a relatively lower image quality and interpretability, which can be addressed by, for example, post-processing methods. One particularly difficult imaging case {{is associated with the}} presence of a barrier, such as a human skull, with significantly different acoustical properties than the brain tissue as the target medium. Some methods were proposed in the literature to account for this structure if the skull 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> is known. Measuring the skull 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> is therefore an important task that requires attention. In this work, a new edge detection method for accurate human skull profile extraction via post-processing of ultrasonic A-Scans is introduced.

40|$|Shadows occur {{frequently}} in indoor scenes and outdoors on sunny days. Despite the information inherent in shadows about a scene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> and lighting conditions, relatively little work in image understanding has addressed the important problem of recognizing shadows. This {{is an even}} more serious failing when one considers the problems shadows pose for many visual techniques such as object recognition and shape from shading. Shadows are difficult to identify because they cannot be infallibly recognized until a scene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> and lighting are known. However, {{there are a number}} of cues which together strongly suggest the identification of a shadow. We present a list of these cues and methods which can be used by an active observer to detect shadows. By an active observer, we mean an observer that is not only mobile, but can extend a probe into its environment. The proposed approach should allow the extraction of shadows in real time. Furthermore, the identification of a shadow should improve with observing time. In order to be able to identify shadows without or prior to obtaining information about the arrangement of objects or information about the spectral properties of materials in the scene, we provide the observer with a probe with which to cast its own shadows. Any visible shadows cast by the probe can be easily identified because they will be new to the scene. These actively obtained shadows allow the observer to experimentally determine the number and location of light sources in the scene, to locate the cast shadows, and to gain information about the likely spectral changes due to shadows. We present a novel method for locating a light source and the surface on which a shadow is cast. It takes into account errors in imaging and image processing and, furthermore, it takes special advantage of the benefits of an active observer. The information gained from the probe is of particular importance in effectively using the various shadow cues. In the course of identifying shadows, we also present a new modification on an image segmentation algorithm. Our modification provides a general description of color images in terms of regions that is particularly amenable to the analysis of shadows...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: With the MapCHECK 2 a {{relatively}} new QA tool is available to implement in the streamline of patient QA (validation of treatment plans). In order to achieve this, its properties and potentials need to be examined. This study is focussed on this characterisation and implementation of MapCHECK 2 at the radiotherapy department of UZ Brussel, especially for the TomoTherapy treatment system. Tomotherapy is a system with unique characteristics opposed to conventional treatment machines and therefore needs an adapted implementation. The main goal is to obtain a representative patient QA technique that can be implemented for every planned treatment. Materials and Methods In order to examine its properties, MapCHECK 2 will be used with its kVCT, MVCT and corrected CT images to find the ideal configuration for measurements. Along with this the angular dependence induced by the MapCHECK 22 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> will be reviewed to find the critical angles that can cause difficulties during rotational delivery. After this the first patient plans will be evaluated. Finally the challenge when using tools like this is {{to determine if the}} results are correct. Measurements can be cross-checked with other dosimetric tools but due to geometric diversities this cannot be the only option used. Therefore also the detection capability of intentional errors induced by the user is examined. Results The results show that working with an adapted CT image where the MapCHECK 22 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>geometry</b> is replaced/masked by two theoretical known densities (MC 2 DENS) is the best reviewed option for patient QA measurements. MapCHECK 2 also shows a high angular dependence in the ranges from 60 ° to 120 ° and 240 ° to 300 ° but the Tomotherapy system is able to deal with this using the inverse planning technique that takes the densities into account. Composite measurements compensate for the angular dependence. The cover up potential measurements show that the MapCHECK 22 ̆ 7 s detection possibility is above expectations. This is an important result for QA measurements in IMRT. Conclusion With these promising results the MapCHECK 2 is integrated in the streamline of the patient QA for Tomotherapy at UZ Brussel using the MC 2 DENS phantom created by masking the obtained HU (Hounsfield Units) with theoretical found HU values.
