How the gas kinetics, i. e. the lift-gas composition will influence this increase {{is the subject of this}} thesis and will be described in relation to multiphase flow, pressure drop and pressure-temperature-volume (PVT) -theory. A vertical pipe flow was studied, simulating the pressure drop coupled with the accompanying multiphase flow and PVT-information. The simulations were run in MATLAB, supported by NeqSim, a non-equilibrium simulation tool. NeqSim was used to acquire the local fluid parameters in order to calculate the local pressure drop. To study the gas <b>lift</b> <b>efficiency,</b> four different simulation variations were performed. Different lift-gas compositions were applied to the reservoir to observe the response. The bubblepoint pressure was altered by adjusting the composition, the bottomhole flowing pressure (BHFP) was lowered by adjusting the reservoir pressure, and a pressure delay was applied to simulate solution above the bubblepoint pressure and a dissolution process below the bubblepoint pressure. Two different pressure delays were implemented; one with equal delay, another with different delays. These simulations were run on a well system with a heavy oil composition and a set geometry. The boundary conditions were the inlet and outlet pressures, set by the reservoir pressure, 120 bar, and the separator pressure, 15 bar. This locks the BHFP at 105 bar, but it was also adjusted for one of the simulation variations. The varying parameter was the gas injection rate, which is set by a for-loop in the code and input flow rate found by using the bisection method for each simulation. From running the simulations and analysing the results it has been found that gas lift has a generally positive effect on the deliverability and stability of an oil field, though with an exceeding amount of gas lift injection the friction pressure drop will have a negative effect on production. A denser gas seems to give an increased gas <b>lift</b> <b>efficiency</b> due to the higher solubility rate. This makes optimising the injection rate imperative in order to have the highest possible production efficiency. There is a higher efficiency for an undersaturated reservoir, though requiring an increased gas injection rate. As for the composition of the lift-gas, it will have an impact on efficiency and should be taken into account. An increased solution effect implemented by a pressure delay will have positive effect on the <b>lift</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A denser gas will dissolve at a higher rate into the liquid, decreasing the density of the wellbore column for higher gas injection rates than for the lighter gas. The delays occurring in a mass transfer situation between the phases will also influence the production, more so if the solution rate is higher than the dissolution rate, this should be studied further...|$|R

[...] Wind-tunnel {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on all 8 per cent thick aerofoil between end plates, with Mowing from a slot in tile knee of a 25 per cent chord trailing-edge flap, to improve the <b>lifting</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the flap. Both the blowing-slot width and position were varied. Tile sectional lift and pitching moment were derived by chordwise integration of tile surface static pressures measured at the mid-span station. Tuft observations as well as surface-pressure measurements were made {{to determine the extent}} of the turbulent separation region on the trailing-edge flap and of the laminar separation bubble on the aerofoil nose. The blowing momentum required to prevent flow separation on tile flap, at a given flap angle and zero wing incidence, proved much less than might have been expected from earlier two-dimensional experiments on thicker wings with blowing over the flap from the shroud. This reduction is probably associated with the low effective aspect ratio of the present quasi two-dimensional model as well as with improvements in blowing techniques. The separation bubble on the aerofoil nose began to expand markedly (with the flap deflected) when the incidence reached only a few degrees, and simultaneously the blowing momentum needed to prevent flow separation on tile flap tended to increase. 1.
