5000|$|In 1968, Beddoes {{proposed}} {{construction of}} a [...] "high-rise trailer park" [...] {{to be built in}} Capistrano Beach, California. His plan called for making [...] "more efficient use of land in areas where acreage is too expensive for a trailer park" [...] by building an eight-story structure of concrete and steel and using a crane to <b>lift</b> <b>trailers</b> and insert them into their respective spaces.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{also common}} in North America to {{transport}} semi-trailers on railway flatcars or spine cars, an arrangement called [...] "piggyback" [...] or TOFC (trailer on flatcar) to {{distinguish it from}} container on flatcar (COFC). Some flatcars are designed with collapsible trailer hitches {{so they can be}} used for trailer or container service. Such designs allow trailers to be rolled on from one end, though <b>lifting</b> <b>trailers</b> on and off flatcars by specialized loaders is more common. TOFC terminals typically have large areas for storing trailers pending loading or pickup.|$|R
25|$|On 7 July 2015, trailer 58 {{suffered}} a serious derailment {{on a relatively}} new crossover just north of Laxey Station, toppling onto its side. Services were suspended between Laxey and Ramsey. A complex operation was undertaken to <b>lift</b> the <b>trailer</b> back upright. It required a road closure, removal of overhead line equipment and a large crane. The re-railed trailer was then moved by tractor to Laxey Station and has since returned to service after overhaul.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{function}} of a trailer jack is to <b>lift</b> the <b>trailer</b> to a height that allows the trailer to be hitched or unhitched {{to and from the}} towing vehicle. Trailer jacks are also used for leveling the trailer during storage. The most common types of trailer jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and drop-leg jacks. Some trailers, such as horse trailers, have a built-in jack at the tongue for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Action {{switches}} to the Lotus factory where the Lotus 49 chassis is shown {{at an early}} stage of production. The chassis is finished and the engine mated to it for the first time, and Chapman explains the theory behind the new car. In Germany, Hill's car is shown being <b>lifted</b> onto a <b>trailer</b> after a practise shunt. The leading drivers are shown and named, and the race gets under way. Several cars are shown getting airborne over the Nürburgring's jumps. Both Lotuses retire with suspension trouble.|$|R

The tornado traveled 15 miles into Mountain Top. One person was killed by a falling tree in Dauphin County. They were part of a larger winter weather event.|$|R
5000|$|Since bulb keels {{work best}} on long, thin keels or daggerboards, they are {{generally}} not used on sailboats intended for shallow waters, but are most often found on offshore racing craft. Daggerboards built like bulb keels are {{often referred to as}} [...] "lifting keels", and they can be retracted into the boat to reduce the draft, and to allow the boat to be loaded onto a <b>trailer.</b> <b>Lifting</b> keels {{are also more likely to}} be found on craft built for speed, as a winch or a set of pulleys is required to provide purchase to lift the heavy keel.|$|R
