5|$|Among {{the better}} known {{pipelines}} were the Northern Lights {{line from the}} Komi petroleum deposit to Brest on the Polish border, the Soiuz line running from Orenburg to Uzhgorod near the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders, and the Export pipeline from the Urengoy gas field to L'vov and thence to First World countries, including Austria, Italy, West Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The 1,420-millimeter Export pipeline was 4,451 kilometers <b>long.</b> <b>It</b> crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr. It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>long,</b> <b>it</b> {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled {{with the belief that}} the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last <b>long.</b> <b>It</b> {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E

5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy and how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E

5|$|Inocybe maculata has {{thin-walled}} cheilocystidia, {{which are}} clavate (club-shaped), lack encrustation at the apex, and are colourless. The basidia are also clavate, {{and can be}} two-, three- or four-spored, and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres (μm) by 5 to 9μm. The sterigmata (the narrow horns {{on the end of}} the basidia which hold the spores) are 4 to 5μm <b>long.</b> <b>It</b> lacks pleurocystidia. The species leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped; they have a yellow-brown to rusty brown colouration, and measure from 9 to 11μm by 4.5 to 5.5μm. The hyphae can have clamp connections, but can also lack them.|$|E

5|$|Located near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located {{approximately}} 71.7 million {{light years}} from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1.

5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester, England, {{built to}} link Bolton and Bury with Manchester. The canal, when fully opened, was 15miles 1furlong (24.3km) <b>long.</b> <b>It</b> was {{accessed}} via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford. Seventeen locks {{were required to}} climb to the summit as it passed through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several minor roads.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} of Daredevil was {{released}} on March 18, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K. Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site.

Netflix also debuted a countdown timer to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to see how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> was until the season would debut. The season was enhanced to be available in high dynamic range after its initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe.|$|E

Through World War II, animated propaganda shorts remained influential in American cinema.

5|$|With {{the dispute}} resolved, the {{discovery}} team proposed Eris on September 6, 2006. On September 13, 2006 this name {{was accepted as}} the official name by the IAU.

The asteroids had taken {{the vast majority of}} Graeco-Roman names. Eris, whom Brown described as his favorite goddess, had fortunately escaped inclusion. The name in part reflects the discord in the astronomical community caused by the debate over the object's (and Pluto's) classification.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
