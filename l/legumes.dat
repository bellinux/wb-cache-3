For example, canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many <b>legumes,</b> and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia gladiata (sword bean).

The non-protein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of legume, in particular Leucaena leucocephala.

The 6 pasture types investigated were Arachis pintoi-Brachiaria humidicola mixtures which differed in <b>legume</b> and grass mass per hectare and grass:legume ratios. The sward attributes explaining the greatest variation in <b>legume</b> selection by fistulated and non-fistulated steers were <b>legume</b> percentage in the forage on offer (r 2 = 0. 67) and available <b>legume</b> mass (r 2 = 0. 56), respectively. <b>Legume</b> selection by both groups of steers was correlated with <b>legume</b> bulk density (kg DM/ha/cm).

In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, <b>legumes</b> and beans were also cultivated.

In this study, we grew three <b>legume</b> species vs. three grass species in mesocosms, and monitored the soil chemical property, quantified the abundance of bacteria and fungi.

When <b>legume</b> increased the abundance of Verrucomicrobia, grass decreased it, and furthermore, linear discriminant analysis identified some group-specific microbial taxa as potential biomarkers of <b>legume</b> or grass.

The objective of this study was to determine the changes that occurred in the 13 C isotope composition of soil from a grass + <b>legume</b> pasture that was established by cultivation of a native savanna dominated by C 4 vegetation. The 13 C natural abundance technique was used to estimate the amount of soil organic carbon originating from the <b>legume.</b> Up to 29 % of the organic carbon in soil of the grass + <b>legume</b> pasture was estimated to be derived from <b>legume</b> residues in the top 0 2 -cm soil depth, which decreased to 7 % at 8 10 cm depth. Improvements in soil fertility resulting from the soil organic carbon originated from <b>legume</b> residues were measured as increased potential rates of nitrogen mineralization and increased yields of rice in a subsequent crop after the grass + <b>legume</b> pasture compared with the grass-only pasture.

In situ RUP for <b>legume</b> and grass hays averaged 25. 9 % CP and ranged from 14. 6 to 45. 5 % CP, respectively. We developed a near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy RUP calibration equation for the <b>legume</b> and grass hay data set using in situ RUP contents as base data. This procedure resulted in an acceptable (R 2 = 0. 87, SE = 2. 46 % CP) near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy equation to predict RUP content of <b>legume</b> and grass hays. Data suggest that near-infrared spectroscopy predicts RUP contents of <b>legume</b> and grass hays with accuracies similar to <b>legume</b> and grass silages.

The study focused particularly on the identification of factors determining adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> technologies, evaluation of welfare impacts of adoption status and intensity of improved food <b>legume</b> varieties, identifying intra-household impact dynamics due to adoption of improved <b>legume</b> varieties and spotting out the major challenges and opportunities faced by smallholders in their adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> technologies [...] This study used cross sectional data that acquired from a total of 600 households, which were randomly and proportionately sampled from 12 major <b>legume</b> producer kebeles in 3 districts of Bale highlands by using three-stage sampling technique. Probit and Clog-log binary model were estimated to identify the underlying factors that determine adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> varieties; and fertilizer and pesticide, respectively and separately. PSM model was estimated to evaluate the welfare impacts of adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> varieties. In addition, continuous treatment effects model (GPS) was also employed to estimate the welfare impact of intensity of adoption by discarding non-adopters from the analysis. The results from probit and clog-log indicate that age, livestock holding, farm size, membership in farmers cooperatives, contact with agricultural research center, household head participation in off-farm activity, distance from agricultural extension office and main market; and location (district dummy) were factors that significantly determine farmers decision to adopt improved food <b>legume</b> technologies. The study also indicates that adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> technologies can motivate farmers to shift from the monocropping system to diversified one, improve income since they fetch higher prices than common cereals and they are the major source of protein for the household who cannot acquire it from animal products. However, adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> technologies is highly constrained by labor-intensive nature of the production, lack of improved food <b>legume</b> technologies especially water logging tolerant varieties and market irregularities. The outputs from PSM indicate that adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> varieties has positive and significant impact on the income and the adopter receive 25 % higher income than non-adopter. The intra household analysis indicated that households with productive labor force receive better treatment effect while households with economically dependents female members receive considerably lower treatment effects from adoption of improved food <b>legume</b> varieties, suggesting the prevalent intra-household differences. The result of GPS also confirms the positive effect of intensity of adoption on income, consumption expenditure and calorie intake. The results generally suggests the need to design interventions enhancing adoption of food <b>legume</b> technologies focusing on improving adoption rates and minimizing intra household difference in income.

The presence of the <b>legume</b> living mulch decreased weed abundance before winter. Field pea, berseem clover, common vetch and the common vetch/faba bean/berseem clover mixture were particularly effective, regardless of the growing conditions, decreasing weed abundance by 20 - 75 % with respect to that in the crop grown alone, in the absence of herbicide application. Weed abundance before winter was negatively correlated with total intercrop biomass, and this relationship was dependent on the <b>legume</b> species considered and soil mineral nitrogen content. As with other <b>legume</b> intercrops, the level of soil mineral nitrogen had a strong influence on intercrop structure, modifying the proportion of <b>legume</b> biomass produced. The legume/oilseed rape biomass ratio was also found to be a useful indicator in all growing conditions: the higher the ratio, the more efficient the weed control. However, a high ratio was associated with a higher risk of competition with the cash crop. The choice of the most appropriate <b>legume</b> living mulch is therefore a compromise between the anticipated ecosystem services and the potential disservices provided by the <b>legume</b> mulch.
