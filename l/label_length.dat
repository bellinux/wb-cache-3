40|$|We {{consider}} how to assign labels to any undirected graph with n nodes such that, given the labels of two nodes {{and no other}} information regarding the graph, {{it is possible to}} determine the distance between the two nodes. The challenge in such a distance labeling scheme is primarily to minimize the maximum label lenght and secondarily to minimize the time needed to answer distance queries (decoding). Previous schemes have offered different trade-offs between label lengths and query time. This paper presents a simple algorithm with shorter labels and shorter query time than any previous solution, thereby improving the state-of-the-art with respect to both <b>label</b> <b>length</b> and query time in one single algorithm. Our solution addresses several open problems concerning <b>label</b> <b>length</b> and decoding time and is the first improvement of <b>label</b> <b>length</b> for more than three decades. More specifically, we present a distance labeling scheme with label size (log 3) / 2 + o(n) (logarithms are in base 2) and O(1) decoding time. This outperforms all existing results with respect to both size and decoding time, including Winkler's (Combinatorica 1983) decade-old result, which uses labels of size (log 3) n and O(n/log n) decoding time, and Gavoille et al. (SODA' 01), which uses labels of size 11 n + o(n) and O(loglog n) decoding time. In addition, our algorithm is simpler than the previous ones. In the case of integral edge weights of size at most W, we present almost matching upper and lower bounds for label sizes. For r-additive approximation schemes, where distances can be off by an additive constant r, we give both upper and lower bounds. In particular, we present an upper bound for 1 -additive approximation schemes which, in the unweighted case, has the same size (ignoring second order terms) as an adjacency scheme: n/ 2. We also give results for bipartite graphs and for exact and 1 -additive distance oracles...|$|E

This research is motivated by the problem of developing standards for taxonomic data, and addresses the data intensive problem of evaluating semantic similarities between taxonomic elements. Evaluating such similarities often requires the processing of large common ancestor sets between elements. We propose a new class of compact labelling schemes, designed for directed acyclic graphs, and tailored for applications to large web taxonomies. Our labelling schemes significantly reduce the complexity of evaluating similarities among taxonomy elements by enabling the gleaning of inferences from the labels alone, without searching the data structure. We provide an analysis of the <b>label</b> <b>lengths</b> for the proposed schemes based on structural properties of the taxonomy. Finally, we provide supporting empirical evidence for the quality of these schemes by evaluating the performance on the WordNet taxonomy...|$|R

Unfortunately however, such a restriction on dimension does not suffice to guarantee embeddibility in a normed space. In this paper we explore the option of bypassing the embedding. In particular we show the following for low dimensional metrics: * Quasi-polynomial time (1 +ffl) -approximation algorithm for various optimization problems such as TSP, k-median and facility location. * (1 + ffl) -approximate distance labeling scheme with optimal <b>label</b> <b>length.</b> * (1 +ffl) -stretch polylogarithmic storage routing scheme...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A graph G is δ-hyperbolic if for any four {{vertices}} u, v, x,y of G the two larger of {{the three}} distance sums dG(u, v) + dG(x,y), dG(u, x) + dG(v, y),dG(u, y) + dG(v, x) differ by at most δ, and the smallest δ � 0 for which G is δ-hyperbolic is called the hyperbolicity of G. In this paper, we construct a distance labeling scheme for bounded hyperbolicity graphs, that is a vertex labeling such that the distance between any two vertices of G can be estimated from their labels, without any other source of information. More precisely, our scheme assigns labels of O(log 2 n) bits for bounded hyperbolicity graphs with n vertices such that distances can be approximated within an additive error of O(log n). The <b>label</b> <b>length</b> is optimal for every additive error up to n ε.

A family of graphs is trimmable if for every constant t> 0, {{there is a constant}} g ≥ 0 such that every vertex-weighted graph in the family is (t,g) -trimmable.

We also show that every family of directed graphs of bounded layer bandwidth (a less restrictive condition than bounded directed bandwidth) is trimmable. As an application of these results, we derive polynomial-time approximation schemes for various forms of the problem of labeling a subset of given weighted point features with nonoverlapping sliding axes-parallel rectangular labels so as to maximize the total weight of the labeled features, provided that the ratios of label heights or the ratios of <b>label</b> <b>lengths</b> are bounded by a constant.

40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) -encoded heterodimeric TAP 1 /TAP 2 transporter (TAP) translocates cytosolic peptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where peptides of 8 to 11 amino acids long associate with MHC class I molecules. We have studied the selectivity of peptide translocation by TAP in streptolysin O- permeabilized cells using glycosylatable, radioiodinated model peptides to detect import into the ER lumen. TAP-dependent translocation of a radiolabeled nonamer peptide was most efficiently inhibited by unlabeled 9 - to 11 -mer peptides. Peptides between 7 and 40 amino acids long all could inhibit transport, the longer peptides being least effective. Also, peptides shorter than eight amino acids were inefficiently translocated. The use of directly <b>labeled</b> <b>length</b> variants in translocation assays and TLC analysis of the transported material revealed two pathways for translocation: short peptides (7 to 13 amino acids long) were translocated without prior modification. In contrast, transport of longer peptides was not effective. Instead such peptides were clipped by cytosolic peptidases before efficient transport. Our data suggest that TAP preferentially translocates peptides of appropriate length for class I binding. Furthermore, TAP-translocated peptides were rapidly released from the ER unless they were trapped there by being glycosylated or by binding to MHC class I molecules...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that dynamic XML {{labelling}} schemes have been investigated widely, some challenges {{still need to be}} tackled. Dynamic XML documents are subject to change. An efficient dynamic labelling scheme is able to maintain the node relationships throughout continuous changes to the XML tree structure.

The main problem for dynamic XML is overflow that occurs when the <b>label</b> <b>length</b> of the new node is over the reserved space limit. There has not been sufficient analysis to determine the class of labelling scheme which faces this problem {{in the early stages of}} update. To this end a series of experiments were performed when updating the Nasa XML database, which contains real data. Five sets of new nodes (50, 100, 400, 800, 1200) were inserted into this dataset using two versions of XML node indexing system: a Prefix and an Interval labelling scheme.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, {{the length of}} the labels is variable; so, we should take this into account in the {{labeling}} scheme. To do this, a fixed <b>label</b> <b>length</b> could be assigned for all nodes. In this way, {{there is no need to}} store the size of labels. However, it is clear that a fixed length label storage schemes are subject to overflow by the update process which requires the relabeling of all existing nodes [30]. Alternatively, it is possible to use a variable length labeling scheme which requires the size (length) of the label to be stored in addition to the label itself. It is not the case to use a fixed length of bits for storing the variable size of the labels because the original fixed-length of bits will eventually be too small, requiring all existing nodes to be relabeled, or this leads to significant wastage of storage space if a very large fixed-length of bits is used [42]. In other words, not only labels should have variable sizes but also the length field of the labels should be stored, and be identified, using a variable length scheme. Thus, we store each label’s length using the encoding method called FibLSS [43] along with the label itself, just before it.|$|E
