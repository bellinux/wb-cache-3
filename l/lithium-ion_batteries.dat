5|$|<b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if {{overheated}} or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries,</b> resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Lithium and its {{compounds}} {{have several}} industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of valence electrons per atom is {{the same as that of}} Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> is the {{development}} trend in the airborne and automotive applications, but there are constraint technical security risk issues. The spontaneous combustion and other safety hazards of the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> are mainly caused by the imbalance of monomers in the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> packs. In order to solve the imbalance problems in the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> monomers that exist during the charging and discharging process, a novel <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> balancing strategy is proposed based on the global best-first balancing strategy and integrated imbalance calculation analytical methodology. This strategy analyzes the variation of the cell voltage and capacity of the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> which are two key characteristic factors for the balancing adjustment. The integration effect degrees of these two core factors are determined for seeking the optimal balancing path to achieve the active equalization of the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> under charging, discharging and shelving conditions. The experimental results show that, the integrated imbalance degree of remaining capacity and terminal voltage of the battery monomer is no greater than 8 % and the real-time active equalization goals of the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> under different operating conditions are achieved through the equalization adjustment system (EAS) design and implementation, providing security protection for the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> application...|$|R

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries.</b> One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Several plug-in {{electric}} vehicle fire incidents {{have taken place}} since the introduction of mass-production plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s in 2008. Most {{of them have been}} thermal runaway incidents related to the <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> and have involved the Zotye M300 EV, Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, BYD e6, Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid, Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Outlander P-HEV. , four fires after a crash have been reported associated with the batteries of all-electric cars involving a BYD e6 and three Tesla Model S cars.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the high-voltage batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
5|$|Thurso {{boasts a}} small museum, Caithness Horizons, several hotels and bars, a surf shop/cafe {{stocking}} famous brands, {{and a small}} skatepark. There is also a sizeable British Telecom call centre and a plant making <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> for the MoD {{on the west side}} of the town, which along with the Dounreay Nuclear power plant, provide a high level of employment in Caithness. On 12 January 2010, approval was granted for the Baillie wind farm near Thurso which will feature 21 turbines and supply 52.5MW, enough for 25,000 homes.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. <b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries,</b> which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} work, CoO porous nanofibers were {{directly}} grown on conductive substrate as a binder/additive-free anode for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery.</b> These porous nanofibers exhibited high specific discharging/charging capacities at various rates and good cycling stability, suggesting its promising application as <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> anode.|$|R

30|$|MnO 2 {{nanomaterials}} {{are recognized}} as anode materials since three-dimensional (3 d) transition metal oxides (MO, where M is Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) were proposed to serve as high theoretic capacity anodes for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> by Poizot et al. [18]. Before that, MnO 2 nanomaterials were usually used to prepare LiMn 2 O 4 crystals as cathode for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> [19, 20]. Chen's research group has made great contributions on the research of anode for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> [21, 22]. Nevertheless, compared to the intensive investigation on Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, SnO 2, CoO, and so on [23 – 28], the application investigation of MnO 2 nanomaterials on anodes for <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>battery</b> is still immature, although the investigations on their preparation are plentiful.|$|R
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries,</b> but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
