5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} <b>large</b> brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was as <b>large</b> as a <b>large</b> male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a <b>large</b> brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate {{a higher level of}} intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E

25|$|If {{a number}} is the {{successor}} of another number, {{then the first}} number {{is said to be}} <b>larger</b> than the other number. If a number is <b>larger</b> than another number, and if the other number is <b>larger</b> than a third number, then the first number is also <b>larger</b> than the third number. Example: five is <b>larger</b> than four, and four is <b>larger</b> than three, therefore five is <b>larger</b> than three. But six is <b>larger</b> than five, therefore six is also <b>larger</b> than three. But seven is <b>larger</b> than six, therefore seven is also <b>larger</b> than three... therefore eight is <b>larger</b> than three... therefore nine is <b>larger</b> than three, etc.|$|R

5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle <b>large</b> ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue <b>large</b> ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build <b>large</b> webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, <b>large</b> windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a <b>large</b> open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually <b>large</b> to accommodate a <b>large</b> choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>large</b> numbers of organisms {{actually}} {{consumed by the}} walrus, its foraging has a <b>large</b> peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the <b>Large</b> Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} <b>Large</b> Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred <b>Large</b> Black.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very <b>large</b> heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in <b>large</b> amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
