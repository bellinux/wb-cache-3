Gacy stated he had <b>lost</b> <b>count</b> of the number of victims buried in his crawl space and had initially considered stowing bodies in his attic before opting to dispose of his victims off the I-55 bridge into the Des Plaines River.

25|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ridgway is {{believed}} to have murdered at least 71 women (according to Ridgway, in an interview with Sheriff Dave Reichert in 2001) near Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. His court statements later reported that he had killed so many, he <b>lost</b> <b>count.</b> A majority of the murders occurred between 1982 and 1984. The victims were believed to be either sex workers or runaways picked up along Pacific Highway South (International Blvd. 99), whom he strangled. Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the Green River, except for two confirmed and another two suspected victims found in the Portland, Oregon area. The bodies were often left in clusters, sometimes posed, usually nude. He would sometimes return to the victims' bodies and have sexual intercourse with them. Because most of the bodies were not discovered until only the skeletons remained, three victims are still unidentified. Ridgway occasionally contaminated the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported a few victims' remains across state lines into Oregon to confuse the police.|$|E
