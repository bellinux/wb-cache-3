40|$|Abstract A central {{construct}} {{within the}} positive psychology literature is life satisfaction. Whereas adult life satisfaction {{has been studied}} extensively, the life satisfaction {{of children and adolescents}} has only received attention more recently. This article provides a review of the extant research on youth life satisfaction. Empirical studies (n = 141) on <b>life</b> satis-faction <b>among</b> youth are reviewed. The review details how <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>among</b> youth relates to various other important emotional, social, and behavioural constructs. Evidenced by the review are the conditions that foster positive life satisfaction and the implications of positive <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>among</b> youth. Future directions in <b>life</b> satisfaction research <b>among</b> youth are briefly discussed...|$|R

5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of <b>life</b> <b>among</b> her crew.|$|E
5|$|Davies' script {{takes place}} in two {{distinct}} time frames and required two different actors for the eponymous role: the older Casanova was portrayed by Peter O'Toole, and the younger Casanova was portrayed by David Tennant. The serial takes place primarily during Casanova's early adulthood and depicts his <b>life</b> <b>among</b> three women: his mother (Dervla Kirwan), his lover Henriette (Laura Fraser), and his consort Bellino (Nina Sosanya). The script takes {{a different approach to}} Dennis Potter's 1971 dramatisation; instead of Potter's focus on sex and misogyny, the 2005 serial focuses on Casanova's compassion and respect for women.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining an {{affordable}} food {{supply to the}} city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family <b>life</b> <b>among</b> the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E

40|$|As {{two primary}} domains of adult life, {{work and family}} are known to {{influence}} <b>life</b> stress <b>among</b> employees. However, because most {{research in this area}} has been conducted in the Western setting, very little is known as to whether demands in the work and family domains are two key sources of <b>life</b> stress <b>among</b> employees in developing countries as well. We investigated life stresses of 239 Chinese employees, based on the work-family interface perspective. We found that work and family demands cause <b>life</b> stress <b>among</b> Chinese employees. Contrary to our expectations, work demands appear to have a lesser impact on life stress than family demands, although the difference is not substantial. Furthermore, while the effect of family demands on life stress is fully mediated by work-family conflict, work demands affect life stress both directly and indirectly through work-family conflict...|$|R

5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto {{vision of the}} primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the Tree of <b>Life,</b> <b>among</b> many others. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E
5|$|Hoste also {{remained}} at sea, cruising in the battered Amphion beyond {{the range of}} the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of Flore's officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of Flore had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of <b>life</b> <b>among</b> its crew. Flore had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.|$|E

5|$|In late August it {{was decided}} that further Fleet Air Arm attacks should not be {{attempted}} as the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. As it was still seen as desirable to destroy Tirpitz, the task was assigned to Bomber Command. On 15 September a force of heavy bombers attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this, Tirpitz sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, and a third raid was mounted on 12 November in which Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of <b>life</b> <b>among</b> her crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the {{ideology}} of kingship. In the Opet Festival, an extremely important ceremony during the New Kingdom, the image of Amun from Karnak visited the form of Amun worshipped at Luxor Temple, and both acted to reaffirm the king's divine rule. Still other celebrations had a funerary character, as in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley, when Amun of Karnak visited the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis to visit the kings commemorated there, while ordinary people visited the funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives. Some may have centered on ritual marriages between deities, or between deities and their human consorts, although the evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose is ambiguous. A prominent example is a festival in which an image of Hathor from Dendera Temple was brought annually to visit the Edfu, the temple of her mythological consort Horus. These varied ceremonies were united by the broad purpose of renewing <b>life</b> <b>among</b> the gods and in the cosmos.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the levels of <b>life</b> {{satisfaction}} <b>among</b> academicians in Turkey and to investigate the effects of demographics on levels of <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>among</b> academicians. A questionnaire-based study was conducted in 648 academicians working in the Universities of Turkey. Data were collected using Diener et al. ’s Life Satisfaction Scale. The life satisfaction levels of the academicians were found to be moderately high in the study. The results of the study indicated that professors have a higher level of life satisfaction as compared to assistant professors, instructors and research assistants. Professors have the highest level of <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>among</b> the all academicians. Among the demographic variables, gender, age, income level, length of service in present university, length of service in higher education, and abroad experience were significantly related to life satisfaction.
