We discuss why the Indian government has not contemplated such a measure, which also leads {{to a discussion of}} whether they might have considered adopting their own cryptocurrency. However, even though the Indian public seems willing to adopt the technology, we find that unlikely. Finally, we show that our application demonstrates that fiat money to cryptocurrency conversion is technically feasible, but the Indian government is unlikely to consider such technology due to issues surrounding monetary sovereignty...|$|E

40|$|We analyze how cooperatives in Northern Italy (Alto Adige and Trentino) {{compete with}} private wineries {{regarding}} product quality and reputation, i. e. if firm organization affects wine quality and winery reputation. Moreover, we examine if cooperatives with {{deep roots in}} their local economy specialize in specific regional denomination rules (i. e. DOC, IGT). Compared to private wineries, cooperatives face additional challenges {{in order to raise}} wine quality, among them appropriate incentives that induce individual growers to supply high quality grapes (e. g. vineyard management and grape pricing schemes to lower yields). The quality reputation of a winery with consumers depends crucially on its winemaking skills. Wine regions differ with respect to climatic conditions and quality denomination rules. Assuming similar climatic conditions within wine regions as well as winemaking skills between firms, incentive schemes to induce individual growers to supply high quality grapes and quality denomination rules remain crucial determinants of wine quality and winery reputation when comparing different regions and firm organizational forms. The data set analyzed allows differentiating local cooperatives vs. private wineries and denotes retail prices, wine quality evaluations, indicators for winery reputation, and distinct denomination rules. We employ a hedonic pricing model in order to test the following hypothesis: First, wines produced by cooperatives suffer a significant reputation and/or wine quality discount relative to wines from private producers. Second, cooperatives and/or private wineries specialize in specific wine denominations for which they receive a price premium relative the competing organizational form. Our results are mixed. However, we reject the hypothesis that cooperatives suffer a reputation/wine quality discount relative to private producers for the Alto Adige wine region. Moreover, we find that regional cooperatives and private wineries specialize in specific wine denomination for which they receive a relative price premium (e. g. Alto Adige cooperatives specialize in DOC relative to private wineries in the region; private wineries in Trentino specialize in IGT denominated wines emphasizing their own brands). Our results indicate regional differences in terms of how cooperatives compete with private wineries with respect to wine quality and reputation. If cooperatives are able to implement incentive schemes to induce individual growers to raise grape quality, they may also gain a wine quality and reputation premium in the market. Specialization in <b>local</b> <b>denomination</b> rules allows private wineries and cooperatives to capture premium prices in different market segments...|$|E

40|$|Most of the world's {{architectural}} heritage consists of constructions in stone materials. These materials conditioned to the architectural {{styles of the}} past and marked connotative characters of entire ancient cities. There is a huge variety of stone materials that have substantially different characteristics {{depending on the type of}} sourced rocks from which they are extracted. Limestone rocks of biochemical origin are widespread in all over the countries both of Latin America and Mediterranean area, where they are often known with the <b>local</b> <b>denominations,</b> such as calcarenites or tuffs of Matera, Lecce, Agrigento, Malta, etc. These materials are affected by synergistic chemical, physical and biological degradation phenomena caused by the complex interaction between the materials and the environment that surrounds them, i. e. exposure environment. The degradation of materials can compromise the structural behavior of the construction, increasing its seismic vulnerability. The preservation of the {{architectural heritage}} built with stone materials requires restoration works able to neutralize or, at least, to reduce the degradation phenomena of these extremely vulnerable materials. The choice of the consolidating and protective products plays a key role in the effectiveness of restorations: their wrong choice can determine the uselessness of restoration works, but it can also worsen the diseases of the stones and irreparably damage architectural heritage. However, the effectiveness of these products is highly dependent on the stone characteristics and on the many interactions that occur among the stone, the product and the exposure environment over the short and long time after the restoration treatment. This paper illustrates a multidisciplinary research activity on the use of innovative product based on lime and nanoparticles of graphene in restoration and seismic retrofit of masonry constructions in limestone materials. The use of graphene as nanotechnological component overcomes the drawbacks of traditional products based on lime, providing extraordinary physical properties (hardness, strength and flexibility) to the investigated product.

5000|$|Wine was {{introduced}} into Corsica by the Greeks. The Romans developed the wine industry, and imported Corsican wines. The island's wines were highly regarded during the Renaissance: in the Gallery of Maps in the Vatican, which depicts {{the regions of}} Italy and its surrounding islands, the 16th century Italian cosmographer Ignazio Danti wrote above the map of Corsica: [...] "Corsica has received four major gifts from Nature: its horses, its dogs, its proud and courageous men and its wines, most generous, that princes hold in the highest esteem!" [...] In 1887 the vineyards of the island were hit by the Phylloxera. A dramatic change in the island's viticulture happened {{at the beginning of}} the 1960s. At that time about 20,000 pied-noirs (French colonists from Algeria) had to leave north Africa and resettled in Corsica. The French state helped them with huge capitals, that were used among others to plant large vineyards on the east coast (which had been cleared from malaria few years before), introducing southern varieties which changed the profile of Corsican wines. The vineyard area, that amounted to 4,700 hectares in 1959, rose to 28,000 hectares in 1978. wine production rose accordingly from 284,000 hectoliters in 1966 to 2 millions hectoliters in 1978. This expansion had as result a massive overproduction, which was fought by the state by uprooting a great part of the vines. This measure brought the surface in 1993 back to 7,609 hectares, 1,994 being of AOC wine, and the production to 410,581 hectoliters, 76,512 being of AOC wine.In 1972, the French Ministry of Agriculture established the denomination [...] "Vin de Corse", the AOC denomination for Corsican wines. Moreover, each production area can have an additional <b>local</b> AOC <b>denomination.</b> These are as of 2014 eight: Porto Vecchio, Figari, Sartène, Ajaccio, Calvi, Patrimonio, Cap Corse (the latter with the Muscat du Cap Corse, a sweet dessert wine). AOC wines must obey to several prescriptions: sugar cannot be added; at least 50% of the grapes must come from traditional Corsican grapes; the yield cannot be higher than 50 hectoliters each hectare; the grapes must be planted only along slopes or dry plateaus. The most important wine regions in the island are: the territory around Patrimonio, at the south west of the Cap Corse peninsula; the Ajaccio region; the Sartène region; the Balagne, and the Cap Corse.Besides the AOC, local wines are also produced in Corsica, under the denomination [...] "Vin du pays".|$|R
40|$|Cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) is an {{exquisite}} subtropical fruit, intensively cultivated in Spain, but generally underutilized in the inter-Andean valleys where the species shows high botanical diversity. Economic use of Andean cherimoyas currently remains far below potential levels. In 2006 - 2007, a cherimoya value chain {{analysis was performed}} through a market survey in which structured interviews were made with 172 cherimoya producers and 346 cherimoya traders in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Two main flows of cherimoya were observed in all markets studied. The first flow pertains to locally produced cherimoya fruits that have irregular quality due to high infestation levels of fruit flies. These fruits are inadequately packed and transported, and consequently have a low economic value to both producers and traders. The other flow consists of cherimoyas produced in the Huarochir province (Lima Department, Peru), commonly known as 'Cumbe', a collective trademark registered by producers from the Cumbe Valley. This trademark {{which serves as a}} geographical indication currently lacks appropriate legal protection. Consequently, illegal application of the 'Cumbe'-label is widespread. 'Cumbe' fruits are intensively selected and graded on wholesaler markets in the Lima metropolis and distributed in wooden crates to main markets both within Peru and to its neighboring countries Ecuador and Bolivia. Fruit characterization data show that 'Cumbe' fruits are partly distinctive from other Andean cherimoyas. The value of the collective trademark 'Cumbe' should thus be attributed not only to elite germplasm and appropriate cultivation practices, but also to the intensive selection, grading, and packaging process. As a result of higher product quality, 'Cumbe' cherimoya market prices are up to twice or more of the prices for <b>local</b> cherimoyas. More <b>denominations</b> of origin, locally managed by producer organizations, are valuable tools for both conserving on-farm cherimoya diversity and additional income generation for the rural Andean poor...|$|R
