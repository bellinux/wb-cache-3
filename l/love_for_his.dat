5|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} attempting to explain his disappearance: that he committed suicide, was murdered by his Persian or Turkish enemies, or arrested and exiled to Siberia by the Special Corps of Gendarmes, among others. Given his <b>love</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> children and their young age, it is generally disregarded that Abovian committed suicide. Writer Axel Bakunts put forward the theory that Abovian was in Western Europe engulfed in the Revolutions of 1848.|$|E
5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his <b>love</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E

The play focuses on Caligula's <b>love</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> sister Drusilla and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.|$|E

She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in psychosexual development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic <b>love</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able {{to let go of the}} rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his <b>love</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E
