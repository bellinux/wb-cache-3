30|$|Many industries, such as textiles, cosmetics, <b>leather,</b> <b>pulp</b> mills, printing, dye synthesis, {{foods and}} {{plastics}} industries widely use dyes as coloring agents. The removal of color from effluents discharged from these industries {{is of great}} concern from the environmental viewpoint because most of these dyes are toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic (Joshi et al. 2008). Dyes, even in low concentrations, are visually detected and affect the aquatic life and food web. The discharge of colored wastes into receiving streams not only affects the esthetic nature but also interferes with transmission of sunlight into streams and therefore hinders photosynthesis in aquatic plants (Kagalkar et al. 2010). In the present study, methylene blue (MB) has been chosen as a model dye. Methylene blue is a basic dye of thiazine group and {{is also known as}} swiss blue and tetramethyl thionine. It appears as a dark green powder that yields a blue solution when dissolved in water. MB has wide applications including cottons or wools dyeing, paper coloring, temporarily coloring hair, and coating for paper stock (Wu et al. 2009). Although not strongly hazardous, it can cause some harmful effects in humans such as heartbeat increase, vomiting, shock, cyanosis, jaundice, quadriplegia, and tissue necrosis. Hence, their removal from industrial effluents before discharging into the environment is extremely important.|$|E

A área de estudo localiza-se na cidade do Rio de Janeiro e foi ocupada por uma fábrica de vidros por cerca de quarenta anos e comprada para construção de condomínios residenciais. A área de estudo passou um processo de gerenciamento {{ambiental}} que contemplou diversos estudos ambientais para aquisição de dados e delimitar a contaminação, horizontal e verticalmente. O teste de bancada realizado com o reagente químico polissulfeto de cálcio demonstrou ser eficiente para reduzir as concentrações de cromo hexavalente em solo e água subterrânea. Com base nos dados adquiridos neste teste foi possível calcular a dose de injeção do polissulfeto de cálcio. Foram realizados setenta pontos de sondagem, pela técnica direct push, para injetar duzentos e cinquenta e dois mil e trinta litros de solução de polissulfeto de cálcio e água, sendo aproximadamente três mil e quinhentos litros por ponto de injeção. Os resultados após a injeção demonstraram que o polissulfeto de cálcio conseguiu remover o cromo hexavalente que estava adsorvido ao solo e reduziu a concentração de cromo hexavalente na água subterrânea entre quarenta e seis e sessenta e sete e noventa e nove e noventa e cinco por cento, após dezenove meses da injeção. Dessa forma, comprovou a eficiência deste reagente químico para remediação de áreas contaminadas por cromo hexavalente, assim como foi observado nos artigos técnicos de estudos de casos nos Estados Unidos e Europa.

This dissertation {{presents the results}} obtained in the remediation process remediation of a contaminated area by hexavalent chromium applying the technology in situ chemical remediation (ISCR). The study area is located in the Rio de Janeiro city and was occupied by a glass factory for forty years and purchased for construction of residential condominiums. Chromium is an important metal for the industry and is used in various products and processes, such as electroplating, <b>leather</b> treatment, <b>pulp,</b> wood preservation, and refractory manufacturing. The trivalent chromium is essential from a nutritional point of view, non-toxic and poorly absorbed in the body, acting in the maintenance of some functions. Cr(III) is the most common being found and occurs naturally, since the element Cr(VI) can occur naturally, but in low concentrations, if the groundwater has geochemical conditions the Cr (III) can be oxidize to Cr (VI). The hexavalent chromium is the most dangerous valence state and, according to ATSDR (two thousand and twelve), have greater mobility in the groundwater, being carcinogenic by inhalation of high doses of soluble chromate salts. The mobility of hexavalent chromium is high in soil and groundwater because it is not adsorbed by the soil in that valence state, on the other hand when it is in trivalent form is strongly adsorbed by the soil, forming insoluble precipitates, having low mobility in soil and groundwater. The hexavalent chromium remediation by in situ chemical reduction using calcium polysulfide {{has been the subject of}} several field studies documented in the literature, both for soil and groundwater from the Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) (Storch, et al., two thousand and two; Graham, et al., two thousand and six; Charboneau, et al., two thousand and six; Wazne, et al., two thousand seven a; Wazne, et al., two thousand seven b; Chrysochoou, et al., two thousand and ten; Chrysochoou & Ting, two thousand and eleven; Pakzadeh & Batista, two thousand and eleven; Chrysochoou, et al., two thousand and twelve). Calcium polysulfide is a fertilizer to soil and commercially available and has been used in some remediation studies cases for reducing hexavalent chromium in soil and groundwater. Being commercially available and used as fertilizer, it is a relatively cheap chemical reagent in comparison with other chemical compounds exclusively developed for this purpose. The stoichiometric demand and the chemical kinetics of the reduction of Cr (VI) by the calcium polysulfide in aqueous solution was studied by Graham et al. (two thousand and six) from the chromite ore processing residue (COPR). With this study it was reported that a molar ratio of a point sixty-six is required (close to the theoretical value of one point five) and a first-order kinetics with an initial concentration of twenty-six eight point mg/L and pH of the CPS solution around eleven point five, with the presence of oxygen. Thus, the hexavalent chromium is reduced to chromium hydroxide, slightly water soluble compound which is precipitated to the soil. The trivalent chromium has low solubility, toxicity, mobility, reactivity and is considered stable. There are various application techniques of chemical reagents in the underground environment, and choosing the most appropriate method for each area depends on the type of contaminant, geological environment, groundwater and surface interference, depth, thickness and size of the contaminated area. As described by Suthersan (mil novecentos ninety-six), the injection of chemical reagents has to achieve two objectives: (one) creating and maintaining an ideal redox environment and other p...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Düşük köpürme özelliğine sahip, soğuk suda iyi çözünebilen ve bu özellikleri nedeniyle düşük konsantrasyonlarda bile etkili olan noniyonik yüzey aktif maddeler çok geniş bir kullanım alanına sahiptirler. Noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerden nonil fenol etoksilatlar kısa süre öncesine kadar yüzey aktif madde pazarının % 80 ‘ini oluşturan türler olarak bu pazarda ciddi bir paya sahiptiler. Sucul ortamda yarattıkları olumsuz etkiler anlaşılana kadar nonil fenol etoksilatlar kağıt, tekstil, deri, gıda, boya gibi bir çok endüstriyi kapsayan geniş bir yelpazede yaygın olarak kullanılmaktaydılar. Ancak 1990 ‘lı yılların başlarında endokrin bozucu ve toksik etkilerinin fark edilmesinin ardından nonil fenol etoksilatların yerine kullanılabilecek başka bir noniyonik yüzey aktif madde arayışına girilmiştir. Gelinen bu aşamada birinci alternatif olarak toksik etkileri bilinmeyen, yüksek biyolojik bozunurluğa sahip ve yüzey aktif madde olarak uygulamada nonil fenol etoksilatları ikame edebilecek nonil alkol etoksilatlar görülmektedir. Bahsedilen özellikleri nedeniyle nonil alkol etoksilatların üretimleri ve kullanımları gün geçtikçe artmakta ve yaygınlaşmaktadır. Her ne kadar bilinen herhangi toksik, kanserojenik veya mutajenik etkiye sahip olmasalar da, giderek artan miktarda üretilen ve kullanılan alkol etoksilatların arıtılabilirliklerinin araştırılması ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Literatürde alkol etoksilatların biyolojik olarak arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili gün geçtikçe artan sayıda araştırma yer almasına karşın söz konusu yüzey aktif maddelerin fiziko-kimyasal, elektrokimyasal ve fotokimyasal arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili sınırlı ve yetersiz sayıda araştırma mevcuttur. Bu çalışmanın amacı alkol etoksilatlara örnek teşkil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eter (Brij 30) ‘in 20 mg/L konsantrasyonundaki sulu çözeltilerinin koagülasyon, elektrokoagülsyon ve TiO 2 /UV-A fotokatalitik oksidasyon prosesleri esas alınarak fizikokimyasal ve kimyasal yöntemler ile arıtılabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve maksimum Brij 30 ve organik madde (TOK) giderimini sağlayacak en uygun proses reaksiyon koşullarının belirlenmesidir. Yukarıda belirtilen amaç doğrultusunda yürütülen deneysel çalışmadan elde edilen sonuçlar koagülasyon-flokülasyon ve çelik elektrotların kullanıldığı elektrokoagülasyon proseslerinin gerek Brij 30 gerekse organik madde gideriminde istenilen verimi sağlamadığını göstermiştir. İki farklı TiO 2 katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon deneylerinde Aeroxide PF 2 heterojen katalizörü ile yine istenilen düzeyde giderme verimleri elde edilememiştir. Buna karşılık Degussa P 25 TiO 2 heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon denemelerinde uygun reaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde gerek Brij 30 ‘un tamamı giderilmiş, gerekse % 90 civarında organik madde minerilizasyonu gerçekleştirilmiştir. Elde edilen bu sonuçlardan hareketle Degussa P 25 TiO 2 xvi heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak UV-A ışınımı altında alkol etoksilatları temsil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eterin sulu çözeltilerden uygun reareaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde etkin şekilde arıtılabildiği sonucuna varılmıştır. Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have low}} foaming properties, are highly soluble {{in cold water}} and are effective even in very low concentrations in water. Because of these advanteges, nonionic surfactants are widely used surface active substances especially in the industries such as <b>leather,</b> food, <b>pulp</b> and paper, cosmetics etc. Nonylphenol ethoxylates which used to dominate the surfactant market with a consumption rate of 80 %, {{have been the most}} preferred nonionic surface active compound. Nonylphenol ethoxylates are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use nonylphenol ethoxylates for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In early 90 ‘s the toxic and endocrine distrupting effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the aquatic environment have been revealed. Nonylphenol, a breakdown product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, has been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen. Concerns have focused on the potential for nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates to cause feminisation in wildlife, such as fish exposed to nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates contaminated effluents, as well as being a potential factor in the increasing incidence of reproductive organ disorders and decreasing sperm counts in men. Whereas nonylphenol ethoxylates is reasonably readily degradable, its breakdown product nonylphenol is more persistent. It has been determined that these compouns exhibit the estrogenetic activity by mimicing the hormones mentioned. Especially in the aquatic environment, fishes are the most affected organisms. It is known that nonylphenol ethoxylates are also very slowly biodegredable and have bioaccumulating property. After realizing the adverse effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the environment, espacially in aquatic environment, several countries have been taken act by regulations restricting production and consumption of nonylphenol ethoxylates. It was necessary to replace nonylphenol ethoxylates with another nonionic surface active agent. At this point alcohol ethoxylates seem to be the most appropriate alternative due to it‘s high biodegredability, low toxicity, high water solubility and surface active effectiveness. Alcohol ethoxylates are the second largest group of surfactants in terms of manufacture (after linear alkylbenzenesulphonates) and the main group of non-ionic surfactants. The main area of alcohol ethoxylate application is in the manufacture of washing powders, liquids etc. Alchol ethoxylates are classifed as easily biodegradable surfactants, in contrast to previously used oxyethylated alkylphenols or oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers. xviii However, the massive stream of alcohol ethoxylates directed into sewage systems and then to sewage treatment, is required strict control in order to prevent pollution of the aquatic environment. A very important chain in this control is the examination of the biodegradability of surfactants prior to their uses in washing powder formulations. After replacing nonylphenol ethoxylates, production and consumption of alcohol ethoxylates have rapidly increased. This progression brought on the requirement of knowlege on the treatability, biodegradability and toxicity properties of alcohol ethoxylates. There are several research on the biodegradability of nonyl alcohol ethoxylates, however there are very little information about the chemical treatablity of these compounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the treatability of alcohol ethoxylates in aqueous solutions by coagulation, electrocoagulation and TiO 2 /UV-A photocatalitic oxidation processes and to determine the optimum process conditions for the most effective treatment process. As a model nonyl alcohol ethoxylate compound poly(oxyethylene) (4) loryl ether, Brij 30 was selected to be used in the experiments. This study consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter, the purpose and scope of the study was described briefly. In the second chapter, classification of surfactants, properties of surfactants, a brief explanation about toxicity of nonylphenol ethoxyltes, properties of alcohol ethoxylates and treatability of alcohol ethoxylates were defined. In the third chapter, fundamentals of coagulation and electrocoagulation were defined. Basic chemicals‘ reactions which occur during these processes were explained. In the fourth chapter, photochemical oxidation process was described, the fundamentals and basic reactions were explained. The factors which effecting photocatalitic activity were also explained in the end of the chapter. In the fifth chapter, the materials and methods were introduced which were used during the experimental part of the thesis. Since three different processed were used, three different treatment methods were explained. These processes were: classical coagulation-floculation process, electrocoagulation process and TiO 2 catalized photocatalitic oxidation process. For every process the same analytical analysis were applied to the sampes in order to follow the treatment efficiency such as colourimetric surfactant determination and TOC analysis. In the sixth chapter all of the experimental results were evaluated and discussed. In the last chapter of the study the results were briefly evaluated and the most important results were stressed by the explanation of importance. In this experimental study, three different chemical treatment alternatives were evaluated and it was determined that only one of them was suitable to treat model pollutant, Brij 30 compound from its aqueos solution. The first alternative was classical coagulation-flocculation process derived in different coagulant (FeCl 3) concentrations varing between 100 and 1000 mg/L, in pH 6. 5 and 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentration. In this process the least Brij 30 removal was observed with 25 % Brij 30 removal in 100 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage and the highest Brij 30 removal efficiency was achieved with 39 % in 750 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage. These results showed that coagulation-floculation process was not practical for removing Brij 30 from its aqueous solution. xix The second process was electrocoagulation process using stainless steel electrodes and NaCl as electrolyte. Electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6), various NaCl concentrations (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg NaCl/L) and two different current densities (9, 3 and 18, 6 mA/cm 2). When experimental results were evaluated; in 500 mg/L NaCl concentration, current density of 18, 6 mA/cm 2 after 180 minutes 70 % of Brij 30 removal was achieved. In the coagulation-flocultion experiments there was no significant removal result neighter in Brij 30 nor in TOC. The last but the most effective process was photocalalytic oxidation using TiO 2 as catalyst under UV-A radiation. In this experiments firstly two different TiO 2 types (Degussa P 25 and Aeroxide P 2) were compared and it was proved that Degussa P 25 was significantly more effective than Aeroxide P 2 in removing Brij 30 and TOC. The experiments were conducted in 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentrations, in two different pH (original pH ~ 6 and pH= 3) to determine the effect of initial pH, in two different TiO 2 concentrations (1 and 1. 5 g/L) to determine the effect of TiO 2 dosages and for the selected test periods (5, 10, 15, 60, 240, 480 minutes). The aim of experiments were to determine the optimum process terms. In these experiments that in the original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6) and 1 g/L Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage after 15 minutes more than 96 % Brij 30 removal was obtained. Under these experimental conditions only after 240 minutes 64 % TOC removal was achieved. After increasing the Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage to 1. 5 g/L, after 480 minutes of photocatalitic oxidation TOC removal increased to 86 %. In general after decreasing the pH to 3 resulted in decreases the Brij 30 removal efficiencies. The experimental results showed that coagulation-floculation and electrocoagulation processes were not suitable effective treatment methods in removing Brij 30 from aqueous solutions. Additionally very limited organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of TOC could be obtained by appliying these processes. The most effective process was photocatalitic oxidation under UV-A radiation from the three different processes. By using photocatalitic oxidation it is possible to remove practically all of the model pollutant and most of the TOC from the water under mentioned conditions. Even in short reaction periods (15 minutes) high rates of Brij 30 removals are achieved but longer experiment periods (240 - 480 minutes) are needed in order to reach significant TOC removals.
