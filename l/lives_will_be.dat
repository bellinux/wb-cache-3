5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} NES Mega Man title and has similar gameplay and level designs. The game moves on a 2D plane and players are given control of the game's eponymous hero Mega Man. Unlike the original's 8-bit graphics, the game uses 3D character models with super deformed designs. Mega Man's primary abilities include jumping and shooting and he is given both a health meter and a life meter. Mega Man can lose health by touching enemies or their projectiles, while <b>lives</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lost when <b>Lives</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> consumed if Mega Man touches certain spikes, or falls into a pit. Lives and health can be found either dropped by enemies or in fixed locations.|$|E

There are five battle modes in Crash Nitro Kart. Each mode {{can be played}} by two to four players. In the [...] "Limit Battle", {{the objective is to}} attack opponents with weapons and traps while avoiding attacks unleashed by the opponents.
