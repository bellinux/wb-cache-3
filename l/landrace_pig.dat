To elucidate the molecular interactions among diet, pig genotype, and physiological stage, we examined the effect of dietary protein concentration, pig genotype, and physiological stages on amino acid (AA) pools, protein deposition, and related signaling pathways in different types of skeletal muscles. The study used 48 <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs</b> and 48 pure-bred Bama mini-pigs assigned to each of 2 dietary treatments: lower/GB (Chinese conventional diet) - or higher/NRC (National Research Council) -protein diet. Diets were fed from 5 weeks of age to respective market weights of each genotype. Samples of biceps femoris muscle (BFM, type I) and longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM, type II) were collected at nursery, growing, and finishing phases according to the physiological stage of each genotype, to determine the AA concentrations, mRNA levels for growth-related genes in muscles, and protein abundances of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our data showed that the concentrations of most AAs in LDM and BFM of pigs increased (P< 0. 05) gradually with increasing age. Bama mini-pigs had generally higher (P< 0. 05) muscle concentrations of flavor-related AA, including Met, Phe, Tyr, Pro, and Ser, compared with <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs.</b> The mRNA levels for myogenic determining factor, myogenin, myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2 A, and myostatin of Bama mini-pigs were higher (P< 0. 05) than those of <b>Landrace</b> <b>pigs,</b> while total and phosphorylated protein levels for protein kinase B, mTOR, and p 70 ribosomal protein S 6 kinases (p 70 S 6 K), and ratios of p-mTOR/mTOR, p-AKT/AKT, and p-p 70 S 6 K/p 70 S 6 K were lower (P< 0. 05).

Reproductive indicators of sows, fertility (number of piglets born, number of piglets born alive, number of piglets weaned) and milk production, are evaluat. Comparing the results of the observed <b>Landrace</b> <b>pig</b> herd population in the Czech Republic, it found that better results are achieved by breeding Landrace population. The achievement in the observed enterprise is 15. 8 ? 2. 2 units of all piglets born in a litter, 14. 4 ? 2. 3 units of piglets born alive per litter and number of piglets wean per litter is 9. 4 ? 1. 6 piglets.
