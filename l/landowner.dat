40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} a survey conducted by the Organic Research Centre’s Agroecology Programme to gain an understanding of how <b>landowners</b> in the UK are currently using the woody components on their land, in order to assess whether there is potential from <b>landowners</b> to gain more both economically and ecologically from the woody components. This survey was intended to reach a wide audience of <b>landowners</b> that practiced both organic and non-organic farming. Organisations that helped to distribute this survey are listed in Appendix 1. The survey was a voluntary online survey, therefore the assumption is that <b>landowners</b> that took part would have had an interest in this topic and therefore may not be representative of all UK <b>landowners.</b> From March 2011 to May 2011 57 <b>landowners</b> participated in this survey, and results from these <b>landowners</b> are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Why would {{small private}} <b>landowners</b> {{be willing to}} comply or {{cooperate}} with the Endangered Species Act (ESA), given that the law can impose limits on their material interests and rights as property owners? The dissertation argues that <b>landowners</b> possess affirmative motivations through morality and legitimacy that explain their willingness to (over) comply with the law. <b>Landowners</b> feel that the ESA accords with {{their own sense of}} right and wrong (morality) and that the ESA is just (legitimacy). In total 101 nonagricultural <b>landowners</b> were interviewed in three different states where non-charismatic and non-threatening endangered species inhabit private property. Future success of the ESA depends upon co-operative management between the Fish and Wildlife Service and private <b>landowners</b> so empirical data concerning the beliefs and values of <b>landowners</b> is essential. Overall, most <b>landowners</b> felt that conservation of endangered species and the regulation of private property for conservation purposes is moral and legitimate. Evidence of affirmative motivations to cooperate with the ESA among <b>landowners</b> is an important empirical finding because it suggests that <b>landowners</b> are willing to co-operate with regulators and voluntarily make land management decisions that benefit endangered species, a known public good. ...|$|R

Results illustrate the bundle of CES that <b>landowners</b> enjoy and illustrate a range of compatibility and conflict <b>landowners</b> perceive between active forest management and enjoyment of CES.

40|$|Data {{collected}} during interviews with private <b>landowners</b> {{are used to}} identify important constraints on how market-based instruments {{can be used to}} expand woodland regeneration on marginal pastures in the southern Queensland region of Australia. <b>Landowners</b> highlighted three types of constraints: those related to the uncertainty over what rules will govern a mandatory carbon trading scheme in Australia; those related to how <b>landowners</b> can measure and sell their carbon credits; and those related to whether the initiative will be profitable for <b>landowners.</b> Case analysis of the ‘Emissions Biodiversity Exchange Project for the 21 st Century’ (EBEX 21) program of Landcare Research New Zealand are then used to reveal ways in which similar constraints have been successfully addressed in the context of marginal pastures in New Zealand. The EBEX 21 program demonstrates how a government policy initiative can provide support to <b>landowners</b> by: (1) informing <b>landowners</b> about carbon trading opportunities (2) ensuring satisfactory regeneration of woodlands (including the use of appropriate practices for fire and livestock exclusion and pest and weed management) (3) helping <b>landowners</b> measure and verify their carbon credits; and (4) providing a transparent system (through carboNZero) for <b>landowners</b> to engage with potential buyers of carbon credits...|$|R

5000|$|At {{sufficiently}} high levels, {{land value}} tax would cause {{real estate prices}} to fall by removing land rents that would otherwise become 'capitalized" [...] into the price of real estate. It also encourages <b>landowners</b> to sell or relinquish titles to locations {{that they are not}} using. This might cause some <b>landowners,</b> especially pure <b>landowners,</b> to resist high land value tax rates. <b>Landowners</b> often possess significant political influence, so this may explain the limited spread of land value taxes so far.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMarket {{mechanisms}} for forest environmental services are increasingly used for promoting environmental conservation, and their impacts on development are of considerable interest. In Costa Rica a national scheme of Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) rewards <b>landowners</b> {{for the services}} provided by different forest land-uses. We evaluated the impacts of reforestation under the PSA on local development in the North of the country. We applied a fuzzy multi-criteria analysis including socioeconomic, institutional, and cultural dimensions {{and based on the}} individual perceptions of <b>landowners.</b> The impacts of the PSA applied to reforestation are positive; negative economic impacts are balanced by positive institutional and cultural impacts. In most dimensions, the impacts on the poorest <b>landowners</b> are notably positive and generally higher than for upper class <b>landowners.</b> However, the short-term incomes of the poorest <b>landowners</b> decrease as a consequence of reforestation. This problem may engender negative outcomes and reduce the participation of the poorest <b>landowners</b> in the PSA. Positive impacts were stronger for <b>landowners</b> applying to the PSA through a local non-governmental organization...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of private}} lands for public {{recreation}} {{is a highly}} emotive issue in Ireland at present. Conflict over access rights, disturbance, liability and compensation {{has resulted in the}} closure of many sections of the countryside to those wishing to walk, climb, fish or swim. This research examines the attitudes of both the <b>landowners</b> and recreationists towards access to the countryside for walking access. An extensive literature review and a pilot study concluded that the key issue can be surmised into four topics: Disturbance, privacy, liability and compensation. A total of 162 on-site surveys were conducted (n = 85 <b>Landowners,</b> n = 77 Recreationists). The data was supplemented by eight in-depth interviews. Results show that there are many areas of agreement between both groups, access may be restricted (74 % <b>Landowners,</b> 88 % Recreationists), participants should accept the risks involved (99 % <b>Landowners,</b> 100 % Recreationists), recreationists should heed dangers (98 % <b>Landowners,</b> 100 % Recreationists) and that recreation has negative impacts on farmland and on <b>landowners.</b> Differences exist in the data with <b>landowners</b> more aware of the Occupiers’ Liability Act(1995), (P < 0. 001), <b>landowners</b> want compensation for access (P< 0. 001), and <b>landowners</b> should be compensated for work to facilitate access(P< 0. 5). Recreationists are more aware of environmental codes (P< 0. 001), they think that recreation is positive for their health(P< 0. 001) and that it is more positive for the local infrastructure. 55 % of recreationists are willing to pay a mean fee of € 2. 24 to guarantee access, while 69 % of <b>landowners</b> are willing to accept a mean fee of € 6. 27 to provide this access. Results show that a proportion of both groups are willing to cooperate and work together towards an accessible countryside to the benefit of both <b>landowners</b> and recreationists. Future collaboration must work towards an accepted level of access throughout the Irish countryside which eases the concerns of <b>landowners</b> and allows sufficient access for recreationists...|$|R

5|$|An enquiry {{was held}} to resolve the {{question}} of whom should inherit the de Eynsford lands; Eynsford Castle and the other family estates were divided equally between William Heringaud, a powerful <b>landowner</b> in east Kent, and Nicholas de Criol, a smaller local Kentish <b>landowner,</b> {{both of whom were}} descended from William V. The Second Barons' War broke out in 1264 and both men supported the rebels against Henry III. Eynsford, by now unoccupied, was seized by Ralph de Farningham, a royal official, who in turn passed it onto Ralph de Sandwich, a royal judge. De Sandwich squeezed the Heringauds out of their inheritance, making a deal in 1292 with Heringaud's daughter, the lady of Horton Kirby, and de Sandwich and the Criols then became joint owners of the castle. Around 1300, the castle was occupied once again, probably either by the widow of Nicholas or William VI, or a castle bailiff.|$|E
