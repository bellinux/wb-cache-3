5|$|In 1337 Flemish weavers {{settled and}} {{introduced}} {{the manufacture of}} woollen cloth. More Flemish weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The second wave of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> cotton. Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.|$|E
5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E
5|$|Positioned atop a hill {{dominating}} Cubzac-les-Ponts and Saint-André-de-Cubzac, the Terrefort-Quancard castle is a wine {{property and}} family house. The main {{building is a}} limestone rectangular body of living area, covered with slate for the roof. The surrounding grape wines, {{most of which are}} Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, span approximately 70hectares of land. Various vestiges remain, including a wash for <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> horses, and a wind-will for flour.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Indians {{are known}} to use resist method of {{printing}} designs on cotton fabrics, which {{can be traced back}} 2000 years. Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics. Until recently batik was made only for dresses and tailored garments, but modern batik is applied in numerous items, such as murals, wall hangings, paintings, household <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> scarves, with livelier and brighter patterns. Contemporary batik making in India is also done by the Deaf women of Delhi, these women are fluent in Indian Sign Language and also work in other vocational programs.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian {{trade with}} Byblos yielded a {{critical}} source of quality timber {{not found in}} Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons. Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, {{which had to be}} imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of olive oil. In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> other goods to the near and far East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that {{was involved in the}} trade system.

5|$|Seneb's tomb reliefs and {{the false}} {{door of his}} tomb {{indicate}} his wealth and power. Seneb is described {{as the owner of}} several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name. He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{maintained}} an elaborate set of burial customs {{that they believed}} were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife. Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid, desert conditions were a boon {{throughout the history of}} ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in <b>linen,</b> <b>and</b> burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} these changes were the Highland Clearances, by which much of the {{population}} of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. Many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> military service became important sources of additional revenue. Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis, when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846. Some 150,000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster. They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland, but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the {{commercial}} and industrial centres of the British Empire. With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3million. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of <b>linen</b> <b>and</b> cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when it sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began {{to make up for the}} loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.|$|E
