500|$|... "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo," [...] {{written by}} Scott Peterson and {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief, was rated TV-G in the United States. The episode was conceived {{as a means of}} expanding the time machine plot that was introduced previously in the episode [...] "It's About Time." [...] Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, co-creators of Phineas and Ferb, centralized plot elements to satirize time travel films, such as The Time Machine (1960) and the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990). Multiple scenes in the episode were meant to be rather confusing and difficult to understand in order to interest viewers so they would watch the episode multiple times, trying to <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> each time.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may appear}} that the reason some {{students}} are more engaged and perform better in class activities relative to other students is because some are more motivated than others. However, current research suggests that motivation is not concrete or quantifiable; it is “dynamic, context sensitive, and changeable.” [...] Thus, students have the flexibility to [...] motivate themselves to engage in an activity or <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> {{even if they were}} not intrinsically motivated in the first place [...] While having this type of flexibility is important, research reveals that a teacher’s teaching style and the school environment also play a factor in student motivation ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett {{also has}} a {{response}} to the [...] "Mary the color scientist" [...] thought experiment. He argues that Mary would not, in fact, <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red. Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew [...] "everything about color", that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the [...] "quale" [...] of color. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know all the physical facts about it, which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined, and twists our intuitions.|$|E
2500|$|The Lost Hero {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans. Publishers Weekly gave The Lost Hero a favorable review, {{and stated that}} [...] "Riordan's storytelling is as polished as ever, brimming with wit, action, and heart". The novel received a mixed review from Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews, who wrote that the [...] "Greek-vs.-Roman tension tantalizes" [...] and that [...] "incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine." [...] However, she also noted that there are [...] "far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue" [...] and believed that only the die-hard fans would enjoy the book. She said that [...] "unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, they may find themselves hoping {{that it does not}} end with a third Great Prophecy". The Seattle Times Karen Macpherson called the Greek and Roman mix [...] "fascinating" [...] and also said that the [...] "characters are interesting and well-developed, and the richly complex story has Riordan's trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action". Kidsreads, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, stating [...] "I always <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> whenever I read these books, and it certainly helps that I laugh along the way. You’re {{not going to want to}} miss this one!" [...] but also comments on the confusing plot line, commenting that [...] "This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail." [...] The book also received a positive review from The Epoch Times, which said [...] "If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldn’t top his Percy Jackson series—they can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish." ...|$|E

60|$|Here Rollo looked rather foolish, {{but he did}} not reply. The truth is, {{like almost}} all other children, who take an {{interest}} in reading, he was sometimes a little vain of his knowledge; and in this case, instead of listening attentively, and endeavoring to <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> from his father's explanations, he seems to have thought it a good plan for him to help him elucidate the subject to James and Nathan. He exchanged the character of learner for teacher too soon.|$|E

"Now, my lads," [...] said he, {{shutting}} the book, [...] "that's all I've {{got to say}} to you to-day, but before closing, {{let me ask you to}} think like men--not like children--about what we have been reading. The service of God is not a mere matter of ceremonies. Jesus Christ came to save you and me, not so much from punishment, as from sin itself. It is a great salvation. Those of you who may have been swimming with the current know and care nothing about the power of sin. If you think you do, my lads, turn up stream. Try to resist sin, and you'll <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> Only those who are made willing and strong by the Spirit of God can do it successfully. No doubt that remark will set adrift a lot o' thoughts and questions in your minds. To all of them I give you a short text as a good course to steer by: `Ask, and ye shall receive.' Ask light and ask wisdom.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the goal}} seemed very near. He would have {{finished}} his appointment at St. Luke's {{by the middle}} of the following year, and then he would go to Spain; he could afford to spend several months there, rambling up and down the land which stood to him for romance; after that he would get a ship and go to the East. Life was before him and time of no account. He could wander, for years if he chose, in unfrequented places, amid strange peoples, where life was led in strange ways. He did not know what he sought or what his journeys would bring him; but he had a feeling that he would <b>learn</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> about life and gain some clue to the mystery that he had solved only to find more mysterious. And even if he found nothing he would allay the unrest which gnawed at his heart. But Doctor South was showing him a great kindness, and it seemed ungrateful to refuse his offer for no adequate reason; so in his shy way, trying to appear as matter of fact as possible, he made some attempt to explain why it was so important to him to carry out the plans he had cherished so passionately.|$|E
6000|$|Worshipping {{power and}} force and money-mastery as an elderly nerve-ridden woman might worship {{youthful}} physical energy, the comfortable, plump-bodied cafe-oracle had jested and gibed at the ambitions of the Balkan kinglets and their peoples, had unloosed against them that battery of strange lip-sounds that a Viennese employs {{almost as an}} auxiliary language to express the thoughts when his thoughts are not complimentary. British travellers had visited the Balkan lands and reported high things of the Bulgarians and their future, Russian officers had taken peeps at their army and confessed “this is a thing to be reckoned with, {{and it is not}} we who have created it, they have done it by themselves.” But over his cups of coffee and his hour-long games of dominoes the oracle had laughed and wagged his head and distilled the worldly wisdom of his castle. The Grossmächte had not succeeded in stifling the roll of the war-drum, that was true; the big battalions of the Ottoman Empire would have to do some talking, and then the big purses and big threatenings of the Powers would speak and the last word would be with them. In imagination Luitpold heard the onward tramp of the red-fezzed bayonet bearers echoing through the Balkan passes, saw the little sheepskin-clad mannikins driven back to their villages, saw the augustly chiding spokesman of the Powers dictating, adjusting, restoring, settling things once again in their allotted places, sweeping up the dust of conflict, and now his ears had to listen to the war-drum rolling in quite another direction, had to listen to the tramp of battalions that were bigger and bolder and better skilled in war-craft than he had deemed possible in that quarter; his eyes had to read in the columns of his accustomed newspaper a warning to the Grossmächte that they had something new to <b>learn,</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> to reckon with, much that was time-honoured to relinquish. “The Great Powers will have not little difficulty in persuading the Balkan States of the inviolability of the principle that Europe cannot permit any fresh partition of territory in the East without her approval. Even now, while the campaign is still undecided, there are rumours of a project of fiscal unity, extending over the entire Balkan lands, and further of a constitutional union in imitation of the German Empire. That is perhaps only a political straw blown by the storm, but {{it is not possible to}} dismiss the reflection that the Balkan States leagued together command a military strength with which the Great Powers will have to reckon [...] . The people who have poured out their blood on the battlefields and sacrificed the available armed men of an entire generation in order to encompass a union with their kinsfolk will not remain any longer in an attitude of dependence on the Great Powers or on Russia, but will go their own ways [...] . The blood that has been poured forth to-day gives for the first time a genuine tone to the purple of the Balkan Kings. The Great Powers cannot overlook the fact that a people that has tasted victory will not let itself be driven back again within its former limits. Turkey has lost to-day not only Kirk Kilisseh and Kumanovo, but Macedonia also.” ...|$|E
