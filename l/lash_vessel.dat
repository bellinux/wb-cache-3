25|$|The {{warships}} of {{the time}} were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy <b>vessel,</b> <b>lashing</b> the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two <b>lashed</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|BaCo Liner an {{abbreviation}} for ''''Ba''''rge - ''''Co''''ntainer - Carrier, was a shipping service between Europe and Africa owned by Seerederei Bacoliner GmbH of Duisburg, Germany. It used {{a fleet of}} specialized barge carrying <b>LASH</b> <b>vessels</b> which have a very unusual design: they carry both conventional shipping containers, and barges that are loaded through twin doors in the bow, a kind of 'float in-float out' arrangement.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for two areas of airship application are considered. The {{first of these}} are those countries {{where there is a}} need to move consignments that are too large for the existing transport systems; the second are those regions where ground characteristics have resulted in an area totally devoid of transport. The needs of the second group are considered in detail since they also require transport to provide social as well as economic growth. With this problem in mind, a philosophy is put forward for using airships in conjunction with <b>LASH</b> <b>vessels.</b> A specimen design is outlined and the initial costs estimated...|$|R
60|$|Francis {{shouted back}} some indistinct answer. Rinaldo pushed down the helm, and {{a minute later}} the Pluto ran {{alongside}} the other vessel. Half a dozen hands, told off for the work, sprang into her rigging, and <b>lashed</b> the <b>vessels</b> together; while Francis, followed by the crew, climbed the bulwarks and sprang on to {{the deck of the}} enemy.|$|R
5000|$|Containers <b>lashed</b> to {{cellular}} <b>vessels</b> {{are less}} vulnerable to crew tampering than containers on mixed-use cargo vessels, making them less of a risk {{from the standpoint of}} port security.|$|R
50|$|LASH barges {{are loaded}} at inland river and shallow ports. Then, the barges are towed to ocean port's {{fleeting}} areas {{to meet the}} <b>LASH</b> mother <b>vessel.</b> On arrival, the mother vessel crane lifts the LASH barges onto the ships. LASH cargo does not require transshipment, as the movement from the origin to destination takes place with a single bill of lading.|$|R
60|$|The {{members of}} the English langue had each been {{provided}} with short pieces of rope, and before joining their companions in the fray they <b>lashed</b> the <b>vessels</b> together, side by side. The fight was a very short one. France and Auvergne, led by Ralph Harcourt, boarded at the bow, the other five langues at the poop; and so impetuous was their onset that the pirates, who had still scarce recovered from their surprise at being hastily aroused from sleep to repel the attack of the foe who had so suddenly sprung out from the darkness upon them, offered but a feeble resistance. Many threw themselves overboard, and swam to the ship nearest to them; others were cut down; and the rest flung away their arms, and cried for quarter.|$|R
50|$|At sunset on 18 July, Newport’s Little John and John Evangelist sighted three Spanish merchantmen off Cayo Jutias (west of Havana and North of Los Órganos). They {{proved to}} be stragglers from Commodore Rodrigo de Rada’s convoy from Veracruz, which had entered the Cuban capital ﬁve days earlier. The English {{attacked}} in the darkness and opened ﬁre compelling one ship to reverse course. The following morning the English closed in on the remaining pair: the 150 ton Nuestra Señora del Rosario Captained by Miguel de Acosta and a 60-ton pinnace Nuestra Señora de la Victoria under Juan de Borda. The Spaniards had <b>lashed</b> both <b>vessels</b> together, and a long-range artillery exchange commenced which the English got the better off, severely damaging Victoria. The English then closed amidships with the Victoria and managed to board her and ferocious hand-to-hand combat soon followed. Newport killed the Spanish captain in the melee that followed but soon after his right arm was struck off by another Spaniard trying to protect his captain. However Newport was saved by a sergeant of arms who killed his would be assailant. The Spanish were soon driven from the vessel and the English suffered five killed and sixteen wounded (including Newport) while the Spanish losses were higher.|$|R
25|$|Loch Vennachar was {{considered}} an unlucky ship narrowly surviving a cyclone in the Indian Ocean in June 1892. Around 8pm on 3 June, the barometer began to fall ominously and the sail was promptly shortened. At approximately 5.00am as darkness lifted it showed terrific head seas that swept down upon the <b>vessel,</b> <b>lashed</b> by the North-East gale. Two large waves approached the ship. Loch Vennachar rode the first wave and sank into the trough at the other side. While in this position, the second wave came on and broke on deck {{with such force that}} it broke the foremast, mainmast and the mizzen topmast. Without her masts to steady her, the Loch Vennachar rolled dangerously in heavy seas. After 9 days, the weather eased and the crew were able to rig a spar forward and sail on the damaged mizzen. After 5 weeks of sailing, she arrived at Port Louis, Mauritius. Although her stay lasted 5 months while new spars were sent from England, repairs only took 10 days to complete. Captain Bennett was awarded the Lloyd's Medal for his leadership and bravery at sea.|$|R
2500|$|McDougall {{reported}} that the final three prahus {{did not attempt to}} escape like the first three had and they fought with determination even after all of the Sarawakian guns were brought to bear on them. One of the prahus was run over just as the second and split in two while the largest and final vessel was destroyed by gunfire and sank with a valuable cargo of gold and jewels. McDougall later said: [...] "The poor captives, who were all made fast below as we came up to engage them, were doubtless glad when our stem opened the sides of their ships, and thus let them out of prison. Few, comparatively, were drowned, being mostly all good swimmers. All those who were not <b>lashed</b> to the <b>vessels,</b> or killed by the Illanuns, escaped. Our decks were soon covered with those we picked up, men of every race and nation in the Archipelago, who had been captured by the pirates in their cruise, which had already lasted seven months." [...] McDougall also confirmed the loss of at least one dead and two wounded while several of the pirates were killed or wounded, most having been hit by cannon and rifle fire. In all at least 100 Sulus became casualties while many others escaped to the shore and retreated into the jungle.|$|R
6000|$|But our adventurers {{had no such}} gales {{as those}} we mean, or any such seas to withstand. The wind blew fresh from the south, and Michigan can get up a very respectable swell at need. Like the seas in all the great lakes, it was short, and all the worse for that. The larger the expanse of water over which the wind passes, the longer is the sea, and the easier is it for the ship to ride on it. Those of Lake Michigan, however, were quite long enough for a bark canoe, and glad enough were both Margery and Dorothy when they found their two little <b>vessels</b> <b>lashed</b> together, and wearing an air of more {{stability}} than was common to them. Le Bourdon's sail was first spread, and it produced an immediate relief from the washing of the waves. The drift of a bark canoe, in a smart blow, is considerable, it having no hold on the water to resist it; but our adventurers fairly flew {{as soon as the}} cotton cloth was opened. The wind being exactly south, by steering due north, or dead before it, it was found possible to carry the sail in the other canoe, borne out on the opposite side; and from the moment that was opened, all the difficulty was reduced to steering so [...] "small," [...] as seamen term it, as to prevent {{one or the other of}} the lugs from jibing. Had this occurred, however, no very serious consequences would have followed, the precaution taken of lashing the craft together rendering capsizing next to impossible.|$|R
