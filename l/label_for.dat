5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} <b>label</b> <b>for</b> THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing <b>label</b> <b>for</b> a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E

5|$|Advertising {{alcohol on}} {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the <b>label</b> <b>for</b> its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.|$|E

5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU.

5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records.

After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record <b>label</b> <b>for</b> his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the major}} record {{companies}} dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim {{to be signed}} to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie <b>label</b> <b>for</b> their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} the repeated acquisition of <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> data items when the labeling is imperfect.

We show that the repeated-labeling strategies proposed acquire more <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> difficult examples automatically. Among these strategies, the integrated one, combining {{the uncertainty of the}} multiple label with the uncertainty predicted from classification models, performs better than the strategies based on the two uncertainties respectively.

40|$|In two studies, {{we tested}} the {{relationship}} between children’s label-learning experience and label-learning ability within diverse superordinate categories with complex perceptual organization (animals, clothing, foods). Using both quasi-experimental and experimental designs, we examined 18 - and 24 -month-old children’s ability to generalize <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> novel members of superordinate categories {{as a product of}} their previous experience in learning <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> members of those categories. As predicted, children properly generalized more <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> members of the categories within which they had more label-learning experience than for members of the categories within which they had less label-learning experience. Results are consistent with the idea that children develop category-specific label-learning biases through their experience in learning <b>labels</b> <b>for</b> category members; they carry implications for multiple accounts of vocabulary acquisition and identify directions for future research...|$|R
