5|$|SR522, named <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> Way within Seattle city limits, {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, {{and includes a}} connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR522 intersects SR523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.|$|E

5|$|From Springville {{north to}} Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> US-89 parallels—and for a {{distance}} overlaps—Interstate 15, following the old Arrowhead Trail, once {{the main highway}} from Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> to Los Angeles, {{through a number of}} downtowns. Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, including SR-77 in Springville, SR-114 in Provo, SR-52 in Orem, SR-180 and SR-145 in American Fork, and SR-73 in Lehi. In Provo, US-89 meets US-189, its only branch, which heads northeast through Provo Canyon to Heber City, connecting to I-80 and bypassing Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b> North of Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the old road through a gap in the Traverse Mountains (elevation 4800 feet/1500 m) into the Salt Lake Valley. The routes split in Draper, formerly with a direct interchange north of SR-71, but US-89 traffic must now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to Factory Outlet Drive, and follow this frontage road to the location of the former split. From here all the way to downtown Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> US-89 is marked along State Street, a major northsouth street that ends at the Utah State Capitol. After passing through Sandy, Midvale, Murray, Millcreek Township, and South Salt Lake, State Street enters Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> at the intersection with SR-201 (2100 South).|$|E

5|$|Sledd {{nominated}} all of {{the original}} faculty members, a majority of whom he had previously selected to be professors at the University of Florida at <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b> The new University of the State of Florida operated in <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> during the first academic year of its existence (1905–06), while the buildings of the new Gainesville campus were being erected. Sledd managed the move of the school's assets from <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> to Gainesville during the late summer of 1906, and participated in the official dedication of the campus on September 27, 1906. When registration for classes was held in Gainesville on September 24, 1906, there were 102 students and {{fewer than a dozen}} faculty members. Sledd received a $2,250 annual salary in his first year {{as the head of the}} new state university and, together with his wife and their young children, moved into the still incomplete Buckman Hall dormitory on the Gainesville campus.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{reaching}} Taylorsville, {{the highway}} intersects I-215. Shortly thereafter, the road passes Salt Lake Community College and enters West Valley City. It soon reaches a single-point urban interchange at SR-201 that {{lies on the}} border of West Valley City and Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b> The highway loses one lane in each direction past the frontage road of SR-201. West of Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City,</b> the highway passes over the surplus canal of the Jordan River as it goes through the neighborhoods of Glendale and Poplar Grove. It arrives at an interchange with I-80 east of Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> International Airport. The road loses one lane northbound beyond 1000 North as it proceeds through the neighborhood of Rose Park in the northwestern portion of the city; the second southbound lane is lost north of 1300 North. The highway crosses the Jordan River before exiting the county.|$|E
5|$|The Bothell Road {{became part}} of the Pacific Highway in 1915, which would {{continue}} north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> Way in 1967, after lobbying from <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> businessmen.|$|E

50|$|On August 3, 1980, Amtrak {{extended}} the St Clair, the midday Chicago—Detroit train, to Toledo, Ohio. The train was renamed the <b>Lake</b> <b>Cities</b> {{and continued to}} use Turboliner trainsets until mid-1981. The <b>Lake</b> <b>Cities</b> schedule allowed both east- and westbound connections with the Chicago—New York Lake Shore Limited, {{eliminating the need for}} Michigan travelers to backtrack through Chicago. Budget cuts led Amtrak to discontinue service to Toledo on April 1, 1995.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few years}} before the Erie's 1960 merger with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, the <b>Lake</b> <b>Cities</b> began running into the Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, rather than the Erie's Pavonia Terminal, in Jersey City. Between 1961 and 1962, the train {{was known as the}} [...] "Chicago Lake Cities/Buffalo Lake Cities", but reverted to <b>Lake</b> <b>Cities</b> again. Sleeper service ended on October 28, 1962. In {{connection}} with the 1964 World's Fair in New York, the <b>Lake</b> <b>Cities</b> was renamed The World's Fair from April 26 until October 25, 1964. Originally routed via Port Jervis en route to Bingamton over the traditional Erie lines, by {{the latter part of the}} 1960s it was routed over the Lackwanna's Poconos line after the elimination of the Phoebe Snow line in 1966. On November 28, 1966, the <b>Lake</b> <b>Cities</b> regained diner and sleeper service to compensate for the withdrawal of the Phoebe Snow (which had its final run the previous day), but by 1967 the sleeping service went no further west than Marion, Ohio, while the dining car stopped at Huntington, Indiana.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} and completion of Interstate 5 through North Seattle spurred considerable suburban {{development in the}} 1950s. Northgate and <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> were annexed into the city of Seattle in 1954, and the city's Seattle Transit System expanded bus service into the area. The new service included a shuttle that ran at a significant loss for several years before being cancelled in the late 1950s. A second attempt at serving the north end with bus service was launched in 1963, with existing routes extended north towards Northgate and <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> later that year.|$|E
5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City</b> on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>City.</b>|$|E
