Mystical experiences in particular places are known to all cultures. Every so often, such places become sacred. The author proposes a hypothesis that the following complex of geological and geophysical prerequisite factors is of importance to the sacralization of a place: regional and local active faults, <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies,</b> regional and <b>local</b> lithospheric stresses, and regional seismic activity. The following cause and effect chain is assumed: Along faults and at fault intersections, the crust exhibits increased permeability over geological time scales. This creates conditions conducive to the occurrence of ore concentrations and magmatic bodies generating <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Geomagnetic storms modulate {{the intensity of the}} geomagnetic field at these anomalies.

Small refers to those cases where the solar wind proton's thermal gyroradius is arbitrarily taken to be greater than 0. 1 radius of the object under investigation.

The collisionless Boltzmann equation, neglecting the magnetic field, is used to calculate steady-state profiles of density and velocity around the obstacle. A low density plasma void in the umbral region and a compression in the penumbral region are clearly found.

30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} cause of annual {{variations}} in the geomagnetic total intensity that are often seen especially in the volcanic areas. As a hypothesis of the cause, a model was proposed, in which such a change is produced by changes in the inhomogeneous magnetization of near-surface rocks due to temporal changes of the atmospheric temperature. This hypothesis was tested by field and laboratory experiments. First, amplitude and phase difference of annual variations in the total intensity and ground temperature data were determined by time series analyses. Considering thermal diffusion from the surface into the ground, the phase difference between the total intensity and temperature was converted to a characteristic depth, and then the amplitude of annual temperature variation at the depth was estimated. Finally, the observed total intensity variations were compared with the expected change {{on the basis of}} the temperature dependence of rock’s magnetization obtained by a laboratory experiment and the <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> obtained by a magnetic survey at each magnetometer site. A good agreement between the observed and expected changes was obtained, which strongly suggests that the hypothesis is correct. It was also shown that a correction of annual variations by using temperature data will enable us more accurate detection of volcanomagnetic signals.|$|E

40|$|Thellier–Thellier paleointensity {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} a collection of glasses from three very recent submarine axial flows. Two were erupted along the Juan de Fuca ridge at around 46 °N and one along the East Pacific Rise South at around 18 °S. The within-sample dispersion of paleointensity results from the ‘Animal Farm’ flow (EPR south) is very low and leads to a well-defined mean value of 35. 6 ± 1 μT (95 % error on the mean) based on 11 glass chips from four independent samples. Today’s geomagnetic field intensity in the area is 31. 2 μT. Comparing Animal Farm results with published field model reference curves developed for the past 400 yr suggests an eruptive date estimated between 1880 A. D. and 1950 A. D. (taking into account different sources of errors). This is consistent with qualitative evidence for the age of this flow and constitutes the first precise demonstration of using paleointensity as a dating tool for very recent mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). However in the Juan de Fuca area results show a more erratic pattern with samples varying by up to 30 % higher and lower from the expected value of about 55 μT. The dispersion is attributed to the large <b>local</b> crustal <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> in this area {{that can lead to}} inconsistent intensity values over the same unit. <b>Local</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> should thus always be checked when doing paleointensity on MORB samples which should also be distributed as widely as possible in a flow unit.

The most important aspect is the search for the seismomagnetic effect; no convincing observation has yet been reported, although calculations 2, 3 indicate that in many cases it must be of measurable magnitude, and observations of magnetic precursors to creep increments on the San Andreas fault 4 encourage the view that magnetic effects of earthquakes themselves are observable. <b>Local</b> <b>magnetic</b> changes preceding and accompanying volcanic eruptions in New Zealand are very striking 5, 6 and indicate that substantial stresses are associated with eruptions; a quite different pattern of volcanomagnetic changes in Hawaii (P.

Orbit analyses are conducted comprising ΔV and error propagation analysis for the CubeSat mission orbit. First, three possible orbit scenarios are presented {{in terms of the}} CubeSat’s impacting trajectories. For each scenario, it is important to achieve mission objectives with a minimum ΔV since the CubeSat is limited in size and cost. Therefore, the ΔV needed for the CubeSat to maneuver from the initial orbit toward the impacting trajectory is analyzed for each orbit scenario. In addition, error propagation analysis is performed for each scenario to evaluate how initial errors, such as position error, velocity error, and maneuver error, that occur when the CubeSat is separated from the lunar orbiter, eventually affect the final impact position. As a result, the current study adopts a CubeSat release from the circular orbit at 100 km altitude and an impact slope of 15 °, among the possible impacting scenarios. For this scenario, the required ΔV is calculated {{as the result of the}} ΔV analysis. It can be used to practically make an estimate of this specific mission’s fuel budget.

40|$|Repeated imaging of Jupiter's aurora {{has shown}} that the {{northern}} main oval has a distorted 'kidney bean' shape in the general range of 90 - 140 ? System III longitude, which appears unchanged since 1994. While it is more difficult to observe the conjugate regions in the southern aurora, no corresponding distortion appears in the south. Recent improved accuracy in locating the satellite footprint auroral emissions has provided new information about the geometry of Jupiter's magnetic field in this and other areas. The study of the magnetic field provides us with insight into the state of matter and the dynamics deep down Jupiter. There is currently no other way to do this from orbit. The persistent pattern of the main oval implies a disturbance of the local magnetic field, and the increased latitudinal separation of the locus of satellite footprints from each other and from the main oval implies a locally weaker field strength. It is possible that these phenomena result from a magnetic anomaly in Jupiter's intrinsic magnetic field, as was proposed by A. Dessler in the 1970 's. There is presently only limited evidence from the scarcity of auroral footprints observed in this longitude range. We propose to obtain HST UV images with specific observing geometries of Jupiter to determine the locations of the auroral footprints of Io, Europa, and Ganymede in cycle 13 to accurately determine the magnetic field geometry in the suggested anomaly region, and to either confirm or refute the suggestion of a <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E

An important issue to be addressed is how these seamounts affect the generation of a great interplate earthquake at the Suruga trough (often referred to as the Tokai earthquake). So we made a numerical simulation of earthquake generation, applying the rate- and state-variable friction law to the plate interface. Here we incorporated the seamounts in the simulation as an additional normal stress exerted locally to the interface. We then found how the seamounts affect the generation of an interplate earthquake depends on {{whether or not they are}} located in the seismogenic zone. The most notable effect is that the amount of slip immediately before the main shock, often called a pre-slip, tends to be enhanced if they are located inside the zone.|$|R

The circular dipole anomalies appear to represent the effect of intrusions in volcanic pipes or vents rising from these crustal rifts which strike essentially east-west on the islands of Hawaii, Lanai, Maui, and Molokai, and west northwest-east southeast on Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau.

Bibliography: leaves 67 - 69. vi, 69 l illus., maps, tablesA {{geophysical}} and geological {{analysis is}} made of a total field magnetic survey of the major islands of Hawaii. It is established that the regional distortion of the earth's normal magnetic field due to the topographic mass of the Hawaiian Ridge rising in places to over 30, 000 feet above the ocean floor seldom exceeds 150 gammas.

30|$|Additional {{approaches}} to <b>local</b> spherical coordinate <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> analyses have invoked inversions using equivalent point dipoles (e.g., von Frese 1998; von Frese et al. 1981, 1988; Hinze et al. 2013) and spherical cap harmonic functions (e.g., Haines 1985, 1990; Thébault et al. 2006). Spherical cap harmonic functions {{in particular have}} been widely applied for modeling main field and secular variations (e.g., Haines 1985; Kotzé 2001; Gaya-Piqué et al. 2006), and lower-order lithospheric components of the Earth’s magnetic field (Coles 1985; de Santis et al. 1989; Kovács et al. 2011). Lesur (2006) also introduced a ‘quasi-local’ function of band-limited wavelets to model the main geomagnetic field of any subregion of the globe.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions produce significant variations in the geomagnetic field. To investigate possible tectonomagnetic effects related to seismic activity, the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica installed a seismomagnetic network in central Italy; the area was selected after a magnetic noise survey. Geomagnetic field intensity data are simultaneously recorded at four magnetometer stations and at L’Aquila Geomagnetic Observatory, which is located in the same area. The data are differentiated in order to detect <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> field <b>anomalies.</b> The present study reports geomagnetic field observations in central Italy from July 1989 to March 1995 and also discusses the detectability of a tectonomagnetic effect in this area. A variation of about 5 nT over a two-month period January–February 1990. has been observed in the geomagnetic field. No other anomaly has been observed, although moderate seismicity occurred in central Italy during the study period...|$|R
30|$|The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) {{released}} the 12 th {{generation of the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) in December 2014 (Thébault et al. 2015). The IGRF {{is a series of}} standard mathematical models describing the large-scale internal part of the Earth’s magnetic field between epochs 1900 A.D. and the present (see for instance Macmillan and Finlay 2011 for a review and Finlay et al. 2010 a for the preceding generation). It is used by scientists {{in a wide variety of}} studies including long-term dynamics of the Earth’s core field, space weather (e.g., Bilitza and Reinisch 2008), <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> imprinted in the Earth’s crust, or land surveying. It is also used by commercial organizations and individuals as a source of orientation information for drilling or navigation (Meyers and Minor Davis 1990) and has become of increasing interest for space science during the last decade. A task force appointed by IAGA approved the specifications of IGRF- 12 and issued a call in May 2014. The call requested candidate models for the main field (MF) for the Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field for epoch 2010 (DGRF- 2010), for a provisional IGRF model for epoch 2015 (IGRF- 2015) both to spherical harmonic (SH) degree 13, and for a prediction of its annual rate of change, the secular variation (SV), over the upcoming 5 years (SV- 2015 - 2020) to SH degree 8. The term “definitive” is used because any further substantial improvement of these retrospectively determined models is unlikely. In contrast, the provisional IGRF model will eventually be replaced by a definitive model in a future revision of the IGRF when the community will have more complete knowledge concerning the Earth’s magnetic field for epoch 2015.0.|$|R
40|$|If we {{can ever}} hope to {{understand}} the non-seismic signals that the Earth sends out before major earthquakes, {{we need to understand}} the physics of rocks under increased levels of stress. In particular we need to understand the generation of electrical currents in the ground. We have begun to study how electrical conductivity of igneous rocks changes under stress and what types of charge carriers are involved. We show that quartz-rich granite and quartz-free anorthosite both generate electronic charge carriers when subjected to stress. The charge carriers are positive holes (p-holes), i. e., defect electrons on the oxygen anion sublattice. They spread out of the stressed rock volume, the “source volume”, into the surrounding unstressed rocks. Time-varying ground currents are required to generate pre-earth-quake <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> field <b>anomalies</b> and low-frequency electromagnetic emissions. We posit that stress-induced activation of p-hole charge carriers and their outflow from the source volume is the basic process by whic...|$|R
50|$|The lunar swirls are {{coincident}} with {{regions of}} relatively high magnetic field strength on a planetary body that does not, and {{may never have}} had, an active core dynamo with which to generate its own magnetic field. Every swirl has an associated <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly,</b> but not every <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> has an identifiable swirl. Orbital magnetic field mapping by the Apollo 15 and 16 sub-satellites, Lunar Prospector, and Kaguya show regions with a <b>local</b> <b>magnetic</b> field. Because the Moon has no currently active global magnetic field, these regional anomalies are regions of remanent magnetism; their origin remains controversial.|$|R
