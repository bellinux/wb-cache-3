25|$|According to some accounts, captives were {{provided}} with shared buckets to use as toilets, {{and did not have}} access to running water. Although captives share their cells with dozens of other captives, there were reports in 2006 that they were not allowed to speak with one another, or to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another.|$|E
25|$|Since an RMS value can be {{calculated}} for any waveform, apparent power can {{be calculated}} from this.

However, if we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result.|$|E

500|$|While much of {{the prior}} work in {{automated}} virtual camera control systems has been directed towards reducing {{the need for a}} human to manually control the camera, the Director's Lens solution computes and proposes a palette of suggested virtual camera shots leaving the human operator to make the creative shot selection. [...] In computing subsequent suggested virtual camera shots, the system analyzes the visual compositions and editing patterns of prior recorded shots to compute suggested camera shots that conform to continuity conventions such as not crossing the line of action, match placement of virtual characters so they appear to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another across cuts, and favors those shots which the human operator had previously used in sequence.|$|E
500|$|Skinner {{returns to}} the routing center where he tears {{a hole in the}} {{bathroom}} wall and finds a large honeycomb of dead bees. He visits an entomologist to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of the bees and is told that Mulder visited him six months ago about a similar subject. Skinner finds Mulder's file on the matter, copying down the contact information for Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Mulder tells Skinner that a bank near the police station took a picture of the detective, which shows him with Skinner, but the picture is too obscured for Mulder to identify him. Skinner calls Covarrubias, who does not have any evidence to provide him at this time. The entomologist is killed by a swarm of bees. The next day, Mulder and Skinner look at his body, which is infected with smallpox transmitted by the bees. Skinner visits the co-worker of the postal worker who died, who tells him she was pressured to not say anything about what happened by men who demanded a damaged package. At the photo lab Mulder analyzes the photo, which reveals Skinner's identity.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast {{did not look at}} each other while saying their lines and he tried to encourage them to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another, so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E
2500|$|The Antandroy {{adhere to}} a variety of fady (taboos) {{established}} by elders and ancestors. [...] Antandroy women are prohibited from milking zebu. [...] There is a general fady in Antandroy society against killing the radiated tortoise, and a particular Antandroy king was forbidden to so much as <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one.</b> It is also fady to mention the name of a deceased king.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} garnered {{a wide range}} of awards. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76%, based on 169 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "On the strength of its two lead performances Assassination is an expertly crafted period piece, and an insightful <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of the enduring figures of American lore." [...] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews".|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, the characters' on/off romance was resurrected {{later in}} the year, facilitating a plot twist whereby Jack, angered after another {{break-up}} with Ronnie, was seduced by Roxy as revenge for Ronnie interfering in her love life. This resulted in a [...] "who's the daddy?" [...] storyline, which began in April 2008 and continued throughout the year, with both Jack and Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) potential candidates for the father of Roxy's unborn child, though Ronnie remained unaware of Jack and Roxy's liaison. Rita Simons, who plays Roxy, said: [...] "Jack winds Roxy up by suggesting that Ronnie controls her, so she decides to prove him wrong – and kisses him. Afterwards it's really awkward between them. They can barely <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another." [...] In the storyline, Roxy and Jack agreed to keep their affair secret, while Roxy appropriated Sean Slater as the father, and married him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} {{physicians}} {{to know if}} a mutation is connected to a certain disease, researchers often do a study called a “genome-wide association study” (GWAS). A GWAS study will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> disease, and then sequence the genome of many patients with that particular [...] disease to look for shared mutations in the genome. Mutations that are determined {{to be related to}} a disease by a GWAS study can then be used to diagnose that disease in future patients, by looking at their genome sequence to find that same mutation. The first GWAS, conducted in 2005, studied patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). It found two different mutations, each containing only a variation in only one nucleotide (called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs), which were associated with ARMD. GWAS studies like this have been very successful in identifying common genetic variations associated with diseases. As of early 2014, over 1,300 GWAS studies have been completed.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> {{minority}} leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why {{it might}} be employed in specific circumstances. The purposes of obstruction are several, such as frustrating the majority party's ability to govern or attracting press and media attention to the alleged ineffectiveness of the majority party. [...] "We know how to delay," [...] remarked Minority Leader Gephardt Dilatory motions to adjourn, appeals of the presiding officer's ruling, or numerous requests for roll call votes are standard time-consuming parliamentary tactics. By stalling action on the majority party's agenda, the minority leader {{may be able to}} launch a campaign against a [...] "do-nothing Congress" [...] and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House. To be sure, the minority leader recognizes that [...] "going negative" [...] carries risks and may not be a winning strategy if his party fails to offer policy alternatives that appeal to broad segments of the general public.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Yvyes Bigerel and Mark Waid of Marvel Comics {{launched}} an initiative {{to create and}} publish digital comics under the title Marvel ReEvolution. While creating these webcomics, Bigerel and Waid were inspired by {{the manner in which}} time is experienced within comics, as the passage of time in a comic book is ultimately controlled by its reader. Rather than to allow readers to skim through the images on a whim or to increase the space between panels as McCloud suggested, the duo stacked the panels up [...] "like a PowerPoint slideshow," [...] forcing the reader to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> panel at a time. According to Comic Book Resources, this design directly affects how a comic is created and read, as surprises can be better controlled and a letterer could directly control the reading order of text balloons. Rachel Edidin of Wired said of Wolverine: Japan's Most Wanted and Iron Man: Fatal Frontier that [...] "these are comics that truly feel native to the digital format." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
