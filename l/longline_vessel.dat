Trends in catches suggest that the non-significance of the results may reflect the low statistical power resulting from small sample sizes rather than a lack of relationship.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of longfin mako, Isurus paucus is recorded {{for the first}} time in the mid-North Atlantic. Two specimens were caught, including a 215 cm stretched total length mature male, at 42 º 50 'N 36 º 16 'W by a commercial <b>longline</b> <b>vessel</b> targeting swordfish. The genus Isurus consists of two species, the shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque, 1810 and the longfin mako Isurus paucus Guitart, 1966 (Compagno, 2001). The latter is a pelagic, oceanic, probably circumtropical shark, reaching a maximum size of 417 cm total length (Compagno, 1984, 2001). This species is apparently common in the western Atlantic where it was described {{for the first time}} (Garrick, 1967; Dodrill & Gilmore, 1979). The capture of a large female south of Panama City, FL reported by Killam & Parsons (1986), extended this species known distribution into the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|Industrial {{longline}} fisheries {{cause the}} death {{of large numbers of}} seabirds annually. Various mitigation measures have been proposed, including the use of tori lines. In this study the efficiency of a single tori line to reduce seabird bycatch was tested on pelagic longline vessels (25 - 37 m length). Thirteen fishing trips were carried out in the area and season of the highest bycatch rates recorded in the southwest Atlantic (2009 - 2011). We deployed two treatments in random order: sets with a tori line and without a tori line (control treatment). The use of a tori line significantly reduced seabird bycatch rates. Forty three and seven birds were captured in the control (0. 85 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 49 sets) and in the tori line treatment (0. 13 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 51 sets), respectively. In 47 % of the latter sets the tori line broke either because of entanglement with the longline gear or by tension. This diminished the tori line effectiveness; five of the seven captures during sets where a tori line was deployed were following ruptures. Nine additional trips were conducted with a tori line that was modified to reduce entanglements (2012 - 2016). Seven entanglements were recorded in 73 longline sets. The chance of a rupture on these trips was 4 % (95 % c. l. = 1 - 18 %) of that during 2009 - 2011. This work shows that the use of a tori line reduces seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries and is a practice suitable for medium size vessels (~ 25 - 40 m length). Because the study area has historically very high bycatch rates at global level, this tori line design is potentially useful to reduce seabird bycatch in many medium size pelagic <b>longline</b> <b>vessel</b> fishing in the southern hemisphere...|$|E

40|$|South Georgia is a large, old, and {{isolated}} oceanic archipelago in the Atlantic {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean. It {{is surrounded by a}} wide continental shelf which is highly productive, rich in biodiversity and one of the world’s largest Marine Protected Areas. Most of its ~ 1450 species live on the seabed, many are endemic or at the edge of their geographic ranges, but are still quite poorly known. This UK overseas territory is administered by the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and its waters are designated Food & Agricultural Organisation (FAO) area 48. 3. They form an important fishing ground for a well established fishery for the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, a high value fish endemic to the Southern Hemisphere. There are many more fishing than scientific vessels visits to South Georgia and fishing boats, deploy lines at locations too steep or rough for most scientific sampling gear. This thesis investigates the potential for this fishery {{to be a source of}} much needed biodiversity information and evaluates how benthic invertebrate bycatch data is collected by fishing observers. After a general introduction, chapter 2 describes and compares the two longline systems (autoline and Spanish system) used around South Georgia. It also investigates how technical changes in the gear imposed through legislation was responsible for one of the best examples worldwide of successful management on reducing seabirds mortality from nearly 6000 birds yearly to almost zero in the recent years. Historical data was used to show how both gear types have evolved and new weighting regimes adopted. Chapter 3 investigated a method to potentially improve collection of benthic bycatch information by observers, by reducing routine workload. An electronic monitoring system (EM) was designed and installed on a <b>longline</b> <b>vessel</b> to record footage of fishing activity. Data collected was compared to that from human observers, which could optimise that during settings by ~ 89 % of the time spent by the observer. Hauling monitoring operations were reduced by ~ 56 %. Species identification agreement across techniques was high for vertebrate, and for some groups of invertebrates, especially larger specimens. For detection of small benthic bycatch the video technique showed clear limitations but with the expected reduction in workload, more time will be available for observers identify through direct collection of VME taxa by the crew during hauling operations. Chapter 4 examines the composition of benthic bycatch particularly those constituting Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) from trials in well known fishing grounds. Bycatch composition collected did not differ with gear type but significantly varied with area and depth. In total 199 taxa were found in the study period, of which 28 represented new records for South Georgia and at least one species of Holothuroidea (Laetmogonidae) was previously undescribed. These new records are compared with previous distribution and maps showing the previous and new range are shown. Chapter 5 shows the spatial and bathymetric distribution of the most important VME groups using information collected by observers. The amount (CPUE) of bycatch of each fishing gear is compared and differed significantly with gear type system where invertebrate bycatch is higher on Spanish than autoline system. The quality of the data collected by these observers are then assessed and compared with longline trials in the same area. Two methods of observation used by observers are also evaluated showing significant differences in CPUE and numbers of VME groups identified. The general findings, implications and recommendations are then given in a general discussion...|$|E

The most commonly captured species were long-beaked common dolphins Delphinus capensis, dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus, common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncates (offshore stock) and Burmeister’s porpoises Phocoena spinipinnis. Overall bycatch CPUE (catch per unit effort) {{was estimated to be}} 0. 677 animals/set and 0. 007 animals/set for gillnet and <b>longline</b> <b>vessels,</b> respectively. Based upon total fishing effort for the port, we estimated the average of small cetacean bycatch at 2, 623 animals/year (CI 2, 061 - 3, 185) for 2002 - 2007. This work indicates that, in at least one Peruvian port, bycatch and harpooning of small cetaceans persist at high levels and on a regular basis, particularly in driftnet vessels. The formerly unknown practice of at-sea discarding of carcasses stands in sharp contrast with current, high small cetacean discard rates (49 %) found in this study. That, combined with high prices/lack of availability of traditional bait fish suggest that small cetacean bycatch and harpooning could now potentially be reduced through the implementation of bycatch mitigation measures and greater accessibility to preferred bait...|$|R
40|$|Incidental {{by-catch}} {{and associated}} discarding {{are difficult to}} estimate {{on the basis of}} logbook information because they are poorly reported by fishing masters and their importance varies with several interrelated factors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to inform the commonly discarded fishes of the Indonesian tuna longline fishery in the Indian Ocean. The study was carried out during 2010 – 2011 following six commercial tuna <b>longline</b> <b>vessels</b> based in Port of Benoa. Discards composition was dominated by longnose lancetfish and pelagic stingrays which composed almost half of total discards. Almost half of total catch are discards and half of discards are disposed dead or dying...|$|R
