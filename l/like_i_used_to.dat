500|$|The album Anticult was {{released}} on July 7, 2017. Vogg stated about the songwriting process: [...] " [...] album is one that we created together as a band. Our drummer, Michał , [...] a lot with the arrangements and the songs. He's like the co-author of the songs. It's <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do with Vitek [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, Lesnar {{announced}} that he was returning to action, stating, [...] "I feel like a new man. Healthy. Strong. I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> feel". His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round. The result of the fight remains controversial, as Overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight. Lesnar then announced his retirement from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying [...] "tonight was the last time you'll see me in the octagon".|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, {{months before}} his death at age 79, Gore told a reporter, [...] "I haven't seen a sick day in seventy-five years, and I feel as good today as I did thirty years ago. I can't get around <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> but I still am able to walk three or four miles daily. That keeps me in good shape. [...] I eat three hearty meals a day and my {{favorite}} diversion now is playing pinocle. I play it every night. It's great sport for us old-timers." [...] Gore died in Utica, New York {{at the age of}} 79, after having lived in Nutley, New Jersey the previous 13 years.|$|E

6000|$|... "O, Miss Eva, I is tryin!" [...] said Topsy, earnestly; [...] "but, Lor, it's {{so hard to}} be good! 'Pears <b>like</b> <b>I</b> an't <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, no ways!" ...|$|R
60|$|I set it down, private, because {{somebody}} might want ME to spell it next, and so I {{wanted to be}} handy with it and rattle it off <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' said Alfred, 'when I {{hear him}} {{whooping}} about like mad, and jumping and leaping, {{and going on}} <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do, and never shall again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall die. I {{only live}} when I can fall in love. Otherwise I'm dying by inches. Why, man, you don't {{know what it}} was <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get the most grand feelings--like a great rush of force, or light--a great rush--right here, as I've said, at the solar plexus. And it would come any time--anywhere--no matter where I was. And then I was all right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sell a pusson down de river--DOWN DE RIVER!--for de bes'! I wouldn't treat a dog so! I is all {{broke down}} en wore out now, en so I reckon it ain't in me to storm aroun' no mo', <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> when I 'uz trompled on en 'bused. I don't know--but maybe it's so. Leastways, I's {{suffered}} so much dat mournin' {{seem to come}} mo' handy to me now den stormin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so. He always scolded me. He did not <b>like</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{think that}} <b>I</b> {{would go away}} and leave him. I wish that I had never come to Llanfeare. I do;--I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And did He {{send you}} hither? Well--that was more <b>like</b> what <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fancy Him....A grand thought it is after all--a Jew {{the king of}} heaven and earth!.... Well--I shall know soon.... I loved Him once,.... and perhaps....perhaps....' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{club was}} one of those large clubs that look <b>like</b> prisons. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> go there to lunch with my uncle, the one who left me his money, and I always hated the place. It {{was one of}} those clubs that are all red leather and hushed whispers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bort 'em in shops <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> 'ave. I'll {{show you}} the place, Teddy, if we go back. People {{nowadays}} 'aven't no idee of a shop--no idee. Plate-glass winders--it's all Greek to them. Why, I've 'ad {{as much as a}} ton and a 'arf of petaties to 'andle all at one time. You'd open your eyes till they dropped out to see jes' what I used to 'ave in my shop. Baskets of pears 'eaped up, marrers, apples and pears, d'licious great nuts." [...] His voice became luscious--"Benanas, oranges." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{something}} to go on," [...] he announced. [...] "You've {{got to make}} a start to get started. I just liked you at first, and look what it's grown into. You recollect, you said you didn't like my way of life. Well, I've changed it a heap. I ain't gambling <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> I've gone into what you called the legitimate, making two minutes grow where one grew before, three hundred thousand folks where only a hundred thousand grew before. And this time next year there'll be two million eucalyptus growing on the hills. Say do you like me more than the littlest bit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{see exactly}} what you are driving at," [...] said William. [...] "I don't wear an alpaca coat with blue {{trousers}} and a seersucker vest on dress occasions, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do at home. You talk about being cut to a pattern--well, ain't the pattern all right? When you're in Rome you've got to do as the Dagoes do. This town {{seems to me to}} have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations. According to the railroad schedule I've got in mind, Chicago and Saint Jo and Paris, France, are asterisk stops--which means you wave a red flag and get on every other Tuesday. I like this little suburb of Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson. There's something or somebody doing all the time. I'm clearing $8,000 a year selling automatic pumps, and I'm living like kings-up. Why, yesterday, I was introduced to John W. Gates. I took an auto ride with a wine agent's sister. I saw two men run over by a street car, and I seen Edna May play in the evening. Talk about the West, why, the other night I woke everybody up in the hotel hollering. I dreamed I was walking on a board sidewalk in Oshkosh. What have you got against this town, Jack? There's only one thing in it that I don't care for, and that's a ferryboat." ...|$|E
30|$|ST 10 : Learning with my {{mobile phone}} was great, much more comfortable. You can study anywhere; {{no need to}} lug heavy books around or {{anything}} <b>like</b> that. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> play on the train a lot, I loved it! Mobile phones are good because you can play whenever you want.|$|R
6000|$|... "Moss says she's just <b>like</b> what <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be," [...] said Mrs. Moss, [...] "though I {{was never}} so quick and fond o' the books. But I think my Lizzy's like her; she's sharp. Come here, Lizzy, my dear, {{and let your}} uncle see you; he hardly knows you, you grow so fast." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{like to hear}} Mr. Rogers complimented. I am not stingy in {{compliments}} to him myself. Why, I did it to-day when I {{sent his}} wife a telegram to comfort her. That {{is the kind of}} person I am. I knew she would be uneasy about him. I knew she would be solicitous about what he might do down here, so I did it to quiet her and to comfort her. I said he was doing well for a person out of practice. There is nothing like it. He is <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. There were times when I was careless--careless in my dress when I got older. You know how uncomfortable your wife can get when you are going away without her superintendence. Once when my wife could not go with me (she always went with me when she could--I always did meet that kind of luck), I was going to Washington once, a long time ago, in Mr. Cleveland's first administration, and she could not go; but, in her anxiety that I should not desecrate the house, she made preparation. She knew that there was to be a reception of those authors at the White House at seven o'clock in the evening. She said, [...] "If I should tell you now what I want to ask of you, you would forget it before you get to Washington, and, therefore, I have written it on a card, and you will find it in your dress--vest pocket when you are dressing at the Arlington--when you are dressing to see the President." [...] I never thought of it again until I was dressing, and I felt in that pocket and took it out, and it said, in a kind of imploring way, [...] "Don't wear your arctics in the White House." ...|$|E

[...] "The truth is, you look so strikingly <b>like</b> someone <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> know that <b>I</b> feel sure you must be related to her. I do not think I have any relatives of your name. Have you any of mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strangely indeed!" [...] {{said the}} General, {{resuming}} his good temper; [...] "and I acknowledge that I {{have no right}} to be offended with your lordship for treating me <b>like</b> what <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think myself--a man of some firmness and courage.

5000|$|Batum {{noted in}} a 2013 {{interview}} with the Portland Oregonian that as he got older, he was moved from the low post to the wing, where {{he was no longer}} able to make the face-up block a signature component of his game.
