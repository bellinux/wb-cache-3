40|$|When {{automated}} systems {{attempt to}} deal with unstructured text, a key subproblem is identifying the relevant actors in that text [...] -answering the "who" of the narrative being presented. This thesis is concerned with developing tools to solve this NLP subproblem, which we call entity analysis. We focus on two tasks in particular: first, coreference resolution, which consists of within-document identification of entities, and second, entity linking, which involves identifying each of those entities with an entry in a knowledge base like Wikipedia. One of the challenges of coreference is that it requires dealing with many different linguistic phenomenon: constraints in reference resolution arise from syntax, semantics, discourse, and pragmatics. This diversity of effects to handle {{makes it difficult to}} build effective learning-based coreference resolution systems rather than relying on handcrafted features. We show that a set of simple features inspecting surface lexical properties of a document is sufficient to capture a range of these effects, and that these can power an efficient, high-performing coreference system. Our analysis of our base coreference system shows that some examples can only be resolved successfully by exploiting world knowledge or deeper knowledge of semantics. Therefore, we turn to the task of entity linking and tackle it not in isolation, but instead jointly with coreference. By doing so, our coreference module can draw upon knowledge from a resource like Wikipedia, and our entity <b>linking</b> <b>module</b> can draw on information from multiple mentions of the entity we are attempting to resolve. Our joint model of these tasks, which additionally models semantic types of entities, gives strong performance across the board and shows that effectively exploiting these interactions is a natural way to build better NLP systems. Having developed these tools, we show that they can be useful for a downstream NLP task, namely automatic summarization. We develop an extractive and compressive automatic summarization system, and argue that one deficiency it has is its inability to use pronouns coherently in generated summaries, as we may have deleted content that contained a pronoun's antecedent. Our entity analysis machinery allows us to place constraints on summarization that guarantee pronoun interpretability: each pronoun must have a valid antecedent included in the summary or it must be expanded into a reference that makes sense in isolation. We see improvements in our system's ability to produce summaries with coherent pronouns, which suggests that deeper integration of various parts of the NLP stack promises to yield better systems for text understanding...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{interactions}} of hyaluronan (HA) with proteins {{are important in}} extracellular matrix integrity and leukocyte migration and are usually mediated by a domain termed a <b>Link</b> <b>module.</b> Although the tertiary structure of a <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> has been determined, the molecular basis of HA–protein interactions remains poorly understood. Results: Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to characterize {{the interaction of the}} <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> from human TSG- 6 (Link_TSG 6) with HA oligosaccharides of defined length (HA 4 –HA 16). All oligomers bound (except HA 4) with Kd values ranging from 0. 2 – 0. 5 μM at 25 °C. The reaction is exothermic with a favourable entropy and the thermodynamic profile is similar to those of other glycosaminoglycan–protein interactions. The HA 8 recognition site on Link_TSG 6 was localized by comparing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from a 1 : 1 complex with free protein. Residues perturbed on HA binding include both amino acids that are likely to be directly involved in the interaction (i. e., Lys 11, Tyr 59, Asn 67, Phe 70, Lys 72 and Tyr 78) and those affected by a ligand-induced conformational change in the β 4 /β 5 loop. The sidechain of Asn 67 becomes more rigid in the complex suggesting that it is in close proximity to the binding site. Conclusions: In TSG- 6 a single <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> is sufficient for a high-affinity interaction with HA. The HA-binding surface on Link_TSG 6 is found in a similar position to that suggested previously for CD 44, indicating that its location might be conserved across the <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> superfamily.

Despite these glycosaminoglycans binding to non-overlapping sites on the <b>Link</b> <b>module,</b> the interaction of heparin can inhibit subsequent binding to HA, and it is possible that this occurs via an allosteric mechanism.

The association of heparin with the <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> significantly increases the anti-plasmin activity of the TSG- 6. IalphaI complex. Changes in plasmin activity have been observed previously at sites of TSG- 6 expression, and the results presented here suggest that TSG- 6 is likely to contribute to matrix remodeling, at least in part, through down-regulation of the protease network, especially in locations containing heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-stimulated gene- 6 (TSG- 6) is an inflammation-associated hyaluronan (HA) -binding {{protein that}} contributes to remodeling of HA-rich extracellular matrices during inflammatory processes and ovulation. The HA-binding domain of TSG- 6 consists solely of a <b>Link</b> <b>module,</b> making it a prototypical member of the superfamily of proteins that interacts with this high molecular weight polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Previously we modeled a complex of the TSG- 6 <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> in association with an HA octasaccharide based {{on the structure of}} the domain in its HA-bound conformation. Here we have generated a refined model for a HA/Link module complex using novel restraints identified from NMR spectroscopy of the protein in the presence of 10 distinct HA oligosaccharides (from 4 - to 8 -mers); the model was then tested using unique sugar reagents, i. e. chondroitin/HA hybrid oligomers and an octasaccharide in which a single sugar ring was (13) C-labeled. The HA chain was found to make more extensive contacts with the TSG- 6 surface than thought previously, such that a D-glucuronic acid ring makes stacking and ionic interactions with a histidine and lysine, respectively. Importantly, this causes the HA to bend around two faces of the <b>Link</b> <b>module</b> (resembling the way that HA binds to CD 44), potentially providing a mechanism for how TSG- 6 can reorganize HA during inflammation.
