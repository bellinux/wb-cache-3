50|$|In August 1769, Turst {{purchased}} a <b>leasehold</b> <b>house</b> {{on the west}} side of Poland Street which backed on to the site of the Pantheon and built a secondary entrance there. This unbudgeted cost added more fuel to the legal fire. In 1771 one of the shareholders filed a bill of complaint against Turst in the Court of Chancery, complaining of dishonest treatment. In 1773 and again in 1782 Turst in his turn filed complaints against several other shareholders. The outcome of these suits is not known.|$|E

On June 2 the leasehold was sold to Tingley, but the latter, upon learning the facts here given respecting Muller refused to proceed with the contract of sale, and commenced an action for a declaration that the contract was illegal because {{at the time it was}} made the defendant, Muller, was an alien enemy. Eve, J., held that this fact had not been proved, and dismissed the action, and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal, Tingley v. Muller, [1917] L.

As a result, the investors are unwilling to pay a premium for the security of rights when facing political uncertainty.

It is named after the first station master of Pontypool and New Inn railway station (then known as Pontypool Road), Henry Griffiths. Griffiths founded a 'terminating' Building Society to finance the construction of houses in the village so that his workforce could become freehold owner-occupiers, rather than constructing rental or <b>leasehold</b> <b>housing</b> as was the more usual practice in industrial South Wales and Monmouthshire. He lived in the substantial St. Dunstan's House (now demolished) on what is now Commercial Street and his memorial is in St Hilda's Church. Today the site is occupied by a nursing home and a modern house of the same name.|$|R

40|$|Independent Singapore, {{which has}} a {{tradition}} of free trade, has implemented large doses of Henry George 2 ̆ 7 s prescriptions. It has successfully captured land rents for redistribution through its land acquisition, public housing and other programs. These policies have been instrumental in the successful economic development of the island city state. Industrial estates on state-owned land were leased to foreign multinationals for export-oriented manufacturing which created the bulk of jobs in the sector. Commercial developments are built by the program. Affordable 99 -year <b>leasehold</b> <b>housing,</b> built by the state, provided added economic incentives for employment, and helped keep inflation and wages down. Private motor vehicle ownership and usage are heavily taxed. While land-related policies have improved international competitiveness and wealth distribution generally, particular aspects have generated wipeouts and windfalls in an almost lottery like manner. George would have approved of the former but not the latter...|$|R

It finds that (i) mortgage markets have experienced rapid development, which has led to lower private per capita consumer spending volatility this decade; (ii) a downward price correction occurred in the housing market after 2007, which appears to have bottomed out; (iii) the rental market appears to be largely determined by region-specific economic fundamentals-a youthful working-age population and wealth variables; and (iv) a segregation between self-owned house and rental price dynamics exists in this region, rendering the former more sensitive to the business cycle.

Kuo once handled a major urban planning project, saved more than 260 million NT dollar of public funds for the Taipei City Government and had been awarded an excellent performance by the Taipei City Government. Because of her devotion to work, she was appreciated by colleagues and the major. Kuo was promoted as a {{secretary general of the}} Public Works Bureau and after that the first female director general of the Public Housing Department in the Taipei City Government. Kuo had successfully solved sea sand houses, slanted houses, and radiation houses problems. She was reforming public housing rental management system, abolishing unfair manner priority waiting roster, and the first to create <b>leasehold</b> <b>housing</b> for low-income families. In year 2000, Kuo served as a director of Public Affairs of the Presidential Office, minister without portfolio, and chair of the Public Construction Commission of the Executive Yuan in 2002. Meanwhile, she also served as the CEO of the 921 Post-earthquake Disaster Recovery Commission to accelerate the reconstruction works. For Kuo’s great achievement in recovering and revitalizing the 921 earthquake disaster areas, she was elected as the Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award of the National Cheng Kung University in 2004.|$|R

50|$|Mrs. Armistead’s next notable patron was John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. She {{may have}} met the duke through her {{friendship}} with his maternal cousin, Richard Fitzpatrick. Elizabeth Armistead {{was one of a}} number of celebrated courtesans kept by the duke over the years of his extended bachelorhood. It may have been from Lord Dorset that Mrs. Armistead acquired the <b>leasehold</b> of a <b>house</b> on Clarges Street that was to become her principal residence. Toward the end of their alliance in 1777, she appeared in two plays by George Coleman at the Haymarket Theatre. According to Town and Country, Dorset’s patronage ceased abruptly when he embarked on an affair with the Countess of Derby. His desertion was reported to have caused Mrs. Armistead a period of financial difficulty.|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a massive development of new housing {{taking place in the}} UK to meet rising demand predominantly being delivered in multi-owned new estates which include a mix of freehold <b>houses,</b> <b>leasehold</b> flats and models of affordable housing. Since the financial constraints imposed by the government on local authorities {{there appears to be a}} growing requirement for the new residents to set up private companies to manage communal space contained within. This is unprecedented at this scale in freehold purchase and binds new owners to service charges for upkeep and maintenance and for permissions for development in addition to those imposed by statutory legislation. Purchasers are advised that a limited company will be set up to manage a selection of: green infrastructure, parking, roads, lighting and drains. Each resident will hold a share in this company and will then be responsible for appointing voluntary directors from the estate who can in turn appoint a property management agents. This paper investigates the back-ground to the current position and uses case studies and interviews with residents of a number of estates where these service charges are payable to determine how this is working in practice...|$|R
60|$|And so Hilda {{continued}} perforce to live her lonesome existence, {{that was}} only cheered by her husband's short and uncertain visits. Friends she had none, nor did she dare to make any. The only person whose conversation she could rely on to relieve the tedium of the long weeks was her landlady, Mrs. Jacobs, the widow of a cheesemonger, who had ruined a fine business by his drinking and other vicious propensities, {{and out of a}} good property had only left his wife the <b>leasehold</b> of a <b>house</b> in Lincoln's Inn Fields, which, fortunately for her, had been settled upon her at her marriage. Like most people who have seen better days--not but what she was now very comfortably off--she delighted in talking of her misfortunes, and of the perfidiousness of man; and in Hilda, who had, poor girl, nothing else to listen to, she found a most attentive audience. As was only natural where such a charming person and such a good listener were concerned, honest Mrs. Jacobs soon grew fond of her interesting lodger, about whose husband's circumstances and history she soon wove many an imaginary tale; for, needless to say, her most pertinent inquiries failed to extract much information from Hilda. One of her favourite fictions was that her lodger was the victim of her handsome husband, who had in some way beguiled her from her home beyond the seas, in order to keep her in solitary confinement and {{out of the reach of}} a hated rival. Another, that he kept her thus that he might have greater liberty for his own actions.|$|R

She had a copper plate set into the foundations with the inscription:Not Vain but Grateful In Honour of the Society her first subscribers and my first Protectress Ye Honble Mrs. Elizabeth Chudleigh is Laid the First Stone of this edifice June 19, 1761 by me Teresa Cornelys. She also extensively refurbished the house, and added sumptuous furnishings. Much of the furniture was hired - the ballroom furnishings alone were valued at £730 - and she had much of the work done on credit or in exchange for large numbers of tickets to her entertainments. She was already having problems with creditors and seizures of furnishings in February 1762. However, the entertainments were an immense success, particularly the elaborate masked balls. She had to have a new door put in to accommodate the crowds, and attendees included members of the royal family, the Prince of Monaco, the King of Denmark and his entourage and [...] "half the peerage". In February 1770, Parliament adjourned early to enable members to attend one of her masquerades. Laurence Sterne called a visit to Mrs Cornelys' [...] "the best assembly and the best concert I ever had the honour to be at." [...] In Humphrey Clinker, published in 1771, Tobias Smollett writes of [...] "Mrs. Cornelys' assembly, which for the rooms, the company, the dresses, and decorations, surpasses all description". In Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon the narrator recalls that [...] "all the high and low demireps of the town gathered there". Dickens wrote in an article on Soho that [...] "the world was dying to be on Mrs. Cornelys's list." [...] For her concerts, she engaged the best musicians available, including Johann Christian Bach, Carl Friedrich Abel, Stephen Storace and Carl Friedrich Weichsel.|$|R
