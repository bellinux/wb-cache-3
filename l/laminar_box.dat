In order to incorporate the influences of soil, a <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> can be used to contain the soil during experiments. The <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> simulates field boundary conditions by allowing the soil to shear during shake table tests. A holistic response of a structure and supporting soil can thus be obtained by placing a model structure on the surface of the soil in the <b>laminar</b> <b>box.</b> This work reveals the response of structure with SFSI under mainshock and aftershock earthquake sequences.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{development}} and performance of the 1 -g model testing system to monitor the liquefaction occurrence of saturated soils, under subsequent one-dimensional shake table tests. The system is composed of one-dimensional <b>laminar</b> <b>box,</b> cone penetration system, soil model, system for hydraulic soil pumping to achieve loose soil deposit, instrumentation and associated testing hardware. In order to simulate the free-field conditions in the laboratory, the laminates slide on each other using rollers placed between each laminate. The static calibration test results demonstrate that the friction effects between the laminates and the rollers are satisfactorily low. The loosest and the most liquefiable sand deposit is prepared inside the <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> by hydraulic filling process and subjected to four subsequent shaking tests at different intensities. First, the <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> and shake table performance is verified by using time-histories of acceleration and displacement test results.

The previously calibrated numerical model UBCSAND which shows the seismic loading conditions in the free field is used in the simulations.

40|$|The use of {{physical}} scale modeling techniques for geotechnical applications is investigated. The scaling laws to relate a prototype structure to a model are {{developed for the}} centrifuge modeling technique and for the laboratory (or one-g) environment. A theory based on critical or steady state concepts for the constitutive scaling {{of the behavior of}} the soil in a one-g model is investigated. A series of one-g models of varying configurations was constructed in a <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> and subjected to earthquake like motions on a shake table. A total of 73 tests was performed. Most tests were constructed of saturated Nevada sand placed in a loose and dense state in adjacent halves of a <b>laminar</b> <b>box,</b> and the results of these tests were compared with a similar centrifuge test (Model 3) which was performed as part of the VELACS study. Some of the one-g models were constructed with an alternate model sand and an alternate pore fluid to investigate these modeling variations. One-g models were also constructed with the sand at a uniform density throughout the <b>laminar</b> <b>box.</b> The research indicates that there is a significant conflict between the time scaling for dynamic processes and dissipation processes in both the centrifuge and one-g techniques, which means that excess pore pressures generated in the model saturated sand by a simulated earthquake will be less than what would occur in the same sand in the real prototype. This effect is generally more severe in the centrifuge. This implies that model tests performed to investigate liquefaction, flow failure problems, and/or deformation problems in saturated sands may significantly underestimate the potential behavior of the prototype. In addition to the above, the research provides insight into the behavior of adjacent loose and dense sands and indicates the potential for high excess pore pressures to develop in the dense sand. Current practice ignores the potential for liquefaction in dense sands or the development of cyclic mobility in the assessment of the seismic performance of geotechnical structures. ...|$|E

Extensive research has been carried out to investigate solutions to enhance the lateral stability of pile foundations. This research is motivated by the need to install piles in sites characterized by soft subsurface soil conditions, and often times, in seismic active areas. This research work explores an innovative use of geosynthetics to enhance the lateral performance of pile foundations. The static and seismic soil-structure-interaction behaviors of geosynthetics-reinforced pile foundation systems were evaluated using a series of reduced scale physical model tests performed on a shaking table in a 1 G environment. A <b>laminar</b> shear <b>box</b> containing a pile foundation model supporting a single degree of freedom structure installed in different soil bed models was used in the experiments. The soil models included: a layer of synthetic clay (Modified Glyben) underlain by a sand layer (simulating a base case of soft soil); a layer of synthetic clay sandwiched between a sand layer and an aggregate layer (simulating the case of conventional ground replacement for the top soft soil); and a layer of synthetic clay sandwiched between a sand layer and a geosynthetic-reinforced aggregate layer (simulating the case of ground replacement of the top soft soil combined with geosynthetic reinforcement using a microgrid mesh). A series of sine-sweep, harmonic and scaled earthquake tests have been performed to identify the amplification and resonance conditions of the foundation system and to identify various aspects of seismic-soil-pile-geosynthetic reinforcement interaction effects. Lateral static load tests of this system were performed using a one directional load system that was fixed on the <b>laminar</b> shear <b>box.</b> The dynamic and static tests were simulated employing numerical models developed using the finite element program Plaxis 3 D.

40|$|The {{relative}} density {{can be used}} as the main indicator to assess the liquefaction resistance of clean sands. As {{relative density}} of the sand deposit increases significantly following the initial liquefaction, one should expect that the soil can improve its liquefaction resistance. However, earthquake records indicate that densified sand can be liquefied again (re-liquefied) at smaller cycles by the similar seismic loadings. This work aims to clarify the counterintuitive finding that, after the first liquefaction, the resulting significant increase in relative density (induced by settlements and variation of the water level) do not necessarily imply {{an increase in the number}} of loading cycles for re-liquefaction. In this paper, we present a series of experimental results concerning the cyclic liquefaction and the following re-liquefaction of clean sand deposits.

New nurses are therefore overloaded with lots of new information concerning nursing care, documentation, instruments, team etc. This dissertation consists of two parts ? theoretical and empirical one. The theoretical part deals with ARD description, monitoring, technical equipment, work of nurse on ARD and her adaptation process. The empirical part used a qualitative research method. Information was gathered from a semi-structured interview. The current state in context of nurse work with technical equipment on ARD was analysed {{in the first period}} of research. Tutorial material was created on the basis of gathered information which was applied in practice. Feedback on created tutorial material was found in the last period. The focus group was created by 10 respondents who work as general nurses on ARD in selected hospitals. Four goals and five research questions were stated during the investigation. The first goal was to map what technical equipment nurses on ARD are working with; the second goal was to find out how the training of new nurses on ARD is carried out; the third goal was to create training material concerning technology, not only for new nurses on ARD; and the fourth goal was to find out feedback on provided tutorial material from nurses on ARD. Research questions were: 1. What technical equipment do nurses operate on ARD? 2. How are new nurses on ARD trained? 3. What means are used during the training of new nurses? 4. According to nurses, what information regarding technology should a handbook for nurses on ARD contain? 5. What opinion do nurses on ARD have of created training material?The first goal was to map what technical equipment nurses on ARD are working with.

The second goal was to find out how the training of new nurses on ARD is carried out. Research results are different in this area. Every respondent undertook a different form of adaptation process in variously long intervals. The third goal was to create training material concerning technology not only for new nurses on ARD. Training material was created on the basis of discussion analysis with respondents and didactic principles had been kept during its creation (visualisation, connection theory with practise, scientism, adequacy, actuality, feedback, consciousness and activity, individualization and orderliness).

Meanwhile, helical piles are gaining popularity {{as a foundation for}} new structures and retrofitting solution for existing deficient foundations due to their immense advantages over conventional driven pile alternatives. In addition, helical pile foundations performed well in recent earthquakes, proving they can be a suitable foundation option in seismic regions. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the seismic performance of helical piles by conducting full-scale shaking table tests and nonlinear three-dimensional numerical modeling using the computer program ABAQUS/Standard. The experimental setup involved installing ten steel piles with different configurations and pile head masses in dry sand enclosed in a <b>laminar</b> shear <b>box</b> mounted on the NEES/UCSD Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table. The loading scheme consisted of white noise and two earthquake time histories with varying intensity and frequency content. The performance of different moment curve fitting techniques used for reduction of shake table experimental data are compared. The experimental results are presented in terms of natural frequency and response of the test piles. The effects of the loading intensity and frequency and the pile’s geometrical configuration and installation method were evaluated. The dynamic numerical model constructed accounted properly for the test boundary conditions, employing tied vertical boundaries. In addition, the nonlinear behavior of the soil during the strong ground motion was simulated by considering a strain-dependent shear modulus and applying Masing’s loading-unloading rules by the overlay method to account for the soil non linearity more realistically. The numerical model was verified employing the full-scale experimental results, then was used to conduct a limited parametric study that investigated the effect of pile stiffness and the location of helix on its lateral response. The experimental results show that the natural frequency of the driven pile was slightly higher than that of the helical piles. However, the response of the helical pile was close to that of the driven pile, which illustrates the ability of helical piles to perform as good as conventional piles under seismic loading...|$|R

Reduced-scale models of retaining walls reinforced with geogrid layers were constructed in a <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> {{mounted on a}} uniaxial shaking table and subjected to various levels of sinusoidal base shaking. Models were instrumented with ultrasonic displacement sensors, earth pressure sensors and accelerometers. Effects of backfill density, number of reinforcement layers and reinforcement type {{on the performance of}} rigid faced and modular block walls were studied through different series of model tests. Performances of the walls were assessed in terms of face deformations, crest settlement and acceleration amplification at different elevations and compared. Modular block walls performed better than the rigid faced walls for the same level of base shaking because of the additional support derived by stacking the blocks with an offset. Type and quantity of reinforcement has significant effect on the seismic performance of both the types of walls. Displacements are more sensitive to relative density of the backfill and decrease with increasing relative density, the effect being more pronounced in case of unreinforced walls compared to the reinforced ones. Acceleration amplifications are not affected by the wall facing and inclusion of reinforcement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Saturated soils, {{particularly}} cohesionless soils, may liquefy when {{subjected to}} earthquake excitation, resulting in reductions in strength and stiffness of the soil. The consequences have {{shown to be}} devastating to foundations in past earthquakes. For pile foundations, a reduction of vertical or lateral soil resistance may cause failure of the super structure. To study this issue, two unique 1 -g soil-pile tests were conducted. The models were constructed in a <b>laminar</b> soil <b>box</b> which was subsequently placed on a uniaxial shake table. One experiment focused on characterizing the soil resistance of partially liquefied soil, while the other on multi-layered soil {{and the effect of}} its movement and load demands on the nonlinear behavior of piles. These two different experimental configurations illustrate scenarios commonly observed in the field, where the behavior of the soil and the pile merit further investigation. While evidence in the literature indicates that the lateral soil ("p-y") resistance of piles in liquefiable soils is significantly reduced, the shape and amplitude of the reduced p-y curve during pore pressure build-up is not well understood. To investigate this, a single steel pile embedded in homogeneous saturated Nevada sand was subjected to sequential dynamic shaking and lateral inertial equivalent loading. A key goal in the test program was to develop a data set capable of rendering insight into the characteristics of p-y resistance under developing and partial liquefied soil conditions. Test data were used to back-calculate p-y resistance curves for partially liquefied soils. These curves are subsequently adopted in a numerical study of the behavior of piles in partially liquefied soils considering different layering conditions. In contrast, in a multi-layered soil profile, if a loose layer liquefies, large localized plastic demands may be generated in the piles. In the case of concrete piles, these demands manifest flexural cracks in the concrete, which weakens the pile and exposes it to subsequent environmental degradation. During the experiments conducted herein to study this issue, plastic demands in the pile were characterized using curvature profiles coupled with back-calculation of the plastic hinge length and post-test physical observations. Numerical modeling studies demonstrate the applicability of current design- oriented tools to capture these key response parameters needed for desig...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia can {{influence}} fish growth, survival and on larger scales, population structure. These effects {{may be influenced}} by water temperature, and may vary intra-specifically with genotype. In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), the two haemoglobin homozygotes (Hb-I 11 and Hb-I 22) vary in oxygen affinity at different temperatures, which is thought to correspond to variation in hypoxia tolerance. We therefore tested if hypoxic avoidance behaviour in cod 1) depends on ambient temperature and 2) is modified by haemoglobin genotype. In a <b>laminar</b> flow choice <b>box,</b> we subjected juvenile cod to an initial phase of non-escapable hypoxia, and a subsequent recovery phase, where one habitat was kept at 20 % O 2 saturation while the other was raised in steps to full saturation. The experiment was performed at 5 and 15 °C with Hb-I 11 and Hb-I 22 cod. Cod responded to inescapable hypoxia by reducing their overall swimming speed and then, at the initial levels of the recovery phase, avoiding the most hypoxic habitat, irrespective of temperature or genotype. Fish recovered quickly as O 2 levels increased, as evidenced by increased swimming speed and time spent in the most hypoxic habitat. The avoidance response depended strongly on temperature: the relative reduction in speed and avoidance of the most hypoxic habitat was more pronounced at 15 than at 5 °C. During the recovery phase, stressed fish initially maintained a higher swimming speed in the most hypoxic habitat. However, as O 2 increased, swimming speed in both habitats converged. This point of convergence occurred at a lower O 2 saturation at 5 °C. Fish ventilation rate in inescapable hypoxia was also higher at 15 °C. Haemoglobin genotype did not influence either ventilation rates or the nature of the hypoxic avoidance response at either temperature, but Hb-I 11 cod swam faster than Hb-I 22 cod in normoxia at 15 °C. Our results indicate that increased temperature limits the ability of cod of both haemoglobin genotypes to exploit hypoxic habitats. This may have negative future consequences for coastal cod stocks in light of increasing global temperatures and eutrophication in coastal waters...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} by various investigators {{during the last}} five decades {{to better understand the}} engineering behaviour of unsaturated soils. These studies are justified as more than 33 % of soils worldwide are found in either arid or semi-arid regions with evaporation losses exceeding water infiltration. Due to this reason, the natural ground water table in these regions is typically at a greater depth and the soil above it {{is in a state of}} unsaturated conditions. Foundations of structures such as the housing subdivisions, multi-storey buildings, bridges, retaining walls, silos, and other infrastructure constructed in these regions in sandy soils are usually built within the unsaturated zone (i. e., vadose zone). Limited studies are reported in the literature to understand the influence of capillary stresses (i. e., matric suction) on the bearing capacity, settlement and liquefaction potential of unsaturated sands. The influence of matric suction in the unsaturated zone of the sandy soils is ignored while estimating or evaluating bearing capacity, settlement and liquefaction resistance in conventional engineering practice. The focus of the research presented in the thesis has been directed towards better understanding of these aspects and providing rational and yet simple tools for the design of shallow foundations (i. e., footings) in sands under both static and dynamic loading conditions. Terzaghi (1943) or Meyerhof (1951) equations for bearing capacity and Schmertmann et al. (1978) equation for settlement are routinely used by practicing engineers for sandy soils based on saturated soil properties. The assumption of saturated conditions leads to conservative estimates for bearing capacity; however, neglecting the influence of capillary stresses contributes to unreliable estimates of settlement or differential settlement of footings in unsaturated sands. There are no studies reported in the literature on how capillary stresses influence liquefaction, bearing capacity and settlement behavior in earthquake prone regions under dynamic loading conditions. An extensive experimental program has been undertaken to study these parameters using several specially designed and constructed equipment at the University of Ottawa. The influence of matric suction, confinement and dilation on the bearing capacity of model footings in unsaturated sand was determined using the University of Ottawa Bearing Capacity Equipment (UOBCE- 2011). Several series of plate load tests (PLTs) were carried out on a sandy soil both under saturated and unsaturated conditions. Based on these studies, a semi-empirical equation has been proposed for estimating the variation of bearing capacity with respect to matric suction. The saturated shear strength parameters and the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) are required for using the proposed equation. This equation is consistent with the bearing capacity equation originally proposed by Terzaghi (1943) and later extended by Meyerhof (1951) for saturated soils. Chapter 2 provides the details of these studies. The cone penetration test (CPT) is conventionally used for estimating the bearing capacity of foundations because it is simple and quick, while providing continuous records with depth. In this research program, a cone penetrometer was specially designed to investigate the influence of matric suction on the cone resistance in a controlled laboratory environment. Several series of CPTs were conducted in sand under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Simple correlations were proposed from CPTs data to relate the bearing capacity of shallow foundations to cone resistance in saturated and unsaturated sands. The details of these studies are presented and summarized in Chapter 3. Standard penetration tests (SPTs) and PLTs were conducted in-situ sand deposit at Carp region in Ottawa under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. The test results from the SPTs and PLTs at Carp were used along with other data from the literature for developing correlations for estimating the bearing capacity of both saturated and unsaturated sands. The proposed SPT-CPT-based technique is simple and reliable for estimation of the bearing capacity of footings in sands. Chapter 4 summarizes the details of these investigations. Empirical relationships were proposed using the CPTs data to estimate the modulus of elasticity of sands for settlement estimation of footings in both saturated and unsaturated sands. This was achieved by modifying the Schmertmann et al. (1978) equation, which is conventionally used for settlement estimations in practice. Comparisons are provided between the three CPT-based methods that are commonly used for settlement estimations in practice and the proposed method for seven large scale footings in sandy soils. The results of the comparisons show that the proposed method provides better estimations for both saturated and unsaturated sands. Chapter 5 summarizes the details of these studies. A Flexible <b>Laminar</b> Shear <b>Box</b> (FLSB of 800 -mm 3 in size) was specially designed and constructed to simulate and better understand the behaviour of model surface footing under seismic loads taking account of the influence of matric suction in an unsaturated sandy soil. The main purpose of using the FLSB is to simulate realistic in-situ soils behaviour during earthquake ground shaking. The FLSB test setup with model footing was placed on unidirectional 1 -g shake table (aluminum platform of 1000 -mm 2 in size) during testing. The resistance of unsaturated sand to deformations and liquefaction under seismic loads was investigated. The results of the study show that matric suction offers significant resistance to liquefaction and settlement of footings in sand. Details of the equipment setup, test procedure and results of this study are presented in Chapter 6. Simple techniques are provided in this thesis for estimating the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour of sandy soils taking account of the influence of capillary stresses (i. e., matric suction). These techniques are consistent with the methods used in conventional geotechnical engineering practice. The studies show that even low values of capillary stresses (i. e., 0 to 5 kPa) increases the bearing capacity by two to four folds, and the settlement of footings not only decreases significantly but also offers resistance to liquefaction in sands. These studies are promising and encouraging to use ground improvement techniques; such as capillary barrier techniques to maintain capillary stresses within the zone of influence below shallow foundations. Such techniques, not only contribute to the increase of bearing capacity, they reduce settlement and alleviate problems associated with earthquake effects in sandy soils...|$|R
40|$|Topography effects, the {{modification}} of seismic motion by topographic features, have been long recognized {{to play a}} key role in elevating seismic risk. Site response, the {{modification of}} ground motion by near surface soft soils, has been also shown to strongly affect the amplitude, frequency and duration of seismic motion. Both topography effects and 1 -D site response have been extensively studied through field observations, small-scale and field experiments, analytical models and numerical simulations, but each one has been studied independently of the other: studies on topography effects are based on the assumption of a homogeneous elastic halfspace, while 1 -D site response studies are almost exclusively formulated for flat earth surface conditions. This thesis investigates the interaction between topographic and soil amplification, focusing on strong ground motions that frequently trigger nonlinear soil response. Recently, a series of centrifuge experiments tested the seismic response of single slopes of various inclination angles at the NEES@UCDavis facility, to investigate the effects of nonlinear soil response on topographic amplification. As part of this collaborative effort, we extended the search space of these experiments using finite element simulations. We first used simulations to determine whether the centrifuge experimental results were representative of free-field conditions. We specifically investigated whether wave reflections caused by the <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> interfered with mode conversion and wave scattering that govern topographic amplification; and whether this interference was significant enough to qualitatively alter the observed amplification compared to free-field conditions. We found that the <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> boundaries caused spurious reflections that affected the response near the boundaries; however its effect to the crest-to-free field spectral ratio was found to be insignificant. Most importantly though, we found that the baseplate was instrumental in trapping and amplifying waves scattered and diffracted by the slope, and that in absence of those reflections, topographic amplification would have been negligible. We then used box- and baseplate-free numerical models to study the coupling between topography effects and soil amplification in free-field conditions. Our results showed that the complex wavefield that characterizes the response of topographic features with non-homogeneous soil cannot be predicted by the superposition of topography effects and site response, as is the widespread assumption of engineering and seismological models. We also found that the coupling of soil and topographic amplification occurs both for weak and strong motions, and for pressure-dependent media (Nevada sand), nonlinear soil response further aggravates topographic amplification; we attributed this phenomenon to the reduction of apparent velocity that the low velocity layers suffer during strong ground motion, which intensifies the impedance contrast and accentuates the energy trapping and reverberations in the low strength surficial layers. We finally highlighted the catalytic effects that soil stratigraphy can have in topographic amplification through a case study from the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. Results presented in this thesis imply that topography effects vary significantly with soil stratigraphy, and the two phenomena should be accounted for as a coupled process in seismic code provisions and seismological ground motion predictive models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of shaking table tests on model reinforced soil retaining walls in the laboratory. The influence of backfill relative density on the seismic response was studied through a series of laboratory model tests on retaining walls. Construction of model retaining walls in the <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> mounted on shaking table, instrumentation and results from the shaking table tests are described in detail. Three types of walls: wrap- and rigid-faced reinforced soil walls and unreinforced rigid-faced walls constructed to different densities were tested for a relatively small excitation. Wrap-faced walls are further tested for higher base excitation at different frequencies and relative densities. It is observed from these tests that the effect of backfill density on the seismic performance of reinforced retaining walls is pronounced only at very low relative density and at the higher base excitation. The walls constructed with higher backfill relative density showed lesser face deformations and more acceleration amplifications compared to the walls constructed with lower densities when tested at higher base excitation. The response of wrap- and rigid-faced retaining walls is not much affected by the backfill relative density when tested at smaller base excitation. The effects of facing rigidity were evaluated to a limited extent. Displacements in wrap-faced walls are many times higher compared to rigid-faced walls. The results obtained from this study are helpful in understanding the relative performance of reinforced soil retaining walls constructed to when subjected to smaller and higher base excitation for the range of relative density employed in the testing program.

Previous earthquake records and computational modelings have given general information about liquefaction, but many questions, such as; effects of silt content on liquefaction phenomena {{have not been}} clearly answered yet. In this study, liquefaction phenomena in sands and silty sands were simulated by a large scale 1 -g <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> system. Three shake table tests were performed, where each test consisted of four shakes to analyze the initial-liquefaction and re-liquefaction phenomena. Instrumentations were used during shake table tests to measure laminate, soil response and settlement of ground. The soil deposit was prepared with different fines content using hydraulic filling method. Piezocone penetration tests (CPTu) were conducted, before and after each shake to determine the relative density of the soil model. Following results were found; Silty sands were found to possess more liquefaction resistance than uniform fine sands. Soils with rounded shapes were more susceptible to liquefaction, than angular grained soils. Required time to trigger liquefaction increased with fines content and depth of the soil sedimentation. Liquefaction resistance of each tested sand decreased from 1 st to the 2 nd shaking, despite increase in relative density. Relative density values increased with each shake. Despite the increase in relative density, liquefaction resistance decreased. Relative density values have decreased, when fines content increased, but despite decreased in relative density, liquefaction resistance increased. Ground settlement values after the shaking was more than during the shaking. Ground settlement values have increased with fines content of the soil model...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the factors influencing stress distributions of piles during earthquakes, a physical model test was conducted using the large shaking table at E-defense. The tests were {{run on a}} 3 × 3 pile group supporting a foundation with and without a superstructure set in a dry sand deposit prepared in a cylindrical <b>laminar</b> <b>box.</b> Experimental variables included the natural period of a superstructure {{and the presence of}} foundation embedment. Based on the test results and discussions, the following conclusions are made: (1) When the natural period of a superstructure was shorter than or close to that of the ground, the inertial force of the superstructure mainly controlled pile stresses, in which both shear force and bending moment tended to be the largest in the leading pile. When the overturning moment is small in this case, sway motion dominates in which bending moment has maxima at both pile head and a certain depth in the ground. When the overturning moment becomes large enough to induce a rotation of foundation, by contrast, rocking motion dominates in which pile bending moment is small at the pile head, increasing with depth with a peak at some depth; (2) When the natural period of superstructure was much longer than that of the ground, the inertial force from the superstructure gets small and ground displacement may control the pile stresses {{in such a way that}} the shear forces at the pile heads were almost the same within a pile group. In this case, pile stress distributions with depth were mainly controlled by the sway motion due to the ground displacement, in which bending moment becomes a maximum only at the pile head and decreases with depth; and (3) The combination of the effects of the sway and rocking motions on pile stress varied depending on such factors as the presence of foundation embedment, natural periods of superstructures, aspect ratios of structures (height/width) and ground displacement...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. It is {{well-known}} that any parapharmaceutical substance, in particular, foam-washing agents comprising water {{in combination with}} detergents, extracts, water-soluble vitamins, viscosity regulators, pH, etc., is the ideal environment for microbial growth. Therefore, it is indispensable to use preservatives to protect any foam-washing agent from possible contamination by microorganisms. Their main advantages are: presence of a single antimicrobial and antifungal effect, expanded range of effects, decrease {{in the risk of}} resistance of microorganisms and decrease in the toxicity and concentration of the preserving mixture. In this regard, the shelf life of parapharmaceutical substances is not provided through the use of large quantities of preservatives, but thanks to their rational combination. Materials and Methods. For this study, we have made a number of samples of foam washing bases with a number of preservatives, which are often used in developing foam-washing agents with acidic pH value, namely: sample number 1 – foam washing base + sodium benzoate; sample number 2 – foam washing base + «Euxyl K 300 » (phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, bulylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, isobutylaraben); sample number 3 – foam washing base + «Germaben II» (polypropylene glycol, diazolium dinomovine, methylparaben, propylparaben); sample number 4 – foam washing base + «Nipaquard CMB» (benzyl alcohol, triethylene glycol, chloromethylisothiazoline, methylisothiazoline). The concentration of preservative in each sample was 0. 1 % (average concentration that is recommended for developing foam-washing agents). The antimicrobial activity of prototype gels was studied in vitro by diffusion in agar (“wells” method). The antimicrobial activity was measured immediately after sample preparation. All the studies were performed in aseptic conditions using a <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> (biological safety cabinet AS 2 - 4 E 1 "Esco" Indonesia). Results. According to the study, it was found that among the selected preservatives “Nipaquard CMB” was just the most active. When studying the antimicrobial activity of foam-washing agent samples with different concentrations of the preservative “Nipaquard CMB”, it was found that namely the sample with the concentration of “Nipaquard CMB” of 0, 1 % showed satisfactory results due to its antimicrobial activity against all cultures such as bacteria and fungi. Conclusions. On the basis of microbiological studies it has been demonstrated that all the selected preservatives such as sodium benzoate, “Euxyl K 300 ”, “Germaben II” and “Nipaquard CMB” at a concentration of 0. 1 % have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial action and antimicrobial activity against all test strains used. We just chose «Nipaquard CMB» as a preservative at a concentration of 0. 1 % according to the results of experimental research, because it had the best results and a very high antimicrobial activity both against the bacterial cultures - Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pr. Vulgaris and in relation to the effect on fungal cultures – Candida albicans, Aspergillus brasiliensis...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} {{is a relatively}} young medical field. The nuclear medicine department performs both diagnostic tests and therapies using open radiation sources whereas the diagnostic use currently prevails. The imaging method used is called scintigraphy and uses a scintillation camera capturing the distribution of administered radiopharmaceutical. Using a scintillation detector, which is incorporated in a gamma camera, {{the distribution of the}} radiopharmaceutical in the target tissue can be observed, either after {{a certain period of time}} from the administration of the radiopharmaceutical (static scintigraphy) or over time (dynamic scintigraphy). One of the most common examinations performed at the nuclear medicine department is bone scintigraphy. The examination is carried out using osteotropic radiopharmaceutical that binds to bones, thus revealing pathologies caused by the change of metabolic activity. The examination in itself takes place through external detection of the administered radiopharmaceutical. Bone scintigraphy is a very useful examination that is used to detect bone metastases in cancer diseases, to diagnose primary malignant bone tumors, to detect infectious processes in the bones, to diagnose joint diseases, metabolic diseases of the skeleton, and bone injuries. The examination in itself is performed by using radiopharmaceuticals. Once administered, the radiopharmaceutical serves as a diagnostic indicator. This is a medicine that incorporates a radionuclide that emits ionizing radiation. The radionuclides used in nuclear medicine are artificially prepared and transported either as ready-to-use products or as radionuclide generators to the nuclear medicine department. The generator that is the most commonly used at the nuclear medicine department is the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. The above mentioned radionuclide generator consists of a glass chromatography column which is located in a lead shielding cylinder. The column contains the adsorbent material (alumina) in which the parent radionuclide is adsorbed. Due to different chemical properties of the parent and the daughter element the daughter radionuclide can be washed out (eluted) by means of a suitable solution. In practice, the radiopharmaceuticals are commonly prepared using kits that are commercially available. The kits are labeled by using sodium pertechnetate solution obtained from the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. Prior to the administration of the radiopharmaceutical to the patient it is necessary to carry out the determination of radiochemical purity. The most commonly used is a paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography. In the Czech Republic, 99 mTc labelled diphosphonates (e. g. the kits TechneScan HDP, 6 -MDP or 8 -MDP are used for bone scintigraphy. These osteotropic radiopharmaceuticals are prepared in a shielded <b>laminar</b> <b>box</b> in the radiopharmaceutical laboratory at the nuclear medicine department. The preparation is subject to the manufacturer's instructions. After preparation, prior to administration to the patient, the determination of radiochemical purity needs to be performed. The determination of radiochemical purity of the radiopharmaceutical TechneScan HDP is carried out by using thin layer chromatography (ITLC-SG) by means of 13. 6 % solution of sodium acetate and methyl ethyl ketone as eluent. However, this determination is demanding for the normal operation of the department in terms of design as well as costs. Therefore, a suitable alternative method was sought. The new method consists in paper chromatography by using 0. 9 % solution of sodium chloride and acetone as eluent. After 50 determinations of radiochemical purity using pharmacopoeial and alternative methods was found that the alternative method is applicable for the routine determination of radiochemical purity during normal operation of the nuclear medicine departmen...|$|E
