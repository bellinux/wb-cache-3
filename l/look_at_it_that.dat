It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E

[...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge {{a new book by}} Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist?

It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E
