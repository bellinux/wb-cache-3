40|$|Purpose: Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is {{strictly}} {{affected by the}} concentration of total suspended particulate matter (TSP). Air filtration {{is by far the}} most feasible suggestion to improve IAQ. Unfortunately, highly effective HEPA filters also have a few major weaknesses that have hindered their widespread use. There is therefore a renewed interest in developing novel, cost-effective filtration systems. We have recently reported the development of cardboard-based filters for bacterial removal that were further implemented and tested herein.  Methods: A parallelepiped filter manufactured by aligning strips of corrugated cardboard and surrounded by a cardboard frame was specifically designed with an internal pocket holding a partially cut antistatic pleated fabric (HP). This filter, together with its parent version (CTRL) and a commercially sourced specimen (CAF), were assessed comparatively in a <b>long-time</b> <b>test</b> to assess their effectiveness on TSP removal.  Results: We found that the TSP abatement efficiency (E%) of the HP filter was relatively high and invariable over the 93 days of test and the pressure drop (PD%) decrease because of filter clogging was moderate. Most important, the HP filter was the most effective if assessed in terms of overall yield (Y%) and its performance was quite constant over the entire period considered.  Conclusions: This work disclosed this novel class of corrugated cardboard-based filters as promising tools to ameliorate IAQ in light of their good TSP removal properties that endure over time. Moreover, cardboard is a lightweight, inexpensive, and eco-friendly material and corrugated cardboard-based air filters are very easy to shape and mount on and/or replace in existing ventilation systems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{researchers}} have proposed equivalence between hot-tensile data and creep rupture properties based on Larson-Miller or similar time-temperature parameter approaches. This is attractive {{from the point}} of view economy of time and cost of testing as compared to the <b>long-time</b> creep <b>tests.</b> Basic idea behind such a comparison is that the plastic deformation behavior controlling both the hot-tensile and creep properties are the same, provided the microstructure does not ndergo significant changes for the time periods under consideration. Particularly, such a procedure will be useful in alloy development and preliminary screening. Such a time-temperature parameter approach is adopted in the following for predicting the stress-rupture behavior of 316 L(N) stainless steel from reported hot-tensile properties and the results are compared with actual creep test data for almost a similar steel at two temperatures. It is found that the predicted data follow the ASME Code Case minimum stress-rupture data for 316 SS (stainless steel) and thus are very conservative. Predicted creep rates are also much larger than the actual ones for the one case where comparison has been made. The conclusion drawn is that considering the microstructural stability of the low-carbon nitrogen bearing SSs (at least for lower nitrogen contents), the method of equivalence of hot-tensile and stress-rupture data seems feasible. But test results at different strain rates, rather than the single value considered here, along with the more accurate method suggested would yield better results. In addition, using some old results from the literature, relation for variation of yield stress with temperature, nitrogen content and grain-size for the present heats of steel (with various nitrogen contents) has been derived...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe network {{structure}} of plasticized EPDM compounds, crosslinked with resol at different concentrations, was studied {{by means of}} rheological methods consisting in oscillatory shear tests, to determine the equilibrium modulus Ge, and <b>long-time</b> relaxation <b>tests</b> in compression followed by strain recovery (a protocol that also yielded values of the compression set of the samples). Ge results were analyzed {{with respect to the}} phenomenological model of Langley and Graessley which takes into account the contribution of crosslinks and trapped entanglements to the shear equilibrium modulus. A correction was introduced in order {{to take into account the}} presence of plasticizer. The measurement of the soluble polymer fraction in the different samples allowed a more detailed characterization of the networks to be carried out, following a molecular approach by Pearson and Graessley. This method enabled to calculate the crosslink density and trapping factor, but also to compute the probability ψ 1 for an un-crosslinked polymer unit to belong to a dangling chain. This probability was shown to increase as resol concentration, and then crosslink density, decreased. The empirical Chasset–Thirion equation was used to model the long-time relaxation data for each sample. Chasset–Thirion parameters were interpreted by Curro and Pincus within a theoretical framework based on the idea that the longest relaxation times are associated with the pendent chains of the network. The relaxation times, obtained from the fitting of experimental relaxation moduli, dramatically increased as the crosslink density decreased. This result corroborates the evolution of ψ 1 : both tend to demonstrate that in the present compounds, the decrease of crosslink density is accompanied by an increase of the number and length of the dangling chains, leading to increasing relaxation times. The large soluble fraction and long pendent chains of samples showing the lowest crosslink densities were responsible for their poor elastic recovery. The relaxation data were used to model the elastic recovery of the compounds and predict their compression set profiles. Very satisfactory agreement was obtained between experimental data and computations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{segmental}} {{prestressed concrete}} box girder of Koror-Babeldaob (KB) Bridge in Palau, {{which had a}} record span of 241 m (791 ft), presents a striking paradigm of serviceability loss because of excessive multidecade deflections. The data required for analysis have recently been released and are here exploited {{to show how the}} analysis and design could be improved. Erected segmentally in 1977, this girder developed a midspan deflection of 1. 61 m (5. 3 ft) compared with the design camber after 18 years, and it collapsed in 1996 as a consequence of remedial prestressing, after a 3 -month delay. Compared with three-dimensional analysis, the traditional beam-type analysis of box girder deflections is found to have errors up to 20 %, although greater errors are likely for bridges with higher box-width-to-span ratios than the KB Bridge. However, even three-dimensional finite-element analysis with step-by-step time integration cannot explain the observed deflections when the current American Concrete Institute, Japan Society of Civil Engineers, Comité Euro-International du Béton (or Comité Euro-International du Béton—Fédération internationale de la précontrainte), and Gardner and Lockman prediction models for creep and shrinkage are used. These models give 18 -year deflection estimates that are 50 – 77 % lower than measured and yield unrealistic shapes of the deflection history. They also predict the 18 -year prestress loss to be 46 – 56 % lower than the measured mean prestress loss, which was 50 %. Model B 3, which is the only theoretically based model, underestimates the 18 -year deflection by 42 % and gives a prestress loss of 40 % when the default parameter values are used. However, in Model B 3, several input parameters are adjustable and if they are adjusted according to the <b>long-time</b> laboratory <b>tests</b> of Brooks, a close fit of all the measurements is obtained. For early deflections and their extrapolation, it is important that Model B 3 can capture realistically the differences in the rates of shrinkage and drying creep caused by the differences in the thickness of th...|$|R

Surface micromachined silicon pressure sensors, based on piezoresistive mechanism, are reliable with satisfactory pressure sensitivity. However, the use of mechanical diaphragm limits {{the performance of the}} sensor due to its slow response time when a pressure is applied. The measurable pressure by silicon pressure sensor is also low (mostly in kPa range) and is not suitable for high contact pressure measurement (MPa in range). This paper reports the fabrication and testing of pressure sensitive silicon-based AlxGa 1 −xAs pressure sensors, which are suitable for both static and dynamic pressure measurements {{with a wide range of}} applied pressure. The pressure sensors are fabricated based on two different kinds of substrates, silicon and GaAs, and tested under various conditions. Contact pressure sensitivity, linearity, hydrostatic pressure sensitivity, hysteresis, temperature sensitivity and <b>long-time</b> stability (creep) <b>test</b> results for these two types of the fabricated pressure sensors have been compared and presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} selected issues of UV detectors’ diagnostics. When choosing the UV detector {{to a specific}} application, one should {{take into account that}} their optical and electrical parameters can vary significantly during operation. The most common sources of these processes are long term exposure of semiconductor structure of UV detector to the impact of thermal and/or optical radiation. On the basis of experimental studies of different types of semiconductor UV detectors, the methodology of their characterization has been developed. The first step is to measure spectral characteristics of the noise detector at ambient temperature. Measurements are aimed at checking and possible rejection of detectors that do not meet the requirements of the application. The next step is to measure spectral characteristics in a wide temperature range of positive and cryogenic temperatures’ changes. Detectors that are expected to be used in equipment operated in extreme conditions (eg. high temperature, high levels of natural ultraviolet), should be examined in the context of <b>long-time</b> diagnostics. These <b>tests</b> include annealing at elevated temperatures and long-term study of the effects of optical excitation. The developed diagnostic procedures allow us to obtain additional data, beyond the catalogue data, in terms of UV detectors operating in extreme conditions. On the other hand, studies on long term forecast ensure long-term reliability of detectors. Keywords: optoelectronic, semiconductors UV detectors, spectral characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{spectral}} {{methods are}} numerical techniques for approximating solutions to partial differential equations with random parameters. In this work, we present {{and examine the}} multi-element probabilistic collocation method (ME-PCM), which is a generalized form of the probabilistic collocation method. In the ME-PCM, the parametric space is discretized and a collocation/cubature grid is prescribed on each element. Both full and sparse tensor product grids based on Gauss and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules are considered. We prove analytically and observe in nu-merical tests that as the parameter space mesh is refined, the convergence rate of the solution depends on the quadrature rule of each element only through its degree of exactness. In addition, the L 2 error of the tensor product interpolant is exam-ined and an adaptivity algorithm is provided. Numerical examples demonstrating adaptive ME-PCM are shown, including low-regularity problems and <b>long-time</b> in-tegration. We <b>test</b> the ME-PCM on two-dimensional Navier Stokes examples and a stochastic diffusion problem with various random input distributions and up to 50 dimensions. While the convergence rate of ME-PCM deteriorates in 50 dimensions, the error in the mean and variance is two orders of magnitude lower than the er-ror obtained with the Monte Carlo method using {{only a small number}} of samples (e. g., 100). The computational cost of ME-PCM is found to be favorable when com-pared to the cost of other methods including stochastic Galerkin, Monte Carlo and quasi-random sequence methods. ...|$|R
