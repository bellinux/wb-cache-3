50|$|At {{standard}} {{atmospheric pressure}} and low temperatures, no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate {{is controlled by the}} usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is sub-cooled nucleate boiling, and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the departure from nucleate boiling, or DNB).|$|E

40|$|A boiling {{simulator}} {{was constructed}} {{to model the}} void and pressure effects of <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> in an LMFBR. By forcing superheated steam into subcooled water the boiling simulator produced aseries of single bubbles separated by waiting times. The bubbles ranged from one to four centimeters in diameter and had lifetimes {{on the order of}} 60 milliseconds, and waiting times of 90 milliseconds. The boiling simulator was placed in the core of a zero power reactor (GfK, ARK), and the neutron and pressure signals were recorded and cross correlated. The neutron-pressure cross correlation exhibited an almost perfect correlation at the bubble repetition frequency (7 Hz). If (as expected) the normal pressure and reactivity background noises in apower reactor are uncorrelated, then this strong correlation will improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a boiling detection scheme. Other advantages of the cross cor-relation technique are that only simple linear transfer functions are necessary to relate the neutronic noise to the pressure noise and that the zone of the reactor (positive or negative void coefficient zone) can easily be determined. Because of these advantages, the neutron-pressure cross correlation technique is considered a serious alternative for the detection of <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> in sodium cooled reactors.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the influence of curvature on <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficient and two-phase pressure drop in helically coiled tubes with water as the working medium. In helically coiled tubes, the geometric parameters like pipe diameter and coil diameter vary the curvature and hence secondary flow which affects the heat transfer distribution and pressure drop. The present work investigates the characteristics of flow boiling in helically coiled tubes. Very less information {{is available on the}} influence of curvature on flow boiling system. The local wall temperature is measured not only in the axial direction (along the length of coil) but also in the circumferential direction using thermal imaging technique. Experiments are performed with six helically coiled test sections made of SS 304 tubes having inner diameters varying from 6 to 10 mm. The coil diameter to the tube diameter ratio ranges from 14 to 58 and coil pitch is 50 mm. The effect of geometric and operating parameters like tube diameter, coil diameter, heat flux and mass flux on <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficient and two-phase pressure drop is analysed. In the subcooled region and in a low quality region, boiling heat transfer coefficient in helical coils is much higher (12 %- 100 %) than in straight tubes. However, in a high quality region, the boiling heat transfer coefficient in helical coils is same as in straight tubes. A correlation is suggested for two-phase pressure drop in helical coils.

40|$|Characterization of <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> trends, in {{addition}} to the typically reported area-averaged trends, is essential for the robust design and implementation of phase change technologies to sensitive heat transfer applications such as electronics cooling. This paper compares local and area-averaged boiling curves during a phase change process using non-intrusive quantitative infrared thermal visualization to highlight the importance of considering the former in design of phase change cooling systems. As an illustration, both pool and jet impingement boiling modes of heat transfer from a heated silicon surface are considered. A thin-film serpentine heater that allows for a circumferentially uniform but radially non-uniform heat flux distribution on the surface is chosen as the heat source in order to assess the effect of spatial variations in imposed boundary condition on the local and area-averaged boiling curves. Local convective heat fluxes are estimated from thermal maps using a control volume approach that accounts for axial conduction in the silicon substrate. Using the spatial information on surface temperatures and convective heat fluxes, <b>local</b> <b>boiling</b> curves are generated for different radial locations on the surface and compared with their corresponding area-averaged representations. As validation, it is shown that the net input electrical heat flux varies within 4 to 12 percent of the area-averaged results.

Area-averaged thin-film sensor data are used to augment the heat transfer data by highlighting the differences in nucleation events on the surface in different regions. Keywords...|$|E

This process is complex and involves heat and mass transfer inside the mat of the panels [2]. Heat is transferred from the hot platens to the mat surfaces by conduction [1, 3]. Then, the moisture at the mat surface vaporises and generates vapour pressure with increasing temperature. The vapour flows vertically and transfers the heat from the surface to the centre of the mat panels.

40|$|Natural {{saltwater}} upconing {{caused by}} the preferential groundwater discharge of boils is a key proce ss in the salinization of Dutch deep polders. The factors controlling upconing by boil discharge and boil water salinities are poorly constrained and have not been previously documented. We addressed this knowl- edge gap by investigating upconing mechanisms using field measurements and numerical simulation s of simplified situations. Boils occur as conduits in the upper aquitard connecting the underlying aquifer {{to the surface and}} allowing groundwater to discharge at rates up to 100 m 3 d? 1 with Cl concentrations up to 5 gL? 1. Boils are found as isolated features or clustered in small areas of 20 – 100 m 2. Field observations show that preferential flow through boils creates localized and narrow saltwate r upconing spikes, caus- ing the elevated boil water salinities. Modeling results indicate that boil water in Dutch polders com- prises mixtures of groundwater {{from a wide range of}} depths and salinities with larger contributions from shallower and less saline groundwater than from the deeper and more saline water. Similar to pre- vious numerical studies of pumping-in duced upconing, the numerical results show that the most impor- tant factors controlling the boil salinity in Dutch polders are boil discharge, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, the depth of the transition zone and the salinit y (or density) contrast within the aquifer. When boils are clustered, natural saltwater upconing is a function of the total discharge of a boil cluster, whereas the boil-to-boil salinity variations within a cluster are determined by the discharge of individual boils and their position relative to neighboring boils. Regional lateral flow significantly mod- ifies flow patterns by dividing the groundwater flow system into a <b>local</b> <b>boil</b> system overlying the regio- nal flow system. Despite this, regional flow has only a minor effect on the relative contribu tions of saline and fresh groundwater to boil discharge and thus on boil salinity as well...|$|R
