25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator.</b> Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members {{may not have a}} common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.|$|E

This article fills a gap in our knowledge by addressing the key questions as to why and how this prestigious proposal was watered down during the negotiation process. By applying the framework of rational choice institutionalism, the analysis pinpoints the positions of the key players and estimates their relative importance in shaping the final outcome. Prima facie, the European Parliament seemed to be the decisive actor developing the text which was adopted in the end. However, a closer inspection reveals that the text was influenced by the newly elected conservative-socialist coalition government in Germany and reflected a relatively <b>low</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> which secured acceptance from not only the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament, but also avoided any explicit opposition in the adoption by the Council of Ministers...|$|R
500|$|Reception to 21st Century Breakdown {{has been}} {{generally}} favorable, according to aggregating website Metacritic, which reported {{a rating of}} 70/100 based on 30 critical reviews.

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{perspective of}} employee motivation is presented, {{based on the}} premise that the principles of natural science provide the fundamental basis for analogizing the operational similarities of physical and social productive systems. This concept is applied to motivation by observing that all productive systems [...] whether physical, organic or social [...] are input-output systems. The <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> in these systems are energy and mass. Le Chatelier's principle provides the universal environment for motivation. Thus, the transformation of energy in a given productive system represents the essence of motivation. The usefulness of analogizing the process of energy transformation in these two seemingly diverse systems can be seen by tracing the essential factors leading to efficient energy expenditure is physical systems and applying similar strategies to energy transformation in social system. Such an approach will provide the manager with a concrete frame of reference from which to draw plausible remedies in solving the innumerable problems of efficient motivation and utilization of employee energies. ...|$|R

Mark Gatiss has noted that the Artsex and Foodshow programmes that also appear in the play [...] "ingeniously depicted the future of <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> TV". This view is echoed by the writer and critic Kim Newman, who has said that [...] "as an extreme exercise in revolutionary self-criticism {{on the part of}} television professionals, who also lampoon their own world of chattering commentators and ratings-chasing sensationalism, the play [...] is a trenchant contribution to a series of debates that is still raging" [...] and has concluded that [...] "Nigel Kneale might be quite justified in shouting, 'I was right!

Of the action scenes, Nicholson said [...] "they're glorious nonsense, a guns-blazing bullet barrage". The Hollywood Reporters Justin Lowe called the film [...] "taut, humorous and attractively packaged". Lowe considered Schwarzenegger's brief role to have the most memorable dialogue, noting that he stole any scene in which he was present. On West's direction and cinematographer Shelly Johnson, he said [...] "the action choreography never disappoints". Varietys Justin Chang appreciated the self-referential humor in each actor's film history and the violent action scenes; however, he felt the scenes were undermined by poor editing and a [...] "grimy" [...] visual scheme throughout the film.

40|$|Collaborative {{software}} is usually {{thought of as}} providing audio-video conferencing services, application/desktop sharing, and access to large content repositories. However mobile device usage is characterized by users carrying out short and intermittent tasks {{sometimes referred to as}} ‘micro-tasking’. Micro-collaborations are not well supported by traditional groupware systems and the work in this paper seeks out to address this. Mico is a system that provides a set of application level peer-to-peer services for the ad-hoc formation and facilitation of collaborative groups across a diverse mobile device domain. The system builds on the Java ME bindings of the JXTA P 2 P protocols, and is designed with an approach to use the <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominators</b> that are required for collaboration between varying degrees of mobile device capability.

50|$|Israel’s Knesset {{is elected}} through a {{proportional}} representation system, the closed list. In 1973 Israel adopted the d’Hondt formula, {{a method for}} distributing surplus seats in proportional representation systems. The multi-party system produced a growing instability {{leading up to the}} 1981 legislative elections, with frequent party shifts and factions amongst coalitions. In Israel, a party must win 61 seats in order to achieve a majority. This has not yet occurred in Israel’s history, meaning each ruling government has been composed of party coalitions. Since 1965 Israel had been on a path of party oversimplification, with political parties abandoning attempts to frame moral issues in favor of spreading wider nets to catch a bigger range of voters. Rather than focusing on controversial issues that divided them, parties took to forming clusters that resorted to “emotive catchwords” and the <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominators.</b> The party clusters had set aside fundamental ideals in order to work together, which meant that infighting amongst the coalitions was inevitable.|$|R

500|$|Goldsmith's {{party was}} the biggest spender on press {{advertising}} in the 1997 campaign; it spent {{three times as much}} as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: [...] "The most important video you'll ever watch", [...] "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and [...] "If you care about Britain, please pass this video on." [...] The 12-minute film, presented by the former That's Life! presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming [...] "federal European super-state". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through [...] "eerie sound effects", the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film [...] "manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator,</b> and aimed to shock." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{academic}} Rikky Rooksby, [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] {{is an example}} of Brian Wilson's growing interest in musical development within a composition, something antithetical to popular music of the time. Suppressing tonic strength and cadential drive, the song makes use of descending harmonic motions through scale degrees controlled by a single tonic and [...] "radical disjunctions" [...] in key, texture, instrumentation, and mood while refusing to develop into a predictable formal pattern. It instead develops [...] "under its own power" [...] and [...] "luxuriates in harmonic variety" [...] exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes. Comparing [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] to Wilson's previous work Pet Sounds, biographer Andrew Hickey has said: [...] "he best way of thinking about [...] is that it's taking the <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> of 'Here Today' and 'God Only Knows' and turned the result into an R track. We have the same minor-key change between verse and chorus we've seen throughout Pet Sounds, the same descending scalar chord sequences, the same mobile bass parts, but here, rather than to express melancholy, these things are used in a way that's as close as Brian Wilson ever got to funky."

Oliver also wrote that older viewers would find Eccleston [...] "easily the best time lord since Tom Baker". Reviewing the first episode, The Stages Harry Venning hailed it as a [...] "fabulous, imaginative, funny and sometimes frightening reinvention" [...] and particularly praised Rose for being an improvement upon previous female companions who were [...] "fit only to scream or be captured". However, he found Eccleston to be [...] "the show’s biggest disappointment" [...] as he looked [...] "uncomfortable playing fantasy". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan found the final episode anticlimactic, but overall said that the series was [...] "excellent Saturday night telly of the kind that many of us thought the BBC had forgotten how to make". He praised Eccleston's performance and named [...] "The Empty Child" [...] and [...] "The Doctor Dances" [...] as the best episodes. Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the series a grade of A-, praising its variety.

5000|$|Largely in the US, but {{increasingly}} in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of new math and reform mathematics which {{have sought to}} replace traditional mathematics in what have been called the math wars. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast [...] "progressive" [...] approaches seek to address problems in social inequity with approaches that often incorporate principles of constructivism and discovery.

500|$|After the 2000s, {{the effects}} of poptimism {{attracted}} a belief that once a pop star reaches {{a certain level of}} stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews. Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent. New York Times Magazines Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of click-driven internet journalism that aspired to the <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominator</b> while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and film critics. Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: [...] "When [...] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, [...] "Don't tell them that!" [...] We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place."

[...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic."

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} made in any research concerns the selection of an appropriate scale of analysis – are we looking out into the heavens, or down into atoms? To conceive a digital library {{as a collection of}} a million books may restrict analysis to only one level of granularity. In this paper we examine the consequences and opportunities resulting from a shift in scale, where the desired unit of interpretation is something smaller than a text: it is a keyword, a motif, or a metaphor. A million books distilled into a billion meaningful components become raw material for a history of language, literature, and thought that has never before been possible. While books herded into genres and organized by period remain irregular, idiosyncratic, and meaningful in only the most shifting and context-dependent ways, keywords or metaphors are <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> <b>denominators.</b> At the semantic level – the level of words, images, and metaphors – long term regularity and patterns emerge in collection, analysis, and taxonomy. This paper follows the foregoing course of thought through three stages: first, the manual curation of a high quality database of metaphors; second, the expansion of this database through automated and human-assisted techniques; finally, the description of future experiments and opportunities for the application of machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing techniques to help find patterns and meaning concealed at this important level of granularity. 2 But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor.
