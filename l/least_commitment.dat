50|$|Partial-order {{planning}} is {{an approach to}} automated planning that leaves decisions about the ordering of actions as open as possible. It contrasts with total-order planning, which produces an exact ordering of actions. Given a problem in which some sequence of actions is {{required in order to}} achieve a goal, a partial-order plan specifies all actions that need to be taken, but specifies an ordering of the actions only where necessary. Consider the following situation: a person must get from point A to point B. In between points A and B, there is an obstacle course. In a partial order plan, the specific path that this person will take to get from point A to point B will not be conceived of all at once. Instead the person will navigate the obstacle course by deciding which obstacles to master one at a time. Partial-order planning exhibits the Principle of <b>Least</b> <b>Commitment,</b> which contributes to the efficiency of this planning system as a whole. Often there are many possible plans for a problem which only differ in the order of the actions. Many traditional automated planners search for plans in the full search space containing all possible orders. In addition to the smaller search space for partial-order planning, it may also be advantageous to leave the option about the order of the actions open for later.An important distinction to be made is between ordering steps of an action and conceptualizing those steps. Partial order planning doesn’t sequence actions until it is absolutely necessary; however, these actions are conceived of much before they are sequenced. This type of planning system is simply a relation structure between actions. It is not the mechanism by which these actions mentally come to fruition.|$|E
40|$|Partial-order plans (POPs) are {{attractive}} {{because of their}} <b>least</b> <b>commitment</b> nature, providing enhanced plan flexibility at execution time relative to sequential plans. Despite the appeal of POPs, most of the recent research on automated plan generation has focused on sequential plans. In this paper we examine the task of POP generation by relaxing or modifying the action orderings {{of a plan to}} optimize for plan criteria that promotes flexibility in the POP. Our approach relies on a novel partial weighted MaxSAT encoding of a plan that supports the minimization of deordering or reordering of actions. We further extend the classical <b>least</b> <b>commitment</b> criterion for a POP to consider the number of actions in a solution, and provide an encoding to achieve <b>least</b> <b>commitment</b> plans with respect to this criterion. We compare the effectiveness of our approach to a previous approach for POP generation via sequential-plan relaxation. Our results show that while the previous approach is proficient at heuristically finding the optimal deordering of a plan, our approach gains greater flexibility with the optimal reordering. ...|$|E

His original position, as expressed in Actions and Events, was that event-individuation must be done on the basis of causal powers.

40|$|<b>Least</b> <b>commitment</b> {{scheduling}} is {{a useful}} tool for planning astronomical observatories. For many classes of observatories, it is not feasible to create detailed schedules of observations, more than a few weeks or months in advance of execution. For these domains, combining a long range planner with a short term scheduler allows the flexible creation of efficient schedules. The long range planner creates <b>least</b> <b>commitment</b> plan windows that handle proposal constraints and resources. The short term scheduler uses plan windows to drive the creation of efficient telescope uploads. An issue with this approach is that the default method of distributing resource usage evenly across plan windows can create both false positives and false negatives in the resource model.

40|$|Brute-force dense {{matching}} {{is usually}} not satisfactory because the same search range {{is used for the}} entire image, yielding potentially many false matches. In this paper, we propose a progressive scheme for stereo matching which uses two fundamental concepts: the disparity gradient limit principle and the <b>least</b> <b>commitment</b> strategy. The first states that the disparity should vary smoothly almost everywhere, and the disparity gradient should not exceed a certain limit. The second states that we should first select only the most reliable matches and therefore postpone unreliable decisions until enough confidence is accumulated. Our technique starts with a few reliable point matches obtained automatically via feature correspondence or through user input. New matches are progressively added during an iterative matching process. At each stage, the current reliable matches constrain the search range for their neighbors according to the disparity gradient limit, thereby reducing potential matching ambiguities of those neighbors. Only unambiguous matches are selected and added to the set of reliable matches in accordance with the <b>least</b> <b>commitment</b> strategy. In addition, a correlation match measure that allows rotation of the match template is used to provide a more robust estimate. The entire process is cast within a Bayesian inference framework. Experimental results illustrate the robustness of our proposed dense stereo matching approach...|$|E

5000|$|This {{approach}} typically involves eschewing philosophical [...] "theories" [...] {{in favor}} of {{close attention to the}} details of the use of everyday [...] "ordinary" [...] language. It is sometimes associated with the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and a number of mid-20th century philosophers that can be split into two main groups, neither of which could be described as an organized [...] "school". In its earlier stages contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as Norman Malcolm, Alice Ambrose, Friedrich Waismann, Oets Kolk Bouwsma and Morris Lazerowitz started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by Gilbert Ryle, then followed by J. L. Austin. This Oxford group also included H. L. A. Hart, Geoffrey Warnock, J. O. Urmson and Peter Strawson. The close association between ordinary language philosophy and these later thinkers has led to it sometimes being referred to as [...] "Oxford philosophy". More recent philosophers with at <b>least</b> some <b>commitment</b> to the method of ordinary language philosophy include Stanley Cavell, John Searle and Oswald Hanfling.|$|R
40|$|As most of {{its readers}} are aware, the Critique of Pure Reason is {{primarily}} concerned not with empirical, but with a priori knowledge. For the most part, the Kant of the first Critique tends to assume that experience, and the knowledge {{that is based on}} it, is unproblematic. The problem with which he is concerned is that of how we can be capable of substantive knowledge independently of experience. At the same time, however, the notion of experience plays {{a crucial role in the}} central arguments of the Critique. For, again as most readers of the Critique know, Kant aims to show how we can have synthetic a priori knowledge by showing that the categories, or pure concepts of the understanding, are conditions of the possibility of experience. This means that, whether or not Kant is concerned with the notion of experience for its own sake, his account of a priori knowledge carries with it at <b>least</b> some <b>commitments</b> regarding the character of experience.
