5|$|The employees, however, did not <b>like</b> <b>living</b> {{so close}} to their employers. They complained about the {{distance}} to the city and the transportation problems, and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves they had to make. After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken, however, the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area. In 1931 the villa, Rust Roest, which had long been empty, was converted into a school. It was demolished in 1981. Since 1989, the park has been listed as Cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Adapiforms are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many {{anatomical}} similarities with lemuriforms. They {{are sometimes}} referred to as lemur-like primates, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy. <b>Like</b> <b>living</b> strepsirrhines, adapiforms were extremely diverse, with at least 30genera and 80species known from the fossil record as of the early 2000s. They diversified across Laurasia during the Eocene, some reaching North America via a land bridge.They were among the most common mammals found in the fossil beds from that time. A few rare species have also been found in northern Africa. The most basal of the adapiforms include the genera Cantius from North America and Europe and Donrussellia from Europe. The latter bears the most ancestral traits, so it is often considered a sister group or stem group of the other adapiforms.|$|E

5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers <b>like</b> <b>living</b> colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) {{changed his}} name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief {{technician}} of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years. He did not <b>like</b> <b>living</b> in the US, so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg, competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg—both companies were known for producing premium pianos.|$|E

This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for watercolor images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism was the use of color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.|$|E
25|$|The jaw {{muscles of}} Sebecus were likely {{similar to those}} of living crocodilians, but the distinctively deep skull of Sebecus {{indicates}} that the muscles were longer. In Sebecus, the shape of the skull and jaws provides more room for adductor muscles, or muscles that close the jaws. The supratemporal fenestrae {{at the top of the}} skull are relatively wide, allowing for the passage of large muscles. In crocodilians, the depressor muscle that opens the jaws originates near the top of the skull and inserts into a projection at the back of the jaw called the retroarticular process. Living crocodilians have a straight retroarticular process at the back of the jaw and a low point of origin for the depressor muscle. Sebecus, with its deeper skull, has a higher point of origin for the depressor, but the retroarticular process curves upward to make the length of the depressor about the same as it is in crocodilians. <b>Like</b> <b>living</b> crocodilians, the depressor muscle of Sebecus was relatively underdeveloped. Therefore, while the closure of the jaws would have been very strong, the ability to open the jaws would be much weaker.|$|E

500|$|As a group, the lemurs of Madagascar are {{extremely}} diverse, having evolved in isolation and radiated {{over the past}} 40 to 60million years to fill many ecological niches normally occupied by other primates. [...] In the recent past, their diversity was significantly greater, with 17extinct species sharing body proportions and specializations with lorises and various non-primates, such as tree sloths, giant ground sloths, koalas, and striped possums (genus Dactylopsila). [...] Although the diversity of lemur communities today can {{be as high as}} 10 to 12species per region, communities of 20 or more lemur species existed as recently as 1,000years ago in areas that now have no lemurs at all. Just <b>like</b> <b>living</b> species, many of the extinct species shared overlapping ranges with closely related species (sympatry) through niche differentiation (resource partitioning). Among all the late Quaternary assemblages of megafauna, only Madagascar was dominated by large primates.|$|E

500|$|The astragalus of Veratalpa is {{the largest}} among those from Vieux Collonges that Ameghino {{assigned}} to Talpidae. Although at 4.5mm it is {{about as long as}} his [...] "species A", it is broader, and Hutchison noted the broadness as one of the characters that argue against classification of Veratalpa in Talpidae. <b>Like</b> <b>living</b> moles, it has a broad, flat, and short head, but it forms a noticeably small angle with the body—in actual moles, the head is more axially oriented (i.e., towards the central axis of the foot). The surface of the head that contacts the navicula is less rounded than in moles. The body is low and nearly square and has a diameter of about 3mm. The trochlea—a surface on the body of the bone that articulates with the tibia (lower leg bone)—is not large and pulley-like, as in talpids. There is a small perforation on the lower side of the body. This perforation is larger in Ameghino's other supposed talpids, and Trouessart suggested {{on the basis of this}} feature that the internal parts of the toes were reduced in Veratalpa.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, <b>like</b> <b>living</b> in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E
500|$|Pachylemur is an extinct, giant lemur {{most closely}} related to the ruffed lemurs of genus Varecia. [...] Two species are known, Pachylemur insignis and Pachylemur jullyi, {{although}} there is some doubt {{as to whether or not}} they may actually be the same species. [...] Pachylemur is sometimes referred to as the giant ruffed lemur, because although it and the living ruffed lemurs had similar teeth and skeletons, Pachylemur was more robust and as much as three to four times larger. [...] DNA studies have confirmed a sister group relationship between these two types of lemur. [...] <b>Like</b> <b>living</b> ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur specialized in eating fruit, and was therefore an important seed disperser, possibly for tree species with seeds too large for even ruffed lemurs to swallow. [...] In the spiny thickets of southwestern Madagascar, they were also likely to have dispersed seeds evolved to attach to fur and be carried away. [...] Unlike ruffed lemurs, the fore- and hindlimbs of Pachylemur were nearly the same length, and therefore it was likely to be a slow, deliberate climber. [...] However, both used hindlimb suspension to reach fruit on small branches below them.|$|E
