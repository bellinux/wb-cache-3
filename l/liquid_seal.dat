25|$|In October 2007, the Cervo {{received}} the Good Design Award, and the SR version was introduced. This had a new, 64hp direct injection turbo engine and a seven-step CVT transmission, {{the first time}} for such a combination to be available. With front-wheel drive, this car achieved a remarkable 23.0km/l (54 mpg) on the test cycle. The Cervo also received some minor updates across the line, with new <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> engine mounts and suspension changes. In May 2008 the range received more minor updates, with new colors being added and a new limited edition model, the G Limited II, which featured alcantara interior and a sporty exterior. Other models received new aero parts and other equipment, gas discharge headlights were now available on the SR.|$|E
50|$|To {{maintain}} {{pressure on}} a separator, a <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> must be effected {{in the lower}} portion of the vessel. This <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> prevents loss of gas with the oil and {{requires the use of}} a liquid-level controller and a valve.|$|E
5000|$|... A {{mechanical}} seal {{would most likely}} be created out of an annular elastomeric material through which the nozzle must pass during refueling, preventing vapors from escaping alongside the nozzle. A <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> is created by {{the design of the}} filler pipe, which creates a seal with the liquid flowing into the tank. Since the liquid fills the entire pipe, no emissions can escape during refueling. A <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> is usually used for smaller vehicles, while the {{mechanical seal}} is used for larger vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Mercury is a metal liquid at normal temperature. It {{was used}} as the {{earliest}} glass-to-metal seal and is still in use for <b>liquid</b> <b>seals</b> for e.g. rotary shafts.|$|R
40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> is an {{effective}} method to convert a fiber-optic refractometer into a simple and highly sensitive temperature sensor. A refractometer based on the thin-core fiber modal interferometer is sealed in a capillary tube filled with Cargille oil. Due to the thermo-optic effect of the <b>sealing</b> <b>liquid,</b> the high refractive-index sensitivity refractometer is subsequently sensitive to the ambient temperature. It is found that the liquid-sealed sensor produces a highest sensitivity of − 2. 30 nm/°C, which is over 250 times higher than its intrinsic sensitivity before sealing and significantly {{higher than that of}} a grating-based fiber sensors. The sensing mechanisms, including the incidental temperature-induced strain effect, are analyzed in detail both theoretically and experimentally. The <b>liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> technique is easy and low cost, and makes the sensor robust and insensitive to the surrounding refractive index. It can be applied to other fiber-optic refractometers for temperature sensing...|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{seal face}} {{geometry}} {{is one of}} the most critical design elements within a mechanical seal. Seal face properties such as: balance diameter, centroid location, surface area, surface finish, drive mechanism, and face topography can be altered to achieve specific results in a variety of <b>liquids.</b> <b>Seal</b> face topography refers to the alteration of an otherwise flat seal face sealing surface to one with a three-dimensional surface.|$|R
50|$|PD flowmeters, with {{internal}} wiping seals, produce the highest differential pressure (and subsequently greatest pressure drop head loss) {{of all the}} flowmeter types. Meters that rely on a <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> create a relatively low pressure drop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>seal</b> flame arrestors are liquid {{barriers}} {{following the}} principle of a siphon where the liquid stops the entering deflagration and/or detonation and extinguishes the flame, they work by bubbling the gas through a non-flammable and ideally non-gas-absorbing liquid, which is typically water. They stop the flame by preventing it from reaching the submerged intake.|$|E
50|$|Gallium is a {{soft metal}} with melting point at 30 °C. It readily wets glasses and most metals {{and can be}} used for seals that can be assembled/disassembled by just slight heating. It {{can be used as a}} <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> up to high {{temperatures}} or even at lower temperatures when alloyed with other metals (e.g. as galinstan).|$|E
50|$|Rashid {{swallows}} {{some of the}} <b>liquid,</b> <b>sealing</b> {{his fate}} but intending to bring them all down with him. O'Neill manages to free Terry and send her to safe ground. He and Traveres however are cornered and are thus subsequently forced to jump from the third floor due to Rashid's explosion. Traveres lands on a wrought-iron fence which impales and kills him, though O'Neill survives. A year later, he has a second child with Terry.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel room {{temperature}} hermetic <b>liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> process based on wire bonded “plugs ” over the access ports of liquid-filled cavities. The method enables liq-uids {{to be integrated}} already at the fabrication stage. Test vehicles were manufactured and used to investigate the me-chanical and hermetic properties of the seals. A helium leak rate of better than 10 − 10 mbarL/s was measured on the suc-cessfully sealed structures. The bond strength of the “plugs” were similar to standard wire bonds on flat surfaces...|$|R
40|$|TutorialPg. 153 - 170. This {{discussion}} briefly summarizes {{some of the}} devices, seal systems, {{and operating}} parameters encountered with turbines and compressors, {{but because of the}} magnitude of technical information that would be required, the writer has omitted any comments related to some of the more recent developments, such as welded bellows and aspirated circumferential <b>liquid</b> <b>seals.</b> It is hoped that the topic description presented herein serves as a basis for further technical study and, therefore, understanding that will facilitate the utilization of seal theory in applications...|$|R
50|$|A third {{problem is}} where {{the lower end of}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> is simply a U-trap bend in an outflow pipe. During {{vigorous}} emptying, the kinetic motion of the liquid out the outflow can propel too much liquid out, causing a loss of the sealing volume in the outflow trap and loss of the trapped air bubble to maintain intermittent operation.|$|E
5000|$|Pouring a {{small amount}} of {{vegetable}} or mineral oil into the drain to just cover the trap's water surface. The oil floats {{on the surface of the}} water and creates a <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> preventing further evaporation. Mineral oil tends to be a better option, as it does not go rancid, where vegetable oil does. Any environmental impact from its discharge is negligible compared to the contents that can be flushed out of a flooded basement.|$|E
50|$|A {{second problem}} is that the trapped air pockets will shrink over time if the siphon is not {{operating}} due to no inflow. The air in pockets is absorbed by the liquid, which pulls liquid up into the piping until the air pocket disappears, and can cause activation of water flow outside the normal range of operating when the storage tank is not full, leading to loss of the <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> in lower parts of the mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Ferrofluids {{are used}} to form <b>liquid</b> <b>seals</b> around the {{spinning}} drive shafts in hard disks. The rotating shaft is surrounded by magnets. A small amount of ferrofluid, placed in {{the gap between the}} magnet and the shaft, will be held in place by its attractionto the magnet. The fluid of magnetic particles forms a barrier which prevents debris from entering the interior of the hard drive. According to engineers at Ferrotec, ferrofluid seals on rotating shafts typically withstand 3 to 4 psi; additional seals can be stacked to form assemblies capable of withstanding higher pressures.|$|R
50|$|Shaft seals {{eliminate}} {{the possibility of}} cross-contamination between the hydraulic and process ends. Options include a centrifugal <b>liquid</b> ring <b>seal</b> and a non-contacting inert gas purged labyrinth seal that eliminates leakage.|$|R
5000|$|Ceramic glaze is an {{impervious}} layer or coating of a vitreous substance {{which has been}} fused to a ceramic body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item. [...] Glazing renders earthenware vessels suitable for holding <b>liquids,</b> <b>sealing</b> the inherent porosity of unglazed biscuit earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on stoneware and porcelain. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} {{purposes}} to the liquid seal: first, {{to draw off}} some of the tar and liquor, as the gas from the retort was laden with tar, and the hydraulic main could rid the gas of it, to a certain degree; further tar removal would take place in the condenser, washer/scrubber, and the tar extractor. Still, there would be less tar to deal with later. Second, the <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> also provided defense against air being drawn into the hydraulic main: if the main had no liquid within, and a retort was left open with the pipe not shut off, and air were to combine with the gas, the main could explode, along with nearby benches.|$|E

50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker rod string. In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and saddle bearing. The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above stuffing box. The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> at the surface.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple, {{generally}} applicable approach to prevent sample evaporation when working at elevated temperatures in high resolution NMR. It consists of experimentally sealing the NMR sample {{by a second}} <b>liquid</b> (Experimental <b>Liquid</b> <b>Sealing,</b> ELISE). For aqueous samples, we identified the mineral oil commonly used in PCR application as the best candidate, because it contains only a very limited amount of water-soluble contaminants, is stable over time and heat resistant. The procedure does not interfere with shim settings, and is compatible {{with a wide variety}} of samples, including oligosaccharides and proteins. For chloroform samples, a simple drop of water allows to efficiently seal the sample, avoiding solvent evaporation even over lengthy time periods...|$|R
40|$|Flow and ionic {{transport}} in porous {{media are}} central to electrokinetic pumping {{as well as to}} a host of other microfluidic devices. Electrokinetic pumping provides the ability to create high pressures (to over 10, 000 psi) and high flow rates (over 1 mL/min) with a device having no moving parts and all <b>liquid</b> <b>seals.</b> The electrokinetic pump (EKP) is ideally suited for applications ranging from a high pressure integrated pump for chip-scale HPLC to a high flow rate integrated pump for forced liquid convection cooling of high-power electronics. Relations for flow rate and current fluxes in porous media are derived that provide a basis for analysis of complex microfluidic systems as well as for optimization of electrokinetic pumps...|$|R
50|$|The {{bearings}} {{have to be}} leak-tight. A hermetic seal, {{usually a}} <b>liquid</b> <b>seal,</b> is employed; a turbine oil at pressure higher than the hydrogen inside is typically used. A metal, e.g. brass, ring is pressed by springs onto the generator shaft, the oil is forced under pressure between the ring and the shaft; part of the oil flows into the hydrogen side of the generator, another part to the air side. The oil entrains {{a small amount of}} air; as the oil is recirculated, some of the air is carried over into the generator. This causes a gradual air contamination buildup and requires maintaining hydrogen purity. Scavenging systems are used for this purpose; gas (mixture of entrained air and hydrogen, released from the oil) is collected in the holding tank for the sealing oil, and released into the atmosphere; the hydrogen losses have to be replenished, either from gas cylinders or from on-site hydrogen generators. Degradation of bearings leads to higher oil leaks, which increases the amount of air transferred into the generator; increased oil consumption can be detected by a flow meter associated to each bearing.|$|E
40|$|Keywords：rectification; condenser; tower; Bernoulli {{equation}} Abstract：Bernoulli {{equation is}} used in this paper to deduce the calculation formula for the height of <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> in the U shape tube. Practice shows the result is reasonable and right. The conclusions provide foundation for engineering design. In the rectification device, {{in order to improve}} product’s purity on the top of distillation tower, we need to put part of the condensed liquid through condenser into the distillation tower. But at this point, if the height of <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> in the U shape tube is insufficient, it cannot ensure the smooth. operation of distillation. Therefore, this paper using the Bernoulli equation to deduce the calculation formula for the height of <b>liquid</b> <b>seal</b> in the U shape tube.

40|$|Circumferential grooved liquid seals are {{utilized}} inside turbomachinery {{to provide}} noncontacting control of internal incompressible fluid leakage. Accurate prediction {{of the flow}} field is fundamental in producing robust and efficient designs. To validate {{the capabilities of the}} computational fluid dynamics FLUENT for incompressible fluid seal flow, comparisons of velocity parameters are made to the published experimental results and other CFD code for a circumferential grooved <b>liquid</b> <b>seal.</b> This work employs a pressure-based CFD code FLUENT to calculate the flow field in the seal, using four different turbulence models respectively. The velocity contours are compared with experimental values. It shows good overall agreement of the axial, radial, and azimuthal velocities in the through-flow jet, shear layer, and recirculation zone. Quantitative comparisons of velocity profiles {{at the center of the}} groove are made to experiment. This study verifies the prediction accuracy of three turbulence models. Various structures were considered to obtain a better understanding of the circumferential grooved liquid flow characteristics. The best groove structure to control leakage was also found within the limited designed seal. This study will provide a useful reference for designing the circumferential grooved <b>liquid</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnetic <b>liquid</b> <b>seals</b> are {{engineered}} for a {{wide range}} of applications and exposure but are generally limited to sealing gases and vapors, not direct pressurized liquid. Each particular combination of construction materials and design features has practical limits with respect to temperature, differential pressure, speed, applied loads and operating environment; however, these limits can generally be overcome by carefully selecting or designing the device for the application. Necessary features may include multiple ferrofluid stages, water cooling, customized materials including metals, permanent magnets and ferrofluid, and exotic bearings. Ferrofluid-based seals have extremely low leak rates - almost immeasurable with laboratory equipment - however they cannot reach the levels of welded connections or other all-metal, static (non-rotating) seals.|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{components}} for <b>liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> applications {{are employed in}} a variety of potentially corrosive environments, such as seawater. Frequently, corrosion of the metal is found at or adjacent to the rubber-metal interface rather than at a noncontact area. The corrosion of different metal alloys (titanium, bronze, nickel, aluminum, 316 stainless steel, and 4130 steel) in combination with rubber O-rings (Buna-N and EPDM) of varying internal diameters and cross-sectional shapes in seawater over a period of four years is described herein. The corrosion of some metals (i. e., 4130 stainless steel) was found to be accelerated through interaction with Buna-N rubber O-rings. Theories to account for corrosion at the polymer-metal interface, especially with respect to polymer composition and O-ring size and shape, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We present Sandwich-ELISE, a {{concatenated}} {{version of}} our previously proposed Experimental <b>LIquid</b> <b>SEaling</b> (ELISE) protocol, {{in which an}} aqueous sample is effectively sealed {{by the addition of}} a small layer of mineral oil, or, alternatively, a chloroform sample was sealed by a water layer. With Sandwich-ELISE, a triple layered geometry composed of deuterated chloroform/aqueous buffer/mineral oil can be used to limit the sample to the active coil volume, effectively replacing the popular Shigemi tubes. Importantly, this procedure is readily applicable to smaller diameter tubes, for which no Shigemi tubes are available. We further present spectra of a 1 microl protein sample sandwiched between the chloroform and Nujol phases in a 1 mm tube, demonstrating thereby that the volume of the aqueous phase of interest can be reduced even further...|$|R

40|$|TutorialPg. 145 - 148. Buffered bushing liquid-film seals {{have been}} in {{existence}} {{for some time and}} have proven to be quite reliable for most centrifugal compressor applications. However, industry has been demanding more from seals and their associated systems over the years. While expecting better performance in terms of lower inner sealant leakage, which means tighter clearances or lower differential pressures, or both, industry primarily wants reliability. Therefore, manufacturers were forced into alternate seals, among which is the pumping type liquid-firm seal. This paper will deal with one company?s approach to meet industry?s many seal requirements with a pumping type <b>liquid</b> <b>seal.</b> Pertinent process considerations will be brought out which establish the proper seal variation as well as the proper associated system for best operation...|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), <b>liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|R
