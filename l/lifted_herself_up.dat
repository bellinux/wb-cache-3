500|$|The Spectator {{was more}} equivocal in its {{appraisal}} of She. The review described the narrative as [...] "very stirring" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] and of [...] "remarkable imaginative power", adding: [...] "The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, {{and from the}} day when Leo and Holly land {{on the coast of}} Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: [...] "To the present writer {{there is a sense of}} the ludicrous in the end of She that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that [...] "in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she <b>lifts</b> <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> against the Omnipotent.

40|$|This article {{highlights}} the processes, challenges, and difficulties of writing about lived, emotional experiences. This article explores the emotional issues confronted and the practical steps taken to write "Abbie’s Life"&mdash;an evocative narrative about one woman’s struggle with bulimia and obesity. This article tacks {{back and forth}} between Abbie’s story and the author’s as the author attempts to reflexively connect their experiences. She shows how she makes use of Abbie’s story to deepen her understanding of her own life and how the author calls on her own experience to heighten her comprehension of Abbey’s. The coffee in my cup has turned cold and bitter. A thin, oily film floats on top. For the past few minutes, the tape player that rests between Abbie and me has been recording the sounds of her soft, barely audible voice and gentle weeping. Sullen and withdrawn, Abbie <b>lifts</b> <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> slowly from the couch, takes our coffee mugs, and walks to the kitchen. Sitting alone now, I begin to reflect on the intensity of the past few hours. As I listen to Abbie run warm tap water into our soiled mugs, I note how exhausted and overwhelmed I feel. We have just spent the past 2 hours in an interactive interviewing (Ellis...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] said Mrs. Rolland. She {{had found}} herself compelled, as {{wife of the}} Bishop, to assent to the self-evident {{proposition}} which had been made. She was a quiet, silent little woman, whom the Bishop had married {{in the days of}} his earliest preferment, and who, though she was delighted to find herself promoted to the society of the big people in the diocese, had never quite <b>lifted</b> <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> into their sphere. Though she had her ideas as to what {{it was to be a}} Bishop's wife, she had never yet been quite able to act up to them.|$|E
6000|$|But {{she could}} not; {{her head and}} hands were broiling hot, and she was terribly thirsty; when she <b>lifted</b> <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> {{to get a drink}} of water such a pang went through her head that she fell back on the bed groaning, and lay there with beating heart. And strange pains that she did not know went through her. Then a cold shiver seemed to rise in the very marrow of her bones and run down every artery and vein, {{freezing}} the blood; her skin puckered up, and drawing up her legs she lay huddled together in a heap, the shawl wrapped tightly round her, and her teeth chattering. Shivering, she whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} after, she sickened with {{symptoms}} of the plague, and her frame was so weakened that she sank very quickly. She was often delirious; but when she was too much exhausted to endure the exertion of taking cordials, her husband entreated her to try for their children's sake, she <b>lifted</b> <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> and made the endeavor. She lay peacefully, saying, 'she was but looking for the good hour to come', and calmly died, making the responses to her husband's prayers even to the last. Her he buried in the churchyard, and fenced the grave in afterwards with iron rails. There are two beautiful letters from him written on her death--one to his little children, to be kept and read when they would be {{old enough to understand}} it; the other to his patron, Sir George Saville, afterwards Lord Halifax. 'My drooping spirits', he says, 'are much refreshed with her joys, which I assure myself are unutterable.' He wrote both these letters in the belief that he should soon follow her, speaking of himself to Sir George as 'his dying chaplain', commending to him his 'distressed orphans', and begging that a 'humble pious man' might be chosen to succeed him in his parsonage. 'Sire, I thank God that I am willing to shake hands in peace with all the world; and I have comfortable assurance that He will accept me for the sake of His Son, and I find God more good than ever I imagined, and wish that his goodness were not so much abused and contemned', writes the widowed pastor, left alone among his dying flock. And he concludes, 'and with tears I entreat that when you are praying for fatherless and motherless infants, you would then remember my two pretty babes'.|$|E

60|$|The {{subject of}} this {{reflection}} is at all events so occupied in washing greens at present that she remains unsuspicious of Mr. George's approach until, <b>lifting</b> <b>up</b> <b>herself</b> and her tub together when she has poured the water off into the gutter, she finds him standing near her. Her reception of him is not flattering.|$|R
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} on his feet, leaning over her, a changed man, masterful, passionate. She opened her lips, but said nothing. She felt <b>herself</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>up,</b> clasped {{for a moment}} in his arms. Unresisting, she felt the fire of his kisses. The world seemed to have stopped. Then she tried to push him away, weakly, and against her own will. At her first movement he laid her tenderly back in her place.|$|R
60|$|He set his hat firmly with {{a little}} tap, and next moment she felt <b>herself</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> in the {{powerful}} embrace of his arms. Her feet lost the ground; her head hung back; he showered kisses on her face with a silent and over-mastering ardour, as if in haste to get at her very soul. He kissed her pale cheeks, her hard forehead, her heavy eyelids, her faded lips; and the measured blows and sighs of the rising tide accompanied the enfolding power of his arms, the overwhelming might of his caresses. It {{was as if the}} sea, breaking down the wall protecting all the homes of the town, had sent a wave over her head. It passed on; she staggered backwards, with her shoulders against the wall, exhausted, {{as if she had been}} stranded there after a storm and a shipwreck.|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, for two {{or three}} days after her return, Mr. McClosky {{followed}} his daughter about the house with yearning eyes, and occasionally with timid, diffident feet. Sometimes he came upon her suddenly at her household tasks, with an excuse so palpably false, and a careless manner so outrageously studied, that she was fain to be embarrassed for him. Later, he took to rambling about the house at night, and was often seen noiselessly passing and repassing through the hall after she had retired. On one occasion, he was surprised, first by sleep, and then by the early-rising Jenny, as he lay on the rug outside her chamber-door. [...] "You treat me like a child, father," [...] said Jenny. [...] "I thought, Jinny," [...] said the father apologetically,--"I thought I heard sounds as if you was takin' on inside, and, listenin' I fell asleep."--"You dear, old simple-minded baby!" [...] said Jenny, looking past her father's eyes, and lifting his grizzled locks one by one with meditative fingers: [...] "what should I be takin' on for? Look how much taller I am than you!" [...] she said, suddenly <b>lifting</b> <b>herself</b> <b>up</b> to the extreme of her superb figure. Then rubbing his head rapidly with both hands, as if she were anointing his hair with some rare unguent, she patted him on the back, and returned to her room. The result of this and one or two other equally sympathetic interviews was to produce a change in Mr. McClosky's manner, which was, if possible, still more discomposing. He grew unjustifiably hilarious, cracked jokes with the servants, and repeated to Jenny humorous stories, with the attitude of facetiousness carefully preserved throughout the entire narration, and the point utterly ignored and forgotten. Certain incidents reminded him of funny things, which invariably turned out to have not the slightest relevancy or application. He occasionally brought home with him practical humorists, with a sanguine hope of setting them going, like the music-box, for his daughter's edification. He essayed the singing of melodies with great freedom of style, and singular limitation of note. He sang [...] "Come haste to the Wedding, Ye Lasses and Maidens," [...] of which he knew a single line, and that incorrectly, as being peculiarly apt and appropriate. Yet away from the house and his daughter's presence, he was silent and distraught. His absence of mind was particularly noted by his workmen at the Empire Quartz Mill. [...] "Ef the old man don't look out and wake up," [...] said his foreman, [...] "he'll hev them feet of his yet under the stamps. When he ain't givin' his mind to 'em, they is altogether too promiskuss." ...|$|R

60|$|It was not necessary. The girl's mind, {{perhaps because}} it was imbued already with the subject, had possessed itself of what filled her mother's. She dropped from the elbow on which she had <b>lifted</b> <b>herself,</b> and turned her face into the pillow, with a long wail of shame.|$|R
