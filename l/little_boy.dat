5|$|After the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> assemblies in 1947 {{for use by the}} Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} <b>Little</b> <b>Boy.</b> They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E

5|$|The rest of Project Alberta {{departed}} for Tinian following the {{successful completion of}} the Trinity test on 16 July.

The whole of Project Alberta was assembled on Tinian by 25 July, except for members who were couriers for bomb parts. Nolan arrived on 26 July on the cruiser , along with Major Robert Furman and Captain Charles H. O'Brien of the 1st Technical Services Detachment, with the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> assembly and active material. Jesse Kupferberg and Raemer Schreiber arrived by C-54 with the remainder of the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> active material and the plutonium Fat Man pit.|$|E

No <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.|$|E
