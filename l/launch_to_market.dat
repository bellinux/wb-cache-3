50|$|The growing mobile market, the {{unsatisfied}} {{requirements of}} mobile devices and the advantages {{that can be}} gained {{by the development of}} new techniques leaves much more room for the existing competition and for new competitors entering the market. Thus the SIP and the software supporting it (the device drivers and maybe even the software infrastructure for these device drivers, i.e. the entire graphics stack) can be considered more prone to discretion and a quick <b>launch</b> <b>to</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} a 12 -month LDA-funded {{collaborative}} project with Prior 2 Lever, a sports footwear start-up company combining design and podiatry with 3 D direct manufacturing technology to develop custom fit and design sports footwear for elite athletes, {{resulting in the}} <b>launch</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> of the “assassin” football boot. My role was to explore novel surface decoration strategies to give the sole unit the required aesthetic appeal that such a high value application required, and to advise on the overall product aesthetic design. This was a progression of my research into mass-customisation, and the opportunities offered by direct 3 D manufacturing to produce individualised, functional parts {{without the need for}} tooling. This new manufacturing paradigm emerged from Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies which allow layered manufacturing of 3 D objects directly from a CAD file. While some RP technologies allow colour parts to be produced (3 D printing), laser sintering which involves high temperatures is not, as yet able to deliver surface texture mapped images. Subsequently, post-manufacturing techniques for finishing and colouring the parts were explored, such as vacuum dye-sublimation. As a result, a number of designs were developed for the launch. This work situates my practice between craft design practice (engaging with the aesthetic possibilities offered by digital tools) and engineering design practice (using digital tools to derive design from optimised structures and materials). My work looks at the combination of these in their relationship to the body and the decorated surface. The “assassin” boot is subsequently being trialled with a female England player, and a male Manchester City and Danish international player...|$|E
