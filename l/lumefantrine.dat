5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and <b>lumefantrine</b> into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, <b>lumefantrine,</b> mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, <b>lumefantrine,</b> or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Several fixed-dose ACTs are now {{available}} containing an artemisinin component and a partner drug which has a long half-life, such as mefloquine (ASMQ), <b>lumefantrine</b> (Coartem), amodiaquine (ASAQ), piperaquine (Duo-Cotecxin), and pyronaridine (Pyramax). Increasingly, these combinations are being made to GMP standard. A separate issue concerns the quality of some artemisinin-containing products being sold in Africa and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lumefantrine</b> (or benflumetol) is an {{antimalarial}} drug. It is {{only used}} {{in combination with}} artemether. The term [...] "co-artemether" [...] is sometimes used to describe this combination. <b>Lumefantrine</b> has a much longer half-life compared to artemether and so is therefore thought to clear any residual parasites that remain after combination treatment.|$|E

50|$|The Project 523 also {{resulted}} in the discovery of synthetic drugs such as pyronaridine in 1973, <b>lumefantrine</b> in 1976 and naphthoquine in 1986. These are all antimalarial drugs and are used in artemisinin-combination therapy.|$|E
50|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} {{the treatment of}} uncomplicated P. falciparum with artemisinin-based combination therapy. Given in combination with <b>lumefantrine,</b> it may {{be followed by a}} 14 day regimen of primaquine to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale malarial parasites and provide a complete cure.|$|E
50|$|Artemether/lumefantrine, {{sold under}} the trade name Coartem among others, is a {{combination}} of the two medications artemether and <b>lumefantrine.</b> It is used to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum that is not treatable with chloroquine. It is not typically used to prevent malaria. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Artemether is a {{medication}} {{used for the}} treatment of malaria. The injectable form is specifically used for severe malaria rather than quinine. It may not be as effective as artesunate.

50|$|In January 2009, Novartis and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) {{launched}} Coartem Dispersible, a artemisinin-based {{combination therapy}} developed specifically {{for children with}} malaria. Coartem Dispersible contains the same ratio of artemether and <b>lumefantrine</b> as Coartem. It works {{as well as other}} formulations. The sweet-tasting Coartem Dispersible tablets disperse quickly in small amounts of water, easing administration and ensuring effective dosing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Novartis filed a new Chinese patent for a {{combination}} treatment with artemether and <b>lumefantrine,</b> providing the first artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) (Coartem) at reduced prices to the World Health Organisation. In 2006, after artemisinin {{had become the}} treatment of choice for malaria, the WHO called for an immediate halt to single-drug artemisinin preparations in favor of combinations of artemisinin with another malaria drug, {{to reduce the risk}} of parasites developing resistance.|$|E
50|$|Halofantrine {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} malaria. Halofantrine's {{structure}} contains a substituted phenanthrene, and {{is related to the}} antimalarial drugs quinine and <b>lumefantrine.</b> Marketed as Halfan, halofantrine is never used to prevent malaria and its mode of action is unknown, although a crystallographic study showed that it binds to hematin in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. Halofantrine has also been shown to bind to plasmpesin, a haemoglobin degrading enzyme unique to the malarial parasites.|$|E
5000|$|Zhou {{specifically}} {{worked on}} artemether, {{one of the}} derivatives of artemisinin. In 1985 he combined artemether with another drug <b>lumefantrine</b> into a single tablet, which he successfully used {{for the treatment of}} severe malaria. With the support of Novartis, the drug was produced in 1991 under the brand name Coartem, and it became the first artemisinin-based combination therapy. For this invention he and his team were awarded the European Inventor Award of 2009 in the category [...] "Non-European countries".|$|E
50|$|Food, in {{particular}} fat, enhances {{the absorption of}} both artemether and <b>lumefantrine,</b> and patients are advised to take the tablets with food {{as soon as a}} meal can be tolerated. Coartem has a potential to prolong the QT interval, so combinations with other drugs having that property can cause irregular heartbeat, potentially leading to lethal ventricular fibrillation. The combination with halofantrine, another antimalarial, can cause a life-threatening QT prolongation. Drugs and other substances influencing the activity of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice, can either increase or lower blood levels of artemether/lumefantrine, depending on the sort of substance. This can either lead to more severe side effects or to reduced efficiency.|$|E
50|$|A dose of 8 mg/kg of {{halofantrine}} is {{advised to}} be given in three doses at six-hour intervals {{for the duration of}} the clinical episode. It is not recommended for children under 10 kg despite data supporting the use and demonstrating that it is well tolerated. The most frequently experienced side-effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and itch. Severe ventricular dysrhythmias, occasionally causing death are seen when high doses are administered. This is due to prolongation of the QTc interval. Halofantrine is not recommended for use in pregnancy and lactation, in small children, or in patients that have taken mefloquine previously. <b>Lumefantrine</b> is a relative of halofantrine that is used in some combination antimalarial regimens.|$|E

Zhou showed that artemether combined with another antimalarial <b>lumefantrine</b> was the most potent of all antimalarial drugs.

50|$|Zhou {{was among}} more than 500 Chinese {{scientists}} assigned to investigate {{for a new}} antimalarial medication during the Cultural Revolution. Established by Mao Zedong-led government in 1967, the collaborative research was called Project 523. In 1972 Tu Youyou and her team discovered artemisinin (originally known as qinghaosu). The new compound was demonstrated {{to be an effective}} drug against Plasmodium falciparum. A more stable compound artemether was synthesised from artemisinin. In 1981 the National Chinese Steering Committee for Development of Qinghaosu (artemisinin) and its Derivatives authorised Zhou to work on artemether.

5000|$|In 1967, a plant {{screening}} research program, {{under the}} name Project 523, {{was set up by}} the People's Liberation Army to find an adequate treatment for malaria; the program and early clinical work were ordered of Chairman Mao Zedong at the request of North Vietnamese leaders to provide assistance for their malaria-ridden army. In the course of this research, Tu Youyou discovered artemisinin in the leaves of Artemisia annua (annual wormwood; 1972). The drug is named qinghaosu in Chinese. [...] It was one of many candidates tested as possible treatments for malaria by Chinese scientists, from a list of nearly 5000 traditional Chinese medicines. Tu Youyou also discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant. Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments written in AD 340 by Ge Hong saying that this herb should be steeped in cold water. This book contained the useful reference to the herb: [...] "A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all." [...] Tu's team subsequently isolated a useful extract. The extracted substance, once subject to purification, proved to be useful starting point to obtain purified artemisinin. A 2012 review reported that artemisinin-based therapies were the most effective drugs for treatment of malaria at that time; it was also reported to clear malaria parasites from patients' bodies faster than other drugs. In addition to artemisinin, Project 523 developed a number of products {{that can be used in}} combination with artemisinin, including <b>lumefantrine,</b> piperaquine, and pyronaridine.|$|E

The focus of present study is to report bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, dose linearity and permeability of <b>lumefantrine</b> in rats. Methods A single dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg of <b>lumefantrine</b> was given orally to male rats (N = 5 per dose level) to evaluate dose proportionality. In another study, a single intravenous bolus dose of <b>lumefantrine</b> was given to rats (N = 4) at 0. 5 mg/kg dose following administration through the lateral tail vein in order to obtain the absolute oral bioavailability and clearance parameters. Blood samples were drawn at predetermined intervals and the concentration of <b>lumefantrine</b> and its metabolite desbutyl-lumefantrine in plasma were determined by partially validated LC-MS/MS method. In-situ permeability study was carried in anaesthetized rats. The concentration of <b>lumefantrine</b> in permeability samples was determined using RP-HPLC. Results For nominal doses increasing in a 1 : 2 : 4 proportion, the C max and AUC 0 -∞ values increased in the proportions of 1 : 0. 6 : 1. 5 and 1 : 0. 8 : 1. 8, respectively. For <b>lumefantrine</b> nominal doses increasing in a 1 : 2 : 4 proportion, the C max and the AUC 0 -t values for desbutyl-lumefantrine increased in the proportions of 1 : 1. 45 : 2. 57 and 1 : 1. 08 : 1. 87, respectively. After intravenous administration the clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (Vd) of <b>lumefantrine</b> in rats were 0. 03 (± 0. 02) L/h/kg and 2. 40 (± 0. 67) L/kg, respectively.

Upon post hoc simulation of <b>lumefantrine</b> exposure, patients in the EFV-arm had lower exposure (median (IQR)) compared to that in the control-arm; AUC 0 -inf; was 303, 130 (211, 080 – 431, 962) versus 784, 830 (547, 405 – 1, 116, 250); day- 7 <b>lumefantrine</b> plasma concentrations was: 335. 5 (215. 8 - 519. 5) versus 858. 7 (562. 3 - 1, 333. 8), respectively. The predictive model through simulation of <b>lumefantrine</b> exposure at different dosage regimen scenarios for patients on EFV-based ART, suggest that AL taken twice daily for five days using the current dose could improve <b>lumefantrine</b> exposure and consequently malaria treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Co-treatment of AL with EFV-based ART but not NVP-based ART significantly reduces <b>lumefantrine</b> bioavailability and consequently total exposure. To ensure adequate <b>lumefantrine</b> exposure and malaria treatment success in HIV-malaria co-infected patients on EFV-based ART, an extension of the duration of AL treatment to five days using the current dose is proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} pfmdr 1 mutations and copy number on in vitro artemether and <b>lumefantrine</b> sensitivity in 101 laboratory and adapted Thai isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. Approximately one-fourth of these isolates exhibited reduced <b>lumefantrine</b> susceptibility. We found that both mutations and amplification of the pfmdr 1 gene influenced in vitro artemether and <b>lumefantrine</b> sensitivity. Using multivariate analysis, 184 F or 1042 N alleles and a copy number of ≥ 4 were identified as the independent markers for decreased <b>lumefantrine</b> susceptibility. Separate analysis also indicated that parasites from different geographical areas were influenced by different genetic markers...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of {{thin layer chromatography}} densitometric analysis of artemether/lumefantrine aims to establish a cheap and reliable method for analysis of artemether and <b>lumefantrine</b> using cheap solvents and simple apparatus which can be easily available in small laboratories. The method has been established so as to analyse artemether and <b>lumefantrine</b> in any I formulation containing artemether and <b>lumefantrine.</b> Because of lack of UV sensitivity of artemether, derivatization was done to make it UV active. The method involves scanning first for <b>lumefantrine</b> at wavelength of 337 nm followed with derivatizing a plate and scanning for artemether at wavelength of 560 n...|$|E
