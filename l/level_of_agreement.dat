40|$|While expert groups {{often make}} {{recommendations}} {{on a range}} of non-controversial as well as controversial issues, little is known about how the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> expert consensus-the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> expert agreement-influences perceptions of the recommendations. This research illustrates that for non-controversial issues expert groups that exhibit high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> are more persuasive than expert groups that exhibit low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement.</b> This effect is mediated by the perceived entitativity-the perceived cohesiveness or unification of the group-of the expert group. But for controversial issues, this effect is moderated by the perceivers' implicit assumptions about the group composition. When perceivers are provided no information about a group supporting the Affordable Care Act-a highly controversial piece of U. S. legislation that is divided by political party throughout the country-higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> are less persuasive than lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> because participants assume there were more democrats and fewer republicans in the group.

The study investigated the differences in perceptions of principals, veteran teachers, and beginning teachers.

Based on the findings, no significant difference in perception of professional development and collaboration exists between educators currently utilizing a compensation model and those not utilizing a compensation model.

40|$|AIM: To compare <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> amongst {{paediatric}} clinicians {{with those}} amongst consultant paediatric radiologists when interpreting chest radiographs (CXRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four paediatric radiologists used picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstations {{to evaluate the}} presence of five radiological features of infection, independently in each of 30 CXRs. The radiographs were obtained over 1  year (2008) from children with fever and signs of respiratory distress, aged 6 months to < 16  years. The same CXRs were interpreted a second time by the paediatric radiologists and by 21 clinicians with varying experience levels, using the Web 1000 viewing system and a projector. Intra- and interobserver agreement within groups, split by grade and specialty, were analysed using free-marginal multi-rater kappa. RESULTS: Normal CXRs were identified consistently amongst all 25 participants. The four paediatric radiologists showed high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> intraobserver <b>agreement</b> between methods (kappa scores between 0. 53 and 1. 00) and interobserver agreement for each method (kappa scores between 0. 67 and 0. 96 for PACS assessment).

CONCLUSION: Paediatric radiologists showed high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> for all features. In general, the clinicians had lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> than the radiologists.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{comprehensively}} investigate {{the reliability of the}} Functional Movement Screen ™ (FMS). The study presents the findings of a comprehensive reliability study, which demonstrates differences between the intra‐ and inter‐ rater reliability of the FMS. The intra‐rater reliability of the FMS shows excellent <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> (0. 86), while the inter‐rater reliability shows moderate <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> (0. 57). Further analysis shows that certification status of raters does not affect the reliability, with both certified and non certified raters showing very similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> (0. 57 & 0. 56). In conclusion, a single rater should use the FMS over time to assess subjects in order to maintain reliable data. Comparing athletes using a variety of raters should be avoided, and where possible in‐service training sessions should be provided to raters in order to ensure rating is as similar as possible. This thesis adds much needed research into the understudied area of FMS reliability, while providing practical advice that will benefit practitioners who utilise the FMS in their practice...|$|R
