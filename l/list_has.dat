5|$|In 2000, Kalmus Music Publishers {{brought out}} an edition where former Philadelphia Orchestra {{librarian}} Clint Nieweg made over 21,000 corrections to the score and parts. Since then a published errata <b>list</b> <b>has</b> added some 310 more corrections, {{and this is}} considered to be the most accurate version of the work as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic <b>list</b> <b>has</b> been pieced together that extends back into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E
5|$|Each yearly <b>list</b> <b>has</b> often {{included}} a few recordings that {{have also been}} selected {{for inclusion in the}} holdings of the National Archives' audiovisual collection. Those recordings on the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry that are of a political nature will tend to overlap with the audiovisual collection of the National Archives. The list shows overlapping items and whether the National Archives has an original or a copy of the recording.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} sight word <b>lists</b> <b>have</b> been {{compiled}} and published; {{among the most}} popular are the Dolch sight words and the magic 100 words. These <b>lists</b> <b>have</b> similar attributes, as they all aim to divide words into levels which are prioritised and introduced to children according to frequency of appearance in beginning readers' texts. Although many of the <b>lists</b> <b>have</b> overlapping content, the order of frequency of sight words varies and can be argued depending on contexts such as geographical location, empirical data, samples used, and year of publication.|$|R
5|$|The {{award is}} based upon the players' {{performances}} in the voting period, typically from August for a year. Prior to 2009, each of the top ten women's national teams nominated two players, and the final selection was made by a 16-person panel. Since 2009, a long <b>list</b> <b>has</b> been chosen by the ICC Awards voting panel, composed of cricket administrators, journalists and former players. This is then trimmed to create a short list by a different, 25-person, board.|$|E
5|$|FIU {{also holds}} many Golden Panther spirit events {{throughout}} the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp {{held in the}} Summer prior to the Fall term for incoming freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a retreat center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other incoming students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants. Panther Camp {{is expected to grow}} in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting <b>list</b> <b>has</b> continued to double from year to year. Freshmen who participate are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on September 26, 1913 and played in theaters throughout the United States. The unbilled cast <b>list</b> <b>has</b> been stated to include Lon Chaney {{in the role of}} the pawn broker. The propaganda film was billed as a popular love story by theaters, but the production was the subject of much concern by organized charities. The Charity Organization Societies sought to produce a film to counter the negative portrayal of charities in The Blood Red Tape of Charity. P. L. Whitney stopped short of directly calling the film's portrayal dangerous, but advocated that charity members use the media to highlight the film's faults and exaggerations. Patricia Erens would use the surviving film still of the pawn broker, claimed to be Lon Chaney by scholars, as an example of Jewish character archetypes that were prominent in silent films. The film is now considered lost.|$|E

5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this <b>list</b> <b>has</b> evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
