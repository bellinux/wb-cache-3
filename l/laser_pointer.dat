5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a <b>laser</b> <b>pointer</b> at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

40|$|Single Display Groupware (SDG) is a {{research}} area that focuses on providing collaborative computing environ-ments. Traditionally, most hardware platforms for SDG support only one person interacting at any given time, which limits collaboration. In this paper, we present <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> as input devices that can provide concurrent input streams ideally required to the SDG environment. First, we discuss several issues related to utilization of <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> and present the new concept of computer con-trolled <b>laser</b> <b>pointers.</b> Then we briefly present a perfor-mance evaluation of <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> as input devices and a baseline comparison with the mouse according to the ISO 9241 - 9 standard. Finally, we describe a new system that uses multiple com-puter controlled <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> as interaction devices for one or more displays. Several alternatives for distinguishing between different <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> are presented, and an im-plementation {{of one of them}} is demonstrated with SDG applications...|$|R
50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>pointers</b> {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications. Green <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> can also be used for amateur astronomy. Green laser is visible at night due to Rayleigh {{scattering}} and airborne dust, allowing someone to point out individual stars to others nearby. Also, these green <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> are commonly used by astronomers worldwide at star parties or for conducting lectures in astronomy. Astronomy <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> are also commonly mounted on telescopes in order to align the telescope to a specific star or location. Laser alignment is much easier than aligning through using the eyepiece.|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> were helium-neon (HeNe) gas lasers and {{generated}} laser radiation at 633 nanometers (nm), usually designed {{to produce a}} laser beam with an output power under 1 milliwatt (mW). The least expensive <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> use a deep-red laser diode near the 650 nm wavelength. Slightly more expensive ones use a red-orange 635 nm diode, more easily visible because of the greater sensitivity of the human eye at 635 nm. Other colors are possible too, with the 532 nm green laser being the most common alternative. Yellow-orange <b>laser</b> <b>pointers,</b> at 593.5 nm, later became available. In September 2005 handheld blue <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> at 473 nm became available. In early 2010 [...] "Blu-ray" [...] (actually violet) <b>laser</b> <b>pointers</b> at 405 nm went on sale.|$|R
25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red <b>laser</b> <b>pointer</b> close to the eye and staring into the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
25|$|Light exerts {{physical}} {{pressure on}} objects in its path, a phenomenon {{which can be}} deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure {{is equal to the}} power of the light beam divided by c, the speed of light. Due to the magnitude of c, the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects. For example, a one-milliwatt <b>laser</b> <b>pointer</b> exerts a force of about 3.3 piconewtons on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a U.S. penny with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers. However, in nanometre-scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research. At larger scales, light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster, acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill. The possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the <b>laser</b> <b>pointer</b> tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E

25|$|Pointing a laser at an {{aircraft}} can be hazardous to pilots and {{has resulted in}} arrests, trials and jail sentences.

500|$|Unlike Pip, the Narissa dragon {{was allowed}} {{to be more of}} a fantasy {{character}} while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain. The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras eyelines instead of a <b>laser</b> <b>pointer.</b> Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a [...] "puppeteering" [...] approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.|$|E
500|$|Pip, a {{chipmunk}} who {{can talk}} in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech {{in the real world}} so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from [...] "every conceivable angle", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, Maya and Furrocious. When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage. To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have. During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a <b>laser</b> <b>pointer</b> would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.|$|E
