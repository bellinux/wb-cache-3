50|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> {{itself is}} not {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> to <b>points</b> on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> at a <b>point</b> just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{complete}} {{rear suspension}} assembly is {{carried in a}} steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> to a <b>point</b> on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|R

5000|$|Yet another {{variation}} of short link design is the [...] "Switch link", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle {{is connected to}} the frame using an eccentric lower pivot, effectively creating a very short <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> whose length is that {{from the center of the}} eccentric to the attached pivot. The <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or [...] "Switching" [...] the <b>lower</b> <b>link's</b> direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> has been replaced with a liner bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This liner bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{function}} of the governor is to maintain the mean speed of the engine with in specified limits whenever there is {{a variation of the}} load. The objective of our investigation is modifying the Watt Governor (pendulum type) to increase minimum speed limit. [2] Generally we seen that watt governor is best suitable for 60 - 80 r. p. m minimum speeds only, in our study we extend lower arm and fly ball position of the watt governor to the downside from the intersection of link and arm, and then we derive the equation for governor speed. We fabricated the model of governor and observed effect of the extension of <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> and fly ball weight on minimum speed of the governor. This analysis carried out by extension of <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> of the governor and position of fly balls.

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and <b>lower</b> <b>links</b> pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|R

50|$|Each <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> is {{fabricated}} from a {{steel tube}} with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer {{end of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>link</b> pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through {{the bottom of each}} hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent {{to the bottom of the}} differential casing. Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.|$|R
