40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the key topics of discussion in the area of vehicle safety legislation in Europe and Japan. Leg injuries are the most common injuries found in nonfatal pedestrian accidents. The EC regulation and Euro NCAP are evaluating pedestrian leg protection performance in current vehicles. The TRL <b>legform</b> impactor is specified by the EC regulation, where Phase 1 took effect during 2005 and a draft phase 2 is scheduled to take effect in 2013. The global technical regulation (GTR) pedestrian protection test protocol was made basically using the TRL <b>legform</b> impactor. However, a flexible <b>legform</b> impactor has been under development. When the flexible <b>legform</b> impactor development is fully completed and evaluated, it is possible that both <b>legform</b> impactors may be determined to be useful in the GTR. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pedestrian leg protection performance of the frontal area of current vehicles using the TRL <b>legform</b> impactor and the flexible <b>legform</b> impactor. Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle (SUV), height wagon, and 1 box car) were used. The center of the bumper and center of the side members (i. e., the vehicles main longitudinal beams) were selected as impact locations for the <b>legform</b> impactors tests. This paper discusses an equivalence of injury assessment between the TRL <b>legform</b> impactor and flexible <b>legform</b> impactor...|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCar-pedestrian {{collision}} fatalities {{have been}} reported for {{a significant number of}} roadside accidents around the world. Protection of pedestrians is taking on an increasingly significant role to car manufactures in developing new designs. The dynamic responses of the pedestrians in vehicle crashes can better be evaluated by examining the biomechanical responses. In order to reduce the lower extremity injuries in car-pedestrian collisions, it is important to determine the impact forces on the pedestrian and conditions that the car frontal side impacts on the lower extremities of the pedestrian. The Working Group 17 (WG 17) of the European Enhanced Vehiclesafety Committee (EEVC) has developed a <b>legform</b> subsystem impactor and procedure for assessing pedestrian collisions and potential injuries. This study describes a methodology for the evaluation of the <b>legform</b> impactor kinematics after a collision utilizing finite element (FE) models of the <b>legform</b> and cars, and comparing the simulation results with the ones from a multi-body <b>legform</b> model as well as a 50 th percentile male human pedestrian model responses. Two approaches are carried out in the process. First, the collision strike simulations with the FE model using an FE lower <b>legform</b> is considered and validated against the EVVC/WG 17 regulation criteria. Secondly, the collision strike simulations with a multi-body <b>legform</b> and an ellipsoidal multi-body car model are conducted to compare the responses from the FE model and the multibody model. The results from the impact simulations of FE <b>legform</b> and the multi-body <b>legform</b> are also compared with the ones from a full-size pedestrian model at different speeds. All the FE models of the <b>legform</b> impactor and the car model are developed and evaluated using the LSDYNA nonlinear FE code, while the multibody <b>legform,</b> car, and full-sized pedestrian models are developed and evaluated in MADYMO. The results from this study demonstrate the differences between the subsystem <b>legform</b> and the full-size pedestrian responses as well as suitability of various FE and multibody models related to pedestrian impact responses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Development, {{calibration}} {{and validation}} of a threedimensional {{model of the}} <b>Legform</b> impactor for pedestrian crash with bumper are presented. Lower limb injury is becoming an increasingly important concern in vehicle safety for both occupants and pedestrians. In order to prevent lower extremity injuries to a pedestrian when struck by a car, {{it is important to}} elucidate the loadings from car front structures on the lower extremities and the injury mechanism caused by these loadings. An impact test procedure with a <b>legform</b> addressing lower limb injuries in car pedestrian accidents has been proposed by EEVC/WG 17. In this study a modified <b>legform</b> impactor is introduced and validated against EEVC/WG 17 criteria. The finite element model of this <b>legform</b> is developed using LS-DYNA software. Total mass of <b>legform</b> impactor is 13. 4 kg.

40|$|The new European car-to-pedestrian impact safety {{protection}} regulation has prompted many research efforts in this area. For knee and lower leg protection, the current regulation requires using a <b>legform</b> {{that consists of}} 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) for injury assessment. It mimics the shear and bending about the knee joint when the lateral side of a pedestrian is impacted by a vehicle. However, in a smaller portion, non-lateral impact accidents also exist in the real world. Moreover, even in a purely lateral impact, once the <b>legform</b> contacts with the bumper, it could rotate towards the other directions due to the curvatures of the bumper shape and the deformation of the bumper foam, causing the <b>legform</b> taking load from other directions. For assessing injuries under omni-direction impact, a concept design of a 4 -DOF pedestrian <b>legform</b> is developed. The two added DOFs represent the natural human knee rotation and the shear {{with respect to the}} knee joint when a pedestrian is impacted from the front or the back. The bio-mechanical requirements of the 4 -DOF <b>legform</b> are adopted from the existing 2 -DOF pedestrian <b>legform</b> and the Hybrid III dummy knee. The challenge is to design all the 4 -DOF mechanisms, including the motion and stiffness mechanisms, in a limited space of the <b>legform.</b> Design methodology is also documented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An FE {{model of}} a {{pedestrian}} lower <b>legform</b> impactor has been developed and certied, both statically and dynamically, based on EEVC-WG 17 requirements. The <b>legform</b> is then utilized {{in a series of}} 40 km/hr pedestrian accident analyses to assess the protection level delivered by a typical sedan vehicle. The values of maximum tibia acceleration, maximum knee bending angle, and maximum knee shearing displacement have been extracted for 25 dierent accident congurations and compared with their admissible ranges. It has been shown that tibia acceleration is mainly in uenced by extension of the area transferring the impact load between the <b>legform</b> and the vehicle. However, variations of vehicle front-end structure geometry and stiness in the vertical direction {{have been found to be}} the most decisive parameters in the level of <b>legform</b> knee maximum bending rotation and maximum shearing displacement...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the biofidelity of LSTC and TRL <b>legform</b> impactor. A finite element model of {{simplified}} front vehicle structure was established. The simulation tests were conducted by using this simplified car model against two different <b>legform</b> impactors and a FE lower extremity, respectively at a speed of 40 km/h. The simulation results from the two <b>legform</b> impactors were compare with that of the FE lower extremity. The compared outputs include tibia acceleration, shear displacement, knee bending angle. The test results show that the tibia acceleration of the impactors and the FE lower extremity are approximately consistent. As to the shear displacement and the knee bending angle, though the output of the impactors are not agreed so well with that of the FE lower extremity, the trend are comparable to some extent. The results of the FE lower extremity are higher than that of the <b>legform</b> impactors. The results of LSTC impactor has a better agreement with that from FE lower extremity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the stiffness of the knee joint, in order to provide a basis for developing a biofidelic pedestrian <b>legform</b> impactor. A biofidelic lower limb model was employed to replicate structural responses of the human knee joint by finite element simulations. In the simulation, a single displacement was imposed on the thigh or leg, and constrained six freedoms of the other part. As a result, nonlinear load-displacement data were approximated by a linear regression to determine the stiffness. Considering knee joint kinematics under lateral car-pedestrian impacts, a stiffness matrix was established including lateral bending, lateral shearing and torsion effects that significantly influence pedestrian lower limb injuries. Then, this stiffness matrix was applied in a developed <b>legform</b> model. The structural responses of the <b>legform</b> were obtained by the impact with a family car model. Finally, the <b>legform</b> biofidelity was evaluated by comparing the global kinematics of the pedestrian lower limb...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle-pedestrian {{collisions}} {{had claimed}} {{the lives of}} many in the world roads yearly. Among the types of injury that may occur in a vehicle-pedestrian collision, lower extremity injuries have the highest account. These alarming statistic has encouraged joining effort from researchers, car manufacturers and the government to find solutions in reducing the risk of vulnerable road users. The car bumper structure design plays a crucial role in cushioning the impact on the pedestrian leg during a collision. The European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) has developed test methods to evaluate severity of the lower leg injury, upper leg injury and head impact injury in a vehicle-pedestrian simulated collision. Since lower extremity injury are most common, undivided attention should be paid on the lower <b>legform</b> to bumper test. The maximum bending angle, maximum shearing displacement and maximum tibia acceleration are among the three injury criterion determined for lower <b>legform</b> to bumper test. Before the lower <b>legform</b> to bumper test can be perform the lower <b>legform</b> has to be certified statically and dynamically. The advancement of computerization had supported the usage of Finite Element Method(FEM) in simulating real life scenarios for analysis. Irregular geometries are now discretized and solved numerically. Finite Element Analysis(FEA) has proven to reduce time and cost significantly therefore the author took advantaged of this tool and simulated a lower <b>legform</b> to bumper collision. This paper presents in detail the static and dynamic certification of the Finite Element (FE) <b>legform</b> model using the HyperWorks software.

40|$|The aim of {{the master}} thesis was to study the knee injury {{mechanisms}} in an impact condition associated with car-to-pedestrian accidents, analyse the influences of the physical parameters on the lower extremity impact responses, and predict the injury risks under different impact conditions. The study {{also contributed to the}} evaluation of the validity of the EEVC <b>legform</b> model and a FE model of the lower extremity. For the purpose mentioned above, two substitutes of lower extremity were simulated by using MADYMO MBS-FEM coupling technique and RADIOSS program respectively. One was the EEVC <b>legform</b> model, another the human lower limb model (LLMS) developed by MECALOG in France. The knee and leg injury mechanisms were first investigated using EEVC <b>legform</b> model. The influence of car front structures, upper body mass and presence of tibia fracture on the calculated injury parameters was investigated using total 24 simulations. The LLMS model was refined and evaluated using published cadaver test data. Six simulations of bumper-to-lower extremity impacts were carried out under various loading conditions including two types of car front models at impact speeds of 20 and 40 km/h. The results from LLMS model simulations were analysed and compared with the results from simulations of EEVC <b>legform</b> impacts in terms of injury related parameters: knee shearing displacement, knee bending angle and impact forces. The results showed that the shearing and bending injuries of the knee joint were two important injury mechanisms associated with car-to-pedestrian crash accidents. During the impacts, the major parameters influencing the lower extremity injury severity were bumper stiffness, bumper height and impact velocity. It was confirmed that the upper body mass had certain influence on the knee bending angle and shearing displacement. The tibia fracture had a significant influence on the knee joint injuries. The results also showed that the EEVC <b>legform</b> model was much stiffer than LLMS model for both knee joint and tibia. Further improvement of EEVC <b>legform</b> biofidelity was suggested. The rupture mechanism of the soft tissues in the knee joint was recommended to be simulated in the LLMS model...|$|E

Data accident shows that each year died 6000 people in Europe as a consequence of a traffic accident. The lower extremities are represented by the lower <b>legform</b> impactor in the laboratory tests. The lower <b>legform</b> that is being used nowadays is the one of the TRL.

The main target of this research project is to obtain a simplified model to analyse and to predict the behaviour of the front of the vehicle in the lower <b>legform</b> pedestrian protection.

40|$|Current and {{proposed}} pedestrian test procedures in Europe and Japan evaluate lower extremity injury risk {{by using a}} projectile <b>legform</b> to impact the bumper of a stationary vehicle. Although there are no pedestrian regulations in North America, bumper design is affected in both the United States and Canada by regulations limiting damage in low-speed impact testing. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) evaluate differences in instrumentation capability and kinematic response of two pedestrian legforms (FlexPLI 2004, TRL), and (2) determine if and to what extent vehicles designed to conform to North American bumper regulations are more aggressive toward pedestrians than similar vehicles designed to conform to European bumper impact requirements. The results indicated that none of the North American bumpers were able to achieve the level of pedestrian lower leg protection required by future European Union regulations. It was also found that both legforms have limitations in testing the North American bumpers.

40|$|Current EuroNCAP test {{specifications}} attempt to predict pedestrian lower limb injury in a lateral impact with a rigid <b>legform</b> test device {{developed by the}} UK 2 ̆ 7 s TRL (Transportation Research Lab). Research shows that the measurements taken from this device (knee bending angle, knee shear, and upper tibia acceleration) do not necessarily correspond to accurate injury prediction. Recent {{research suggests that the}} primary improvement to the current test device would be a flexible <b>legform,</b> or one that has more biofidelity (i. e., simulates actual human lower limb response). The work presented in this paper first reviews current legforms developed for pedestrian impact testing, including the TRL impactor used in EuroNCAP tests, Honda 2 ̆ 7 s POLAR II pedestrian dummy, and JAMA/JARI 2 ̆ 7 s FLEX-PLI <b>legform</b> impactor. Component level testing shows the FLEX-PLI performance to be close to the human lower limb response corridors. However, there are still areas of potential improvement with this design. To address these areas, this research includes the phase 1 development of a new <b>legform</b> impactor incorporating adjustable ligament pre-load, direct ligament strain measurements, adjustability in knee flexion to account for the gait cycle, tuned composite bone cores that match the force-deflection curves of PMHS testing, and a condyle load plate that measures knee joint compressive forces.

In so doing, the injury specifications set by the EEVC will be modified to account for the more accurate injury assessment of the improved device...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} test {{procedure}} {{proposed by the}} European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) /WG 17 for evaluating leg injuries to pedestrians, a <b>legform</b> impactor with a rigid bony structure is used. The risk of damages to knee ligaments is evaluated with the shearing displacement and the bending angle at the knee joint. A recent study has focused on evaluating biofidelity of the <b>legform.</b> However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a local deformation at the knee joint from published experiments with Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHSs). In addition, past PMHS experiments have suggested that the height of a bumper significantly affects the risk of ligamentous damages. In this study, three kinds of finite element models were used in order to investigate the relationship between the bumper height and the shearing displacement / bending angle of the knee; 1) a <b>legform</b> impactor with a rigid bony structure, 2) a recently developed pedestrian dummy (Polar) with both a flexible tibia and a biofidelic knee joint structure, 3) a human lower limb. By utilizing the human model, a local deformation at the knee joint could be obtained. The model for the <b>legform</b> impactor and the pedestrian dummy have been validated against experiments with an actual car and in component level, respectively. The human lower limb model has been validated against published PMHS experiments. The result of a parameter study with these models in a range of bumper heights showed that the dynamic response of the dummy model is quite similar to that of the human model. In addition, it was found that the mass of the upper body significantly affects the bending angle of the knee. A geometric analysis of the knee joint was also performed to obtain tensile strains of four principal knee ligaments as a function of both the shearing displacement and the bending angle.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The paper {{presented}} here concerns with the bumper system design optimization for <b>legform</b> impact. Not only lower leg impact but also vehicle to dummy collision were simulate {{to answer the}} question whether the optimized body structure for the sub-system impact is also optimal for real pedestrian impact. Parametric analysis of bumper system under lower leg impact was performed. Modifications in bumper system, which required minimum package space to meet lower leg impact limits were designed. Besides the bumper absorber, the spoiler stiffener was designed not only for keeping the bend angle and the share displacement under limit value, but also for tibia acceleration reduction in this study. It was proved that properly designed stiffness of the lower stiffener and its relative position {{to the rest of the}} bumper significantly influenced both distribution of <b>legform</b> impact energy absorbed by bumper itself and spoiler (lower stiffener) and tibia acceleration. The effect of design changes, leading to improvement in the lower leg impact, on the total kinematics and loading on the pedestrian was investigated.

40|$|The EEVC WG 17 {{upper leg}} test {{as used in}} Euro NCAP was reviewed. Previous work {{revealed}} shortcomings of the EEVC WG 17 test set-up. Recent published accident data show that injuries to the lower extremities by the bonnet leading edge, not including ground impacts, only accounted for 5 % of all AIS 2 + injuries and 4 % of all AIS 3 + injuries. Previous work and this data indicate a discrepancy in importance of the upper leg test between Euro NCAP and real-life injury frequencies. Suggested <b>legform</b> impactor threshold values have {{so far not been}} based on human injury risk transferred to impactor values. The implications of the proposed improvements to the test set-up from Snedeker et al. (2005) for Euro NCAP test results have not been assessed. Both the above issues are aimed at in this study. They are important as only with the right targets and evaluation methods, traffic related injuries can be minimized. Human injury threshold values for femur and pelvis impact were derived from applicable and original PMHS data. Data was scaled to a mid-sized male, survival analysis with Weibull fit was performed with exact femur 3 -point bending data, logistic regression with doubly censored pelvis impact data. <b>Legform</b> thresholds were derived using a linear regression between impactor and THUMS values derived form tests conducted by Snedeker et al. (2005). It is assumed that THUMS and upper leg surrogates have a similar response. The implications of the new set-up and thresholds for Euro NCAP test results were assessed for results published 2009 and 2010 using empirical relationships between impact energy, measured force and moment. Using this approach, the resulting thresholds to be used with the <b>legform</b> were determined to be 7. 9 - 9. 0 kN for the pelvis test and 300 - 365 Nm for the femur test. These values correspond to 5 and 20 % fracture risk, respectively. With the currently used set-up and limits, the average score for the upper leg test is 22 % of the maximum score. With the proposed method and limits, the average score calculated is 70 %. With only 30 % missing, the score matches better with the accident frequency of bonnet leading edge induced injuries to lower extremities...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{pedestrian}} casualties in vehicle traffic accidents, safety countermeasures, for example the active hood system and external airbag system, have been proposed to protect pedestrians in vehicle collisions. Such a protection system must consist of a sensing system to detect the pedestrian impact and/or the potential impact. It is a key issue to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} detection system. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of a remote sensing system and a contact sensor for the detection of pedestrian impacts. In paper I, a remote sensing system was evaluated for the pedestrian detection in vehicle traffic environment. In this study, the car-pedestrian accident data were selected from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA), a database developed by collecting accident data from the police and hospitals. In this database, 9 scenarios of car-pedestrian accidents were defined according to pedestrian and car trajectories and accident locations. A total of 2, 199 car-pedestrian impacts with identified accident scenarios were selected from the database and further analyzed in this study. Based upon the analysis, the two most common scenarios–accounting for 46. 8 percent of all the cases–were identified as cars entering and leaving intersections colliding with pedestrians crossing the road. Based on this understanding, the knowledge of these two scenarios was developed in terms of the trajectories and speeds of pedestrians and cars: the qualitative pedestrian and car trajectories were described by the definition of the accident scenarios, while the quantitative speeds of pedestrians and cars were estimated based on pedestrian ages and road speed limits. By using both the qualitative and quantitative data, a mathematical model was presented with the hypothesis that all the pedestrians in both scenarios were not obstructed. The effectiveness of the sensing system for the detection of potential pedestrian collisions was then evaluated by using this model. In paper II, a new pedestrian air-tube contact sensor in the car bumper was developed at Autoliv Research due to that a traditional contact sensor can be unstable at varying temperatures. This paper aimed to evaluate the new contact sensor for the temperature-independent measurement of pedestrian impacts. First, the baseline FE bumper model of a production car was developed and validated according to the EuroNCAP lower <b>legform</b> impact tests performed on the car bumper. The results of the validation analysis were comparable with the test results, but they have exceeded the limits of the EEVC WG 17 lower <b>legform</b> impact tests. The baseline bumper model was therefore considered as valid, but it required an enhanced safety performance. Based on the baseline model, an improved bumper model was subsequently developed to meet the EEVC requirements. Following the EEVC test methods, the <b>legform</b> impact simulations were conducted in the middle and on the left and right sides of the improved bumper model, resulting in the maximum <b>legform</b> responses of tibia accelerations from 117 to 139 g and knee bending angle from 7. 7 to 9. 3 degree, thereby meeting the EEVC requirements. Second, a FE human lower extremity model was developed; the baseline and improved bumper models were further evaluated using this human model. The improved model was shown to protect the human knee joint effectively, but the risks of tibia and fibula fractures were increased. Finally, the contact sensor was built into the improved bumper model and an analysis was conducted to evaluate the sensor performance. From paper I, it was concluded that the sensing system can detect almost all the pedestrians in the two scenarios, if the detective angle of the system is greater than 60 degrees. From paper II, it was determined that using a 25 -mm instead of 50 -mm air-tube sensor resulted in more stable sensor output at varying temperatures in the EEVC WG 17 <b>legform</b> impacts; moreover the sensor was more sensitive to the different masses of the impact objects. The 25 -mm air-tube sensor was thus a better choice for the contact sensor design...|$|E

The headform impact and one of the upper <b>legform</b> impacts were with the top rail of the bull bar, and the second upper <b>legform</b> impact was with the bumper section of the bull bar. Equivalent locations on the vehicle that the bull bars were attached to were also tested. The tests were conducted at 30 km/h. Two rating systems were developed to summarise the results.

Based on the accident data, a mathematical model was presented, and the remote pedestrian sensor system was evaluated using this model. The contact sensor was analyzed for the temperature-independent measurement of pedestrian impacts. A baseline bumper finite element (FE) model was initially developed and validated using the European New Car Assessment Program (EuroNCAP) lower <b>legform</b> impact tests performed on the production bumper. Based on the baseline bumper model, an improved bumper model was subsequently developed to meet the acceptance requirements of the European Enhanced Vehicle–safety Committee Working Group 17 (EEVC WG 17) lower <b>legform</b> impact tests. A lower limb FE model was then developed and used to evaluate further the protective performance of the baseline and improved bumper models. Finally, the contact sensor was incorporated into the improved bumper model, and a performance study was conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of temperature stability and mass sensitivity of the sensor output. The performance of the RBS was investigated for the protection of pedestrians’ lower limbs during bumper collisions. The detailed FE model of a production car front was developed and validated based on the EuroNCAP lower <b>legform</b> impact tests performed on the production car front. Next, a model RBS was developed to replace the original bumper in the car front model. In order to investigate the performance of the RBS, the lower limb model and the EEVC WG 17 lower <b>legform</b> model were used to collide with the RBS model of different design configurations under various impact conditions. Finally, the effects of the design parameters on the protective performance of the RBS were calculated using the statistical method for factorial experiment design. The RH was evaluated and optimized for the prevention of head injuries among adult pedestrians from hood collisions. The car front FE model was validated based on the EuroNCAP adult headform impact tests conducted on the car hood. The baseline RH was subsequently developed from the original hood of the validated car front model. The FE models of a 50 th percentile human head and the EEVC WG 17 adult headform were used in parallel to evaluate the protective performance of the baseline RH. In order to minimize the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values of the headform model, the response surface method was applied to optimize the RH in terms of material stiffness, lifting speed and lifted height. Finally, the headform and human head models were once again used to evaluate the protective performance of the optimized RH. The results of this study indicated that the remote sensor system can detect almost all visible pedestrians in the two most common scenarios in a timely manner when the detection angle is greater than 60 degrees. The contact sensor can also identify pedestrian impacts with the car bumper. Moreover, enhanced sensor output stability and mass sensitivity can be achieved by using a 25 mm rather than 50 mm sensor tube. The RBS performance can be improved by reducing bumper stiffness; however, such performance is impaired in the bumper-deploying process at speeds of 2. 5 m/s or greater. Less than 150 mm, the deployment distance of the RBS has no influence on the bumper protective performance. Compared with the retracted and lifting baseline RH, the lifted baseline RH can definitely minimize the injury parameters of the headform and human head models. When the optimized RH is lifted, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values of the headform and human head models are reduced to much lower than 1, 000. Thus, the risk of pedestrian head injuries can be prevented as required by EEVC WG 17...|$|E
40|$|Statistic studies {{carried out}} during last decades have {{underlined}} as pedestrians - with a prevalence {{of children and}} elderly - are a category with great risk in car accidents, particularly in the urban areas: according to recent investigations of a research committee of the European Community (CEC 2001), {{the risk of death}} in case of accident is, for pedestrians and cyclists, equal respectively to 9 and 8 times vehicle occupants' one. Particularly, in the European Union every year about 7000 pedestrians die (EEVC, European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee, "Improved test methods to evaluate pedestrian protection afforded by passenger cars," 1998; ETSC, European Transport Safety Council, "Safety of Pedestrian and Cyclists in Urban Areas,"[1, 5] 1999); that value represents around the 20 % of the total of death caused from road accidents. In the world, this percentage varies from 14 % in the United States (NTSHA, "Traffic safety facts 1994," 1995) at 47 % in Thailandia (D. Mohan, J. Kajzer, K. Bawa Blialla, S. Chawla, S. Sarabjit, Conference on the Biomechanics of Impacts, 1995). Sensitization of the public bodies and of the private companies towards the problem of pedestrian passive safety allowed the start of systematic study in subject, so that the European Committee, in 1988, appointed a working group (WG 10) which, in the 1994, {{at the end of its}} task, has defined a test protocol for the evaluation of the "aggressiveness" of the front part of the vehicle towards pedestrians. This protocol, partially revised in the 1998 [2] by a followed working group (WG 17), establish the use of impactors for simulating, singularly, the body parts that, according to thorough statistic studies, have resulted as the mostly exposed to serious damages: knees, pelvis and the head. For each of these impacts it has been found the area statistically interested from greatest number of serious impacts in order to reach the definition of three types of test: <b>legform</b> to bumper test, upper <b>legform</b> (femur-pelvis) to bonnet leading edge test, head to bonnet top test, using, in that case, impactors of two different measures, adult and child...|$|E
40|$|A {{pedestrian}} contact sensor {{in the car}} bumper is {{a potential}} solution to trigger an active hood system. Because of {{the high level of}} temperature dependency for the bumper foam stiffness, the sensor output can be unstable at varying temperatures. A new contact sensor was therefore developed to provide a temperature-independent measurement for pedestrian impacts. This study analyzed the performance of the bumper-pedestrian contact sensor system. First, a baseline Finite Element (FE) bumper model of a production car was developed and validated. Based on the baseline model, an improved bumper model was subsequently developed to meet the requirements of the lower <b>legform</b> impact tests proposed by Working Group 17 of the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC WG 17). Second, a FE human lower extremity model was developed. Using this model, the baseline and improved bumper models were further evaluated in terms of the predicted knee ligament raptures and long bone fractures. Finally, the new contact sensor was built into the improved bumper model. A performance study was then conducted to evaluate the sensor effectiveness. Consequently, a better diameter for the sensor tube was identified in terms of the temperature stability and mass sensitivity of the sensor output...|$|E
40|$|Multibody {{modelling}} of pedestrian collisions {{requires the}} definition of contactimpact between the pedestrian and the vehicle. An examination of relevant impact test data reveals large rate-dependent components of the reaction force, permanent indentation, and concomitant energy loss. Contact-impact models previously used in simulations of pedestrian impacts typically have not adequately modelled one, two or {{all three of these}} phenomena. This paper presents a phenomenological contact-impact model based on the Hunt-Crossley model of impact, which includes rate-dependent damping, and is extended to include permanent indentation. The proposed model suitably characterises impact test data in a form that can also be implemented in the multibody simulation code MADYMO (Tass-Safe, Netherlands). The proposed contact-impact model was used to characterise the impact between a <b>legform</b> and the bumper of a vehicle, based on two impact tests conducted at different impact speeds. A single contact-impact definition in MADYMO closely reproduced the dynamics of both tests. The proposed model may be suitable {{in a wide range of}} impact conditions where the impact is modelled using multibody techniques and it is practicable to conduct impact tests as part of the modelling process. contact-impact properties, impact test, multibody simulation, nonlinear damping, pedestrian collision...|$|E
40|$|Pedestrians and cyclists are {{the most}} {{unprotected}} road users and their injury risk in case of accidents is significantly higher than for other road users. The understanding of the influence and sensitivity between important variables describing a pedestrian crash is key {{for the development of}} more efficient and reliable safety systems. This paper reflects the related work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results summarized out of virtual and physical tests provide valuable information for further development. 1168 virtual and 120 physical tests were carried out with adult and child pedestrian headform as well as upper and lower <b>legform</b> impactors representatives of 4 different vehicle front geometries {{in a wide range of}} impact speeds, angles and locations. This test matrix was based on previous work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results obtained show several trends and influences of input variables (impact speed, angle, location, impactor masses, impactor type) on the particular outcomes. In general, impact speed was the most influential parameter. The increase of impact speed resulted in higher HIC, bending moment or force presumably generating a higher injury risk. The work carried out provided the results to enable further development of Injury Risk Curves regarding VRU protection for different body regions. This work provides insight into the variation of injury criteria when also considering different speed and angles which is especially useful for the evaluation of active safety systems (e. g. AEB) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT - EEVC {{proposed}} the pedestrian headform impact test procedure {{to minimize the}} risk of head injuries in passenger car to pedestrian collisions. To meet the test requirements one protective system was developed and named Active Hood. It consists of a hood that is lifted in the rear end in case of a pedestrian impact. To activate it a contact sensor placed in the bumper is needed. An important issue of the sensor system to be solved is the temperature sensitivity arising from the unstable stiffness of bumper foam with the variety of environment temperature. A new concept pedestrian sensor has thus been developed and it should be less temperature dependent. This study aims at development of mathematical model of a new bumper system. Then the model will be used to optimize the new pedestrian sensor concept so as to solve the temperature sensitivity issue. Based on physical tests with simplified experimental bumpers in Autoliv Research, three Finite Element (FE) experimental bumper models have been developed in a first phase. Using these experimental bumper models, 11 physical tests were simulated to obtain the valid material parameters for a production bumper. Then a detailed production bumper FE model has been developed using validated material parameters. The standard production bumper model was evaluated according to EEVC WG 17 test procedure requirements. Two aspects of improvement were then made on this model for the purpose that the improved FE bumper model can meet the requirements of the EEVC WG 17 <b>legform</b> test procedure. Based on the improved bumper FE model, the new pedestrian sensor has been introduced in bumper foam and optimization has been carried out with varying concept sensor parameters. According to the optimization analysis, the smaller sensor tube diameter will lead to a better result. In all the tested parameters, the 25 mm diameter of sensor tube with 2. 5 bars initial air pressure can give a high distinction of sensor signals when impact with objects of different masses. The signals from this FE model are less temperature dependent, which provided a mathematical model and background knowledge for a pedestrian sensing system design...|$|E
40|$|In late 70 ', {{mainly in}} the United States and in Australia, {{independent}} research centres had processed several statistical data on accidents between vehicles and pedestrians, taking care, obviously, to pedestrians' injury. That problem in the early 80 ' became also interesting for European research centres. In 1990 a research group of EEVC (European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee) had examined statistical data of past twenty years and scientific research published about this topic, and had presented several documents about "pedestrian test" procedures. In reference papers of period of twenty years (1977 - 97) and in documents of EEVC, the scientists describe a proposed test for lower-leg impact; it {{is represented by the}} impact of a standardised impactor (that simulate the human leg) on car front-part; those documents have been updated in 1994, 1998 and finally in 2002 while Euro-NCAP, since 1998 had used them to realize, in specialized laboratories, tests for giving a rate for car-safety judgement. EEVC wants to introduce those tests for the new homologation program since 2010. A "lighter" version of those tests will be performed on new-cars, also for homologation, using ACEA Protocol, which is easier to per form, since 2005. The most Important Automotive industries had understood the impact of those new regulations about homologation and began to study the problem and particularly how to introduce these new Homologation parameters in their Product development cycles, today based on Virtual Prototyping of the Whole Vehicle and final Physical testing of few physical prototypes. EEVC lower-leg impactor was thought in order to evaluate the injury in several parts of the leg using three parameters: - Deceleration of the higher part of the tibia in order to evaluate the injury on Tibia bone; - Shear displacement in the knee joint in order to evaluate the damage that occurs at the human knee for the displacement of the patella towards the higher part of the Tibia - Maximum bending angle in non-natural way of deformation of the knee (in left or right side) that causes the injury for knee ligaments. Those three parameters are useful to evaluate what happens when a pedestrian, that cross a road orthogonally to the vehicle direction, is rammed by a car, and hits the Bonnet and the bumper by Leg (femur/tibia). Impactor used to evaluate the damage in pedestrian test is made by TRL and is quite similar to the structure of the Human leg: it has a very complicated joint system. In this study we have simulated the <b>Legform</b> Impactor, using FEM processor PamCrash (TM), using the ESI (TM) Kinematic joint formulation. After that work of modelling we have tested the Impactor by the simulation of the Certification Tests, as described in the EEVC and EuroNCAP norms, in order to obtain the same results of the experimental test. The Numeric/Experimental correlation is very good and we've numerically certified our FEM impactor...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{analysis}} of predicted injuries to the lower leg and head of pedestrians in vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions through finite element (FE) simulations were analyzed. Today, pedestrian regulatory tests consist of subsystem tests using impactors that are made to hit the vehicle; there is no use of any pedestrian crash test dummy. Hence, the kinematics of the impactors used in the testing procedure can be questioned. An alternative way to assess vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction and injury risks is {{through the use of}} a FE-Human Body Model (HBM). This thesis presents a comparison of injuries predicted by simulated regulatory tests and injuries predicted by a modified Total Human Body Model for Safety (THUMS), with KTH head and neck model, when impacting an advanced FE-model of a sedan passenger car. The injuries in focus are those sustained to the lower extremities, mainly to the knee ligaments and tibia bone fracture, and the head. Further, real-life vehicle-to-pedestrian accidents were reconstructed with the modified THUMS to indicate the power of accident reconstructions using FE simulations. The modified THUMS and the leg impactor did not predict similar risk of leg injuries. THUMS predicted lower ligament elongation and higher tibia bending moments than the impactor. The ligament elongation difference between THUMS and impactor is not comparable. For tibia bending moments, THUMS predicted 18 % higher bending moments than impactor for impact point P 3 and tibia- 2 cross-section for small passenger vehicle-to-pedestrian collision, on average it was 60 % higher for Flex-PLI positioning 75 mm above ground and 42 % higher when Flex-PLI is positioned according to THUMS walking stance. For tibia injury risk as predicted with modified THUMS, vehicle velocity and pedestrian impact location along the width of the energy absorber were significant. Moreover, presence of a femur fracture influenced the tibia bending moment; femure fracture varied as a function of impact location and vehicle velocity. The injuries to the head as predicted by the modified THUMS, with Rigid KTH head and neck model, and headform impactor were found to have similar head impact kinematics with similar head impact duration and behavior of acceleration curve. Predicted head injuries, using the injury measures HIC 15 and BRIC, were influenced by the head impact location on the vehicle, vehicle height in relation to THUMS and vehicle velocity. In the accident reconstructions modified THUMS model predicted high HIC 15 values, representing high risk of head injuries as compared to the head injury reported in the two cases that were reconstructed. The difference is qualitative only, no quantitative difference conclusion can be drawn from the results. This deviation in results could be explained due to the fact of non-availability of head impact locations in the database cases, not including the vehicle deceleration which may be present during actual accident and non-inclusion of road and weather conditions.
