5000|$|Semi-intelligent readers: {{have all}} {{inputs and outputs}} {{necessary}} to control door hardware (<b>lock,</b> door <b>contact,</b> exit button), but do not make any access decisions. When a user presents a card or enters a PIN, the reader sends information to the main controller, and waits for its response. If the connection to the main controller is interrupted, such readers stop working, or function in a degraded mode. Usually semi-intelligent readers are connected to a control panel via an RS-485 bus. Examples of such readers are InfoProx Lite IPL200 by CEM Systems, and AP-510 by Apollo.|$|R
50|$|Power {{interlockings}} {{may also}} use mechanical locking {{to ensure the}} proper sequencing of levers, but the levers are considerably smaller as they themselves do not directly control the field devices. If the lever is free to move based on the <b>locking</b> bed, <b>contacts</b> on the levers actuate the switches and signals which are operated electrically or electro-pneumatically. Before a control lever may be moved into a position which would release other levers, an indication must be received from the field element that it has actually moved into the position requested. The locking bed shown is for a GRS power interlocking machine.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike basic readers, IP readers do {{not require}} control panels and operate independently. A basic reader simply sends card numbers to a panel and does not control an {{electric}} <b>lock,</b> door <b>contact</b> or exit button. If the control panel fails, the basic reader stops working. An IP reader has inputs for monitoring a door contact, exit button and a relay for controlling an electric lock. It also has internal memory for storing the database of users, configuration parameters and recording events. Such readers are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "intelligent readers" [...] or [...] "readers with built-in controllers".|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the biomechanical properties of a new minimum <b>contact</b> <b>locking</b> plate (MC-LP) compared with the limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP). Eighteen pairs of fresh human osteoporotic cadaver radii were equally divided into three groups. Each specimen was tested in each of the following force applications: anteroposterior (AP) four point bending, mediolateral (ML) four point bending, and torsion. A 10 -mm gap osteotomy model was used to simulate a comminuted diaphyseal radial fracture. For each pair, one radius received a limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) and the contralateral radius was fixed with a minimum <b>contact</b> <b>locking</b> plate (MC-LP). Specimens were tested in nondestructive four point bending and torsion on an electronic universal material testing system. The results indicate that the MC-LP system is significantly more stable than the LC-DCP system when tested in four point bending and torsion in an osteoporotic comminuted radial diaphyseal fracture model...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of thermal}} dissociation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was studied in 0. 05 M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7. 4 containing 10 − 4 M EDTA. The number of conformational <b>locks</b> and <b>contact</b> areas and amino acid residues of dimers of SOD {{were obtained by}} kinetic analysis and biochemical calculation. The cleavage bonds between dimers of SOD during thermal dissociation and type of interactions between specific amino acid residues were also simulated. Two identical contact areas between two subunits were identified. Cleavage of these contact areas resulted in dissociation of the subunits, with destruction of the active centers, and thus, lost of activity. It is suggested that the contact areas interact with active centers by conformational changes involving secondary structural elements...|$|R

This motion assures that the <b>locking</b> lugs fully <b>contact</b> the receiver and so headspace is held to a minimum every time the bolt is locked.

50|$|The chamber {{block is}} locked to the handle block, which {{contains}} the locking surface, firing button (pushed by the trigger when the chamber block is locked), pistol grip, battery and electronics. The cartridge primers are ignited electrically, {{so there are}} four circular contact plates on the <b>locking</b> surface (<b>contacting</b> the case bottom) and four contact pins {{in the center of}} each plate (contacting the primer). On the trigger pull an impulse is generated. The electronic firing mechanism is able to send firing impulses in sequence to the chambers from 1 to 4 and to skip chambers with malfunctioning rounds to avoid misfires. The weapon is only capable of firing one round at a time. There are different models of PB-4; in some, the firing mechanism is fed by a battery, on others by a piezoelectric igniter similar to those used by kitchen gas lighters.|$|R

Load-controlled cyclic fatigue tests {{were carried out}} using a sine waveform and in tension-tension mode. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray techniques were employed to analyze the fretting failure mechanisms of the joints. The experimental results showed that there was extremely severe fretting at the contact interfaces of rivet and sheet materials for the joints at relatively high loads levels. Moreover, the severe fretting in the region on the <b>locked</b> sheet in <b>contact</b> with the rivet was the major cause of the broken locked sheet for the joints at low load level...|$|R
40|$|The third {{generation}} of the fluidic hand currently {{is in the process}} of clinical trial. The new hand combines functionality and cosmesis. It has the natural shape of a human hand and multiple new functions. The grasping operation is built in an adaptive way according to the biological example. This means that objects are enclosed with positive <b>locking.</b> The big <b>contact</b> area and soft passive elements considerably reduce the grasping force required to hold an object securely. Starting from a natural basic hand position, all actuators can be controlled individually by two myoelectrodes in the socket. The software allows for a quick selection of the most important grasping patterns.

40|$|A {{berthing}} mechanism {{especially for}} use in berthing and compliant air-tight securing between manned space vehicle and modules is disclosed. The interface is provided {{by a pair of}} annular rings, one of which is typically, mechanically attached to the vehicle and the other to the module to which it is to be docked and secured. One of the two rings is attached to a base by resilient bellows. The facing surface of one annular ring is joined to a base by a cable laced through alternating pulleys attached circumferentially so that the interface surface of that ring may be tilted to accommodate angular misalignment as the annular rings are brought into docking (berthing) contact. Interleaving guide flanges with chambered sides provide at least some rotational mialignmnet correction.

30|$|These studies provide strong {{evidence}} that people make predictive eye movements while viewing naturalistic activity. However, no previous studies have tested whether predictive looking varies {{as a function of}} event structure. Therefore, in a series of two studies that were designed as close replications of one another, we used a new anticipatory looking task, called the Predictive Looking at Action Task (PLAT), to investigate the time course of predictability. For this task, participants’ eyes were tracked as they watched movies of an actor performing an everyday activity that consisted of sequences of goal-directed actions. Participants were not told to engage in any explicit task other than paying attention to the movie. Prediction was measured based on the amount of time participants spent looking at the object the actor was about to touch during the three seconds before the actor actually contacted the object. This task therefore allowed predictive looking to be time <b>locked</b> to object <b>contact</b> and made it possible to analyze the time course of predictive looking. We hypothesized that looking to the to-be-contacted object would increase as time to object contact approached, providing an index of predictive looking.|$|R

The {{impact of}} inefficient cross {{polarization}} (long TCH values), caused by long 13 C- 1 H internuclear distances, on 13 C CPMAS NMR spectra of charred and uncharred woods {{is determined by}} simultaneously fitting data from complementary variable spin <b>lock</b> and variable <b>contact</b> time experiments. As expected, the impact is minimal for uncharred woods, but is very significant for the charred woods. Quantification of the decrease in CPMAS signal intensity caused by both inefficient cross polarization and rapid T 1 rhoH relaxation is achieved using an advanced spin counting methodology, for which the term "spin accounting" is proposed. 13 C CPMAS NMR observabilities determined using the spin accounting methodology were close to 100 % for the uncharred samples, and 69 - 82 % for the charred samples. This represents a large improvement on the 30 - 40 % observabilities determined using other spin counting techniques. Furthermore, it is shown that remote protonation and rapid T 1 rhoH relaxation are roughly equally responsible for the low signal intensity of standard (I ms contact time) 13 C CPMAS spectra of charcoal.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{whether or not}} a new minimum <b>contact</b> <b>locking</b> compression plate (MC-LCP) can provide advantages over the limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) in the context of interface contact area and force. Six matched pairs of cadaveric bones were used for each of three bone types of the humerus, radius and ulna. For each bone type, one of two bone plates was fixed to either of two matched cadaveric bones at the middle of the diaphysis. The interface contact area and force of the plate fixed to three types of human cadaveric bones were evaluated using Fuji prescale pressure sensitive film. Data were quantitated using computer-assisted image analysis. Results showed that the average force between the MC-LCP and humerus or radius was about half of that of the LC-DCP. And the average force between the MC-LCP and ulna was one third less than that of the LC-DCP. Meanwhile, the interface contact area between the MC-LCP and humerus or radius was also about half of that of the LC-DCP, and the interface contact area between the MC-LCP and ulna was less than one third of that of the LC-DCP. These results indicate that the MC-LCP has lower interface contact area and lower average force than that of the LC-DCP. Thus, the MC-LCP system may be a good alternate to treat forearm diaphyseal fractures...|$|R
40|$|Unintentional {{poisoning}} is {{a significant}} child public health problem. This systematic overview of reviews, supplemented with a systematic review of recently published primary studies synthesizes evidence on non-legislative interventions to reduce childhood poisonings in the home with particular reference to interventions that could be implemented by Children's Centres in England or community health or social care services in other high income countries. Thirteen systematic reviews, two meta-analyses and 47 primary studies were identified. The interventions most commonly comprised education, provision of cupboard/drawer locks, and poison control centre (PCC) number stickers. Meta-analyses and primary studies provided evidence that interventions improved poison prevention practices. Twenty eight per cent of studies reporting safe medicine storage (OR from meta-analysis 1. 57, 95 % CI 1. 22 – 2. 02), 23 % reporting safe storage of other products (OR from meta-analysis 1. 63, 95 % CI 1. 22 – 2. 17) and 46 % reporting availability of PCC numbers (OR from meta-analysis 3. 67, 95 % CI 1. 84 – 7. 33) demonstrated significant effects favouring the intervention group.

The paper highlights the main objectives and issues of his PIANC report with a specific emphasis on gates and specifically on the <b>contact</b> aspects. <b>Locks</b> are key structures {{for the development of the}} navigation in canals and in natural rivers where weirs regulate water levels to enable navigation. They may also be strategic infrastructure for port development. The core of this report has three major parts. The first part presents an exhaustive list of design goals associated with locks. This section is particularly important for decision makers who have to launch a new project. The second part reviews the design principles that must be considered by designers. This section is methodologically oriented. The third part is technically oriented. All main technical aspects (hydraulics, structures, foundations, including computational aspects, etc.) are reviewed, focussing on changes and innovations occurring since 1986. Perspectives and trends for the future are also listed. When appropriate, recommendations are listed. It is impossible to give the details of all lock innovation areas in this paper. As an example, the lock gates and, in particular, the modern views on their contact issues have been chosen. These new solutions are welcome to limit the maintenance and to extend the service life of lock gates. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Using {{classical}} molecular dynamics, atomic scale {{simulations of}} normal contact between a nominally flat substrate and different atomistic and non-atomistic spherical particles {{were performed to}} investigate the applicability of classical contact theories at the nanoscale, and further elucidate the phenomena that govern the perceived breakdown of continuum in nanocontacts. Using a rigorous definition of the real contact area, the corresponding surface energies were calculated via molecular dynamics simulations and validated with values reported in the literature. The contact force and radius, {{as well as the}} contact stress distribution and dislocation propagation were then investigated in detail. The Hertz elastic contact model was shown to sufficiently capture the results of molecular dynamics simulations prior to the onset of plastic deformation for non-adhesive contacts (non-atomistic particles). Moreover, the results show that the Lommer–Cottrell <b>locks</b> observed during <b>contact</b> acted as obstacles to dislocation motion, and cross-slipping of atoms at these points was the deformation mechanism responsible for force drops during loading. In the case of the adhesive atomistic particles, the results were compared to the limiting cases of the Johnson–Kendal–Roberts (JKR) and Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) continuum models. The atomistic systems showed deviations from the classical models, which could be related to energy loss and changes in the effective work of adhesion, as well as the anisotropic properties of the atomistic systems. The findings of this work support the published literature on the subject, and further contribute to our understanding of discrepancies between atomistic and continuum descriptions of contact...|$|R

Methodology Bubble entrapment during irrigation of straight artificial root canals of size 35 or 50 was evaluated by real-time visualizations. The irrigant was delivered by a closed-ended or an open-ended needle positioned at 1 or 3 mm short of working length (WL) and at a flow rate of 0. 033 – 0. 260 mL s− 1. Results were analysed by nonparametric tests at 0. 05 significance. Selected cases were also simulated by a two-phase CFD model. Results A vapor lock was observed in 48 % of the cases investigated experimentally. Increasing the apical size, using an open-ended needle, positioning the needle closer to WL and delivering the irrigant at higher flow rate resulted in significantly smaller vapor <b>lock.</b> An increased <b>contact</b> angle resulted in the entrapment of a larger bubble when a low flow rate was used.
