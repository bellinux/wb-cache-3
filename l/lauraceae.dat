To model the volumetric stem biomass, Cinnamomum of family <b>Lauracea</b> was chosen. Mensuration data were collected based on two volumetric equations, namely, the Huber’s and Newton’s equations. During data collection, the variables considered were height of stem or trunk, height of tree, diameter at breast height, diameter at middle and diameter at top of the stem before the crown. Possible variables with their interactions were screened with spearman correlation tests and values greater than 0. 95 were selected.

O isolamento e as limitações impostas decorrentes da condição geográfica desta comunidade quilombola, localizada no Vale do Ribeira PR obriga os moradores a buscar recursos e melhor infra-estrutura em outros locais. Isso faz com que desenvolvam estratégias diferenciadas e dinâmicas de deslocamentos, como alternativas para enfrentar esta situação. Através desta investigação busca-se compreender como se dão estas relações a partir da experiência vivida e o que isso acarreta no dia-a-dia da comunidade. Através dos {{community}} studies foi possível conciliar teoria ao método, pois a perspectiva micro-escalar presente nesta abordagem permite valorizar a visão dos sujeitos pesquisados. Foi na vivência cotidiana, acompanhando-os em seus deslocamentos diários, também através das entrevistas e na construção de genealogias em conjunto com os moradores, que se chegou aos resultados desta pesquisa. Alguns fatores como a criação do Parque das <b>Lauráceas</b> e a compressão espacial dos fazendeiros a partir dos anos 1970, favoreceram o agravamento do isolamento e o êxodo rural na comunidade. A falta de recursos básicos também os motiva a procurar no mundo urbano o que em seu mundo não encontram. As relações atuais efetuadas entre estes dois mundos vêm demonstrando uma integração entre ambos e alterando a vida na comunidade. The {{purpose of}} this dissertation is to understand the relationships and interactions among the rural and urban worlds, considering the daily life in São João, a rural community maroon. The isolation and the constraints arising from the geographical condition of this maroon community, located in the Vale do Ribeira PR, force residents to seek resources and better infrastructure in other locations. In consequence, they develop different strategies and dynamics of dislocations {{as an alternative to}} face this scenario. This research seeks to understand how these relationships are given from the experience lived and what that entails in day-to-day of community. Through community studies, it was possible to reconcile theory and method. Through the community studies, it was possible to combine the theory with the method, as the micro-scale perspective make possible to appreciate each researched individual view. The research results have been achieved by observing their daily life and accompanying their daily movements. Interviews and a genealogy construction together with the residents were also essential. Some factors, such as the creation of the Park of <b>Lauráceas</b> and the spatial compression of farmers from the 1970 s on, helped to increase the isolation and the rural exodus in the community. The lack of basic resources also motivates them to search in the urban world what they do not find in their own rural world. The current relations made between these two worlds have shown an integration between the two and changing life in the community...|$|R

Six samples from the bark and leaves of ochrosia oppositifolia including three crude extracts and three indole alkaloids and eight isoquinoline alkaloids from the bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla have been tested for their in-vitro inhibitory activity against P. falciparum 3 D 7. Among the crude extracts of Ochrosia oppositifolia dichloromethane crude extract of bark showed the most potent inhibitory activity, with the IC 50 value of 0. 05051 μg/mL, the other crude extracts and compounds showed weak or no inhibitory activity against P. falsiparum as compare as standard which is chloroquine. Three indole alkaloids isolated from the bark of Ochrosia oppositifolia and eight isoquinoline alkaloids isolated from the bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla showed moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activities against Plasmodium falciparum 3 D 7 with the IC 50 of 0. 29 μM, 0. 75 μM and 1. 13 μM for isoreserpiline (120), neisosposinine (121), reserpinine (122) and 0. 08 μM, 1. 18 μM, 3. 11 μM, 0. 65 μM, 0. 26 μM, 3. 99 μM and 1. 38 μM for cycleanine (139), (-) - 10 -Demethylxylopinine (140), reticuline (141), (+) - laurotetanine (142), (+) – bicuculine (143), (-) - a- hydrastine (144), (+) - parfumine (145) and (+) - anolobine (146) respectively which are comparible with standard chloroquine. Antialzheimer activity of crude extracts and pure compounds isolated from the leaves and the bark of Rauvolfia reflexa was carried out. The dichloromethane and ethanol crude iii extracts of the leaves and methanol crude extract of the bark exhibited good inhibitory activity against both enzymes, while the methanol crude extract of the leaves showed moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Cytotoxic effects of rauvolfine B (123), macusine B (130) and isoreserpiline (120) against different cancer and normal cell lines were determined. At the tested concentrations (1. 5 – 250 μM), macusine B (130) and isoreserpiline (120) did not effectively suppress the cell proliferations of cancer cells. Rauvolfine B (123) revealed moderate cytotoxic effects against two breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231) and colon cancer cells (HT- 29). However, test on colon cancer cells (HCT- 116), rauvolfine B (123) elicited the strongest cytotoxic effect with IC 50 value of 46. 86, 39. 93 and 33. 38 μM after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment respectively. Rauvolfine B (123) was selected for further study on the possible mechanism as it shown potential activity activity against HCT- 116 cell line. Morphological changes in the treated HCT- 116 cells with rauvolfine B (123) were observed under fluorescent microscope.

6000|$|Curious Relations of Mascarene Plants.--Among {{the curious}} affinities of Mascarene plants we have culled the {{following}} from Mr. Baker's volume. Trochetia, a genus of Sterculiaceæ, has four species in Mauritius, one in Madagascar, {{and one in}} the remote island of St. Helena. Mathurina, a genus of Turneraceæ, consisting of a single species peculiar to Rodriguez, has its nearest ally in another monotypic genus, Erblichia, confined to Central America. Siegesbeckia, one of the Compositæ, consists of two species, one inhabiting the Mascarene islands, the other Peru. Labourdonasia, a genus of Sapotaceæ, has two species in Mauritius, one in Natal, and one in Cuba. Nesogenes, belonging to the verbena family, has one species in Rodriguez and one in Polynesia. Mespilodaphne, an extensive genus of <b>Lauraceæ,</b> has six species in the Mascarene islands, and all the rest (about fifty species) in South America. Nepenthes, the well-known pitcher plants, are found chiefly in the Malay Islands, South China, and Ceylon, with species in the Seychelles Islands, {443} and in Madagascar. Milla, a large genus of Liliaceæ, is exclusively American, except one species found in Mauritius and Bourbon. Agauria, a genus of Ericaceæ, is found in Madagascar, the Mascarene islands, the plateau of Central Africa, and the Camaroon Mountains in West Africa. An acacia, found in Mauritius and Bourbon (A. heterophylla), can hardly be separated specifically from Acacia koa of the Sandwich Islands. The genus Pandanus, or screw-pine, has sixteen species in the three islands--Mauritius, Rodriguez, and the Seychelles--all being peculiar, and none ranging beyond a single island. Of palms there are fifteen species belonging to ten genera, and all these genera are peculiar to the islands. We have here ample evidence that plants exhibit the same anomalies of distribution in these islands as do the animals, though in a smaller proportion; while they also exhibit some of the transitional stages by which these anomalies have, in all probability, been brought about, rendering quite unnecessary any other changes in the distribution of sea and land than physical and geological evidence warrants.[114] ...|$|E
