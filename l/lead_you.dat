25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should listen to them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E

[...] "Positive Tension" [...] concerns boredom and its dangers, focusing {{on how it}} [...] "can <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> into dark places", while [...] "Banquet" [...] details [...] "how sex is about power, submission, domination and real rapacious desire". The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "She's Hearing Voices", [...] "Red pill / Blue pill / Milk of amnesia", are {{in reference to the}} medications a friend of Okereke's took to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia.

500|$|The loss of Lochry's {{detachment}} {{proved to}} be the fatal setback to Clark's 1781 campaign. In early September, Clark held a series of councils with Kentucky militia officers at Fort Nelson. Clark still advocated carrying out an expedition into the Ohio Country, saying that [...] "I am ready to <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> on to any Action that has the most distant prospect of Advantage, however daring it may appear to be." [...] Given the lateness of the season and the shortage of available men, the council overruled Clark and decided instead to remain on the defensive, although they proposed that another campaign against Detroit should be carried out the next year. On October 1, 1781, a disappointed Clark wrote, [...] "My chain appears to have run out. I find myself enclosed with a few troops, in a trifling fort, and shortly expect to bear the insults of those who have for several years been in continual dread of me." [...] Clark led an expedition against the Shawnee towns on the Great Miami River in 1782, one of the last actions of the war, but he was never able to mount an expedition against Detroit.|$|E

Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just stopped {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville. We finished [...] in the spring, but I don't run good there -- but this is my hardest place. It's a tough place." [...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the <b>lead,</b> <b>you</b> need to make sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack. I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review {{said that while}} [...] "Eclipse restores some of the energy New Moon zapped out of the franchise and has enough quality performances to keep it involving", the film [...] "isn't quite the adrenaline-charged game-changer for love story haters that its marketing might <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> to believe. The majority of the 'action' remains protracted and not especially scintillating should-we-or-shouldn't-we conversations between the central triangle." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a more positive review than {{for the first two}} films in the saga, but still felt the movie was a constant, unclever conversation between the three main characters. He criticized the [...] "gazes" [...] both Edward and Jacob give Bella throughout the movie, and noted that the mountain range that appears in the film looks [...] "like landscapes painted by that guy on TV who shows you how to paint stuff like that." [...] He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, [...] "I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes."

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga and anime have {{commented on}} Sena's character. Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green qualified Sena as [...] "a rather likable put upon hero and visually interesting lead". Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) noted Sena fell into [...] "the archetypal shōnen protagonist" [...] and [...] "the underdog who falls and gets up {{over and over}} again" [...] mold, but praised Sena, calling him [...] "the polar opposite of those talkative, obnoxious, up-and-at-'em heroes that populate so many other series". Writing for Mania.com, Jarred Pine also called Sena an archetypical character, but noted him as a [...] "very likeable" [...] character. Pine praised his debut, saying that it [...] "was a memorable one, as it was both intense and hilarious". Later, he stated that a <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> can cheer for is essential to a sports manga, commenting that Sena [...] "fills that role quite well." [...] The contrast with [...] "Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature" [...] was also praised by Pine. His doormat characteristics was initially [...] "worrying" [...] according to Manga Life's Kevin Hill who said he became [...] "far more likeable" [...] once he meets up Hiruma and Kurita. Zac Bertschy of ANN said that Sena, [...] "unlike so many other shōnen sports heroes, stops moping around and doubting himself and generally tries his damndest"; he is [...] "introspective, kind, and resourceful, something most shōnen heroes can't claim by the third volume of their respective series". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post also shared the feeling that Sena is a [...] "typical protagonist", but remarked how he develops into a more confident character, which [...] "is key to the series" [...] and makes him [...] "a more than acceptable protagonist".|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News called [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] a [...] "sassy [...] girl-power lyrics {{paired with}} [...] club appeal", further writing that {{the song is}} [...] "loud and proud in its {{relentless}} message", and that Beyoncé [...] "is clearly rallying the troops to her side". Nick Minichind of VH1 lauded the song for several pointed comments on empowerment which according to him, [...] "are skillfully weaved into the lyrics, without feeling out of place." [...] He also wrote that [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] restores girls' own subjectivity and that the bridge shows a [...] "practically Cleopatra-channeling Beyoncé." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy described [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] as [...] "yet another female-empowerment revolution that is sure to dominate dancefloors this summer". Robert Copsey, also writing for Digital Spy, awarded the song four stars out of five, complimenting the [...] "earthy beats, hypnotising hooks and militant drums pound relentlessly as Queen B declares it's 'GRLZ who run this mutha' with more woman-friendly conviction than Geri Halliwell at a Spice Girls convention circa 1998." [...] Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] is [...] "as devotedly pro-female as the title would <b>lead</b> <b>you</b> to expect", and is as dancefloor-directed as Beyoncé gets, {{in the tradition of}} [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Single Ladies". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote [...] " [...] misses the mark big time here" [...] and called the song [...] "plain daft". He, however, praised the song's bridge and Beyoncé [...] "warm, gooey harmonies". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice disapproved of the song's lack of structure, calling it [...] "a bit overstuffed, but fairly enjoyable". Dallas Observer critic Shahryar Rizvi stated that the track [...] "cribs a bit" [...] from Major Lazer's [...] "Pon de Floor" [...] and M.I.A.'s track [...] "Boyz", but added that Beyoncé being a couple of years late in acquiring this sound was [...] "a problem".|$|E
