5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|The album artwork, {{photographed by}} American glamour {{photographer}} Peter Gowland, features Patrick Wilson, Rivers Cuomo, Matt Sharp, and Brian Bell standing <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> {{in front of}} a plain, blue background. The simple image would be used prominently in the advertising of the album. The cover received many comparisons to the Feelies' album Crazy Rhythms.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Hebrew writing yet discovered, {{found at}} Khirbet Qeiyafa, {{dates to the}} 10th century BCE. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) trapezoid pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet). The tablet is written from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> indicating that Hebrew writing {{was still in the}} formative stage.|$|E

5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving {{over the body}} of Christ. They are, from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> Nicodemus, Mary Salome, Mary of Clopas, Mary, the mother of Jesus, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} {{numbering}} the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work Der Parthenon, and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme {{in the light of}} recent discoveries. The convention, here preserved, is that blocks are numbered in Roman and figures in Arabic numerals, the figures are numbered <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south.|$|E

5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written in cursive hieroglyphs, most often from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> but also sometimes {{from right to}} left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines – a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E

5|$|Just {{above the}} gate, {{there are three}} coats of arms carved in relief into the arch; from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> they are {{the arms of the}} Wardeux, Dalyngrigge, and Radynden families. The Wardeux family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge's wife; the Radyndens were {{relations}} of the Dalyngrigges. Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest. Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate; the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles, who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years' War, but those flanking it are blank.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5|$|On 33 {{seconds the}} 'game' itself {{begins with the}} two player {{characters}} walking from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> down a deserted street. As the first chorus begins several zombies enter from the right and are shot by the player characters. After 53 seconds the villain from the introduction appears and laughs before disappearing as the playing area is filled with zombies. The view changes to a cut scene showing close-ups of the two players sunglasses then pans out to show a spaceship illuminating the area with yellow light.|$|E
