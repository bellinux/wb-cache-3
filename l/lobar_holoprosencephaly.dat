40|$|Holoprosencephaly is a {{heterogeneous}} developmental malformation {{of the central}} nervous system characterized by impaired forebrain cleavage, midline facial anomalies and wide phenotypic variation. Indeed, microforms represent the mildest manifestation, associated with facial anomalies but an intact central nervous system. In many cases, perturbations in sonic hedgehog signaling are responsible for holoprosencephaly. Here, we have elucidated the contribution of Gas 1 and an additional hedgehog co-receptor, Boc during early development of the craniofacial midline, by generating single and compound mutant mice. Significantly, we find Boc has an essential role in the etiology of a unique form of <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly</b> that only occurs in conjunction with combined loss of Gas 1. Whilst Gas 1 −/− mice have microform holoprosencephaly characterized by a single median maxillary central incisor, cleft palate and pituitary anomalies, Boc−/− mice have a normal facial midline. However, Gas 1 −/−; Boc−/− mutants have <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly</b> associated with clefting of the lip, palate and tongue, secondary to reduced sonic hedgehog transduction in {{the central nervous system}} and face. Moreover, maxillary incisor development is severely disrupted in these mice, arresting prior to cellular differentiation as a result of apoptosis in the odontogenic epithelium. Thus, Boc and Gas 1 retain an essential function in these tooth germs, independent of their role in midline development of the central nervous system and face. Collectively, this phenotype demonstrates both redundancy and individual requirements for Gas 1 and Boc during sonic hedgehog transduction in the craniofacial midline and suggests BOC as a potential digenic locus for <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly</b> in human populations...|$|E
40|$|There are {{multiple}} genetic disorders with known or unknown etiology grouped under obesity syndromes.

40|$|There {{have been}} many causes {{associated}} with bilateral vocal cord palsy, both congenital and perinatal.

40|$|Cyclotocephaly is a {{very rare}} malformative lethal {{condition}} which associates otocephaly (extreme hypoplasia of the mandibular arch with agnathia) and cyclopy with proboscis. The head of a cyclotocephalic neonate from our Museum of Anatomy and Embryology was examined using computed tomography (CT). Cutaneous and osseous three-dimensional reformations were performed. Severe bony malformations were observed. A single orbital cavity {{was surrounded by a}} cartilaginous proboscis and a median fusion of maxillae, temporal and zygomatic bones. The single orbital cavity contained both paramedial eyeballs (synophthalmia). The external auditory meati and the ear pinnae were also parasagittal. No oral cavity and mandible were observed.

Syntelencephaly, a distinct subset of holoprosen-cephaly, 1 is a rare brain malformation in which the hemispheric fusion does not occur at rostral forebrain but rather across posterior frontal region; hence the al-ternative term “middle interhemispheric fusion ” or “dorsal <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly.</b> ” The clinical pre-sentations can vary, with mental defect or global de-velopmental delay being common. 2 The septum pellucidum is absent in all cases.

40|$|ABSTRACTOBJECTIVE: The bispectral index (BIS) is a {{parameter}} {{derived by}} electroencephalography (EEG) {{which provides a}} direct measurement {{of the effects of}} sedatives and anesthetics on the brain and offers guidance on the adequacy of anesthesia. The literature lacks studies on BIS monitoring in pediatric patients with congenital brain disease undergoing general anesthesia. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 13 -year-old child weighing 32 kg, suffering from <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> underwent surgery in which the bispectral index (BIS) monitoring the depth of anesthesia showed an abnormal response. Detailed analysis of the trends of BIS values in the different observation times demonstrated sudden falls and repetitive values of BIS likely related to repetitive epileptiform electrical activity caused by sevoflurane. CONCLUSION: The BIS is a very useful monitoring tool for assessing the degree of depth of anesthesia and to analyze the electroencephalographic variations of anesthetics. Particular attention should be given to patients with congenital disorders of the central nervous system in which the BIS may give abnormal responses that do not reflect an accurate assessment of the depth of anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|The novel homeobox-containing gene Vax 1, {{a member}} of the Emx/Not gene family, is {{specifically}} expressed in the developing basal forebrain and optic nerve. Here, we show that Vax 1 is essential for normal development of these structures. Mice carrying a targeted mutation of Vax 1 show dysgenesis of the optic nerve, coloboma, defects in the basal telencephalon, and <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly.</b> With the help of molecular markers we determined that in the developing visual system, the absence of Vax 1 results in a proximal expansion of the activity of Pax 6 and Rx. This observation suggests that Vax 1 may interfere negatively with the expression of Pax 6 and Rx. In reciprocal gain-of-function experiments, injection of Xvax 1 mRNA or Shh into Xenopus embryos primarily affects the brain {{at the level of the}} eye primordium. Consistent with the loss-of-function results, the injection of Xvax 1 results in a down-regulation of Rx. Similarly, Shh injection expands the Vax 1 and Pax 2 territory at the expense of the Pax 6 and Rx region. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for a molecular cascade involved in the establishment of structures of the visual system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRhombencephalosynapsis is an {{uncommon}} cerebellar malformation defined by vermian agenesis with fusion of the hemispheres {{and of the}} dentate nuclei. Embryologic and genetic mechanisms are still unknown, and to date, no animal models are available. Ultrasound diagnosis is generally suspected after 22 weeks of gestation, and usually the abnormality is suggested by ventriculomegaly. Morphological analysis of 40 fetuses after medical termination of pregnancy allowed us to confirm that rhombencephalosynapsis was always associated with other brain abnormalities or malformations: Purkinje cell heterotopias, fusion of colliculi, forking and/or atresia of the aqueduct and of the third ventricle resulting in a fusion of the thalami, agenesis of the corpus callosum, <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly</b> and neural tube defects. Pons and medulla were very infrequently abnormal. Furthermore, complete autopsy {{made it possible to}} separate either pure neurologic phenotypes, or associated with extraneural anomalies from syndromic forms: Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome (1 case) and VACTERL-H syndrome (6 cases). The number of our fetal cases strongly suggests that VACTERL-H association related with rhombencephalosynapsis emerges as a non-random association. Furthermore, recurrence and consanguinity were noted in two different families, which argue for a sporadic or inherited cause. From our results, it could be suggested that rhombencephalosynapsis may be due to defective genes regulating formation of the roof plate and the development of midline cerebellar primordium at the junction of the mesencephalon and of the first rhombomere...|$|E
40|$|Gelastic {{seizures}} {{are characterized}} by inappropriate, stereotyped laughter and are often first recognized when other epileptic man-ifestations occur. They are frequently associated with hypothala-mic hamartomas. Central nervous system developmental abnormalities are rarely reported with gelastic seizures. There is only one case report of gelastic seizure caused by holoprosen-cephaly. We report a 2 -year-old girl with multiple brain structural abnormalities including tectal tumor (possibly hamartoma), mul-tiple subependymal nodules, and holoprosencephaly. She developed seizures during the newborn period and presented with gelastic seizure and simple partial seizure at 3 months of age. (J Child Neu-rol 2002; 17 : 152 - 154). Gelastic seizures were first described by Trousseau in 1873. ’ The seizures {{are characterized by}} inappropriate, stereotyped laughter and are often first recognized as seizures when other epileptic manifestations occur. They have frequently been associated with hypothalamic masses, generally hamartomas. 2. : 3 Other types of pathology such as pituitary tumors, astrocytomas of the mammil-lary bodies, third ventricular papillomas, tumor of the pineal region and temporal lobes, cortical dysplasia, meningitis, encephalitis, and lipid storage diseases have also been reported in association with gelastic seizures.

40|$|Rhombencephalosynapsis: new {{findings}} {{in a larger}} study Rhombencephalosynapsis is a developmental midline defect affect-ing the cerebellar vermis. The absence of the vermis in rhomben-cephalosynapsis may {{be compared to the}} other condition in which the vermis is largely absent. In Joubert syndrome, the cerebellar hemispheres are close to normal in volume; the intervening vermis is small and much shortened, leaving a gap between the cerebellar hemispheres. Although the vermis may also be totally absent in rhombencephalosynapsis, remnants such as the nodule may often be found in their normal place with respect to the adjoining hemi-spheres. Allowing a simplification, one can describe the vermis in Joubert syndrome as shortened and in rhombencephalosynapsis as narrowed. The debut of the rhombencephalosynapsis story is credited to Obersteiner in 1916 with a detailed case report entitled ‘Ein Kleinhirn ohne Wurm ’ (‘A cerebellum without vermis’) describing the autopsy findings in a 31 -year old male. The original study is still worth reading for its wealth of detail such as absence of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and misrouting of tracts at the lower mesencephalic level. Over 100 cases have since been pub-lished, mostly as case reports or small series. A review lists 58 published cases before 2005 (Barth, 2008). Hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis is often present at birth. Other cerebral malformations typically affecting the midline may be found includ-ing aplasia of the septum pellucidum, fusion of the fornices and holoprosencephaly. Morphological studies reported by Pasquier et al. (2009) in 40 foetuses after medical termination of pregnancy showed fusion of colliculi, forking and/or atresia of the aqueduct, fusion of the thalami, callosal agenesis, <b>lobar</b> <b>holoprosencephaly</b> and neural tube defects as associated findings. Attention was drawn to the frequent occurrence of ‘Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiovascular anomalies, Trachea-oesophagEal fistula, Renal anomalies, Limb defects ’ (VACTERL) as associated findings. The cognitive outcome in patients with rhombencephalosynapsis may be normal; ataxia was the most frequent physical finding in a series of non-syndromic rhombencephalosynapsis (Poretti et al., 2009). Two syndromes may be seen in association with rhombence-phalosynapsis: Gómez–López-Hernández syndrome (MI...|$|E
