30|$|The column {{specimens}} {{were tested}} under both load and deformation controls: (1) compression <b>loading</b> <b>was</b> applied {{at an average}} rate of 1 kN/sec up {{to the level of}} 70 % of the expected peak load; (2) at this point, the <b>loading</b> rate <b>was</b> changed to 0.5  kN/s until the peak <b>load</b> <b>was</b> reached; (3) in the softening branch, <b>loading</b> <b>was</b> switched to deformation control with a rate of 0.2  mm/s; and (4) testing was terminated when the post-peak <b>load</b> <b>was</b> decreased to 75 % of the peak load.|$|R

5000|$|For aircraft, <b>loading</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} two major categories: limit loads and {{ultimate}} <b>loads.</b> Limit <b>loads</b> <b>are</b> the maximum <b>loads</b> a component or structure may carry safely. Ultimate <b>loads</b> <b>are</b> the limit <b>loads</b> times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust <b>loads</b> <b>are</b> determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash <b>loads</b> <b>are</b> loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground [...] Other <b>loads</b> that may <b>be</b> critical <b>are</b> pressure <b>loads</b> (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and ground loads. Loads on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic loading. These cyclic loads can cause metal fatigue.|$|R
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic <b>load</b> <b>is</b> normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the <b>load</b> <b>is</b> the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's <b>load</b> <b>is</b> constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} elastic-plastic finite element procedure to analyze crack-closure and, {{its effects on}} fatigue crack growth under general spectrum <b>loading,</b> <b>is</b> presented. A hybrid-displacement finite element procedure is used to properly treat the stress and strain singularities near the crack-tip; and crack-growth under cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>is</b> simulated by the translation of certain 'core' elements, near the crack-tip, in which proper stress and strain singularities were embedded. Both pure mode I and mode II types of cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>are</b> considered. In the mode I case, four types of cyclic loading, viz., constant amplitude block loading, high-to-low block loading, low-to-high block, and a single overload in an otherwise constant amplitude block <b>loading</b> <b>are</b> considered; whereas in mode II, only a constant amplitude block <b>loading</b> <b>is</b> considered. Detailed results are presented for the crack-closure and opening-stresses, crack-surface deformation profiles, etc., in each case.

5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid <b>load</b> <b>is</b> lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E

This study investigated associations of specific medication properties with neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms in a first-episode psychosis sample.

Results indicated higher anticholinergic <b>load</b> <b>was</b> associated with poorer verbal long-term memory and higher D 2 <b>load</b> <b>was</b> associated with poorer motor functioning.
