25|$|Michael Faraday, in {{his essay}} The Chemical History of a Candle (1860), {{suggested}} that the raisins in Snap-dragon act like miniature wicks. The concept {{is similar to that}} of burning brandy on top of Christmas puddings – the brandy is burning, but is not burning at a high enough temperature to consume the raisins. Nevertheless, children often burnt their <b>little</b> <b>hands</b> or mouths playing this game, which may have led to the practice mostly dying out in the early 20th century. In some families, this tradition continues to be practiced and enjoyed even into the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|Peggy {{has been}} spoofed in several programmes, {{including}} the ITV cartoon sketch show 2DTV, and Harry Hill's TV Burp. In the BBC's Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona performs as Peggy, shuffling around {{on her knees}} to exaggerate Barbara Windsor's petite height, and regularly using the catchphrase [...] "Get outta my pub!" [...] Impressionist Jan Ravens has spoofed her in the BBC's Dead Ringers, also mimicking her cheeky laugh. Commenting on Ancona's impersonation, Windsor has said: [...] "she does me brilliantly. I {{told her it was}} a great compliment. She made me realise my <b>little</b> <b>hands</b> wave around a lot." ...|$|E
60|$|Tom's {{sister was}} not much wiser on such a topic than he was. So she {{squeezed}} her little purse into his coat-pocket, and folding the <b>little</b> <b>hand</b> with which she did so on the other <b>little</b> <b>hand</b> with which she clasped his arm, said nothing.|$|R

500|$|Still, {{shades of}} Balzac's realism {{are found in}} the book, {{particularly}} in the first-hand descriptions of the Collège de Vendôme. The first part of the novel is replete with details about the school, describing how quarters were inspected and the complex social rules for exchanging dishes at dinnertime. Punishments are also described at length, including the assignment of tedious writing tasks and the painful application of the strap: Of all the physical torments to which we were exposed, certainly the most acute was that inflicted by this leathern instrument, about two fingers wide, applied to our poor <b>little</b> <b>hands</b> with all the strength and all the fury of the administrator. To endure this classical form of correction, the victim knelt {{in the middle of the}} room. He had to leave his form and go to kneel down near the master's desk under the curious and generally merciless eyes of his fellows.... Some boys cried out and shed bitter tears before or after the application of the strap; others accepted the infliction with stoic calm... but few could control an expression of anguish in anticipation. Further signs of Balzac's realism appear when Lambert describes his ability to vicariously experience events through thought alone. In one extended passage, he describes reading about the Battle of Austerlitz and seeing [...] "every incident". In another he imagines the physical pain of a knife cutting his skin. As Balzac's biographer André Maurois notes, these reflections provide insight into the author's perspective toward the world and its written representations.|$|E
2500|$|Coleman and {{her sisters}} [...] and Emilie created a visual video for hearing children's learn ASL, and started Two <b>Little</b> <b>Hands</b> Productions, their {{production}} company. A foundation, Signing Time! Foundation, also exists to teach ASL. [...] The foundation is dedicated to making sign language fun and accessible to all children, and to furthering Rachel's advocacy. Through the Signing Time foundation, Rachel is a keynote speaker at speaking engagements where she shares her message, journey, and experiences. To help children like Rachel's daughter who were diagnosed with hearing loss, the foundation offers an initiative where it delivers, free of charge, an online ASL curriculum called SignIt to those children's families.|$|E
2500|$|Sito {{mentioned}} that Joe Grant contributed heavily towards the film, {{as he was}} the creator of Redfeather, Meeko, and Flit. Redfeather was a wise-cracking turkey planning to be voiced by John Candy, and Percy, who was to be voiced by Richard E. Grant, was revised to become mute. Following the death of John Candy in March 1994, co-screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co-wrote for Pocahontas, and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime instead of talking. Joe Grant stated Redfeather [...] "had comic potential–he thought he was handsome, a lady's man. When we decided he couldn't talk, and, having no hands, he couldn't mime..." [...] Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair-braiding raccoon, in which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors [...] "loved the idea and {{got rid of the}} turkey character." [...] Likewise, according to Sito, Meeko was created because they were [...] "naturally enigmatic, because they have <b>little</b> <b>hands</b> and a little mask over their face like a thief." [...] Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird where [...] "I have hummingbirds all over my backyard, [...] I thought, 'That's a great animal to animate.'" [...] According to the directors, Governor Ratcliffe's pampered pet, Percy, was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went.|$|E
