5000|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> is {{a device}} that employs a {{scissors}} mechanism to raise or lower goods and/or persons. Typically <b>lift</b> <b>tables</b> are used to raise large, heavy loads through relatively small distances. Common applications include pallet handling, vehicle loading and work positioning. <b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> are a recommended way to help reduce incidents of musculoskeletal disorders [...] by correctly re-positioning work at a suitable height for operators. <b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> lend themselves to being easily adapted to a specific use. They can work in hostile environments, be manufactured in stainless steel and have equipment like conveyors, turn-tables, barriers and gates easily added to their deckplates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{in-plant}} {{transport of}} goods is increasingly becoming automated. All reasons that argue for automation result in a better cost effectiveness. An extended percentage of the load units are lightweight and small goods that often occur either as single parts or as several articles in multiple small load carriers. Modern logistics concepts demand an efficient transport and the delivery within the intended time. To reduce the covered distance a flexible adjustment of the load capacity to single or accumulated transport is beneficial so that the vehicle can carry the required amount of goods without being oversized. To fulfill these specifications the paper at hand presents the development and realization of {{a new type of}} Automated Guided Vehicle that is optimized for the transportation of small goods [1]. The construction is carried out as an omnidirectional drive-under tractor in compact dimensions. The main purpose of the vehicle is the automated towing of trailers. Additionally the transport of single small load carriers can be accomplished by using a <b>lifting</b> <b>table.</b> Therefore it is for the first possible time to use a towing and carrying vehicle with a variable load capacity. For the drive system Mecanum wheels are used to enable omnidirectional maneuverability. Index Terms—Automated Guided Vehicle, drive-under tractor, omnidirectional drive...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringDynamic lifting jobs {{result in}} a risk of low back {{disorders}} (LBDs) higher than any other industrial jobs. There are several ergonomics lifting assessment methods used to evaluate OLBD risk in the lifting jobs. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLV) lifting assessment method {{is one of the}} assessment tools used to assess the lifting jobs. The ACGIH TLV tool considers factors such as; the vertical height of the lift, horizontal location of the lift, lift frequency and duration, and the load weight. There is a void on ACGIH TLV, in which it does not apply on lifting jobs that involve torso asymmetry greater than 30 ?, and the professional judgment is required to suggest the right TLV in such cases. The objectives of this study are to a) determine the OLBD risk values for lifting jobs that involve torso asymmetry less than 30 ? (i. e. 0, 15, and 30 ?) and greater than 30 ? (i. e. 45, 60, 75, and 90 ?) and b) adjust the TLV's for lifting jobs with OLBD Risk probability greater than 30 % (i. e. moderate risk). Twenty male college students were included in this lifting experiment. The lifting zones in this study were according to the ACGIH TLV third <b>lifting</b> <b>table.</b> The lumbar motion monitor (LMM) device and the Ballet 2. 0 software that comes along with the LMM were utilized to collect and analyze the torso kinematics. The software provided OLBD Risk probability value for each lifting task. The results have shown that the greater the torso asymmetry angle, the higher the OLBD Risk value. Lifting jobs with torso asymmetry greater than 30 ? were in the moderate risk category in all lifting zones. Also, lifting jobs with torso asymmetry within 30 ? were in the moderate risk category only at mid-shin to knuckle zone in both horizontal distances. However, they were in the low risk category only in knuckle to shoulder zone in both horizontal distances. New TLV's were suggested for lifting jobs with a moderate risk of OLBD...|$|E
