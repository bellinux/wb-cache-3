25|$|Bowling a yorker {{requires}} {{pinpoint accuracy}} since bowling it slightly too <b>long</b> <b>will</b> {{result in a}} full toss or full pitched delivery that is easy for the batsman to play because the ball has not deviated by bouncing off the pitch.

25|$|Therefore, {{the best}} batting {{strategy}} for Team 1 {{ahead of a}} coming interruption {{is not always the}} same, but varies with the facts of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the opinions about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how <b>long</b> <b>will</b> they last – will Team 1's innings be re-started?).|$|E

However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, pasteurized milk can remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date.|$|E

25|$|So {{far there}} has been tacit {{approval}} between the central government and Pointe-Noire and the Department of Kouilou: Most of the mayors of the coastal city have since independence been most often nationals of this region. For example, Stéphane Tchitchéllé, Dr. Jacques Bouiti, Marcel Tchionvo, Jean-Pierre Thysthère Tchicaya, François-Luc Makosso, Roland Bouiti-Viaudo and the current director-Mayor Jean-François Kando (elected since 28th August 2017), are noted. The fact that the first Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso born Tchibota originates from Pointe-Noire, militates for this status quo. But how <b>long</b> <b>will</b> this agreement last, which the Vili consider their prerogative as descendants of this fief? Indeed, the economic lung of the Congo, as the gateway to and exiting the flow of goods, arouses increasingly heightened lust.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too <b>long</b> <b>will</b> do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

500|$|At her death, Barbauld was lauded in the Newcastle Magazine as [...] "unquestionably {{the first}} [...] of our female poets, {{and one of}} the most eloquent and {{powerful}} of our prose writers" [...] and the Imperial Magazine declared [...] "so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, or wherever the English language shall be known, so <b>long</b> <b>will</b> the name of this lady be respected." [...] She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson, no mean feat for a woman writer in the eighteenth century. By 1925 she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism within the academy in the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.|$|E
500|$|As the {{historian}} Michael Postan describes, the revolt became famous [...] "as a landmark in social development and [...] a typical instance of working-class revolt against oppression", and was {{widely used in}} 19th and 20th century socialist literature. William Morris built on Chaucer in his novel A Dream of John Ball, published in 1888, creating a narrator who was openly sympathetic to the peasant cause, albeit a 19th-century persona taken back to the 14th century by a dream. The story ends with a prophecy that socialist ideals {{will one day be}} successful. In turn, this representation of the revolt influenced Morris's utopian socialist News from Nowhere. Florence Converse used the revolt in her novel <b>Long</b> <b>Will</b> in 1903. Later 20th century socialists continued to draw parallels between the revolt and contemporary political struggles, including during the arguments over the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.|$|E

A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen (Rudolf Lettinger), who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal {{in possession of a}} knife (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olson, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame onto the real murderer.|$|E

500|$|Following its release, Mississippi Burning became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} over its fictionalization of events; it was heavily criticized by African-American activists {{who were involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the families of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner. Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., boycotted the film, stating, [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>will</b> we have to wait before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put their lives on the line for equality?" [...] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, [...] "It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember." [...] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, [...] "reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud" [...] and portrays African Americans as [...] "cowed, submissive and blank-faced".|$|E
500|$|While his {{explanation}} {{was found to}} be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two orioles he had seen building a nest outside his window. Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair [...] "plainly deliberated" [...] their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then [...] "tied a single knot at the extreme end" [...] of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time. Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that what he wrote was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. The Atlantic Monthly did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by Century Magazine. Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, [...] "After such an example as this, how <b>long</b> <b>will</b> it be before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?" ...|$|E
500|$|At this point, as in {{the other}} games, the ending varies. Delaying too <b>long</b> <b>will</b> result in Yeesha (who is in fact Sirrus) taking Achenar's {{crossbow}} and shooting first him, then the Stranger. The silver lever will release Yeesha (again, possessed by Sirrus), who drops a large stone on Achenar and the Stranger, and then shoots the Stranger dead. In the good ending, the Stranger pulls the amber lever, reversing the mind-transfer process. But because {{of the age of}} the Memory Chamber, it becomes unstable; Achenar tells the Stranger to return to Dream and set Yeesha's memories right, while he uses the Life Stone to stabilize the chamber by inserting it into the chamber's shrine, poisoning him with its contained toxic spores. In Dream, the Stranger finds a monstrous creature, representing Sirrus' Dream-form, anchored to Yeesha's essence and preventing her from returning to her body; with no spirit guide, Sirrus is forced to cling to Yeesha to avoid being lost forever. He maintains his anchors by jumbling up Yeesha's memories. The Stranger restores Yeesha's memories and frees her from Sirrus' grasp; Sirrus' Dream-form is destroyed by the shifting waves of Dream, killing him. The Stranger awakens to find Achenar, fatally poisoned, confirming that the transfer was successful; he dies shortly afterward. The Stranger then returns to Tomahna to meet with Atrus, who says that Catherine has taken Yeesha to Tay (the [...] "rebel Age" [...] used to evacuate Catherine's people in Riven), and remarks that while his sons are gone, his daughter is safe.|$|E
