40|$|Insects rely {{solely on}} innate immune {{reactions}} for protection against infect-ing microbes in their environment. In Drosophila, one major defense mechanism is {{the production of a}} battery <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs).</b> The expression <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> is primarily regulated at the level of transcription and constitutes both constitutive expression in a tissue-specific manner and inducible systemic expression in response to infection. The aim of my thesis has been to investigate the regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression at different levels. I have studied a novel cis-regulatory element, Region 1 (R 1) found in the proximal promoter of all Cecropin genes in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as in other species of Drosophila. We found that the R 1 element was important for the expression of CecropinA 1 (CecA 1) both in vitro and in vivo. A signaling-dependent R 1 -binding activity (RBA) was identified in nuclear extracts from Drosophila cells and flies. The molecular nature of the RBA, has despite considerable effort, not yet been identified. I also have studied the role of the JNK pathway in transcriptional regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> The role <b>of</b> the JNK pathway in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> has long been elusive, however, in this study we showed that the pathway is directly involved in the expression <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> cells mutant for JNK pathway components showed severely reduced <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Fur-thermore, over-expression of a JNK pathway-inhibitor also inhibited <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Lastly, I have studied transcription factors that have not previously been implicated in transcriptional regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> In a yeast screen, three members of the POU family of transcription factors were identified as regulators of CecA 1. Two of them, Drifter (Dfr) and POU do-main protein 1 (Pdm 1) were further characterized. We showed that Dfr was able to promote <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the absence of infection, suggest-ing it {{to play a role in}} constitutive expression <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> Indeed, down-regulation <b>of</b> Dfr expression using RNAi severely reduced the constitutive expression <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> in the male ejaculatory duct. We also identified an enhancer element important for Dfr-mediated expression of CecA 1. Pdm 1, on the other hand, was shown to be important for the systemic expression <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> In Pdm 1 mutant flies, several <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> are systemically expressed even in the absence of infection, suggesting that Pdm 1 works as a repressor of those genes. However, at least on <b>AMP</b> <b>gene,</b> AttacinA (AttA) requires Pdm 1 for its expression, suggesting that Pdm 1 works as an activator for this gene. Upon infection, Pdm 1 was rapidly degraded, but, regenerated shortly after infection. We propose that the degradation of Pdm 1 is important for the activation of the Pdm 1 -repressed genes and that regeneration sup-ports the expression of AttA...|$|R

40|$|In Drosophila, the humoral {{response}} characterised by {{the synthesis}} <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs)</b> in the fat body (the {{equivalent of the}} mammalian liver) and the cellular response mediated by haemocytes (blood cells) engaged in phagocytosis represent two major reactions that counter pathogens. Although considerable analysis has permitted the elucidation of mechanisms pertaining to the two responses individually, the mechanism of their coordination has been unclear.

LvLRRFIP 2 s were upregulated in hemocytes after challenged with lipopolysaccharide, poly I:C, CpG-ODN 2006, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV).

40|$|Mating and {{immunity}} are {{two major}} components of fitness and links between them have been demonstrated {{in a number of}} recent investigations. In Drosophila melanogaster, a seminal fluid protein, sex-peptide (SP), up-regulates a number <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptide (<b>AMP)</b> <b>genes</b> in females after mating but the resulting effect on pathogen resistance is unclear. In this study, we tested (1) whether SP-induced changes in gene expression affect the ability of females to kill injected non-pathogenic bacteria and (2) how the injection process per se affects the expression <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> relative to SP. The ability of virgin females and females mated to SP lacking or control males to clear bacteria was assayed using an established technique in which Escherichia coli are injected directly into the fly body and the rate of clearance of the injected bacteria is determined. We found no repeatable differences in clearance rates between virgin females and females mated to SP producing or SP lacking males. However, we found that the piercing of the integument, as occurs during injection, up-regulates <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression much more strongly than SP.

40|$|When strains {{harboring}} R {{factor and}} showing ampicillin (APC) resistance were inoculated on plates containing various concentrations of APC, mutants carrying {{various levels of}} APC resistance occurred at high frequencies.

The R-factor mutants carrying high and stable APC resistance were conjugally transferred at the same frequency as their parent R factors, and the level of their resistance to drugs other than APC was not distinct from that conferred by their parents. Such R-factor mutants could easily be obtained from wild-type R factors carrying low APC resistance. The hypersynthesis of penicillinase by such R-factor mutants was considered to be due to the replication <b>of</b> the <b>amp</b> <b>gene</b> on the R factor at hyper-rates and the integration of multiple copies <b>of</b> the <b>amp</b> <b>gene</b> (amp-hyper) in the R-factor genome...|$|R
30|$|Mating is {{considered}} as an indispensable physiological process in insects, and immunity {{is the basic}} aspect for individual survival. Thus, both immunity and mating are closely linked to fitness, and several studies reported the interactions between these two processes (Lawniczak et al. 2007). As previously reported, mating can have two different effect on immunity: either suppress or increase immunity. It was reported that there were tradeoffs between reproduction and immunity, {{and an increase in}} reproduction is generally coupled with a decrease in immunity (Fedorka et al. 2007). Mating leading to a reduction of immunity has been reported in Tenebrio molitor (Rolff and Siva-Jothy 2002), Atta colombica (Baer et al. 2006) and Matrona basilaris japonica (Siva-Jothy et al. 1998). However, some evidence suggested that immunity of insect might also increase after mating. For example, mating resulting in enhancement of immunity has been reported in Gryllus texensis (Shoemaker et al. 2006) and D. melanogaster (Domanitskaya et al. 2007; Peng et al. 2005). In this study, the results found that mating enhanced the immunity in B. dorsalis by up-regulation <b>of</b> the <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> such as BdPho, which might protect the host from immune challenge during mating. This up-regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> may result from transfer of sperm and male accessory protein such as sex-peptide to the female during mating (Lawniczak and Begun 2004; Peng et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|Insects {{have evolved}} an {{efficient}} {{innate immune system}} to combat microbes. Most of our knowledge of insect immunity comes from studies with dipteran and lepidopteran insects, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta and the silkworm Bombyx mori. One of the insect humoral responses is the induced production <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs).</b> In D. melanogaster, bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) and fungal beta- 1, 3 -glucan can induce AMP production by activating the Toll and the IMD (immune deficiency) pathway. Chapter 1 reviews the key features of insect innate immunity. Chapter 2 studies transcriptional upregulation <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> in M. sexta triggered by ultrapure LPS, LTA and PG.

30|$|AMPs are {{expressed}} constitutively or induced by microorganisms infection (Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007). Most insect <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> are mainly expressed in immune-related organs {{such as the}} fat body, midgut and haemolymph (Wang et al. 2006). Meanwhile, the induction <b>of</b> different insect <b>AMPs,</b> as well as induction in different tissues including fat body, reproductive tissues, midgut, and salivary gland in various insects have been reported (Liao et al. 2015; Tzou et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2013 b). Furthermore, it {{has been well documented}} that the expression profiles <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> in different tissues are related to the category <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> with variations across insect species. In B. mori, BmDefA was highly expressed in the hemocyte, silk gland and ovary, and lowly expressed in the fat body, Malpighian tubule and midgut (Wen et al. 2009). In contrast, BtDef was highly expressed in midgut and salivary, and expressed at a relatively lower level in the ovary and fat body in Bemisia tabaci (Wang et al. 2013 b). In the current study, BdPho was expressed at a significantly high level in fat body, and at a much lower level in midgut, Malpighian tubule, testis and ovary. These results suggest that BdPho undertake its roles mainly in the fat body of adults to protect B. dorsalis from pathogens infection.|$|R
40|$|Background: Bursicon is a {{heterodimer}} neuropeptide {{composed of}} two cystine knot proteins, bursicon a (burs a) and bursicon b (burs b), that elicits cuticle tanning (melanization and sclerotization) through the Drosophila leucine-rich repeats-containing G protein-coupled receptor 2 (DLGR 2). Recent studies show that both bursicon subunits also form homodimers. However, biological functions of the homodimers have remained unknown until now. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this report, we show in Drosophila melanogaster that both bursicon homodimers induced expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in neck-ligated adults following recombinant homodimer injection and in larvae fat body after incubation with recombinant homodimers. These <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> were also up-regulated in 24 h old unligated flies (when the endogenous bursicon level is low) after injection of recombinant homodimers. Up-regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> by the homodimers was accompanied by reduced bacterial populations in fly assay preparations. The induction <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> expression is via activation of the NF-kB transcription factor Relish in the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway.

Similarly, in vivo analyses in adult flies confirmed that JH is a hormonal immuno-suppressor. RNA silencing of either partner of the ecdysone receptor heterodimer (EcR or Usp) in S 2 cells prevented the 20 E-induced immune potentiation. In contrast, silencing methoprene-tolerant (Met), a candidate JH receptor, did not impair immuno-suppression by JH III and JHa, indicating that in this context MET is not a necessary JH receptor.

40|$|SummaryInsect immune {{defense is}} mainly based on humoral factors like {{antimicrobial}} peptides (AMPs) that kill the pathogens directly [1] or on cellular processes involving phagocytosis and encapsulation by hemocytes [2]. In Drosophila, the Toll pathway (activated by fungi and gram-positive bacteria) and the Imd pathway (activated by gram-negative bacteria) {{lead to the}} synthesis <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> [3]. But <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> are also regulated without pathogenic challenge, e. g., by aging, circadian rhythms, and mating [4 – 8]. Here, we show that <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> are differentially expressed in mated females. Metchnikowin (Mtk) expression is strongly stimulated in the first 6 hr after mating. Sex-peptide (SP), a male seminal peptide transferred during copulation, is the major agent eliciting transcription of Mtk and <b>of</b> other <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> Both pathways are needed for Mtk induction by SP. Furthermore, SP induces additional <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> via the Toll (Drosomycin) and the Imd (Diptericin) pathways. SP affects the Toll pathway at or upstream of the gene spätzle, the Imd pathway at or upstream of the gene imd. Mating may physically damage females and pathogens may be transferred [9]. Thus, endogenous stimulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> transcription by SP at mating might {{be considered as a}} preventive step to encounter putative immunogenic attacks...|$|R

In our study, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR to compare the microbial community and immunity genes expression in the foregut, midgut and hindgut of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Our results indicated that the community richness of the midgut is higher than in the foregut or the hindgut, although the bacterial diversity in the hindgut is higher. The predominant phyla were Tenericutes and Firmicutes in the foregut, Tenericutes and Proteobacteria in the midgut and Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes in the hindgut. When compared with the midgut, the expression <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs)</b> were significantly elevated in the hindgut (P[*]<[*] 0.05), and the gene expression of EsRelish (IMD pathway) was higher than the Toll signaling pathway genes. Actinobacteria and Lactobacillus had negative correlationship with the expression <b>of</b> <b>AMPs,</b> although Acinetobacter, Bacteroides, Flavobacterium can up-regulate the expression <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> Collectively, our data indicate that microbiota are site-specific within the digestive tracts of crabs and the bacterial community and intestinal immunity have a close relationship in E. sinensis.|$|R

[...] School of Biological Sciences. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City. 2014 The innate immune system, {{also known as}} natural or non-specific immune system, is conserved from insects to humans. The insect innate immune system is composed of humoral and cellular components. Insect humoral responses mainly include synthesis <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs)</b> and activation <b>of</b> the prophenoloxidase (PPO) system. Expression <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> is regulated by two signaling pathways, the Toll-Spätzle (Spz) and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways, in Drosophila melanogaster. My research has been focusing on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. In chapter 2, I showed direct interaction between M. sexta MsToll and MsSpz-C 108 by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and demonstrated that co-expression of MsToll and MsSpz-C 108 can activate <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> promoters in S 2 cells by dual luciferase assays. My results confirm a Toll-Spz pathway in an insect other than Drosophila. In chapter 3, a Toll-ML (MD 2 (myeloid differentiation protein 2) - related lipid-recognition) -LPS signaling pathway was identified in M. sexta. The Co-IP assay showed that MsToll, MsML- 1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could form a receptor complex. More importantly, I showed that co-expression of MsToll and MsML- 1 could up-regulate iv <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> activated by LPS. My results {{for the first time}} showed that a Toll-ML-LPS signaling pathway is conserved from insects to humans. In chapter 4, I identified Relish short isoforms and Dorsal in M. sexta. Dorsal and Relish belong to the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) /Rel family. I showed that M. sexta Dorsal and Rel 2 (Relish) isoforms could regulate <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> differently, and Dorsal and Rel 2 could form heterodimers, which negatively regulated <b>AMP</b> <b>genes.</b> This is a novel finding about NF-κB factors in regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Characterization <b>of</b> a new member (βGRP 3) of the β- 1, 3 -glucan recognition proteins in M. sexta was presented in chapter 5. I discovered novel functions of M. sexta βGRP 3 in the βGRP family proteins: (1) calcium-dependent agglutination of bacterial cells, and (2) antibacterial (bacteriostatic) activity. In Chapter 6, I characterized function of M. sexta gloverin. I showed that M. sexta gloverin can bind to different microbial cell wall components and has activity against different microorganisms. My results suggested that gloverin’s broad spectrum of activity may be related to its binding ability to microbial cell wall components. In Chapter 7, I summarized my discoveries in insect innate immune signaling pathways and proposed future research directions. My research has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} innate immunity in insects and vertebrates, regulation of gene expression by NF-κB factors, and evolution of the innate immune signaling pathways.

The important role of differential regulation <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> expression at the posttranscriptional level needs to be elucidated. It was observed that the highly expressed Cecropin A 1 (CecA 1) mRNA encoding a broad antimicrobial spectrum AMP against both bacteria and fungi decayed more quickly than did the moderately expressed Diptericin mRNA encoding AMP against Gram negative bacteria.

Infection of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by the natural fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora induces the expression in the epidermis <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptide (<b>AMP)</b> <b>genes</b> such as nlp- 29. Here, we tested the hypothesis that injury might also alter <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression and sought to characterize the mechanisms that regulate the innate immune response. ResultsInjury induces a wound-healing response in C. elegans that includes induction of nlp- 29 in the epidermis. We find that a conserved p 38 -MAP kinase cascade is required in the epidermis for the response to both infection and wounding. Through a forward genetic screen, we isolated mutants that failed to induce nlp- 29 expression after D. coniospora infection. We identify a kinase, NIPI- 3, related to human Tribbles homolog 1, that is likely to act upstream of the MAPKK SEK- 1. We find NIPI- 3 is required only for nlp- 29 induction after infection and not after wounding. ConclusionsOur results show that the C. elegans epidermis actively responds to wounding and infection via distinct pathways that converge on a conserved signaling cassette that controls the expression <b>of</b> the <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> nlp- 29.

The cell-mediated immunity includes phagocytosis, pinocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation of invading microbes (Schmidt et al. 2001). In contrast, the humoral response includes melanization and the secretion <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs).</b> <b>AMPs</b> are one <b>of</b> {{the most essential}} molecules of the humoral immune response and are synthesized mainly in insect fat body (Hoffmann 1995; Hultmark 1993). During the past decades, AMPs have {{been the focus of}} intense research on insect immunity and are now regarded as {{a vital part of the}} defense system in insects. Insect AMPs are not only involved in the defense against invading microorganisms in the haemolymph, but also regulate the bacterial community homeostasis in host gut (Buchon et al. 2013). It has been reported that the categories and expression levels <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> could affect bacterial resistance of host in Drosophila (Unckless et al. 2016) and gut symbiont which could in turn enhance insecticide resistance in Bactrocera dorsalis (Cheng et al. 2017). These interesting results broadened our knowledge in pest control and showed that insect AMPs could serve as target or gut-symbiont-killer to control pest indirectly.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In many animals, the {{epidermis}} is {{in permanent}} {{contact with the}} environment and represents a {{first line of defense}} against pathogens and injury. Infection of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by the natural fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora induces the expression in the epidermis <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptide (<b>AMP)</b> <b>genes</b> such as nlp- 29. Here, we tested the hypothesis that injury might also alter <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression and sought to characterize the mechanisms that regulate the innate immune response. RESULTS: Injury induces a wound-healing response in C. elegans that includes induction of nlp- 29 in the epidermis. We find that a conserved p 38 -MAP kinase cascade is required in the epidermis for the response to both infection and wounding. Through a forward genetic screen, we isolated mutants that failed to induce nlp- 29 expression after D. coniospora infection. We identify a kinase, NIPI- 3, related to human Tribbles homolog 1, that is likely to act upstream of the MAPKK SEK- 1. We find NIPI- 3 is required only for nlp- 29 induction after infection and not after wounding. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the C. elegans epidermis actively responds to wounding and infection via distinct pathways that converge on a conserved signaling cassette that controls the expression <b>of</b> the <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> nlp- 29. A comparison between these results and MAP kinase signaling in yeast gives insights into the possible origin and evolution of innate immunity...|$|R
40|$|Survival of {{bacterial}} infection {{is the result}} of complex host-pathogen interactions. An often-overlooked aspect of these interactions is the circadian state of the host. Previously, we demonstrated that Drosophila mutants lacking the circadian regulatory proteins Timeless (Tim) and Period (Per) are sensitive to infection by S. pneumoniae. Sensitivity to infection can be mediated either by changes in resistance (control of microbial load) or tolerance (endurance of the pathogenic effects of infection). Here we show that Tim regulates resistance against both S. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. We set out to characterize and identify the underlying mechanism of resistance that is circadian-regulated. Using S. pneumoniae, we found that resistance oscillates daily in adult wild-type flies and that these oscillations are absent in Tim mutants. Drosophila have at least three main resistance mechanisms to kill high levels of bacteria in their hemolymph: melanization, antimicrobial peptides, and phagocytosis. We found that melanization is not circadian-regulated. We further found that basal levels <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression exhibit time-of-day oscillations but that these are Tim-independent; moreover, infection-induced <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression is not circadian-regulated. We then show that phagocytosis is circadian-regulated. Wild-type flies exhibit up-regulated phagocytic activity at night; Tim mutants have normal phagocytic activity during the day but lack this nighttime peak. Tim appears to regulate an upstream event in phagocytosis, such as bacterial recognition or activation of phagocytic hemocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of phagocytosis in wild type flies results in survival kinetics similar to Ti...|$|R
40|$|The {{harlequin}} ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis {{has emerged}} as a model species in invasion biology because of its strong resistance against pathogens and remarkable capacity to outcompete native ladybirds. The invasive success of the species may reflect its well-adapted immune system, a hypothesis we tested by analysing the transcriptome and characterizing the immune gene repertoire of untreated beetles and those challenged with bacteria and fungi. We found that most H. axyridis immunity-related genes were similar in diversity to their counterparts in the reference beetle Tribolium castaneum, but there was an unprecedented expansion among genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs). We identified more than 50 putative AMPs belonging to seven different gene families, and many of the corresponding genes were shown by quantitative real-time RT–PCR to be induced in the immune-stimulated beetles. AMPs with the highest induction ratio in the challenged beetles were shown to demonstrate broad and potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and entomopathogenic fungi. The invasive success of H. axyridis can therefore be attributed at least in part to the greater efficiency of its immune system, particularly the expansion <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> families and their induction in response to pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{immune system}} is not completely developed when chickens hatch, so the innate immune system has evolved a range of mechanisms to deal with early pathogenic assault. Avian b-defensins (AvBDs) and cathelicidins (CTHLs) are two major sub-classes <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptides (<b>AMPs)</b> with {{a fundamental role in}} both innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate distinct expression patterns of innate immune genes including ? Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (TLR 2, TLR 15 and TLR 21, but not TLR 4), the complete repertoire of AvBDs, CTHLs and both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL 1 B, IL 8, IFNG and IL 10) during early chicken embryonic development. AvBD 9 was significantly increased by over 150 fold at day 9; and AvBD 10 was increased by over 100 fold at day 12 in the abdomen of the embryo, relative to day 3 expression levels (P < 0. 01). In contrast, AvBD 14 was preferentially expressed in the head of the embryo. This is the first study to demonstrate differential patterns <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the sterile environment of the developing embryo. Our results propose novel roles for AMPs during development and reveal the innate preparedness of developing embryos for pathogenic assault in ovo, or post-hatchin...|$|R
40|$|The {{fruit fly}} Drosophila melanogaster is {{recognised}} {{as the most}} widely established genetic model of immunity of the contemporary scientific era, exhibiting {{a high degree of}} conservation between Drosophila and mammalian innate immunity genes. However, whilst the majority of Drosophila immunity studies have previously been performed in adults and larvae, the embryo has recently emerged as a potentially viable model system; aiding in vivo studies and providing a more amendable system to undertake live imaging, hence evading many of the caveats associated with current immunity models. This project aimed to further develop the Drosophila embryo as a more potent and insightful immunity model, focusing on the immune response to bacterial infection. Initial results demonstrated that the Stage 15 Drosophila embryo was able to mount a relatively robust immune response to bacterial infection. This included induction <b>of</b> antimicrobial peptide (<b>AMP)</b> <b>genes</b> upon a range of bacterial stimuli; a response which was able to effectively discriminate between differential types of bacterial infection via the characterised Drosophila systemic immunity pathways. Live-imaging studies also showed that the cellular immune response was functional within the Stage 15 embryo. Subsequently, immune competence was shown to arise at approximately mid-embryogenesis, under the control of 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 -HE) signalling, as demonstrated by the partial rescue <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> expression and bacterial clearance in early stage embryos upon 20 -HE co-administration with infective agents. Further analysis of the global transcriptional response of the Drosophila embryo to infection and damage via microarray studies confirmed the immune potential of this system, but also permitted the identification of genes upregulated uniquely upon Gram-positive or Gram-negativ infection. Moreover, wounding via sterile laser ablation induced significant upregulation of a subset <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> an a network of cuticular genes, providing an insight into the embryonic damage response. Parallel analysis of the hemocyte transcriptional profile upon infection and damage elucidated that these immune cells {{may play a role in}} the regulation of the immune response via 20 -HE signalling and production of ROS, although this remains subject to further validation. As such, transcriptional profile analysis of the embryo has been successful in identifying candidate genes for further validation and study...|$|R
40|$|We test here {{whether a}} class of deletions likely to result from errors during DNA {{replication}} arise preferentially during synthesis of either the leading or the lagging DNA strand. Deletions were obtained by reversion of particular insertion mutant alleles of the pBR 322 <b>amp</b> <b>gene.</b> The alleles contain insertions of palindromic DNAs bracketed by 9 -bp direct repeats <b>of</b> <b>amp</b> sequence; in addition, bp 2 to 5 in one arm of the palindrome form a direct repeat with 4 bp <b>of</b> adjoining <b>amp</b> sequence. Prior work had shown that reversion to Amp(r) results from deletions with endpoints in the 9 - or 4 -bp repeats, and that the 4 -bp repeats are used preferentially because {{one of them is}} in the palindrome. To test the role of leading and lagging strand synthesis in deletion formation, we reversed the direction of replication <b>of</b> the <b>amp</b> <b>gene</b> by inverting the pBR 322 replication origin, and also constructed new mutant alleles with a 4 -bp repeat starting counterclockwise rather than clockwise of the insertion. In both cases the 4 -bp repeats were used preferentially as deletion endpoints. A model is presented in which deletions arise during elongation of the strand that copies the palindrome before the adjoining 4 -bp repeat, and in which preferential use of the 4 -bp repeats independent of the overall direction of replication implies that deletions arise during syntheses of both leading and lagging strands...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a {{group of}} small {{molecule}} non-encoding RNAs, are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that are implicated in many biological processes. In the current study, miR- 217 from Eriocheir sinensis was selected for studying its roles during host–virus interaction. Overexpression or silencing of miR- 217 led to considerable effects on white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) replication, implying that miR- 217 played a positive role in WSSV infection. In insect High Five cells, miR- 217 significantly inhibited Tube gene expression by binding to the 3 ′-untranslated region of the Tube. Overexpression of miR- 217 in crab led to downregulation of tube expression. Knockdown of Tube in vivo led to significant enhancement of WSSV infection and inhibited the expression of five antimicrobial peptide (<b>AMP)</b> <b>genes</b> (Anti-lipopolysaccharide factor ALF 1, ALF 2, ALF 3; Crustin Crus 1, Crus 2) in WSSV-challenged crabs. Overexpression of miR- 217 also led to downregulation <b>of</b> these <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> in WSSV-challenged crabs.

30|$|In {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play {{a crucial}} role in gut immunity (Destoumieux-Garzón et al. 2016; Zhang and Gallo 2016) and form effective defense mechanisms against multitudinous pathogens. Many studies on AMPs and invertebrate gut defense have been performed in insects, especially Drosophila melanogaster, because this species is the model organism of invertebrate (Broderick 2016; Loch et al. 2017; Rolff and Schmid-Hempel 2016). The key role <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> in gut immune response is demonstrated through oral reactive oxygen species (ROS) blockers to Drosophila mutants that are defective in the NF-κB pathway, resulting in increased mortality (Ryu et al. 2006). This mortality rate decreases when a single AMP is expressed in the intestines of these flies (Ryu et al. 2008). In addition, closely regulated AMPs in the gut of Drosophila seem to be indispensable for maintaining the homeostasis of the intestinal flora (Ryu et al. 2008). The production <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> was affected by the Toll and IMD pathways in Drosophila hemocytes, but mainly by the latter in gut (Garcia-Garcia et al. 2013). As the central components of Toll and IMD signaling pathways, e.g., EsTolls, EsDorsal, EsPelle, EsRelish (a novel NF-κB-like transcription factor), these genes have been proven to participate in the innate immunity of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura: Varunidae) and defense against several pathogens (Li et al. 2010; Ying et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2013 a, b). The above genes could function as an adapter protein in Toll and IMD signaling and regulate the production <b>of</b> crab <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> in hemocytes (Mu et al. 2011; Ying et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2010). Then there were <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> in hemocytes have various biological functions in E. sinensis (Destoumieux-Garzón et al. 2016). Hence, these AMPs can help the screening of therapeutic or preventive agents for healthy breeding of crabs. However, the function of these very important genes in the crab intestine is not clear. The study <b>of</b> <b>AMPs</b> in gut immunity of crustaceans is rare and it is unclear which signaling pathways regulate the production <b>of</b> <b>AMPs.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceScleractinian corals are {{the most}} basal eumetazoan taxon and provide the {{biological}} and physical framework for coral reefs, which {{are among the most}} diverse of all ecosystems. Over the past three decades and coincident with climate change, these phototrophic symbiotic organisms have been subject to increasingly frequent and severe diseases, which are now geographically widespread and a major threat to these ecosystems. Although coral immunity {{has been the subject of}} increasing study, the available information remains fragmentary, especially with respect to coral antimicrobial responses. In this study, we characterized damicornin from Pocillopora damicornis, the first scleractinian antimicrobial peptide (AMP) to be reported. We found that its precursor has a segmented organization comprising a signal peptide, an acidic proregion, and the C-terminal AMP. The 40 -residue AMP is cationic, C-terminally amidated, and characterized by the presence of six cysteine molecules joined by three intramolecular disulfide bridges. Its cysteine array is common to another AMP and toxins from cnidarians; this suggests a common ancestor, as has been proposed for AMPs and toxins from arthropods. Damicornin was active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria and the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Damicornin expression was studied using a combination of immunohistochemistry, reverse phase HPLC, and quantitative RT-PCR. Our data show that damicornin is constitutively transcribed in ectodermal granular cells, where it is stored, and further released in response to nonpathogenic immune challenge. Damicornin gene expression was repressed by the coral pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus. This is the first evidence <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> repression in a host-Vibrio interaction...|$|R
40|$|Innate {{immunity}} {{operates as}} a {{first line of defense}} in multicellular organisms against infections caused by different classes of microorganisms. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are synthesized constitutively in barrier epithelia to protect against microbial attack and are also upregulated in response to infection. Here, we implicate Drifter/Ventral veinless (Dfr/Vvl), a class III POU domain transcription factor, in tissue-specific regulation of the innate immune defense of Drosophila. We show that Dfr/Vvl is highly expressed in a range of immunocompetent tissues, including the male ejaculatory duct, where its presence overlaps with and drives the expression of cecropin, a potent broad-spectrum AMP. Dfr/Vvl overexpression activates transcription <b>of</b> several <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> in uninfected flies in a Toll pathway- and Imd pathway-independent manner. Dfr/Vvl activates a CecA 1 reporter gene both in vitro and in vivo by binding to an upstream enhancer specific for the male ejaculatory duct. Further, Dfr/Vvl and the homeodomain protein Caudal (Cad) activate transcription synergistically via this enhancer. We propose that the POU protein Dfr/Vvl acts together with other regulators in a combinatorial manner to control constitutive <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> expression in a gene-, tissue-, and sex-specific manner, thus promoting a first-line defense against infection in tissues that are readily exposed to pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila hemocytes {{have strong}} {{phagocytic}} capacities and produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). However, the precise role of blood cells during immune responses and developmental processes {{has only been}} studied using indirect means. To overcome this limitation, we generated plasmatocyte-depleted flies by specifically overexpressing the proapoptotic protein Hid into plasmatocytes. Unexpectedly, these plasmatocyte-depleted animals have a normal larval and pupal development and do not exhibit any obvious defect after birth. Remarkably, plasmatocyte-depleted adults show a strong susceptibility to infections by various microorganisms, although activation <b>of</b> systemic <b>AMP</b> <b>gene</b> transcription via the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways is wild-type. Our data show that this susceptibility, which correlates with overproliferation of bacteria, is likely due {{to the absence of}} phagocytosis. We also demonstrate that during larval stages, plasmatocytes play an essential role in mediating AMP production by the fat body after oral bacterial infection. Finally, we show that plasmatocytes are involved in immune surveillance during pupal development, because they prevent bacterial infection that causes pupal lethality...|$|R
40|$|Morris Agaba is ILRI authorAfrican animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is endemic across Sub-Saharan African {{and is a}} major {{constraint}} to livestock production. The {{ability of}} certain cattle breeds to remain productive despite infection is known as trypanotolerance; however, the underlying immune mechanisms contributing to this trait remain poorly understood. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and acute phase proteins (APPs) are evolutionarily conserved effector molecules of the innate immune system that have important roles in the resolution of infection and activation of the adaptive immune response. Expression levels <b>of</b> <b>AMP</b> <b>genes</b> (TAP, LAP, BNBD 4, DEFB 1, DEFB 5 and LEAP 2) and APP genes (HP, CP, AGP, LBP, SAA 3 and CRP) were investigated using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) isolated from two breeds of African cattle (trypanotolerant N’Dama and trypanosusceptible Boran), experimentally infected with Trypanosoma congolense. Haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) were also measured in plasma using quantitative protein assays. Results demonstrated that tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) gene expression increased by 32 -fold in Boran, compared to only 3 -fold in N’Dama, by 14 days post-infection (dpi) and rising to 136 -fold at 29 dpi in Boran, compared to 47 -fold in N’Dama (P < 0. 05). Protein expression levels of SAA are elevated in N’Dama, rising to 163 μg/ml at 14 dpi compared with 72 μg/ml in Boran. The SAA expression profile mirrors the wave of parasitaemia detected in N’Dama. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter regions of the SAA 3 and SAA 4 genes, which are predicted to affect transcription factor binding and thereby contributing to the differential patterns of expression detected between the breeds. Whereas elevated TAP expression is a conserved component of the innate immune response to infection in both breeds, higher SAA expression levels may contribute toward trypanotolerance in N’Dama...|$|R
