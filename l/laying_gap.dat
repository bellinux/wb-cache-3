40|$|We {{collected}} 328 freshly laid Great Tit (Parus major) {{eggs from}} 38 clutches in 1999 {{to determine the}} relationship of whole egg weight, wet yolk weight, wet albumen weight, dry shell weight, and the occurrence of laying gaps with mean ambient temperature in the three days preceding laying, while controlling for laying date and position in the laying sequence. We also reanalyzed existing data on whole egg weight in 1978 and 1979 in relation to temperature, controlling for the same other variables. Egg weight was correlated with temperature in 1978 and 1979, but not in 1999. None of the egg components was related to temperature preceding laying, apart from a nonsignificant tendency for albumen weights to be lower at higher temperature. Egg weight increased with laying date in 1978 and 1979 after controlling for other variables. In 1999, albumen and shell weight increased seasonally, but shell weight only did so to the extent expected {{on the basis of}} the seasonal increase in whole egg weight. Yolk weight did not increase significantly seasonally, but neither did yolk weight relative to whole egg weight decrease significantly. Whole egg weight and the weights of all components varied between clutches. Most weights also varied through the laying sequence. The probability of a <b>laying</b> <b>gap</b> occurring varied between clutches, and increased with position in the laying sequence and decreased with temperature and laying date. Eggs preceding laying gaps were lighter and contained less albumen but had higher shell weights than other eggs. Eggs following laying gaps also had heavier shells relative to the size of the egg than other eggs. ...|$|E

40|$|Primary {{sex ratio}} {{adjustment}} in birds {{has been extensively}} studied, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms are far from understood. Avian females are the heterogametic sex (ZW), and the future sex of the offspring is determined at chromosome segregation during meiosis I, shortly before the oocyte is ovulated. Assuming that the mother can detect {{the sex of the}} developing oocyte before ovulation, {{it has been suggested that}} a follicle of the un-preferred sex could selectively be induced to become atretic and regress instead of being ovulated (selective follicle abortion). This potential mechanism has been proposed to underlie biased primary sex ratios in birds, including the homing pigeon (Columba livia domestica), which produces a modal clutch size of two eggs. However, without replacement by an additional, already mature follicle, abortion of a preovulatory follicle would most likely result in either reduced clutch sizes or <b>laying</b> <b>gaps,</b> since a not-yet-recruited follicle still needed to undergo the whole maturation phase. In the current study we killed female pigeons, which were adjusting embryo sex of first eggs according to change in body mass. We examined ovaries for signs of follicle abortion but did not find any supporting evidence. All females produced one or two mature follicles but only two out of the 56 experimental birds produced an additional third mature follicle. Therefore, our results do not corroborate the hypothesis that pigeon mothers manipulate primary offspring sex by selectively aborting follicles of the un-preferred sex. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{seasonally}} reproducing organisms, timing reproduction {{to match}} food availability {{is key to}} individual fitness. Ambient temperature functions as an important cue for {{the timing of the}} food peak in temperate-zone birds. After laying start, individual birds may still improve synchrony between offspring hatching and food availability by adjusting the onset of incubation to most up-to-date cues about the development of the food source. However, it is unknown whether individuals respond to changes in temperature after the onset of laying, and whether individuals adjust incubation onset independent of clutch size. Here, I show in free-living blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) that experimental heating of nestboxes in the laying phase resulted in increased duration of nocturnal incubation bouts prior to clutch completion, leading to earlier hatching of eggs and increased hatching asynchrony. Experimental heating did not affect the number of <b>laying</b> <b>gaps,</b> egg volume and clutch size, nor were any carry-over effects on offspring detected. These results are best explained as a response to increased temperature acting as a cue for an advanced food-peak, rather than a relief of energetic constraints, because improved energetic conditions would not favour more hatching asynchrony. Other benefits cannot be excluded, since increased laying-phase incubation under warmer conditions may also help maintain egg viability. This study is the first to show that temperature has a causal effect on the time between clutch completion and hatching of the first offspring, indicating that behavioural adjustment to climate change can continue after laying start...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSmall hive beetles, Aethina tumida, are {{honeybee}} parasites {{native to}} Africa, {{where they are}} a minor pest only. In contrast, the beetles can be harmful parasites of European honeybee subspecies. Resistance of African subspecies to infestations is probably due to quantitative differences {{in a series of}} behaviours such as absconding, aggression, removal of parasite eggs and larvae and social encapsulation. The beetles use counter-resistance tactics such as defence posture, dropping, hiding, escape, egg <b>laying</b> in small <b>gaps</b> and trophallactic mimicry. Small hive beetles are efficient in long-range transportation (US: 1996, Australia: 2002) and can establish populations in temperate regions due to their overwintering capacity in honeybee clusters. Host shifts to other bee species may also occur. Thus, small hive beetles have the potential to become a global threat to apiculture and wild bee populations. However, our knowledge of the small hive beetle is still limited, creating demand for more research in all areas of its biology...|$|R

(Alternatively, how much degradation, by deletion of pixels, can such an image suffer and still be recovered?) Such questions are prompted by a number of applications in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The quantum {{geometric}} {{potential is}} a gauge invariant carrying novel geometric features between any two energy levels or bands in quantum systems. In generic time-dependent systems {{it gives a}} vital physical modification for the instantaneous energy <b>gaps,</b> <b>laying</b> down more appropriate quantum adiabatic conditions for both non-degenerate and degenerate systems. Remarkably, for generic parameterized quantum systems, {{the integration of the}} quantum geometric potential on a closed loop leads to a novel type of quantized winding number, which is a quantum counterpart of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The effects of the quantum geometric potential had been indirectly supported by the experiments on the quantum adiabatic evolution, however, a direct experimental observation so far is lacking. In this paper we propose an interference measurement to directly probe the quantum geometric potential, where the relevant parameters are easily accessible by current experimental apparatus. A direct confirmation of this new physical quantity could motive further theoretical and experimental investigations as well as its potential real applications. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} research aims at investigating the diferences and similarities between {{two sets of}} war narratives: Homer´s "Iliad" and novels of the Great of 1914 - 18. Dwelling on Hayden White´s methahistory theory and refraining from discussing the fictional or factional or factual nature of the texts to be analyzed, this thesis is focused on two aspects of the narratives. The main difference regards {{the role of the}} individual warfare. Whereas in the "Iliad", we are provided with the powerful, necessarily named warriors, in the Great War novels, "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", and "Company K", we encounter powerless, nameless soldiers who are overwhelmed by the murderous technology of total war. The hero gives way to the figure of the "Unknown Soldier" in war narrative. The principal feature these narratives share is war´s inherent unpredictability. Both the "Iliad" and the Great War novels represent war as an event whose outcome never comes as previously expected and whose means are disproportionate to its presumed ends, <b>laying</b> bare a <b>gap</b> between what men idealize of war and what men actually encounter...|$|R
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them <b>lay</b> the <b>gap</b> itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|R

People with stroke and their carers were involved in the examination of stroke understandings, its causation and mechanism, the impact of stroke on their lives, and actions taken to remediate the symptoms.

40|$|The aims in this Straussian {{grounded}} theory inquiry were to gain {{better understanding of}} the meaning of spirituality and of the process of spiritual development in people living with HIV/AIDS in the Thai context. In Western contexts, spirituality has been described as the essence of human existence. However, in the Thai context, where Buddhist teachings underpin the understanding of life as body and mind, rather than as body, mind and spirit, the concept of spirituality is little understood by <b>lay</b> people. This <b>gap</b> in understanding called for an inductive approach to knowledge generation. HIV/AIDS is a life-altering and deeply stigmatized disease that results in significant distress and calls into question the meaning and purpose of life for many who are diagnosed with the disease. Nevertheless, some Thai people living with the disease successfully adjust their lives to their situation and are able to live with peace and harmony. These findings raise questions firstly as to the process by which those participants achieved peace and harmony despite the nature of the disease and the limited access to ARV drugs at the time of that study; and secondly {{as to whether or not}} the peace and harmony that they described could be linked to the Western concept of spirituality. Data were gathered from 33 participants from the South of Thailand, who had lived with HIV/AIDS for 5 years or more, were aged 18 years or older, and were willing and able to participate in this study. Purposive, snowball and theoretical sampling techniques were used to select participants. Data collection using in-depth interviews and participant observation methods was undertaken over a nine-month period in 2006. The process of data analysis was guided by Strauss and Corbin’s {{grounded theory}} and resulted in the development of a substantive theory. The substantive theory of Achieving Harmony of Mind comprises two categories: struggling to survive and living life. Each category has two subcategories: encountering distress (tukjai) and overcoming distress (longjai), and accomplishing harmony in oneself and discovering an ultimate meaning in life respectively. The metaphor of ‘an eclipse’ was used to describe the process of the development of mind of people living with HIV/AIDS and represents the extent to which the individual’s mind is overshadowed by the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and its consequences. Diagnosis of this disease turns participants’ lives upside down. Yet selective disclosure of one’s HIV status, resulting in the receiving of support and connectedness with others, enables participants to find meaning and purpose in life that enables them to recover the will to live and to attempt to stabilise their lives by learning to live with HIV/AIDS. Most participants were able to adjust their mind to accept their new situation and find new self value enabling them to feel free from the shadow of HIV/AIDS and live life with HIV/AIDS as normal. Fewer participants found an ultimate meaning in life – consistent with Buddhist teachings about suffering and uncertainty, and the impermanence of life that links with an understanding of ‘nonself’ – that enabled them to obtain peace and harmony of mind (kwarmsa-ngobjai). It is this latter stage that represents spirituality in Buddhist terms. This form of spirituality differs significantly from that found in other religions because it does not involve an engagement with a divine and transcendent reality. The findings of this study enhance knowledge about spirituality in the Thai context, and provide a guide for health professionals and education curricula with the aim of achieving more holistic care for patients...|$|R
