The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. <b>Light</b> <b>scattering</b> by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea.

5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of <b>light</b> <b>scattering</b> from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E

40|$|As a {{basis for}} other {{experiments}} using flow cytometry of porcine peripheral blood leukocytes, cell fractions were isolated by various methods and analyzed by forward angle <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> and 90 degree <b>light</b> <b>scatter.</b> Cytospin smears of cell samples were also studied by leukocyte differential counts and nonspecific esterase staining. Three main populations of peripheral blood leukocytes [lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes (primarily neutrophils) ], were defined in the log 90 degree <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> by forward angle <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> histogram. Partial overlap was observed between lymphocyte and monocyte, and between monocyte and granulocyte domains. Correlation between leukocyte differential counts and flow cytometric quantification based on bitmap statistics of appropriate domains was between r = 0. 872 - 0. 892 for lymphocyte and granulocyte. Percoll density gradients were used for subfractionation of leukocyte populations, especially for the enrichment of granulocytes. The specific densities were calculated for lymphocytes (1. 0585 - 1. 0819 g/cc), monocytes (1. 0585 - 1. 0702 g/cc), granulocyte (1. 0819 - 1. 0936 g/cc), and erythrocytes (greater than 1. 0952 g/cc).

The intensity and polarization of <b>light</b> <b>scattered</b> by clover and grass in vivo and soil were measured at a number of different angles of incidence and reflectance. Both individual leaves and natural patches of leaves were measured. The light transmitted through the leaves was found to be negatively polarized. The <b>light</b> <b>scattered</b> from the upper leaf surface was found to be positively polarized in a manner which could be accounted for qualitatively but not quantitatively by the Fresnel reflection coefficients modified by a shadowing function of the form cos sup 2 (g/ 2), where g is the phase angle.

40|$|AbstractFlow cytometry {{is a key}} {{instrument}} in biological studies, used to identify and analyze cells in suspension. The identification of cells from debris is commonly based on <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> properties {{as it has been}} shown that there is a relationship between forward <b>scattered</b> <b>light</b> and cell volume and this has become common practice in flow cytometry. Cryobiological conditions induce changes in cells that alter their <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> properties. Cells with membrane damage from freeze–thaw stress produce lower forward scatter signals and may fall below standard forward scatter thresholds. In contrast to <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> properties that cannot identify damaged cells from debris, fluorescent dyes used in membrane integrity and mitochondrial polarization assays are capable of labeling and discriminating all cells in suspension. Under cryobiological conditions, isolating cell populations is more effectively accomplished by gating on fluorescence rather than <b>light</b> <b>scatter</b> properties. This study shows the limitations of using forward scatter thresholds in flow cytometry to identify and gate cells after exposure to a freeze–thaw protocol and demonstrates the use of fluorescence as an alternative means of identifying and analyzing cells...|$|R

The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (e.g.Creaming and Sedimentation) and global changes in size (e.g. flocculation, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E
