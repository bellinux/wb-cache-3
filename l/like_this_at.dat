500|$|In February 1989, Turner Entertainment {{president}} Roger Mayer {{announced that}} work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that [...] "could be read to prohibit colorization without {{permission of the}} Welles estate." [...] Mayer added that Welles's contract was [...] "quite unusual" [...] and [...] "other contracts we have checked out are not <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>at</b> all." [...] Turner had only colorized the final reel of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage {{was included in the}} BBC Arena documentary The Complete Citizen Kane.|$|E
500|$|Biance Gracie from Idolator gave a {{positive}} review to the performance, saying that [...] "Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch {{things up a}} bit—and we're so glad [...] did! Madge did a wild and super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance {{as one of the}} top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that [...] "the fact that she can dance <b>like...</b> <b>this</b> <b>at</b> 56 is practically a superhuman feat, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the performance." [...] Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as [...] "one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life." ...|$|E

We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

500|$|Manga critic Jason Thompson {{declared}} Toriyama's art influential, {{saying that}} his [...] "extremely personal and recognizable style" [...] was a reason for Dragon Balls popularity. He {{points out that the}} popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures. Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>at</b> the time and that Dragon Ball is [...] "an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist." [...] However, James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually [...] "lose the rounded, innocent look that [...] established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity." ...|$|E
