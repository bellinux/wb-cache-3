Without conceding that culture never determines behavior, I argue that opponents of the inability thesis err in drawing a moral implication from this premise.

Numerous procedural variations <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> have been developed for clinical use. Results of research conducted over the past four decades have shown that punishment is effective in reducing problem behavior in clinical populations, and in some cases, may be an essential component of treatment (see Kazdin, 2001, and O’Brien, 1989, for reviews of this literature). However, more knowledge is needed about factors that may influence the effects <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> on problem behavior.

40|$|This {{study is}} about the key {{stakeholders}} 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> and their effect on classroom culture intended to answer among other questions, the notion and rationale for using or not using punishment in the class. It was further proposed to look into how teachers can confer with other stakeholders of the school, including students, through their perceptions about punishment to understand the effects <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> and explore the possible alternatives to it. The {{study was conducted in}} a community owned school in Karachi, where six students of class eight and their four teachers were involved as participants. In addition to these, one principal and three vice principals of the three sections of the school were also taken as participants. To shuffle the cards well, six parents and one board member of the school were also interviewed. The study revealed that, in the technical sense <b>of</b> what <b>punishment</b> would mean, it is not fair to deny completely the use <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> in schools as a technique to adjust students 2 ̆ 7 misbehavior. The terms misbehavior 2 ̆ 7, discipline 2 ̆ 7 and punishment 2 ̆ 7 have been a common language in schools and that they can be explained together as if one influences the other. Some stakeholders looked into punishment as those actions involving physical situations only and they were not able to assess precisely psychological punishment. Nevertheless their perceptions indicated that there are some vivid examples showing that teachers can organize classes without tension <b>of</b> <b>punishment,</b> and though punishment may work, it should not be suggested to be used. In addition, although most teachers from the sample admitted how they remained skeptical about the use <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> in the classroom, yet they could not do without it as <b>punishment</b> remained part <b>of</b> the hidden curriculum. At some point, some stakeholders suggested the word punishment 2 ̆ 7 to be replaced, although meaning continuing practice. Some administrators also expressed their concern about the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> in schools. However, they accepted the continuance of some practices, and felt that particular modes <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> might help in behavior management. Students on the other hand expressed their feelings that, as social beings who also wanted to belong, they needed encouragement, cooperation and firm control in a democratic alliance of parents, teachers and themselves. Students demanded for more democratic classrooms. Students should be able to face the reality of life from their time in school, as they will also be liable to go wrong in the wider community and punished. Hence, punishment starts at home through school and continues in the wider community. The effects <b>of</b> <b>punishments</b> cover social, academic and moral, aspects of life where, when a student tends to avoid one kind <b>of</b> <b>punishment,</b> one <b>of</b> these aspects is affected.

Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that thought control strategies aimed at controlling unwanted thoughts may be used to cope with negative thoughts in both clinical and nonclinical samples. This study tested the relationship between thought control strategies and cancer among spouses of breast, lung and colorectal cancers. Materials and Methods: As part of an outcome study on a cognitive-behavioral treatment on spouses of cancer patients, 73 men were administered the Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ), a self-report measure designed to assess individual differences in the use of different thought control strategies. Results: the data analysis indicate means for three groups of spouses who had experienced mental disorders, those who were diagnosed with Anxiety symptoms, those who were depressed and spouses who suffered from mixed anxiety depression disorder (MAD). Spouses with Anxiety symptoms reported the following means: distraction, 13. 32; social control, 17. 45; worry, 17. 52; punishment, 11. 98; and re-appraisal, 11. 49. Spouses with depression reported the following means: distraction, 15. 36; social control, 10. 57; worry, 9. 94; punishment, 16. 92; and re-appraisal, 15. 89. Spouses who suffer from MAD reported the following means: distraction, 16. 86; social control, 17. 83; worry, 17. 69; punishment, 15. 81; and re-appraisal, 14. 88. Conclusion: In the present study we examined the frequency of thought control strategies for spouses of cancer patients with anxiety, depression and MAD.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{research}} the concept and institution <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> in three cultures and systems of classical Athens, Islam and International Criminal Justice. The second overall objective of this thesis is to establish how the insights from these three traditions can enrich {{our understanding of the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> and also designing humane, just and effective methods <b>of</b> <b>punishment.</b> I will argue that our response to wrongdoing can be divided into three distinct categories: punitive measures, impunity, and forgiveness. This thesis will contend that western-oriented concept and methods <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> have paid inadequate attention to the third category, forgiveness.
