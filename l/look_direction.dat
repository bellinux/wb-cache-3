50|$|Differential fringes {{which remain}} as fringes in the {{differential}} interferogram {{are a result}} of SAR range changes of any displaced point on the ground from one interferogram to the next. In the differential interferogram, each fringe is directly proportional to the SAR wavelength, which is about 5.6 cm for ERS and RADARSAT single phase cycle. Surface displacement away from the satellite <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> causes an increase in path (translating to phase) difference. Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength. This means in differential interferometry one fringe cycle − to + or one wavelength corresponds to a displacement relative to SAR antenna of only half wavelength (2.8 cm). There are various publications on measuring subsidence movement, slope stability analysis, landslide, glacier movement, etc. tooling D-InSAR. Further advancement to this technique whereby differential interferometry from satellite SAR ascending pass and descending pass can be used to estimate 3-D ground movement. Research in this area has shown accurate measurements of 3-D ground movement with accuracies comparable to GPS based measurements can be achieved.|$|E

30|$|However, the {{previous}} SVE-based robust beamforming methods are unsuitable for subarray robust monopulse beamforming {{for the following}} reason. In the monopulse beamforming, the pattern <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> must be exactly known. The difference beams are formed using the <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> to guarantee the linearity of the monopulse ratios near the pattern <b>look</b> <b>direction.</b> When {{the previous}} SVE-based methods are applied to monopulse beamforming, the pattern <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> is changed. The actual <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> needs to be calculated utilizing the estimated steering vector. However, the <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> is much difficult to be calculated from the subarray steering vector. In a subarray antenna with irregular subarray geometries, the exact position of the phase center of each subarray is needed when calculating the direction. It is known that, for an irregular subarray, the phase center is changed according to {{the direction of the}} incoming signal and is difficult to locate.|$|E
30|$|For {{conventional}} LCMV-based monopulse algorithm [6], {{the response}} in the pattern <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> is constrained, and the output power of the beamformer is minimized. If there are no <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> errors, the beamformer can provide the optimal SNR. When <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> error exists, the constraint mismatches the SOI direction, and the main lobe of the beam pattern may be distorted. The distortion obviously deteriorates angle estimation accuracy. In {{the rest of this}} paper, we use coventional LCMV algorithm to represent the conventional LCMV-based monopulse algorithm presented in [6].|$|E
30|$|Therefore, we can {{conclude}} that the robust beamforming methods which adjust the pattern <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> are not suitable for robust monopulse beamforming on subarray antenna. The main lobe constraint-based robust adaptive beamforming methods imposing multi-directional constraints [22, 23] and derivative constraints [24] will not change the <b>look</b> <b>direction.</b> However, {{the high cost of}} degrees of freedom (DOFs) makes them limited in the application to subarray monopulse beamforming.|$|E
50|$|The SAR {{images are}} {{white and black}} images, which shows the surface {{features}} using the intensity of radar return (echo), either due to surface roughness or orientation.If the surface is rougher, the radar will be scattered away {{and the intensity of}} echo will be weaker, which are represented by brighter regions in normal SAR images. On the other hand, if the surface is smoother, the wave will be reflected along the same direction, resulted as a higher intensity of echo and represented by darker regions. The orientation of surface is depends on the <b>looking</b> <b>direction</b> of the radar. Unlike satellite images of Earth surface, SAR images tells no clues on the color of surface, but the reflection of wave on the surface at a particular <b>looking</b> <b>direction</b> (direction of wave propagation). For example, when there is a light source shining on the blue cap on the left (left-looking), there will be shadows on the another side of the cap where light wave are blocked by the cap and no reflection occurs. If the <b>looking</b> <b>direction</b> is changed to the right, the shadowing (dark on SAR image) part will be at the opposite side. The USGS Branch of Astrogeology has produced a full resolution radar maps (also known as FMAPs) of Venus from the SAR data collected from the Mission, called the Magellan F-BIDRs (Full resolution Basic Image Data Records). The maps has a coverage of around 92% (combination of the 2 left-looking cycles). The resolution of it is 75 m/pixel, which is the highest resolution of Venusian map.|$|R

A linearly constrained subarray robust adaptive monopulse algorithm based on main lobe maintenance constraint and subspace tracking is developed in this paper.

40|$|Abstract-Conventional {{adaptive}} beamformers utilizing {{some form}} of automatic minimization of mean square error exhibit signal can-cellation phenomena when adapting rapidly. These effects result from adaptive interaction between signal and interference, when signal and interference are received simultaneously. Similar phenomena have been observed and analyzed in relatively simple adaptive noise can-celling systems. A study of these phenomena in the simpler systems is used to provide insight into similar behavior in adaptive antennas. A method for alleviating signal cancellation has been devised by Duvall, whereby the signal components are removed from the adaptive process, then reinserted to form the final system output. Widrow has devised a different solution to the problem: to move the receiving array spatially (or electronically) to modnlate emanations received off the <b>look</b> <b>direction,</b> without distorting useful signals incident from the <b>look</b> <b>direction.</b> This approach is called “spatial dither ” and in-troduces the additional possibility of modulating “smart ” jammer signals, thereby limiting their effectiveness.

Although and possibly microdunes (in repetitive imaging by Magellan did show {{changes in the}} appearance of the surface, these changes are attributed to radar artifacts as a consequence of <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> rather than to physical changes of the surface. Nonetheless, measurements of wind speeds near the surface of Venus and wind tunnel simulations suggest that aeolian processes could be currently active on Venus. Study of radar images of terrestrial analogs shows that radar wavelength, polarization, and viewing geometry, including <b>look</b> <b>direction</b> and incidence angle, all influence the detection of dunes, yardangs, and wind streaks. For best detection, dune crests and yardangs should be oriented perpendicular to <b>look</b> <b>direction.</b> Longer wavelength systems can penetrate sand sheets a meter or more thick, rendering them invisible, especially in arid regions. For wind streaks to be visible, there must be a contrast in surface properties between the streak and the background on which it occurs. Nonetheless, more than 6000 aeolian features have been found on Magellan images of Venus, the most common of which are various wind streaks. Mapping wind streak orientations enables near-surface wind patterns to be inferred for the time of their formation. Type P streaks are associated with parabolic ejecta crater deposits and are considered to have formed in association with the impact event. Most Type P streaks are oriented westward, indicative of the upper altitude superrotation winds of Venus. Non Type P streaks have occurrences and orientations consistent with Hadley circulation.
