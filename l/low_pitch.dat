5|$|Strasburg {{has a high}} strikeout rate of 11.2 per 9 innings {{through his}} first 251⅓ MLB innings. This {{corresponds}} with high swing-and-miss rates across all of his pitches, including 54% on his changeup—the highest whiff rate among all starting pitchers' changeups since PITCHf/x began tracking pitches. Through the 2012 season, Strasburg's career strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.67 would rank second all-time if he had enough innings to qualify. Strasburg maintains that his high strikeout rate is not intentional, and in fact is a hindrance to maintaining <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> counts.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

25|$|Ponting was {{announced}} as long-term vice-captain {{in place of}} Adam Gilchrist for Australia's away series in the Caribbean starting in April 2003. The first Test {{was not the first}} time Ponting had been vice-captain of the Australian Test team however, as he was thrust into the role against the West Indies in 2000 and England in 2001—because of injuries to Steve Waugh. Although Gilchrist had not done anything untoward, Ponting was elevated because Australian selectors wanted him to captain if Waugh was to be injured. This was Ponting's third tour to the Caribbean, and he was rested from the only warm-up match ahead of the Tests. Nevertheless, he continued his World Cup form in the First Test, scoring 117 and 42 not out on a slow and <b>low</b> <b>pitch,</b> as Australia won by nine wickets. Ponting scored his first double century (206) in the Second Test, as he and Darren Lehmann shared an Australian third-wicket partnership record of 315 against a weak bowling attack. Australia defeated the West Indies by 118 runs on the final day—retaining the Frank Worrell Trophy. The Tasmanian's rich vein of form continued in the Third Test, after being rested for a tour match against Barbados. He scored 113 before running himself out, as Australia batted first on a pitch at the Kensington Oval described as the slowest Waugh had played on. Waugh's men proceeded to take a 3–0 series, with a comfortable nine-wicket victory. Ponting missed the final Test, as Australia conceded the Test record run chase of 418; nevertheless, Ponting was still awarded the man-of-the-series award, after ending the series with 523 runs at 130.75.|$|E

500|$|In September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, {{received}} US patent 3150739 {{which was}} the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omni-directionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems. Able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 cycles per second (15Hz), a specific objective of Dones’ invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an audible indication of the direction from which they emanate. Dones' loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name [...] "The Octavium" [...] from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the Grateful Dead, bassist Monk Montgomery, bassist Nathan East, and the Pointer Sisters. The Octavium speaker and Dones' subwoofer technology was also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie Earthquake.

500|$|Upon its foundation, whenaccording to Green (1990)it {{was said}} to be a [...] "temporary expedient", the school was based at Stafford House, in East Street in the centre of Tonbridge. Previously used by private tutor Isaac Fleming in 1878, it was a {{building}} whose central urban position was, Taylor (1988) said, a [...] "major asset, and possibly the only one"; Headmaster Bryant [...] "bore its numerous shortcomings, its bricked ambience and grasslessness". Positioned in a narrow street and originally designed for 20 boarders, traffic noise, awkward arrangement and <b>low</b> <b>pitch</b> of the classrooms and the distance of the school from its playing fields made the building far from ideal. It underwent repairs and alterations to the value of £300, carried out by a local builder; several partition walls were knocked down to form larger rooms, although this still restricted the bench length in even the widest of the rooms to , and 18 pupils. The floor of the main schoolroom was restored and lavatory closets and urinals were installed. Later, a carpentry shed was placed in the yard, and a [...] "Mr Russell" [...] was appointed as its first occupant in October 1889. [...] "Mr Beeching's field" [...] was usedat what Taylor (1988) considered [...] "an extortionate sum"for games, but it was unavailable for four months of the year when it was used to grow hay. Beeching ended this arrangement in April 1889, at which time the school used the [...] YMCA field, for £20 per year. In June of that year, a shed to house cricket equipment was constructed at the cost of £13/10s. It was soon decided that there was a need for more [...] "wholesome" [...] surroundings, and it was generally accepted that south Tonbridge would be more suitable {{for the development of a}} new school.|$|E
