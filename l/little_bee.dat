Sarah allows <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> in to the police. When he informs <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> and Charlie take a trip to the park.

5|$|Through {{a mutual}} {{reflection}} on their past, it is revealed that Sarah and Andrew were on holiday {{at the time}} of their meeting with <b>Little</b> <b>Bee.</b> The trip was an attempt to salvage their marriage after Andrew discovered Sarah had been unfaithful to him, embarking on an affair with Home Office employee Lawrence Osborn. While walking on the beach one morning, they were approached by a then 14-year-old <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> and her older sister Nkiruka. The girls were being pursued by soldiers who had burned down their village and intended for there to be no witnesses left alive. The soldiers arrived and murdered a guard from the O'Rourkes' hotel, but offered to spare the lives of the girls if Andrew would amputate his own middle finger with a machete. Afraid, and believing the soldiers would murder the girls anyway, Andrew refused, but Sarah complied in his place. The soldiers took both girls away, leaving the couple in doubt as to whether the soldiers would leave one girl alive in response, as they promised.|$|E
5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system, as well as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the novel, <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> {{considers}} how {{she would}} explain England to [...] "the girls back home" [...] in Nigeria. Cleave uses the girls as a Greek chorus, providing a foil to allow the cultural dissonance experienced by <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> to be made explicit. He feels the device is more natural than having <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> narrate her alarm first hand, allowing the reader to appreciate the cultural gulf, and <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> to seem knowing as opposed to tragic. Through Little Bee's narration, Cleave examines human culture from the opposite perspective as science fiction does, having an extraordinary protagonist explore an ordinary world. This contemporary realism gives a significance to mundane events experienced by <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> while bringing into focus [...] "sad and ignoble" [...] aspects of English culture such as the detention system. Cleave commented: [...] "We have become accustomed to viewing our own actions in soft focus, but the alien narrator has not yet acquired this cultural immunity. She sees us as {{we can no longer}} see ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|The Guardian Lawrence Norfolk {{commented that}} Sarah is a [...] "far from perfect heroine: a semi-neglectful mother and unfaithful wife", but noted that [...] "Cleave does not mock Sarah (and life in Kingston upon Thames) {{any more than}} he does <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> and her {{experiences}} in Nigeria." [...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> who is much easier to like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E
500|$|The primary {{characters}} in The Other Hand are <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, a middle-class Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with <b>Little</b> <b>Bee,</b> she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, and sometimes she tries too hard to convince. It's too often apparent that <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> is not real. This doesn't do justice to her story, and puts the burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} first {{published}} on 7 August 2008, released in hardback by Sceptre in the UK. The hardback edition sold just 3,000 copies in 2008, however {{the publication of a}} paperback copy, released on 5 February 2009, saw increased sales, with 100,000 paperback copies sold in Britain in March and April 2009, despite no advertising and little marketing for the novel. As of November 2009, 300,000 copies of the novel had been sold. Richard Brooks of The Times attributed its success to recommendations from readers to family and friends, with Cleave calling it [...] "an example of word-of-mouth success." [...] The novel was published in America and Canada by Simon & Schuster under the alternative title <b>Little</b> <b>Bee.</b> It was released in hardback and e-book format in February 2009, and in paperback in February 2010. Cleave likes both titles, believing that The Other Hand [...] "speaks to the dichotomous nature of the novel, with its two narrators and two worlds", also referencing Sarah's injury, while <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> is appropriate as the novel is really the telling of Little Bee's story, and sounds [...] "bright and approachable", in line with his aim to write [...] "an accessible story about a serious subject." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} by Sceptre, an imprint of Hodder & Stoughton. Sales were initially slow, but increased {{as a result of}} [...] "word-of-mouth" [...] publicity, with the book eventually ranking 13th on the 2009 Sunday Times bestseller list. It has also been ranked #1 on the [...] "New York Times" [...] bestseller list. The novel has received mixed reviews from critics. It has been praised for its focus on underlying human decency; however, some reviewers felt its events were contrived. The two protagonists have been juxtaposed, with less sympathy evoked by Surrey-born Sarah than Nigerian-refugee <b>Little</b> <b>Bee.</b> The novel was nominated for the 2008 Costa Book Awards and a 2009 Commonwealth Writers' Prize. A film adaptation is being developed, and will be produced by and star Nicole Kidman.|$|E
500|$|A central stylistic {{feature of}} the novel is the lack of detail Cleave gives {{regarding}} elements of Little Bee's past. [...] "Little Bee" [...] is an assumed name, described as a [...] "mechanism for survival" [...] by Courteau, as the character is forced to discard her true name when pursued by soldiers, through fear it may reveal her tribe and religion. Her real name, Udo, is not revealed {{until the end of the}} novel. Courteau also highlights the fact that Little Bee's Nigerian enemies and their motivations are never explicitly described, as the novel is told through the first-person narrative, and <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> herself is limited in her understanding of them. Cleave intended for the story as a whole never to be fully explicit, relying instead on readers' interpretation of the characters' dialogue.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Blitz {{wanted the}} film's music to be [...] "sweet {{and a touch}} melancholy and just a step out of rhythm", demonstrating Hal's sense of himself in the world, and to express his teenage angst while [...] "maintain an {{underlying}} sweetness". While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele that I never played... And Jeffrey [...] had gotten a <b>little</b> <b>bee</b> in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at one point I started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Las Abejas" [...] (Spanish for [...] "the bees") was chosen, {{according}} to {{one member of the}} organization, because [...] "like the bees we want to build our houses together, to collectively work and enjoy the fruit of our work. We want to produce 'honey' but also to share with anyone who needs it... We know that, like the <b>little</b> <b>bees,</b> the work is slow but the result is sure because it is collective." [...] Another member of the organization notes a political element in the choice of the name: [...] "The bee is a very small insect that is able to move a sleeping cow when it pricks. Our struggle is like a bee that pricks, that is our resistance, but it's non-violent." ...|$|R
500|$|The novel also {{deals with}} the issue of globalisation. Courteau {{observed}} that although <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> learns English from newspapers she acquires at the English detention centre, her reference points are still Nigerian, and thus through her narrative voice Cleave [...] "illustrates the forcible dislocations of a globalized world." [...] Cleave chose to explore the issue in The Other Hand as he believes that, although globalisation is frequently discussed, people rarely consider its meaning. He explained: [...] "money can move freely across national borders, but people can't. They're actively prevented from going where the money is. Capital is global, but labour isn't. I believe that's the cause of two major crises that we're involved in as a species – one is a financial crisis and one is a refugee crisis. Imagine a world where money can't move, where capital is stuck in its country of origin, but people can freely move where the work is! That's an alternate interpretation of globalization that would solve a lot of problems." [...] Although Cleave did not intend for the novel to be heavily political, he felt it was important to raise the issue, given the refugee subject matter of The Other Hand.|$|E
500|$|The Other Hand {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the British asylum system and attitude towards asylum-seekers. Cleave feels there exists a [...] "general lethargy" [...] about the way asylum-seekers are treated in Britain, and though he believes he is not a political writer, the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled [...] "United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship". The extract reads: [...] "Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting (sic) persecution and conflict." [...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, how seriously can we take its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the best kind of political novel". Emma Philip of The Courier-Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points, readers should not confuse it with a political book, as the [...] "overwhelming beauty" [...] of the relationship between Sarah, <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> and Charlie [...] "far outweighs the political message." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Giergerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{felt that}} Sarah and <b>Little</b> <b>Bee</b> are both [...] "so richly drawn that the {{supporting}} characters suffer by comparison." [...] These supporting characters are Andrew, Sarah's husband, Lawrence, her lover, Clarissa her colleague and Charlie, her four-year-old son, who {{for much of}} the novel answers only to [...] "Batman" [...] and dresses only in his Batman costume. Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least-likeable characters in the novel, describing Andrew as [...] "an ordinary guy with self-righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he's tested by real life" [...] and Lawrence as a [...] "cowardly yes-man". Cleave agreed that for Lawrence, [...] "career and propriety are more important than basic morality. He's gone so far down that road that he can't come back, and he's made more villainous for all the things he could do but doesn't." [...] Charlie is based on Cleave's oldest son, who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to [...] "Batman". He forms the emotional centre of the novel, holding the adult characters together, and is a study in the early formation of identity. Cleave explained: [...] "Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us, and which are mere camouflage. So it's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor of a child who is engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie's case by taking on the persona of a superhero." ...|$|E

I know she often pondered anxiously what she called [...] "leur avenir;" [...] but if the youngest, a puny and delicate but engaging child, chancing to spy her, broke from its nurse, and toddling down the walk, came all eager and laughing and panting to clasp her knee, Madame would just calmly put out one hand, so as to prevent inconvenient concussion from the child's sudden onset: [...] "Prends garde, mon enfant!" [...] she would say unmoved, patiently permit it to stand near her a few moments, and then, without smile or kiss, or endearing syllable, rise and lead it back to Trinette.|$|R
