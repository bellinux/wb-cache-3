The <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> is a legacy device {{that must be}} removed before deploying broadband services on twisted-pair transmission lines. The proposed methods do not require dedicated hardware but utilize the already installed transceivers for one-port measurements of the line input impedance. The number of <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> is detected by {{counting the number of}} resonance peaks in the line impedance spectrum. An approximative model of the symmetric loaded line is presented, from which a low-complexity <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> locator is derived. For nonsymmetric lines, a <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> locator using model-based optimization is proposed. The two methods are compared and evaluated by computer simulations and by laboratory measurements on real transmission lines. The estimation results indicate that up to five <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> can be robustly detected and located with the proposed methods...|$|R
50|$|Because DSL {{operates}} {{above the}} 3.4 kHz voice limit, it cannot {{pass through a}} <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> which is an inductive coil {{that is designed to}} counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). <b>Load</b> <b>coils</b> are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node (FTTN).|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the T antenna used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a <b>loading</b> <b>coil.</b> The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N parallel <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> and grounds rather than one, the equivalent <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple T antenna. [...] The antenna was used in the powerful radio stations of the wireless telegraphy era but has fallen out of favor due to the expense of multiple <b>loading</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{required}} {{increase in}} L {{is achieved by}} loading the cable with a metal with high magnetic permeability. It is also possible to load a cable of conventional construction by adding discrete <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> at regular intervals. This is not identical to a distributed loading, the difference being that with <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> there is distortionless transmission up to a definite cut-off frequency beyond which the attenuation increases rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Without <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> {{the line}} {{response}} {{is dominated by}} the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency. With <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, waveforms are undistorted and the characteristic impedance is resistive up to the cutoff frequency. The coincidental formation of an audio frequency filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a magnetic resonance {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) system that uses three coils, a planar receiver and operates at 6. 78 MHz,. Effective power transfer is ensured by establishing an impedance matching condition for this WPT system. A metamaterial (MTM) array having dimensions of 20 cm. 30 cm is also positioned near the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> to concentrate the magnetic field and enhance the transfer efficiency. The result is a maximal improvement of 27 % in the transfer efficiency at a transfer distance of 50 cm. The impact of a ground plane on the transfer efficiency is also examined.

The highest transfer efficiency improvement is about 55 % at a distance of 20 cm with the ground plane. A practical laptop model is fabricated to verify the impact of the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> angle and position on the transfer efficiency.

In fact, neither man was the first to suggest the idea of <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> that credit goes to Oliver Heaviside in an 1887 article.

5000|$|Unloaded phantom is {{a phantom}} {{configuration}} of loaded lines (a circuit fitted with <b>loading</b> <b>coils).</b> The idea {{here is not}} to create additional circuits. Rather, the purpose is to cancel or greatly reduce the effect of the <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> fitted to a line. The reason for doing this is that loaded lines have a definite cut-off frequency and it may be desired to equalise the line to a frequency which is higher than this, for example to make a circuit suitable for use by a broadcaster. Ideally, the loading would be removed or reduced for a permanent connection, but this is not feasible for temporary arrangements such as a requirement for outside broadcast. Instead, two circuits in a phantom configuration can be used to greatly reduce the inductance being inserted by the <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> and hence the loading effect.|$|R

The feasibility of the overall operation of the ACAS was verified through simulation and experiments.
