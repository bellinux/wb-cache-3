5|$|The Russian Spaniel {{resembles the}} English Cocker Spaniel, {{with a body}} similar to the field lines of that breed though with the longer ears of the show line. The body of the Russian Spaniel tends to be <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the English Cocker however, and the breed has only one line rather than being split into {{separate}} specific show and field lines of the same breed.|$|E
5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes {{north and south of}} these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Mascarene grey parakeet as a grey, long-tailed parrot. Subfossils show that its beak was about 30% <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the sympatric echo parakeet, {{and that it}} had a comparatively broad beak. Members of the Psittacula genus commonly have large, red beaks, and long tail feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its congeners in other osteological details. It was skeletally similar to the Alexandrine parakeet, but some of its bones were larger and more robust. Its colouration also separated it from all other members of Psittacula, the majority of which are green or partially green.|$|E

5000|$|The consonants marked {{long have}} been {{analyzed}} in various ways, including 'tense' or 'fortis' and paired up with 'lax' or 'lenis' partners, {{though there is}} no phonological basis for grouping the supposed 'long' consonants together, or for partnering them with particular 'short' consonants. The clear cases are , which are twice as long as [...] but otherwise identical in a spectrogram.

It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and {{military}} change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, inaugurated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well {{back from the}} tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But {{they are not as}} square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
40|$|Oddballs—low-probability, attention-capturing {{expectancy}} violations—are {{judged as}} <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> non-oddballs, but are temporal intervals that contain oddballs judged as <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> those <b>that</b> do not? In 2 experiments, we tested competing model predictions using a novel and covert measure of subjective duration—musical imagery reproduction. Participants verbally estimated and reproduced with musical imagery repeated, coherent, or incoherent familiar or unfamiliar chord sequences (3. 5 s, 7 s, or 12 s) that either {{did or did}} not contain dynamic auditory oddballs. Participants verbally estimated repeated chord sequences that contained oddballs as shorter <b>than</b> those <b>that</b> did not, but reproduced with musical imagery incoherent chord sequences that contained oddballs as <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> those <b>that</b> did not. These findings suggest that (a) intervals that contain attention-capturing, high-priority events are judged as shorter <b>than</b> those <b>that</b> do not when people are engaged in relatively temporal information processing, but as <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> those <b>that</b> do not when people are engaged in relatively nontemporal information processing, and (b) temporal and nontemporal information processing are interdependent. These results support the resource allocation model of short interval time estimation. We discuss implications for attention- and memory-based models, dynamic attending theory, and the ongoing debate about the mechanisms driving the temporal oddball illusion...|$|R

5|$|When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly {{and nearby}} males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts males {{she is in}} estrus by {{whistling}} through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female {{does not want to}} mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of other rodents.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E
