50|$|To achieve process {{temperatures}} beneath 450 °C {{leaded glass}} or <b>lead</b> <b>silicate</b> glass is used. The glass frit is a paste consisting glass powder, organic binder, inorganic fillers and solvents. This low melting glass paste is milled into powder (grain size < 15 µm) and mixed with organic binder forming a printable viscous paste. Inorganic fillers, i.e. cordierite particles (e.g. Mg2Al3 AlSi5O18) or barium silicate, {{are added to}} the melted glass paste to influence properties, i.e. lowering the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between silicon and glass frit. The solvents are used to adjust the viscosity of the organic binder. Several glass frit pastes are commercially available, e.g. FERRO FX-11-0366, and every single one need individual handling after deposition. The choice of the paste depends on various factors, i.e. deposition method, substrate material and process temperatures.|$|E

50|$|Lead {{is usually}} {{brought into the}} glazes with tin oxide. The {{reaction}} between lead and tin oxide results in the recrystallisation of tin oxide, and thus enhances the degree of opacification in tin-opacified glazes than in tin-opacified glass. A high PbO/SnO2 ratio is often found in ancient glazes. During the firing process, lead oxide reacts with quartz at approximately 550℃ to form PbSiO3, which then reacts with tin oxide to produce lead-tin oxide (PbSnO3) at a temperature higher than 600℃. After the formation of lead-tin oxide, the melting of PbSiO3, PbO and PbSnO3 occurs at {{the temperature in the}} range of 700℃ to 750℃, resulting in the dissolution of PbSnO3 to SnO2. The degree of the crystallisation of SnO2 increases with the increasing of temperature. During either heating or cooling, the recrystallisation is taken place until the supply of tin is exhausted. In the second heating, lead in the form of lead oxide no longer reacts with tin oxide to form <b>lead</b> <b>silicate,</b> thus the recrystallised cassiterite (SnO2) remain undissolved and precipitate in the glazes. The nucleation and growth rates of the precipitation depend upon temperature and time. The particle size of the cassiterite developed is also dependent on the temperature, and smaller than that used in the very beginning. It is the smaller particle size of the recrystallised SnO2 in glazes that increases the opacity in tin-opacified glazes. Besides the increasing the opacity, the high lead oxide to tin oxide ratio also reduces the melting point of glazes, lead to a lower firing temperature during production.|$|E

40|$|Lead oxide is {{a general}} term and can be either lead {{monoxide}} or "litharge " (PbO); lead tetroxide or "red lead " (Pb 3 O 4); or black or "gray " oxide which {{is a mixture of}} 70 percent lead monoxide and 30 percent metallic lead. Black lead is made for specific use in the manufacture of lead acid storage batteries. Because {{of the size of the}} lead acid battery industry, lead monoxide is the most important commercial compound of lead, based on volume. Total oxide production in 1989 was 57, 984 megagrams (64, 000 tons). Litharge is used primarily in the manufacture of various ceramic products. Because of its electrical and electronic properties, litharge is also used in capacitors, Vidicon ® tubes, and electrophotographic plates, as well as in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials. It is also used as an activator in rubber, a curing agent in elastomers, a sulfur removal agent in the production of thioles and in oil refining, and an oxidation catalyst in several organic chemical processes. It also has important markets in the production of many lead chemicals, dry colors, soaps (i. e., lead stearate), and driers for paint. Another important use of litharge is the production of lead salts, particularly those used as stabilizers for plastics, notably polyvinyl chloride materials. The major lead pigment is red lead (Pb 3 O 4), which is used principally in ferrous metal protective paints. Other lead pigments include white lead and lead chromates. There are several commercial varieties of white lead including leaded zinc oxide, basic carbonate white lead, basic sulfate white lead, and basic <b>lead</b> <b>silicates.</b> Of these, the most important is leaded zinc oxide, which is used almost entirely as white pigment for exterior oil-based paints. 12. 16. 2 Process Description 8 Black oxide is usually produced by a Barton Pot process. Basic carbonate white lead production is based on the reaction of litharge with acetic acid or acetate ions. This product, when reacted with carbon dioxide, will form lead carbonate. White leads (other than carbonates) are made either by chemical, fuming, or mechanical blending processes. Red lead is produced by oxidizing litharge in a reverberatory furnace.
