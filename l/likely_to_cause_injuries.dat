5000|$|Sugar glass (also called candy glass, edible glass, and {{breakaway}} glass) is a brittle transparent form {{of sugar}} {{that looks like}} glass. [...] It can be formed into a sheet that looks like flat glass or an object, such as a bottle or drinking glass. It is used to simulate glass in movies, photographs and plays. It is much less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>injuries</b> than real glass, and it easily breaks convincingly, making it an excellent choice for stunts.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the FHWA has {{concluded}} that the cameras yielded a positive overall cost benefit due to the reduction in more expensive right-angle injury collisions. Other studies have found a greater crash reduction. For example, a 2005 study of the Raleigh, North Carolina, red light camera program conducted by the Institute for Transportation Research and Education at North Carolina State University found right-angle crashes dropped by 42%, rear-end crashes dropped by 25% and total crashes dropped by 17%. In 2010, the IIHS looked at results {{of a number of}} studies and found that red light cameras reduce total collisions and particularly reduce the type of crashes that are especially <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>injuries.</b> A 2011 IIHS report concluded that the rate of fatal collisions involving red-light running in cities with a population of 200,000 or greater was 24% lower with cameras {{than it would have been}} without cameras.|$|E

50|$|Frangible bullets are {{intended}} to disintegrate into tiny particles upon target impact to minimize their penetration of other objects.

50|$|Toughened or {{tempered}} glass {{is a type}} of safety glass processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass. Tempering puts the outer surfaces into compression and the interior into tension.

50|$|Although {{the squat}} {{has long been}} a basic element of weight training, it has in recent years been the subject of {{considerable}} controversy. Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees. Others, however, continue to advocate the squat {{as one of the best}} exercises for building muscle and strength. Some coaches maintain that incomplete squats (those terminating above parallel) are both less effective and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>injury</b> than a full squat (terminating with hips at or below knee level). A 2013 review concluded that deep squats performed with proper technique do not lead to increased rates of degenerative knee injuries and are an effective exercise. The same review also concluded that shallower squats may lead to degeneration in the lumbar spine and knees in the long-term.|$|R

50|$|Hurleys {{are made}} from ash wood, {{the base of the}} tree near the root is the only part used and are usually bought from local {{craftsmen}} in Ireland (for about 20-50 euro), who still use traditional production methods. However, for some time in the 1970s, hurleys made from plastic were used, mainly produced by Wavin. These proved more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>injury,</b> however, and were phased out. As of 2012, at least one manufacturer was producing synthetic hurleys approved for use by the GAA. Steel bands are used to reinforce the flattened end of the hurley though these are not permitted in camogie due to increased risk of injury. Bands have been put on hurleys since the beginning; the 8th century Brehon Laws permit only a king's son to have a bronze band, while all others must use a copper band.|$|R
