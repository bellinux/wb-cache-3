Many <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> middleware services are simplistic, however, {{since they are}} geared only for specific usecases and environments. These limitations {{make it hard to}} use the same <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> service for anything other than the distributed application it was designed for originally. This lack of generality forces continuous re-development of application-specific <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> services. Not only does re-development increase deployment costs of distributed applications, but it also increases the potential of producing nonoptimal <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> implementations since proven <b>load</b> <b>balancing</b> service optimizations cannot be reused directly.
