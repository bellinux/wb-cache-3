5|$|Buddhism <b>long</b> <b>held</b> {{that the}} tengu were {{disruptive}} demons and s of war. Their image gradually softened, however, {{into one of}} protective, if still dangerous, spirits of the mountains and forests. Tengu {{are associated with the}} ascetic practice of Shugendō, and they are usually depicted in the garb of its followers, the yamabushi.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played during the Cold War, but {{during a period}} of {{increasing}} détente. The Soviet Chess School had <b>long</b> <b>held</b> a monopoly on the game at the highest level. Spassky was the latest in an uninterrupted chain of Soviet world chess champions, stretching back to the 1948 championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proximity and competitiveness, the rivalry {{was fueled by}} controversial incidents {{both on and off}} the field. Maryland supporters <b>long</b> <b>held</b> that Navy players used unnecessary roughness during play, a charge counter-accused by the Academy after the 1963 game. Some Midshipmen would travel to College Park to meet female students, which served to aggravate the ill feelings. Pranks and vandalism were commonplace on both campuses and exacerbated the already tense situation between Maryland and Navy.|$|E

5|$|Peter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. The son of John Halkett, a {{director}} of the Hudson's Bay Company who for many years had lived in Canada before returning to England, Peter Halkett had <b>long</b> <b>held</b> an interest in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic. He had a particular interest in John Franklin's disastrous Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822.|$|E
5|$|Salt has <b>long</b> <b>held</b> an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of dogs, horses and {{dolphins}} killing themselves. There, however, {{has been little}} scientific study of animal suicide. Animal suicide is usually put down to romantic human interpretation and is not generally thought to be intentional. Some of the reasons animals are thought to unintentionally kill themselves include: psychological stress, infection by certain parasites or fungi, or disruption of a <b>long</b> <b>held</b> social tie, such as the ending of a long association with an owner and thus not accepting food from another individual.|$|E

5|$|While the wrestler {{who would}} later become known as Diamante Azul has never {{revealed}} his birth name, he did unveil that he was born on December 20, 1982. Lucha libre has a <b>long</b> <b>held</b> tradition of not revealing the birth name of masked wrestlers unless they are later unmasked. Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre {{it is possible that}} he made his wrestling debut prior to 2007 under a masked or unmasked identity that has not been revealed yet.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} <b>long</b> <b>held</b> by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial {{to the defense of}} St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, after the fall of France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E
5|$|The bold March {{across the}} Belts had {{threatened}} Copenhagen so seriously {{that it had}} won the previous war for Charles. When his attempt {{to follow through with}} his previous venture failed, he proved unable to suppress militarily the combined forces of his foes. Sweden had come close to dominating the Baltic, which was not {{in the interest of the}} major powers. England, France and to a lesser extent the Netherlands all favored a return to the status quo of the Roskilde peace. In Denmark, the war resulted in sweeping social changes. Frederick III browbeat the nobility which had <b>long</b> <b>held</b> power in Denmark into accepting a hereditary and absolute monarchy.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had <b>long</b> <b>held</b> a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, <b>long</b> <b>held</b> services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by <b>long</b> <b>held</b> convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E
