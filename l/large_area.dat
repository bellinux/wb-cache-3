5|$|Investigations {{showed that}} the secret pipe had been active for ten years. A <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of wetland was {{contaminated}} with zinc oxide, lead, cadmium and other pollutants at several times the threshold for a public health hazard. Visible evidence of contamination extended five feet down into the bed of Long Lake on property owned by Chemetco.|$|E
5|$|Middleton Park, {{a remnant}} of the manorial estate, {{contains}} a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of ancient woodland and parts of it, where coal was mined, are designated a scheduled ancient monument. It was the location of Middleton Hall and Middleton Lodge, homes to the local gentry.|$|E

5|$|Ornithologists {{and bird}} watchers have {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 175species at the IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of forest in the IBA, as well as great habitat diversity. The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{tropical}} cyclones, extra-tropical storms {{cause an}} offshore rise of water. However, unlike most tropical cyclone storm surges, extra-tropical storms can cause higher water levels across a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> {{for longer periods}} of time, depending on the system.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).

5|$|Southcote has {{a number}} of action groups, {{including}} the Southcote Residents' Association (for general residents' interests), the Southcote Neighbourhood Action Group (for a police and council relations), and Southcote Globe (for environmental issues). Southcote Park Estate, a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of semi-detached housing on unadopted roads built in 1933, has an elected volunteer committee.|$|E
5|$|Three {{areas of}} land are {{protected}} for their ecological or geological interest as Sites of Special Interest (SSI). Jersey has four designated Ramsar sites: Les Pierres de Lecq, Les Minquiers, Les Écréhous and Les Dirouilles {{and the south}} east coast of Jersey (a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of intertidal zone).|$|E

5|$|A <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of {{the grounds}} between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Acapulco to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco at 2100UTC September 21, but was discontinued 18 hours later. On 0300 UTC September 12 a hurricane warning was issued for areas below La Paz. Twelve hours later, a {{tropical storm}} warning was issued for the remaining portion of Baja California Sur. The same day, a hurricane warning was issued for a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of the mainland. However, all watches and warnings were discontinued on September 13 as the system had moved inland over Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is the {{principal}} centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a <b>large</b> <b>area,</b> especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. Aarhus has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of citizens attending short, medium or long courses of study. In addition to around 25 institutions of higher education, several research forums have evolved {{to assist in the}} transfer of expertise from education to business. The city is home to more than 52,000 students.|$|E

5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of sunlight {{into a small}} beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E
