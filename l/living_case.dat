40|$|One of {{the primary}} methods of {{instruction}} in business education is the case.

We have used new forms of media, involving computing and communication, to build a novel learning environment, the <b>Living</b> <b>Case,</b> which flexibly and interactively presents cases along with dynamic, on-going feedback to students while they work. Key to providing meaningful assistance daring case analysis is the ability to model and interpret student behavior. Several investigations were conducted {{in order to understand the}} process of case analysis. Case analysis is characterized as a problem solving activity driven by comprehension and reasoning operators. Twelve hours of protocols are analyzed using "retelling profiles" as an interpretation mechanism for further specifying the operators involved in analyzing a case.

Our preliminary results suggest a deeper structure to case analysis which is common across business disciplines, cases, and analysts, and therefore implementable in a system like <b>Living</b> <b>Case.</b> Differences between the analysis strategies of experts and novices are formalized in terms of the experts' use of "templates" of typical company behaviors. This provides the basis for building mechanisms to instruct and re-orient case analysts using the <b>Living</b> <b>Case</b> system.

40|$|The codeine to {{morphine}} {{concentration ratio}} {{is used in}} forensic toxi-cology to assess if codeine has been ingested alone or if morphine and/or heroin have been ingested in addition. In our experience, this interpretation is more difficult in autopsy cases compared with samples from living persons, since high morphine concentrations are observed in cases where only codeine is assumed to have been ingested. We have investigated if codeine and morphine glucuronides are subject to cleavage {{to the same extent}} in <b>living</b> and autopsy <b>cases</b> in vitro. We included whole blood samples from eight living subjects and nine forensic autopsy cases, where only codeine inges-tion was suspected. All samples were incubated for 2 weeks at 378 C and analyzed for codeine and six codeine metabolites using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A reduction in the codeine to morphine concentration ratio was found, both in samples from living subjects (mean 33 %, range 22 – 50 %) and autopsy cases (mean 37 %, range 13 – 54 %). The increase in the morphine concen-trations was greater in the autopsy cases (mean 85 %, max 200 %) compared with that of the <b>living</b> <b>cases</b> (mean 51 %, max 87 %). No changes were seen for codeine or codeine- 6 -glucuronide concentra-tions.

40|$|Introduction: chronic patellar tendon rupture is {{rare and}} its {{incidence}} and prevalence are unknown. Furthermore, the data about late {{reconstruction of the}} patellar tendon in rheumatoid arthritis is limited. Such condition, if not managed properly, can substantially affect the patient's activities of daily <b>living.</b> <b>Case</b> presentation: We report a case of chronic patellar tendon rupture in a 49 years old lady who has been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for over 20 years. She presented with an inability to extend the right knee which started suddenly {{a year and a}} half ago without any history of trauma. She underwent reconstruction of the patellar tendon using a massive BTB allograft. Three years after surgery, the patient had an active range of motion between − 20 and 120 ° and was walking normally without any external support. Discussion: When the primary repair of the patellar tendon is not possible, it is necessary to either repair with autologous augmentation or use a graft to reconstruct the tendon. We believe autografts may not be suitable in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis since the disease is associated with excessive levels of collagenase that could contribute to the degeneration of the tendons. Conclusion: Late patellar tendon reconstruction in rheumatoid arthritis is a challenging procedure, and we believe it is best performed using an allograft to achieve the desired outcome...|$|E

Our preliminary results suggest a deeper structure to case analysis which is common across business disciplines, cases, and individuals. Differences between the analysis strategies of experts and novices are also formalized. Finally, an expert's analogical reasoning strategy using task-specific knowledge encoded as "templates" is identified as a major contributor to their efficiency in solving cases. Templates of typical company situations and responses are triggered early in the analysis process, and subsequent data gathering and reasoning is directed by an attempt to apply the template to the case situation. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} utility of cluster- and case-based {{surveillance}} established in government hospitals in Bangladesh to detect Nipah virus, a stage III zoonotic pathogen. Physicians listed meningo-encephalitis cases in the 10 surveillance hospitals and identified a cluster when 292 cases who lived within 30 min walking distance of one another developed symptoms within 3 weeks of each other. Physicians collected blood samples from the clustered cases. As part of case-based surveillance, blood was collected from all listed meningo-encephalitis cases in three hospitals during the Nipah season (January-March). An investigation team visited clustered cases' communities to collect epidemiological information and blood from the <b>living</b> <b>cases.</b> We tested serum using Nipah-specific IgM ELISA. Up to September 2011, in 5887 listed cases, we identified 62 clusters comprising 176 encephalitis cases. We collected blood from 127 of these cases.

40|$|A {{number of}} genetic {{disorders}} exhibit inter- and intra-familial variability. Understanding {{the factors that}} control the expression of disease genes should {{provide insight into the}} fundamental disease processes and will have implications for counselling patients. Different mechanisms can account for this variability, including environmental factors, genotype-phenotype correlations and imprinting. There is also evidence that, in a number of genetic diseases, gene expression is under the control of modifier loci. In cases where the biological basis of the genetic disease is understood, any genes involved in the pathogenic process represent candidate modifier genes which can easily be evaluated. Alternatively, modifiers can be identified through approaches such as mouse models. Since modifier genes will generally be common and because of confounding environmental influences, linkage analyses in humans will generally be based upon affected or discordant sib pairs. Discordant sib pairs represent an attractive option for linkage studies, because recurrence rates are high and the reduced survival characteristics associated with severe phenotypes will make the likelihood of obtaining clinical material from two <b>living</b> <b>cases</b> difficult. Furthermore, the use of discordant siblings will select for those siblings which possess sufficient dissimilarity at the modifier locus to overcome any shared environmental influence...|$|R

30|$|As {{seen from}} the {{external}} form, cases A and B are both cases of families choosing to live together, namely, the stem family according to the population census. But after a careful analysis, {{it is found that}} there are big differences in these two types of intergenerational living arrangements. First of all, from a time perspective, case B is temporary situation, with families living together for a short or indeterminate time, while case A is relatively stable and lasting situation. In case B, the younger generation plans to return to their “little own home” after the elderly individual’s recovery. The time of <b>living</b> together in <b>case</b> A is relatively long, because the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law subjectively acquiesced to this traditional living pattern.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{prospective}} {{national register}} {{was established in}} 2008 to record all new cases of live-birth newborns with esophageal atresia (EA). This epidemiological survey was recommended {{as part of a}} national rare diseases plan. METHODS: All 38 national centers treating EA participated by completing for each patient at first discharge a questionnaire validated by a national committee of experts. Data were centralized by the national reference center for esophageal anomalies. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed, with P-values of less than 0. 05 considered statistically significant. Results of the 2008 - 2009 data collection are presented in this report. RESULTS: Three hundred seven new <b>living</b> <b>cases</b> of EA were recorded between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009. The male/female sex ratio was 1. 3, and the live-birth prevalence of EA was 1. 8 per 10, 000 births. Major characteristics were comparable to those reported in the literature. Survival was 95 %, and no correlation with caseload was noted.

The results showed a higher preva-lence of scleroderma in all three study areas compared to that expected based on a population survey {{in another part of the}} United Kingdom adopting similar methodology. Further, within the boroughs there was a suggestion that the cases were not uniformly distributed but tended, in part, to cluster in those parts of the study areas that were in fact near to the air-ports under investigation. The increase in absolute risk was not sufficently high to be consistent with a major environ-mental hazard. There is also no biologically plausible hypothesis for these observations.
