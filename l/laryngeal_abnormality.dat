40|$|Abstract Laryngomalacia (LRM), is {{the most}} common <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormality</b> of the newborn, caused by a long curled epiglottis, which {{prolapse}}s posteriorly. Epiglottis prolapse during inspiration (acquired laryngomalacia) is an unusual cause of airway obstruction and a rare cause of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We present a minimally invasive technique where epiglottis on cadaveric larynx specimens was treated with CO 2 laser. The cartilage reshaping effect induced by laser irradiation was capable of exposing the glottis opening widely. This technique could be used in selected cases of LRM and OSAS due to epiglottis prolapse as an alternative, less morbid approach. </p...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the efficacy of}} using speech training procedures with a cri-du-chat adolescent. Research evidence suggests that neither the 'cat-like cry', <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormality</b> or level of severe mental retardation are sufficient to warrant precluding cases of the syndrome from speech training. One aim {{of the study is}} to determine whether operant training procedures are more effective than attention-control procedures with a case of the syndrome. The subject is trained in two situations, the individual room and ward, during daily training sessions. The statistical analysis in the individual room demonstrates that the subject's verbal imitation is significantly greater in the operant than in the control procedures. The results of the subject's verbal object labelling responses to criterion indicates no significant differences between conditions. However, the follow-up assessment shows that the subject retained significantly more verbal object labelling responses to criterion in the operant than in the control procedures. In the ward situation it is argued that operant speech training is significantly more effective than control procedures in increasing the subject's vocalisations to nurses. Social ratings show that both the subject's socialisation and violent and destructive behaviour increased from the control to operant procedures. The overall findings support the view that a cri-du-chat adolescent can benefit from a speech training programme. Furthermore that operant speech training conducted in two situations, an individual room and ward, during daily training sessions is significantly more effective than a combined control approach...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the accuracy of laryngeal examinations during routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as a method of screening for major laryngeal injury in a series of patients with reflux symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients with reflux symptoms and 100 control individuals underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with standard or high-resolution magnifying video endoscopes. Any <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were initially identified by the gastroenterologist before the scope was inserted into the esophagus. All of the examinations were recorded on video and subsequently reevaluated by an otorhinolaryngologist. All of the patients underwent standard laryngoscopy as a reference procedure.

40|$|Aims: Asthma {{treatment}} {{has the potential}} to affect patients' voices. We undertook detailed characterisation of voice morbidity in patients attending a problem asthma clinic, and we determined how patients' perceptions related to objective assessment by an experienced observer. Methods: Forty-three patients took part in the study. Subjects completed the self-administered voice symptom score (VoiSS) questionnaire and underwent digital voice recording. These voice recordings were scored using the grade–roughness–breathiness–asthenicity–strain system (GRBAS). Laryngoscopy was also performed. Results: The median VoiSS was 26 (range three to 83). VoiSS were significantly lower in the 17 patients with normal laryngeal structure and function (range four to 46; median 22), compared with the 26 patients with functional or structural <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormality</b> (range three to 83; median 33) (95 per cent confidence intervals for difference 0. 0 – 21. 0; p = 0. 044). The overall grade score for the GRBAS scale did not differ between these two groups, and only 13 patients had a GRBAS score of one or more, recognised as indicating a voice problem. There were positive correlations between related GRBAS score and voice symptom score subscales. Although voice symptom scores were significantly more abnormal in patients with structural and functional abnormalities, this score performed only moderately well as a predictive tool (sensitivity 54 per cent; specificity 71 per cent). Nevertheless, the voice symptom score performed as well as the more labour-intensive GRBAS score (sensitivity 57 per cent; specificity 60 per cent). Patients' inhaled corticosteroid dose (median dose 1000 µg beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) had a statistically significant relationship with their overall grade score for the GRBAS scale (r = 0. 56; p &# 60; 0. 001), but not with their VoiSS. Only one patient had evidence of laryngeal candidiasis, and only two had any evidence of abnormality suggesting steroid-induced myopathy. Conclusions: Vocal morbidity is common in patients with asthma, and should not be immediately attributed to steroid-related candidiasis. The VoiSS merits further, prospective validation as a screening tool for ENT and/or speech and language therapy referral in patients with asthma. </p...|$|E
40|$|Acromegalic {{patients}} have a reduced life expectancy mainly due to cardio-, cerebrovascular and respiratory disorders and increased prevalence of neoplasias. Particularly, {{the pathogenesis of}} respiratory disorders in acromegalics is debated. <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> are not yet well clarified {{even if they are}} frequently involved in the occurrence of respiratory insufficiency. In this study, we report on a 65 year-old acromegalic male suffering from frequent and severe dyspnea attacks and clinical findings of respiratory upperway obstruction, besides the common acromegalic features. At the external examination of the larynx, a bilateral painless and soft mass, located in the laterocervical region under the hyoid bone, was detected. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy, showed bilateral swelling between the aryepiglottic fold and the false vocal cords, whose size increased during the expiration and the phonation, fixity of the vocal cords in paramedian position, with a marked reduction of the respiratory space and increase in arytenoid cartilage size and mucosal edema. Neck and mediastinum CT scan showed the presence of an air containing bilateral swelling, crossing the thyrohyoid membrane. Bilateral cricoarytenoidal joint chondrocalcification, associated to a mixed-type bilateral laryngocele, was diagnosed. Laryngoceles were both surgically removed and a left monolateral arytenoidectomy was performed, using fiberoptic microlaryngoscopy with CO 2 laser. The clinical evaluation, one month later, confirmed the complete disappearance of dyspnea and a partial improvement of phonation. Three months later, laryngoscopy showed the bilateral restoration of vocal cords motility and a significant improvement of phonation. This case presents an uncommon and severe respiratory problem in acromegaly such as the fixity of vocal cords associated to laryngocele. Circulating GH and IGF-I hypersecretion caused edema and laxity of laryngeal mucosa as well as bilateral ankylosis of cricoarytenoidal joints.

An objective measurement is therefore necessary to understand the impact of equipment design, its usability, surgeon skill, and learning, on performing LP effectively. This paper introduces imaging based feature extraction as a method to establish metrics to assess surgical performance in LP. Experimental analysis demonstrates the utility of these metrics in measuring surgical task execution vis-a-vis the task objectives. The metrics also provide for a combined rating scale giving a robust quantitative classification of the levels of surgical performance...|$|R

Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate laryngeal lesions in patients after prolonged intubation (> 24 h), to correlate these lesions with the variables involved in the process of intubation and to determine the risk factors. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study for 1 year of patients who were intubated for more than 24 h in our critical care unit. Patients underwent laryngeal video endoscopy on the day of extubation and after 3 weeks by an ENT surgeon who was blinded to the intubation variables. Result: About 51 patients were included in the study. <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were seen in 41 patients on the day of extubation. At the end of third week after extubation, only 10 patients had abnormal laryngeal findings. A multivariate stepwise regression model showed that bigger tube size (P = 0. 02), longer duration of intubation (P = 0. 01) and emergency intubation (P = 0. 02) was associated with higher incidence of laryngeal complications on the day of extubation.

All had developed <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> chronic skin ulceration, nail dystrophy, and conjunctival disease in infancy. In every case, dental enamel was hypoplastic and both skin and mucosal surfaces demonstrated increased susceptibility to trauma. Progression of disease occurred, to life threatening respiratory obstruction in two cases and to effective blindness and fatal respiratory obstruction in the third child. All of these children came from the Pakistani ethnic group. No medical treatment has halted progression of this disease but laser therapy has been partially successful in alleviating laryngeal manifestations. Ultrastructural and immunohistological examination of unaffected skin was undertaken in each child. No abnormality was found in the child with the mildest clinical disease. Both of the other children showed abnormal hemidesmosomes on ultrastructural examination. The most severely affected child also had abnormally weak immunoreactivity with antibodies G 71 and GB 3 directed against basal cell alpha 6 beta 4 integrin and the basement membrane glycoprotein nicein respectively. These abnormal findings are also seen in skin from patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa. These three children have the laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome, which may not be rare in their ethnic group. The available clinical and pathological evidence is consistent with this syndrome being caused by an inherited defect affecting the lamina lucida of the skin basement membrane zone.

Dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, chest pain or tightness and throat discomfort {{are the most}} commonly encountered symptoms. They may occur either at rest or more commonly during exercise in patients with VCD, {{as well as in}} asthmatic subjects. The phase of respiration (inspiration rather than expiration), the location of the wheezing origin, the rapid resolution of symptoms, and the timing occurring in relation to exercise, when VCD is exercise induced, raise the suspicion of VCD in patients who may have been characterized as merely asthmatics and, most importantly, had not responded to the appropriate treatment. The gold standard method for the diagnosis of VCD is fiberoptic laryngoscopy, which may also identify concomitant <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> other than VCD. However, as VCD is an intermittent phenomenon, the procedure should be performed while the patient is symptomatic. For this reason, challenges that induce VCD symptoms should be performed, such as exercise tests. Recently, for the evaluation of patients with exercise-induced VCD, continuous laryngoscopy during exercise (such as treadmill, bicycle ergometer, swimming) was used. A definite diagnosis of VCD is of importance, especially for those patients who have been erroneously characterized as asthmatics, without adequate response to treatment. In these cases, another therapeutic approach is necessary, which will depend on whether they suffer solely from VCD or from both conditions.

40|$|Introduction and objective: This study {{correlates}} the Singing Voice Handicap Index (SVHI) {{scores with}} videostrobolaryngoscopy and acoustic analysis in healthy professional singers, {{as a measure}} of self-perceived vocal health, versus actual pathology diagnosed during examination by stroboscopy, or by modification at the acoustic voice evaluation. The objectives of the study were to measure the strength of self-assessment among professional singers and to determine whether there is a benefit of combining SVHI, acoustic analysis and videostrobolaryngoscopy for the routine assessment of singers who have no obvious singing voice problem. Method: Prospective cross-sectional study. The voice quality of 40 students of the Music Academy, Cluj-Napoca, was assessed by means of a multidimensional test battery containing a singing voice handicap index (SVHI), as well as SVHI- 10, videolaryngostroboscopy, maximum phonation time on vowel /a/, S/Z ratio, Jitter, Shimmer and NHR (Harmonic Noise Ratio, at lowest, highest and conversational frequency). Additionally, in a questionnaire on daily habits has been recorded for the participants, covering the prevalence of smoking, eating habits, and vocal abuse. The correlation between SVHI scores, acoustic analysis and pathologic findings seen on videostrobolaryngoscopy was analyzed using linear regression and serial t tests to draw the conclusions of this study. Results: Both SVHI and SVHI- 10 scores showed, as previously expected, normal values for healthy singers (SVHI- 10 being the singers preferred metric). However, although all participants self-identified as healthy, <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were relatively common. Acoustic analysis of students voices identified relative instability of pitches, problems with F 0 variation, TMF (Maximum Phonation Time) and S/Z ratio. No Significant correlation (P = 0. 9501) between SVHI scores, acoustic analysis and videostrobolaryngoscopy findings were shown by the linear regression analysis. Conclusions: Multidimensional assessment of voice quality for the routine evaluation of singers without obvious singing voice problems is an important tool for the early detection of voice problems, despite appearances of a healthy voice. A trained singer has the possibility to compensate minor laryngeal modifications using singing techniques and, thus, is at risk of overlooking or ignoring an existing pathology. In conclusion, acoustic evaluation of the performers’ voices through the methods outlined above could assist in early detection and treatment of vocal pathology...|$|R

40|$|The Reflux Finding Score for Infants (RFS-I) was {{developed}} to objectively assess signs of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Based on review of flexible laryngoscopic videos, only moderate inter- and highly variable intraobserver reliability was found. We hypothesized that examination of the infant larynx with rigid laryngoscopy would provide better agreement. to assess {{the validity of the}} RFS-I in the detection of LPR-related findings using flexible versus rigid laryngoscopy. Thirty consecutive infants underwent flexible and rigid laryngoscopy. Based on the recorded videos, RFS-I was scored by 4 otorhinolaryngologists, 2 otorhinolaryngology fellows, and 2 inexperienced observers. Videos were presented in a randomized order, blinded for clinical profile and findings during initial examination. Observers were provided an instruction sheet prior to evaluation. For categorical data, agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa (2 observers) and Fleiss' kappa (> 2 observers). For ordinal data the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used. Of 30 included patients (17  M; median age 7. 5 (0 - 19. 8) months), main reasons for referral were: stridor (n =  15, 50 %), ALTE/apneas (n =  7, 23. 3 %), follow-up of <b>laryngeal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (n =  6, 20 %), aspiration (n =  5, 16. 7 %), and other indications (n =  7, 23. 3 %).

The {{purpose is to}} determine whether cartilage abnormalities as seen on preoperative CT in laryngeal and pyriform sinus cancer are predictive of local outcome after partial laryngectomy. METHODS: The preoperative CT studies in a consecutive series of 16 patients who underwent extended hemilaryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis (n = 12), supraglottis (n = 1), or pyriform sinus (n = 3) were reviewed retrospectively. Cartilage abnormalities were defined as asymmetric cartilage sclerosis, lysis of ossified cartilage, or tumor visible {{on both sides of}} the cartilage. Tumor volume was calculated by using the summation-of-areas technique. Seven patients underwent postoperative radiation therapy. All patients had a follow-up of at least 24 months after treatment or until local recurrence. RESULTS: Eleven patients showed cartilage abnormalities. In six patients, only a single cartilage was abnormal, whereas three patients showed involvement of two cartilages and two patients of three cartilages. The overall average tumor volume was 2. 7 mL; the average tumor volume was 1. 5 mL in the patients without and 3. 3 mL in those with cartilage involvement on CT (P >. 05). Two patients suffered a local recurrence. One patient (tumor volume, 1. 5 mL) did not show any cartilage abnormalities. The other patient (tumor volume, 1. 9 mL) showed abnormalities in all three cartilages and also had evidence of early transcartilaginous tumor spread.

RESULTS: The frequency of abnormalities for four parameters (pharyngo-esophageal segment (PES) resting pressure, PES relaxation duration, pharyngeal peak pressure, pharyngeal contraction duration) differed significantly between the patients with penetration and those with normal barium studies. There was, however, no association between manometric abnormalities and the degree of barium penetration.

Treatments according to various conditions will be discussed. Successful management of these neonates requires accurate diagnosis, early intervention, and multidisciplinary care by ENT surgeons, paediatricians, and paediatric anaesthetists. 1...|$|R
40|$|We report two unrelated, long {{surviving}} patients (2 and 17 years) with syndromal hypothalamic hamartoblastoma. Both showed mild facial dysmorphism (downward slanted palpebral fissures, ptosis, microretrognathia), cleft epiglottis, {{and developmental}} delay. The younger child had stenosis of the pulmonary arteries, complex urogenital malformations, and anal atresia. In the oldest patient, the hamartoma caused precocious puberty {{of the central}} type, combined with complete hGH deficiency. Both patients showed bony anomalies of the extremities: variable proximal synostosis between central (2 nd to 4 th) metacarpals or intercalary polydactyly with generalised brachydactyly, severe brachytelephalangism, syndactyly, and nail hypoplasia. Together with the absence of anomalies of cholesterol metabolism, a combination of oral frenula, <b>laryngeal</b> malformations, digestive <b>abnormalities,</b> intercalary polysyndactyly, generalised brachytelephalangism, and nail hypoplasia should allow the delineation of Pallister-Hall syndrome, even when a CNS tumour is absent. The radiological abnormalities are helpful in differentiating Pallister-Hall syndrome from the other syndromes in which hypothalamic hamartoblastoma is observed. This is of major importance for genetic counselling, since Pallister-Hall syndrome may be a dominantly inherited disorder, thus contrasting {{with most of the}} other disorders with the CAVE phenotype, which are recessively inherited...|$|R

Objective. To know the characteristics of endoscopic <b>laryngeal</b> and pharyngeal <b>abnormalities</b> in Japanese patients with laryngophar-yngeal reflux symptoms (LPRS). Methods. A total of 146 endoscopic images of the larynx and pharynx (60 pairs for the rabeprazole group and 13 pairs for the control group) were presented to 15 otolaryngologists blinded to patient information and were scored according to several variables potentially associated with laryngopharyngeal reflux. The median value of the 15 scores for each item from each image was obtained. The mean pretreatment scores of each item and total score were assessed in both rabeprazole and control groups. In the rabeprazole group, the endoscopic findings {{before and after the}} 4 -week treatment with rabeprazole were compared. Changes between corresponding duration in the control group were also evaluated. Results. The median and mean pre-treatment total score was 3 and 3. 02, respectively, from the 73 patients with LPRS. No significant differences were observed befor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Neuronal vacuolation and spinocerebellar {{degeneration}} is a rare, presumably inherited {{condition that}} is reported only in Rottweilers and in crossbred dogs with known or potential Rottweiler heritage. Gross and histopathologic findings include laryngeal muscle atrophy, neuronal vacuolation, and a combined central and peripheral axonopathy. Two 6 -month-old Boxer puppies {{from the same}} litter were referred for evaluation of progressive pelvic limb paresis and ataxia, upper airway stridor, and visual deficits. Examination of each dog suggested a combined myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy, as well as congenital ocular disease. Gross lesions were limited to atrophy of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Histopathologically, there was diffuse loss of axons and myelin in the dorsolateral and ventral funiculi throughout the spinal cord and extending into the caudal aspect of the brain stem. Vacuolation of scattered neuronal cell bodies was present in the spinal cord and selected brain stem nuclei. Multifocal axonal degeneration and demyelination was observed in the recurrent laryngeal nerve, sciatic nerve, and brachial plexus and was most severe in the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve. Ocular <b>abnormalities</b> included microphthalmia, cataracts, and retinal dysplasia. The findings in these Boxer dogs, unrelated to the Rottweiler breed, are analogous to the syndrome of neuronal vacuolation and spinocerebellar degeneration reported in Rottweilers...|$|R

No significant differences were observed before and after treatment in either the rabeprazole or control groups for any item or total score. In 24 patients with a high pretreatment score (total score ≥ 4) from the rabeprazole group, significant decreases in scores for “thick endolaryngeal mucous” (0. 54 to 0. 17, P = 0. 017) and total (4. 77 to 3. 58, P = 0. 0003) were observed after the 4 -week treatment...|$|R
