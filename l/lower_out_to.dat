The intention was to retain lateral control down to the lowest speeds.|$|R

Market microstructure effects in relation to news-induced revaluation of the underlying variable is likely to make this an unrealistic assumption for high-frequency transaction data. To capture these microstructure effects, this paper suggests a model in which market prices adjust gradually to jumps in the underlying effcient price. A case study illustrates the empirical relevance of the model, and the performance of different jump tests is investigated here and in a simulation study. Evidence indicates that tests based on the largest of scaled price increments perform better than tests comparing measures of variability.

Our improvements result from a new approach which might be generally useful for attacking other similar problems. [...] ...|$|R

This paper considers a spatial approach to enabling, understanding and managing access control that is generally applicable {{across a range of}} collaborative environments and applications. Access control is governed according to the space within which subjects and objects reside, and the ability to traverse space to get close to an object. We present a framework that enables the SPACE access model [4], previously presented as an access model solely for collaborative virtual environments, to be applied across a number of collaborative systems. This framework is exemplified through mappings of the model to 3 D and 2 D collaborative environments, namely Spline [1], TeamRooms [19] and Orbit [16]. One particularly interesting feature of the model {{is the way in which}} it handles group access by considering how group credentials are determined. These credentials are presented to the model in the usual manner. We conclude by presenting some limitations of our approach, and workarounds...|$|R
40|$|The Heliospheric Imager (HI) forms {{part of the}} SECCHI {{suite of}} {{instruments}} aboard the two NASA STEREO spacecraft which were launched successfully from Cape Canaveral AFB on 25 Oct 2006 (26 Oct UTC). Following lunar swingby's on 15 Dec and 21 Jan respectively, the two spacecraft were placed in heliocentric orbits at approximately 1 AU - one leading and one lagging the Earth, with each spacecraft separating from the Earth by 22. 5 ° per year. Each HI instrument comprises two wide-angle optical cameras - HI- 1 and HI- 2 have 20 ° and 70 ° fields-of-view which are off-pointed from the Sun direction by 14. 0 ° and 53. 7 ° respectively, with the optical axes pointed towards the ecliptic plane. In this way the cameras will {{for the first time}} provide stereographic images of the solar corona, and in particular of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) as they propagate outwards through interplanetary space towards the Earth and beyond. The wide-field coverage of HI enables imaging of solar ejecta from 15 to about 330 solar radii whilst the other SECCHI instruments (2 coronagraphs and an EUV imager) provide coverage from the <b>lower</b> corona <b>out</b> <b>to</b> 15 solar radii. This paper briefly reviews the design and performance requirements for the instrument. The various activation, checkout and calibration activities before and after opening the instrument's protective cover or door (instrument 'first-light') are then described and it is shown that the instrument has met the design requirements, including CCD and camera imaging performance, correction for shutterless operation of the cameras, straylight rejection and thermal requirements. It is demonstrated from observations of a CME event on 24 - 25 Jan 2007 that the instrument is capable of detecting CMEs at an intensity of 1 % of the coronal background.

40|$|In recent investigations, it {{has been}} found that {{conservation}} laws generally lead to precision limits on quantum computing. Lower bounds of the error probability have been obtained for various logic operations from the commutation relation between the noise operator and the conserved quantity or from the recently developed universal uncertainty principle for the noise-disturbance trade-off in general measurements. However, the problem of obtaining the precision limit to realizing the quantum NOT gate has eluded a solution from these approaches. Here, we develop a new method for this problem based on analyzing the trace distance between the output state from the realization under consideration and the one from the ideal gate. Using the mathematical apparatus of orthogonal polynomials, we obtain a general lower bound on the error probability for the realization of the quantum NOT gate {{in terms of the number}} of qubits in the control system under the conservation of the total angular momentum of the computational qubit plus the the control system along the direction used to encode the computational basis. The <b>lower</b> bound turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be more stringent than one might expect from previous results. The new method is expected to lead to more accurate estimates for physical realizations of various types of quantum computations under conservation laws, and to contribute to related problems such as the accuracy of programmable quantum processors.

40|$|On 13 February 2009, a coronal wave – CME – dimming {{event was}} {{observed}} in quadrature by the STEREO spacecraft. We analyze this event using a three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the solar corona. The numerical simulation is driven and constrained by the observations, and indicates where magnetic reconnection occurs between the expanding CME core and surrounding environment. We focus primarily on the <b>lower</b> corona, extending <b>out</b> <b>to</b> 3 R⊙; this range allows simultaneous comparison with both EUVI and COR 1 data. Our simulation produces a diffuse coronal bright front remarkably similar to that observed by STEREO/EUVI at 195 ˚A. It {{is made up of}} two components, and {{is the result of a}} combination of both wave and non-wave mechanisms. The CME becomes large-scale quite low (< 200 Mm) in the corona. It is not, however, an inherently large-scale event; rather, the expansion is facilitated by magnetic reconnection between the expanding CME core and the surrounding magnetic environment. In support of this, we also find numerous secondary dimmings, many far from the initial CME source region. Relating such dimmings to reconnecting field lines within the simulation provides further evidence that CME expansion leads to the “opening ” of coronal field lines on a global scale. Throughout the CME expansion, the coronal wave maps directly to the CME footprint. Our results suggest that the ongoing debate over the “true ” nature of diffuse coronal waves may be mischaracterized. It appears that both wave and non-wave models are required to explain the observations and understand the complex nature of these events...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{applications}} {{require the}} sink to compute {{a function of}} the data collected by the sensors. Instead of sending all the data to the sink, the intermediate nodes could process the data they receive to significantly reduce the volume of traffic transmitted: this is known as in-network computation. Instead of focusing on asymptotic results for large networks as is the current practice, we are interested in explicitly computing the maximum achievable throughput of a given network when the sink is interested in the first M statistical moments of the collected data. Here, the k-th statistical moment is defined as the expectation of the k-th power of the data. Flow models have been routinely used in multi-hop wireless networks when there is no in-network computation and they are typically tractable for relatively large networks. However, deriv-ing such models is not obvious when in-network computation is allowed. We develop a discrete-time model for the real-time network operation and perform two transformations to obtain a flow model that keeps the essence of in-network computa-tion. This gives an upper bound on the maximum achievable throughput. To show its tightness, we derive a numerical lower bound by computing a solution to the discrete-time model based on the solution to the flow model. This <b>lower</b> bound turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be close to the upper bound proving that the flow model is an excellent approximation to the discrete-time model. We then provide several engineering insights on these networks. Index Terms—Sensor networks, in-network computation, throughput, flow model. I...|$|R
