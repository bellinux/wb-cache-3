5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made <b>little</b> <b>distinction</b> between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds.

5|$|Meat ant {{workers may}} be {{confused}} with those of I. lividus, as the two appear similar and are grouped in the same species complex. I. lividus and the much more localised I. spadius can be distinguished from {{other members of the}} I. purpureus group by the shape of the pronotum. Aside from colour differentiation that was a key morphological character to distinguish I. purpureus and the synonym I. greensladei from each other, some meat ant populations exhibit polymorphism despite being monomorphic (occurs in a particular form); specifically, body size among meat ants may vary geographically. For example, those that are found in very hot regions tend to be larger, whereas those found in regions of high humidity tend to be smaller than average. Examined workers once referred to as I. greensladei from southwestern Western Australia have erect setae on the genae (lateral sclerites), whereas those studied elsewhere have glabrous genae, meaning that these areas have no hairs. Such patterns are most likely clinal, where several characteristics may gradually differentiate over a geographical area. The colour of the setae throughout the body and the iridescence may vary geographically. For example, populations restricted to the coasts of Western Australia usually have pale setae, compared to most colonies throughout the country, which have the common blackish setae. In 1993, Shattuck could not separate populations with pale setae when other key diagnostic traits that would separate these populations were not considered. Meat ants from the Western Australian wheatbelt and goldfields show different iridescence; the iridescence in some collected specimens ranged from pale greenish-blue to yellowish-green, especially around the humeri (a structure which forms the basal corner of an insect's wing or wing case) and frons. The variation of the iridescence is, however, a consistent pattern found in other Iridomyrmex species with <b>little</b> <b>distinction,</b> making it a subtle character. The colour variation is less marked in all collected specimens of I. purpureus, as well as its close relative I. viridiaeneus, which is found in dry regions around the south-western regions. Shattuck further notes that populations found throughout the Northern Territory and South Australia have reduced pubescence on the first gastral tergite, but this is different elsewhere.|$|E

Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.|$|E

25|$|While {{technically}} a graphical {{user interface}} is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by {{reducing the number of}} context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. Linux and macOS are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space; however the graphics drawing routines of versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003 exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very <b>little</b> <b>distinction</b> between the interface and the kernel.|$|E

Then the sudden change {{in the construction of the}} last sentence, and the substitution of the name of the person mentioned, for the degree of affinity in which he was supposed to stand to Tom, might be merely a rigid observance of the best tone of society, or it might be equivocal.

25|$|GalÃ¡pagos green turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} and observed in the GalÃ¡pagos {{as far back as}} the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention has been paid to them due to the overwhelming research done on the GalÃ¡pagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the GalÃ¡pagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. It is the only subpopulation of green sea turtle to be given premise for separate species delineation, proposing Chelonia agassizii as a separate species. At this time, no distinctions have been made, mainly due to analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15nesting beaches. This analysis has showed <b>little</b> <b>distinction</b> between the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Murakami {{published}} his âSuperflatâ {{theory in the}} catalogue for a group exhibition {{of the same name}} that he curated for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The theory posits that there is a legacy of flat, 2-dimensional imagery from Japanese art history in manga and anime. This style differentiates itself from the western approach in its emphasis on surface and use of flat planes of color. Superflat also served as a commentary on post-war Japanese society in which, Murakami argues, differences in social class and popular taste have âflattened,â producing a culture with <b>little</b> <b>distinction</b> between âhighâ and âlowâ. The theory provided the context for his work and he elaborated on it with the exhibitions âColoriageâ (2002, Fondation Cartier pour lâart contemporain, Paris) and âLittle Boy: The Arts of Japanâs Exploding Subcultureâ (2005, Japan Society, New York).
