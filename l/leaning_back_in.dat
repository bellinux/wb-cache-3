5|$|The video {{begins with}} showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z {{sitting on a}} chair inside a dark room. Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to {{simultaneously}} play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At {{the end of the}} chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a pose as fireflies race away.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing {{that is going on}} around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes on June 6, {{becoming}} the 12th Triple Crown winner {{and the first}} since 1978, ending a [...] "drought" [...] of 37 years. [...] The horse was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the starting gate when it opened and was a touch late at the start, but he soon pulled out to an early lead, which he maintained for a gate-to-wire win. He steadily increased his lead throughout the race. He was challenged by Materiality until {{the top of the}} stretch when Materiality faded, ultimately finishing last, and Frosted held second although starting to fade at the sixteenth pole. Keen Ice ran {{in the middle of the}} pack until a late rally brought him into third over Mubtaahij, who was fourth. American Pharoah crossed the finish line leading by [...] lengths, with a winning time of 2:26.65 for the [...] race. His margin of victory was the fourth-largest ever for a Triple Crown winner at the Belmont.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rose Danville, {{the court}} is waiting to hear you," [...] said the president, {{crossing}} his legs and <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously <b>in</b> his large armchair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} {{particular}} to write about; and besides, I always intended {{to come back}} to Pisa and see you," [...] answered Brigida, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously <b>in</b> her chair.|$|R
6000|$|Horace--thus far <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> {{carelessly}} <b>in</b> his chair--suddenly raised {{himself and}} exclaimed, [...] "Good heavens! {{can this be}} the woman I saw laid out for dead in the French cottage?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... as strangers went by. [...] We {{stopped by}} a cabin and inquired of an aged woman who sat <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a {{homemade}} hickory chair with {{her feet on the}} rail, how far it was to Greenbriar, which had been designated to us ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his later}} life he painted {{a series of}} [...] picture based on men in mythology: [...] "Prometheus" [...] (1905), [...] "Sokrates and Alkibiades" [...] (1907, 1911), and [...] "Adam in Paradise" [...] (1913–14). [...] The large format [...] "Adam in Paradise" [...] is suggestively homoerotic, with its vital, young, muscular Adam coyly <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a lush, color-drenched botanic paradise, while the snake is arched halfway up his leg, its tongue darting, and Adam conceals himself casually with a sprig of fig leaves.|$|E
60|$|Cornelian {{was proof}} against these shafts; <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> {{gracefully}} <b>in</b> his chair he launched forth into that {{detailed description of}} his last night's attire which the Dawn had so unaccountably failed to supply.|$|R
60|$|Holder {{pushed past}} him {{and looked into the}} carriage. <b>Leaning</b> <b>back,</b> motionless, <b>in</b> the corner of the seat was the figure of a man. For a terrible moment of premonition, of enlightenment, the rector gazed at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you run over, once again, {{what the}} boy said?" [...] asks Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting {{his hands into}} the pockets of his rusty smallclothes and <b>leaning</b> quietly <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R
2500|$|By 1978, Kath was {{regularly}} carrying guns {{around and}} enjoyed playing with them. Around 5 p.m. January 23, after {{a party at}} roadie and band technician Don Johnson's home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, Kath took an unloaded [...]38 revolver {{and put it to}} his head, pulling the trigger several times on the empty chambers. Johnson warned Kath several times to be careful. Kath then picked up a semiautomatic 9mm pistol and, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a chair, said to Johnson, [...] "Don't worry about it... look, the clip is not even in it." [...] To satisfy Johnson's concerns, Kath showed the empty magazine to Johnson. Kath then replaced the magazine in the gun, put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. However, there was a round in the chamber, and Kath died instantly.|$|E
60|$|The A.i. Damyer {{uttered a}} tiny shriek. Cecilia, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her padded corner, glanced askance at Mr. Purcey <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his; an unholy, {{astonished}} little smile played on her lips.|$|E
60|$|And Zero <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} narrated the {{following}} simple tale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Burger, <b>leaning</b> luxuriously <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his settee, {{and puffing}} a blue tree of cigar-smoke into the air, [...] "tell {{me all about}} your {{relations}} with Miss Mary Saunderson." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{this point}} the rower {{is in the same}} {{position}} as the beginning, torso <b>leaning</b> <b>back,</b> hands drawn <b>in</b> to the body, and legs extended.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} kind of hesitating," [...] Mr. Fischer went on, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> once more <b>in</b> his chair. [...] "You want the truth, don't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed at}} him, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her chair with half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Maggie glanced {{towards her}} aunt, who was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her seat.|$|E
60|$|He passed on, and Louise, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her seat, {{closed her}} eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} whispered: [...] "I can't {{seem to make}} out very clear. I guess I {{got to take a}} little time to it," [...] he added, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> wearily <b>in</b> his chair. [...] "Ever seen much of the manifestations?" [...] he gasped at Westover.|$|R
60|$|They {{came to the}} rim of Wild Water canyon. <b>Leaning</b> far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> their saddles, they {{slid the}} horses down a steep declivity, through big spruce woods, to an ancient and all but obliterated trail.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, hardly," [...] he answered, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously <b>in</b> his arm-chair, {{and sending}} up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. [...] "For example, {{observation}} shows {{me that you}} have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram." ...|$|R
60|$|Immelan was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, gazing steadfastly {{across the}} crowded theatre.|$|E

6000|$|The sheriff, <b>leaning</b> far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the big Morris chair, wore a smirking smile {{which seemed}} to say: [...] "Boys, I'm onto this luxury all right. Stuffed chair don't get me no back-ache. Nothing's too rich for my blood--if I can get it." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{an amateur}} concert for a commendable {{purpose in the}} Vancouver opera-house, which, since the {{inhabitants}} of the mountain province do not expect any organized body to take over their individual responsibilities, was a somewhat unusual event, and Miss Barbara Heathcote, who had not as yet found it particularly entertaining, was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> languidly <b>in</b> her chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jean Baptiste Greuze," [...] Holmes continued, joining {{his finger}} tips and <b>leaning</b> well <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, [...] "was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, {{of course to}} his working career. Modern {{criticism}} has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries." ...|$|R
60|$|Both {{departed}} {{to perform}} these behests, and, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her chair, Aunt Kipp reposed.|$|E
60|$|I {{bowed and}} {{returned}} to my seat. Blenavon was <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, smoking thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned over}} the pages lazily, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar.|$|E
60|$|Bradley helped Ida {{to lay off}} her cloak. It was {{incredible}} what pleasure it gave him to do these little things for her. He left her {{a few minutes to}} go out and look up the matter of the team. When he returned he found Ida <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> wearily <b>in</b> a big chair, her face very grave and pale. He told her that a team would be ready soon.|$|R
60|$|Lakamba's lips moved inaudibly. The man who {{had just}} spoken was again deeply absorbed in the game going on at his feet; and the chief--as if he had {{forgotten}} all about it already--sat with a stolid face amongst his silent followers, <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> squarely <b>in</b> his chair, {{his hands on the}} arms of his seat, his knees apart, his big blood-shot eyes blinking solemnly, as if dazzled by the noble vacuity of his thoughts.|$|R
60|$|When I {{entered the}} room I found Jessie <b>leaning</b> <b>back</b> languidly <b>in</b> her largest arm-chair, {{watching}} the raindrops dripping down the window-pane. The unfortunate box of novels was open by her side, and the books were lying, for the most part, strewed about {{on the ground at}} her feet. One volume lay open, back upward, on her lap, and her hands were crossed over it listlessly. To my great dismay, she was yawning--palpably and widely yawning--when I came in.|$|R
