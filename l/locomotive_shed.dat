25|$|The <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> {{was capable}} of holding four {{locomotives}} and held an inspection pit. Steam and smoke was carried away {{from the inside of}} the shed by a system of wooden troughs hanging suspended from the roof over the centre of the tracks and leading, sloping upwards, to wooden chimneys. The fumes would otherwise erode the iron roof supports.|$|E

25|$|Hubli is the {{commercial}} hub of Karnataka, {{it has a}} wide cluster of industries and {{has more than a}} lakh small and medium industries. The Government of India has set up a Software Technology park of India on Pune–Bangalore Road and Aryabhata Tech Park in Navanagar region of Hubli. The city is situated on the dividing line between Malnad and the Deccan plateau. Malnad is well known for its forests and forest-based industries and the other three sides are known for their agricultural products including cotton, groundnut and oil seeds, besides manganese ore and granite. The establishment of new-generation diesel <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> in the city by Indian Railways was another major boost for development of Industries in this region as this was first of its kind in Indian Railways history. The diesel <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> at Hubli is the largest holder of EMD locomotive in India and was set up in 1880. The agricultural produce market of Hubli at Amargol {{is one of the largest}} markets in Asia and the cotton market of Hubli is among the largest in India.Wallace Laboratories Pvt.

St Philip's Marsh closed to steam in June 1964. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>sheds</b> were subsequently demolished and the site disconnected from the rail network west of Albert Crescent by the 1970s. The site of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>sheds</b> has been redeveloped as a fruit market.|$|R
25|$|The D {{terminus}} was on {{the eastern}} side of Barnstaple in Devon. The long single platform {{was on the}} north side of the line; the track on the south side of this was mainly used for the arrivals while a shorter track on the north side used for departures. The passenger building was wooden. An extensive goods yard with a large stone goods shed was on the south side of the station, while at the eastern end of this was the small <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> and turntable.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} two-road <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> (code number 75F) {{was capable}} of accommodating six engines and situated {{to the south of}} the station. It was opened in 1866 and replaced in 1891 by a larger four-road shed located to the north-west of the station. Following bomb damage on 20 November 1940 during the Second World War, the slate roof of the engine shed was replaced with corrugated asbestos. It was closed to steam locos in June 1965 but the tracks were used for storage of engineers rolling stock until the late 1970s when they were removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{trackbed}} to {{the east}} of Station Road in East Grinstead to the Lewes Road tunnel was taken over by the A22 road as a relief road, with the two tunnels being opened out. The station's goods yard area was also eaten up by the A22 which carved a path running parallel with Railway Approach. This required the removal of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> which was demolished in 1976 despite the efforts of the East Grinstead Society which had attempted to raise funds for its preservation as a drama and arts workshop.|$|E

25|$|The main {{locomotive}} {{works are}} located at Bridgnorth. It is not normally {{open to the}} public but conducted tours and open days are arranged from time to time. Major features of the locomotive works include the boiler shop equipped with overhead crane, Noble and Lund wheel lathe, ex-LT lifting jacks and a Wheeldrop recovered from Leicestershire, installed in 2010. Works to enclose the southern end of Bridgnorth <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> with roller shutter doors, improve natural illumination and waterproof the building more effectively were completed in early 2009. This forms the first of a number of phases to improve the Bridgnorth site both for staff and for visitors.|$|E
25|$|This was not {{too much}} of a problem while the station {{was at the end of}} the line, but on 30 May 1846 the South Devon Railway (SDR) opened a line westwards towards Plymouth. A {{carriage}} shed was built for the SDR at the south end of the B platform but the goods sheds and locomotive sheds for both companies were to the west, between the station and the River Exe. The SDR was designed to be worked by atmospheric power and an engine house was built on the banks of the river near the <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed.</b> This was only used for its original purpose for about a year but was not demolished until many years later.|$|E
25|$|A Drewery rail tractor {{was based}} at Lyttelton in 1936 {{for a trial}} period {{to be used for}} {{shunting}} operations. Members of the shunting staff based at Lyttelton were trained in its use by the locomotive staff, with maintenance carried out by the traffic staff. The tractor was stored in the steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> and was used, for the purposes of evaluation, for as much of the shunting work as possible {{to reduce the amount of}} time the steam locomotives were required for the work. Later, diesel locomotives began to make their presence felt at Lyttelton, and in 1969 four Hitachi rail tractors were assigned there. However, steam locomotives were still used for the South Island Limited at Lyttelton until the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, the ex-Cambrian {{network of}} Western Region was {{transferred}} to the London Midland Region. A question mark hung over the VoR's future for some time, until the Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, confirmed that it would remain open and in British Rail's hands. In 1968, the line was rerouted in Aberystwyth to run into the former standard gauge Carmarthen line platforms of the main station, which had been abandoned in 1964. This meant that the route of the line no longer dog-legged and did not have to cross Park Avenue by a level crossing. The former standard gauge <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> was also refurbished and adapted into use for the VoR. The former station site is now occupied by a supermarket and the former route was sold for redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|A private {{attempt was}} made in the 1960s to {{preserve}} a Z class, BR no 30952 with the intention to locate it on the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. The locomotive was withdrawn from service in November 1962 and stored in working order at Exmouth Junction <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> until the Spring of 1963. It was then moved to Fratton MPD where it was stored for the remainder of 1963 and most of 1964. Eventually the preservation attempt failed, and the locomotive was on the scrap line at Eastleigh Works, with coupling rods removed and tied to one side, by October 1964. It was at Bristol (Barrow Road) MPD for a short period early in 1965 while on its way to South Wales for scrapping. It was cut up at Cashmores of Newport in May 1965.|$|E
25|$|At Pateley Bridge, the Nidd Valley Light Railway {{station was}} to the north west of the Nidd Valley Railway station, close to the River Nidd. The two were {{connected}} by a single track which crossed a level crossing. There were a series of sidings immediately after the level crossing, with the station and more sidings beyond that. A carriage shed and a <b>locomotive</b> <b>shed</b> were located a little further along {{the valley of the}} Nidd. Best built two-storey stone buildings for the stations at Pateley Bridge, Wath, Ramsgill and Lofthouse. He built a signal box at Pateley Bridge, with the other stations having ground frames and simple signalling. Operation of the line was controlled by the Tyer's Electric Train Tablet system, and six machines were ordered at a cost of £360. Both intermediate stations had goods sidings on {{the eastern side of the}} main track, while Lofthouse had a passing loop and sidings to the west.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>locomotive</b> <b>sheds</b> and {{maintenance}} workshops were also at this location. The workshops {{were capable of}} very heavy repair work and the manufacture of carriages [...] - [...] {{the distance from the}} mainland made the railway very self-sufficient.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} a single track, and most {{services}} (which began from Hulme End, where the <b>locomotive</b> <b>sheds</b> were) only involved the use of one engine in steam. There was passing loop at Wetton Mill, {{but it was never}} used as such.|$|R
50|$|Like all <b>locomotive</b> <b>sheds,</b> ERS does regular maintenance, {{overhaul}} {{and repair}} including painting and washing of locomotives. It not only attends to locomotives housed at ERS but to ones coming in from other sheds as well. It has four pit lines for loco repair.|$|R
