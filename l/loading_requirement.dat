30|$|For {{this purpose}} we {{base on the}} values of Schuller et al. (2015) and assume a maximum loading {{capacity}} of P̂= 10 kW and a <b>loading</b> <b>requirement</b> of Wte= 30 kWh. We simulate 35, 040 charging processes for all quarter-hours in 2017. Each charging process is conducted based on the three charging algorithms and five flexibility classes h. The flexibility classes represent different temporal flexibility of the BEV users: The immediate charging (h= 3 : 00 h) {{is used as a}} benchmark (Ai) and a temporal flexibility of up to h= 8 : 00 h (e.g., charging overnight) are investigated.|$|E

Limits and influential factors are analysed against statistical evidence from vehicle dynamics measurement. Additional load combinations are presented as potentially relevant for track design. Discussion are made on the potential reduction of load from improved vehicle performance and slab track improved geometry, areas which might bear some benefits in terms of cost reduction for future slab track designs.

40|$|Abstract—We aim {{to enhance}} the {{end-to-end}} rate of a general dual-hop relay network with multiple channels and finite modulation formats, by jointly optimizing channel pairing, power allocation, and integer bit loading. Such an optimization problem has both a discrete feasible region, due to the combinatoric nature of channel pairing, and a discrete objective, due to the bit <b>loading</b> <b>requirement.</b> For this type of mixed-integer programming problems, the Lagrange dual method generally is inapplicable, due to the non-zero duality gap. However, by exploring the structure of our problem, {{we are able to}} bound the gap to within one bit, allowing the extraction of an exact optimal integer solution. We further present complexity reduction techniques, and demonstrate that the proposed solution only requires a computational complexity that is polynomial in the number of channels, realizing efficient implementation in practical systems. Through numerical experiments, we show that the jointly optimal solution can significantly outperform common sub-optimal alternatives. I...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of design in}} aerospace composites is to minimize weight for a given <b>loading</b> <b>requirement.</b> For thin laminates subject to compression, this means ensuring sufficient buckling stiffness whilst maintaining material strength {{in the presence of}} in-service damage. In effect, stress levels (i. e. applied running load/laminate thickness) are maximized subject to buckling and strength requirements. Where buckling stresses for lightly loaded (thin) panels are relatively low, increased stiffening could be used to reduce effective panel widths but this comes with increased manufacturing costs. A new manufacturing technique which incorporates in-plane steering of fibres to achieve curved, elastically tailored tows is shown to offer improved efficiency by increasing the load carried in the vicinity of supports. However, such design needs to satisfy damage tolerance requirements. The use of a simple, analytical approach to damage tolerance enables the selection of optimum stacking sequences for which effective stress levels may approach those in high strength aluminium alloy...|$|E

40|$|Dna 2 endonuclease/helicase {{participates in}} {{eukaryotic}} DNA transactions including cleavage of long flaps generated during Okazaki fragment processing. Its unusual substrate interaction consists of recognition and binding of the flap base, then threading over the 5 ′-end of the flap, and cleaving periodically {{to produce a}} terminal product ∼ 5 nt in length. Blocking the 5 ′-end prevents cleavage. The Dna 2 ATP-driven 5 ′ to 3 ′ DNA helicase function promotes motion of Dna 2 on the flap, presumably aiding its nuclease function. Here we demonstrate using two different nuclease-dead Dna 2 mutants that on substrates simulating Okazaki fragments, Dna 2 must thread onto an unblocked 5 ′ flap to display helicase activity. This requirement is maintained on substrates with single-stranded regions thousands of nucleotides in length. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} description of a eukaryotic helicase that cannot load onto its tracking strand internally but instead must enter from the end. Biologically, the <b>loading</b> <b>requirement</b> likely helps the helicase to coordinate with the Dna 2 nuclease function to prevent creation of undesirably long flaps during DNA transactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{transverse}} <b>loading</b> <b>requirement</b> for stoppings as {{specified in}} the current Code of Federal Regulations is 39 psf. This measure is based on physical testing of a freestanding wall in accordance with ASTM E 72 specifications, where the dominant parameter is the tensile strength of the sealant. A new protocol based on arching has been developed to determine the true transverse load capacity of stoppings. Arching is achieved by the restraint of the stopping against the mine roof and floor, whereby compressive forces are developed within the wall. A laboratory procedure using the NIOSH Mine Roof Simulator (MRS) to simulate rigid-arching of stoppings was developed and verified through full-scale in-mine tests. Using this protocol, a systematic study of the design parameters that affect arching capability in block stoppings was conducted. The study included a theoretical assessment of arching and development of design formulations that can accurately define the transverse load capacity of various stopping constructions under various loading conditions. This approach should lead to a safer mine environment by matching the transverse load capabilities of the stopping design to the requirements in the mine to ensure proper ventilation control is maintained...|$|E

This paper examines the load feature and its influence using Lorenz curve and Gini index. Lorenz curve can describe the load distribution among zones or times graphically, and Gini index can identify the unevenness degree in a quantitative way. Different Gini indexes, which correspond to different load features, are compared to reveal the influence of load features on the supply, distribution and adjustment process in HVAC systems. Higher Gini index reveals that the <b>load</b> <b>requirements</b> distribute un-evenly among zones and along times, which usually leads to the oversupply, the loss of distri-bution power, the entransy dissipation and a lower heating/cooling source efficiency...|$|R
