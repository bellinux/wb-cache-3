Proposals for reform range from a broad tax base {{in the sense of}} an origin-based value-added tax to a pure profit tax that could be implemented as a surcharge on corporation and personal income tax. <b>Local</b> <b>business</b> taxation systems in OECD countries actually represent the whole spectrum between these two extremes.

40|$|The {{theory of}} fiscal {{federalism}} argues that local governments should only tax mobile tax bases {{for the purpose}} of charging user taxes which correct for congestion effects. Empirically, we observe that local governments do levy taxes on mobile bases. In Germany, this is the <b>local</b> <b>business</b> tax (Gewerbesteuer). Since such taxes are efficient only if they are raised to cover congestion effects, the justification for these taxes usually put forward is that they serve as user taxes. This paper tests empirically whether that justification holds for the case of German <b>local</b> <b>business</b> taxes. Our findings do not support the user tax argument. Instead, our results suggest that local governments use the <b>local</b> <b>business</b> tax as a source of revenue for general public expenditures. Our empirical analysis finds statistically significant positive effects of changes in expenditures for social assistance and interest payments on subsequent tax rate changes. Our results are thus consistent with the view prevailing in the literature according to which <b>local</b> <b>business</b> tax rates are set in response to general financial pressure in local government budgets.
