40|$|AbstractIn {{the adult}} cerebellum, basket/stellate cells are {{scattered}} throughout the ML, but {{little is known about}} the process underlying the cell dispersion. To determine the allocation of stellate/basket cells within the ML, we examined their migration in the early postnatal mouse cerebellum. We found that after entering the ML, basket/stellate cells sequentially exhibit four distinct phases of migration. First, the cells migrated radially from the bottom to the top while exhibiting saltatory movement with a single <b>leading</b> process (<b>Phase</b> I). Second, the cells turned at the top and migrated tangentially in a rostro-caudal direction, with an occasional reversal of the direction of migration (Phase II). Third, the cells turned and migrated radially within the ML at a significantly reduced speed while repeatedly extending and withdrawing the <b>leading</b> processes (<b>Phase</b> III). Fourth, the cells turned at the middle and migrated tangentially at their slowest speed, while extending several dendrite-like processes after having completely withdrawn the <b>leading</b> process (<b>Phase</b> IV). Finally, the cells stopped and completed their migration. These results suggest that the dispersion of basket/stellate cells in the ML is controlled by the orchestrated activity of external guidance cues, cell–cell contact and intrinsic programs in a position- and time-dependent manner...|$|R

A resting potential of almost 40 mv (cytoplasm negative) is maintained by the extracellular organic anions (volatile fatty acids) found in the perienteric fluid.

Accordingly, we tested ARR 4 {{and other members of the}} type-A ARR family for roles in clock function and show that ARR 4 and its closest relative, ARR 3, act redundantly in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian system.
