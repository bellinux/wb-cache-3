2500|$|During September, {{when the}} Poles had gained an upper hand and were {{pursuing}} the Soviets {{back to the}} east, Soviet forces moved through Lithuanian-controlled territory at will, but Polish forces that tried to pursue them were arrested and interned. Lithuania's declared neutrality was challenged by Poland, which accused Lithuania of allowing free Soviet passage through its territory. Lithuania could not deny this. The treaty did not create a formal military alliance between the Soviets and Lithuanians, but diminished Lithuania's standing as a neutral state. Łossowski has written that Lithuania's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> towards Poland was such that [...] "the Polish government could have with full justification treated Lithuania as a country participating {{in the war on}} the other side, with all of its political and legal implications." [...] Historian Alfred E.

A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> net <b>neutrality</b> could negatively impact libraries, intellectual freedom, cultural diversity, and the right to privacy. This paper looks at the issues that underline the net neutrality debate and describes how they are shaped by the different actors that are concerned with the future of the Internet.

Finally, the paper reviews the recent CRTC policy on Internet Traffic Management Practices...|$|R
50|$|Net {{neutrality}} proponents {{claim that}} telecom companies seek {{to impose a}} tiered service model {{in order to control}} the pipeline and thereby remove competition, create artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise noncompetitive services. Many believe net neutrality to be primarily important for the preservation of current internet freedoms; a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> net <b>neutrality</b> would allow Internet service providers, such as Comcast, to extract payment from content providers like Netflix, and these charges would ultimately be passed on to consumers. Prominent supporters <b>of</b> net <b>neutrality</b> include Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol, Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the Web, law professor Tim Wu, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Tumblr founder David Karp, and Last Week Tonight host John Oliver. Organizations and companies that support net neutrality include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, and others.|$|R

Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with {{new types of}} theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging. As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and Shaw, arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{concerns}} arise about the integrity and fairness of the taxation regime where charitable organizations, which avail themselves of the tax exemption status while undertaking commercial activities, compete directly with the for-profit sector. The appropriateness of the tax concessions granted to charitable organizations is considered in respect of income derived from commercial activities. It is principally argued that the traditional line of reasoning for imposing limitations on tax concessions focuses on an incorrect underlying inquiry. Traditionally, it {{is argued that}} limitations should be imposed because <b>of</b> unfair competition, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> competitive <b>neutrality,</b> or an arbitrary decision relating to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> deserving. However, {{it is argued that}} a more appropriate question from which to base any limitations is one which considers the value attached to the integrity of the taxation regime as a whole, and the tax base specifically compared to the public good of charities. When the correct underlying question is asked, sound taxation policy ensues, as a less arbitrary approach may be adopted to limit the scope of tax concessions available to charitable organizations. ...|$|R

40|$|Pakistan {{inherited}} the British Weberian model at its birth in 1947 (Braibanti, 1966). The Weberian framework {{is the basis}} of the professional code of the Pakistani bureaucracy. The Framework highlights the importance <b>of</b> gender <b>neutrality</b> towards ensuring impartiality, promotion of merit and efficiency in organizations. The Pakistani bureaucracy has been categorized as being Weberian by recent research, and hence should be gender neutral. This paper examines if the Pakistani bureaucracy is indeed gender neutral. It inspects the gender norms prevalent {{in the context of the}} macro sociocultural environment in Pakistan and finds that these norms are reflected in women’s position in the bureaucracy. Using the perceptions of male and female bureaucrats and ministers as symptomatic evidence, the research deliberates on how the socially determined status hierarchies interact with organizational rules and regulations to perpetuate gender bias and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>neutrality</b> within the bureaucracy. The paper concludes by reinforcing that the bureaucracy operates in a larger social and cultural environment, which is unable to be a socially transformative agent in the case of Pakistan, and hence, is not gender neutral and by consequence, not Weberian...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{disparities in}} local education expenditures at the settlement and school level n Hungary. It is shown that local average income, {{which is a}} major element of the local government budget constraint, has a strong impact on school expenditures, especially in towns. This <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>neutrality</b> implies that settlements with a higher share of socially disadvantaged children spend somewhat less on education. In case of towns, this between settlement effect is offset by within settlement disparities in expenditures: schools with relatively more disadvantaged pupils {{tend to have a}} larger budget compared to other schools of the same town. Considering village and town schools together indicates, that the higher is the share of poor children in a school, the lower are per capita expenditures on average. Though the magnitude of the effect is small, it reveals a fundamental equity problem. While the successful education of disadvantaged pupils might require substantial additional resources, the pubic education system in Hungary can not provide school with these resources now...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{correlations}} between rings in random network glasses in two dimensions {{as a function of}} their separation. Initially, we use the topological separation (measured by the number of intervening rings), but this leads to pseudo-long-range correlations due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> topological charge <b>neutrality</b> in the shells surrounding a central ring. This effect is associated with the non-circular nature of the shells. It is, therefore, necessary to use the geometrical distance between ring centers. Hence we find a generalization of the Aboav-Weaire law out to larger distances, with {{the correlations between}} rings decaying away when two rings are more than about 3 rings apart.

40|$|We {{consider}} an extended Nambu [...] Jona-Lasinio model including both (q q̅) - and (qq) -interactions with two light-quark flavors {{in the presence}} of a single (quark density) chemical potential. In the color superconducting phase of the quark matter the color SU(3) symmetry is spontaneously broken down to SU(2). If the usual counting of Goldstone bosons would apply, five Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons corresponding to the five broken color generators should appear in the mass spectrum. Unlike that expectation, we find only three gapless diquark excitations of quark matter. One of them is an SU(2) -singlet, the remaining two form an SU(2) -(anti) doublet and have a quadratic dispersion law in the small momentum limit. These results are in agreement with the Nielsen-Chadha theorem, according to which NG-bosons in Lorentz-noninvariant systems, having a quadratic dispersion law, must be counted differently. The origin of the abnormal number of NG-bosons is shown to be related to a nonvanishing expectation value of the color charge operator Q_ 8 reflecting the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> color <b>neutrality</b> <b>of</b> the ground state. Finally, by requiring color neutrality, two massive diquarks are argued to become massless, resulting in a normal number of five NG-bosons with usual linear dispersion laws.

40|$|The {{classical}} system of taxation, whereby companies are taxed without a deduction for dividends paid and shareholders are taxed on their dividend receipts, results in double taxation of dividends. Split rate and imputation {{systems have been}} developed {{in an attempt to}} mitigate the effects of double taxation of dividends. Double taxation of dividends and differences between corporate and maximum individual marginal tax rates result in corporate tax systems lacking neutrality. Distortions arise between organisational forms, between debt and equity financing and between the retention and distribution of profits. Various methods of integrating corporate and individual taxes have been advocated to overcome the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> caused by corporate taxes. Following the introduction of the South African Income Tax Act in 1914, a number of taxes relating to dividends have existed. These have included a Dividend Tax, Non-resident Shareholder's Tax, Undistributed Profits Tax and Secondary Tax on Companies, hereafter referred to as STC. STC is a tax on net dividends declared and results in distributed income being taxed at higher rates than retained income. Despite the implementation of group relief provisions, STC results in an inhibition on the reinvestment of profits {{within the context of a}} group of companies. It is also a major cause of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> of the South African corporate tax system. As a result of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> and inhibition of group reinvestment caused by STC, a full imputation system is suggested as an alternative to replace STC. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} why Turkey has failed to develop and consolidate democracy in the regime. The aim {{of this paper was}} to analyze Turkey’s movement towards an authoritarian regime by examining institutions, the military, civil society and other contextual factors from 2004 to 2016. The method that was applied to this study was a case study were theories about democracy and transition were used to analyze Turkey’s declining development of democracy. The results show that several cases of corruption and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> political <b>neutrality</b> within important institutions have had a negative impact on the regime. The military’s influence on the political power has decreased although the military still has a significant role within the regime. The right to express your word of opinion by taking part in demonstrations is strictly constrained due to reforms by the government. Conflicts between the PKK movement and the Turkish government has contributed to the unstable political situation in the country. One can draw the conclusion that all of these factors have had an impact on Turkey’s development towards an authoritarian regime, but unprecedented behavior within the institutions, an authoritarian leadership by the president and increasing religious influence have had the greatest impact on Turkey’s way towards an undemocratic governance. ...|$|R

It concentrated on internal industrial development and political reform, and building up its great international holdings, the British Empire, while maintaining by far the world's strongest Navy to protect its island home and its many overseas possessions. It had come dangerously close to intervening in the American Civil War in 1861-62, and in May 1871 it signed the Treaty of Washington with the United States that put into arbitration the American claims that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> British <b>neutrality</b> had prolong the war; arbitrators eventually awarded the United States $15 million. [...] Russia {{took advantage of the}} Franco-German war to renounce the 1856 treaty in which it had been forced to demilitarize the Black Sea. Repudiation of treaties was unacceptable to the powers, so the solution was a conference in January 1871 at London that formally abrogated key elements of the 1856 treaty and endorsed the new Russian action. Russia had always wanted control of Constantinople and the straits the connected the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and would nearly achieve that in the First World War. [...] France had long stationed an army in Rome to protect the pope; it recalled the soldiers in 1870, and the Kingdom of Italy moved in, seized the remaining papal territories, and made Rome its capital city.

40|$|Abstract. The effect <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> on {{evolutionary}} {{search is}} known to be crucially dependent on the distribution of genotypes over pheno-types. Quantitatively characterizing robustness and evolvability in geno-type and phenotype spaces greatly helps to understand the influence <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> on Genetic Programming. Most existing robustness and evolv-ability studies focus on mutations with a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> investigation of recombi-national operations. Here, we extend a previously proposed quantitative approach of measuring mutational robustness and evolvability in Linear GP. By considering a simple LGP system that has a compact representa-tion and enumerable genotype and phenotype spaces, we quantitatively characterize the robustness and evolvability of recombination at the phe-notypic level. In this simple yet representative LGP system, we show that recombinational properties are correlated with mutational proper-ties. Utilizing a population evolution experiment, we demonstrate that recombination significantly accelerates the evolutionary search process and particularly promotes robust phenotypes that innovative phenotypic explorations...|$|R
