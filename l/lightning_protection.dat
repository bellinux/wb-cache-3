5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, <b>lightning</b> <b>protection,</b> and recyclability.|$|E
25|$|Copper roofs {{may be used}} as part of a <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> scheme {{where the}} copper skin, gutters and {{rainwater}} pipes can be linked and bonded to an earth termination facility. The thickness of copper specified for roofing materials is usually adequate for <b>lightning</b> <b>protection.</b> A dedicated <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system may be recommended to adequate <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> with an installed copper roof system. The system would include air terminals and intercepting conductors on the roof, a system of ground electrodes, and a system of down-conductors connecting the roof and ground components. It is recommended that the copper roof be bonded to the system of conductors. Bonding ensures that the conductors and roof remain at equipotential and reduce side flashing and possible roof damage.|$|E
25|$|Steel framed {{structures}} can bond the structural members to earth to provide <b>lightning</b> <b>protection.</b> A metal flagpole with its foundation {{in the earth}} is its own extremely simple <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system. However, the flag(s) flying from the pole during a lightning strike may be completely incinerated.|$|E
25|$|Copper and its alloys are {{the most}} common {{materials}} used in residential <b>lightning</b> <b>protections,</b> however in industrial, chemically corrosive environments, the copper may need to be clad in tin. Copper effectively facilitates the transmission of lightning energy to the ground because of its excellent electrical conductivity. Also, it bends easily compared to other conductor materials.|$|R

25|$|<b>Lightning</b> <b>protection</b> {{systems are}} used to prevent or lessen {{lightning}} strike damage to structures. <b>Lightning</b> <b>protection</b> systems mitigate the fire hazard which lightning strikes pose to structures. A <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system provides a low-impedance path for the lightning current to lessen the heating effect of current flowing through flammable structural materials. If lightning travels through porous and water-saturated materials, these materials may literally explode if their water content is flashed to steam by heat produced from the high current. This is why trees are often shattered by lightning strikes.|$|E
25|$|A <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> {{system is}} {{designed}} to protect a structure from damage due to lightning strikes by intercepting such strikes and safely passing their extremely high currents to ground. A <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system includes a network of air terminals, bonding conductors, and ground electrodes {{designed to provide a}} low impedance path to ground for potential strikes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lightning</b> <b>protection</b> for {{aircraft}} {{is provided by}} mounting devices on the aircraft structure. The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a static discharger. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage field form an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. <b>Lightning</b> <b>protection</b> means {{for aircraft}} include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{precautions}} must {{be taken}} to prevent side-flashes between conductive objects on or in the structure and the <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system. The surge of lightning current through a <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> conductor will create a voltage difference between it and any conductive objects that are near it. This voltage difference can be large enough to cause a dangerous side-flash (spark) between the two that can cause significant damage, especially on structures housing flammable or explosive materials. The most effective way to prevent this potential damage is to ensure the electrical continuity between the <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system and any objects susceptible to a side-flash. Effective bonding will allow the voltage potential of the two objects to rise and fall simultaneously, thereby eliminating any risk of a side-flash.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{structure}} vulnerable to lightning is a wooden barn. When lightning strikes the barn, the wooden structure and its contents may be ignited by the heat generated by lightning current conducted through parts of the structure. A basic <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system would provide a conductive path between an air terminal and earth, so {{that most of the}} lightning's current will follow the path of the <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system, with substantially less current traveling through flammable materials.|$|E

25|$|In a <b>{{lightning}}</b> <b>protection</b> system, {{a lightning}} rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods {{is that they are}} all made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in <b>lightning</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lightning</b> <b>protection</b> {{systems are}} {{designed}} to mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the self-inductance and skin effect.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{material}} {{is used to}} make up <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> systems, so it is prudent to consider carefully where an air terminal will provide the greatest protection.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Earlier {{airplane}} fuselages were made primarily of aluminum alloy sheets, which have very good electrical conductivity. If lightning strikes an aluminum alloy surface, the current generated by the lightning can easily flow without interruption or diversion to {{the interior of the}} aircraft. Today, fiber-reinforced polymer composites have been widely utilized in aircraft. In order to protect fiber-reinforced composites against lightning strikes, copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) meshes or metal sheets are used in the uppermost layer. As it is known, carbon fibers are nobler than both Cu and Al meshes, resulting in galvanic corrosion when these dissimilar materials interact with each other under certain environmental conditions. Consequently, corroded metal mesh areas will lose conductivity on the composite surface. For this reason, <b>lightning</b> strike <b>protection</b> is vitally important for the new generation of composite aircraft. In the present study, we systematically studied the galvanic corrosion effects of carbon fibers and metal (Al and Cu) meshes in acidic and salty conditions. We found that environmental conditions had a big impact on the galvanic corrosion between carbon fibers and metal meshes used for fiber-reinforced composites. This paper discusses current <b>lightning</b> strike <b>protection</b> techniques and provides some experimental evidence of graphene and indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) -based nanocomposite coatings on carbon fiber-reinforced composites. This approach may overcome the problem of lightning strikes on composite aircraft and may be useful for redesigning the new generation of composite aircraft...|$|R
50|$|However, a major {{drawback}} with CFRPs {{for primary}} structural applications is their low toughness and damage tolerance. Epoxy resins are brittle and have poor impact strength {{and resistance to}} crack propagation, resulting in unsatisfactory levels of robustness and reliability. This results in designs with large margins of safety and complex inspection operations. In addition, by increasing the relative fraction of composite components within new aircraft, challenges regarding electrical conductivity have arisen such as <b>lightning</b> strike <b>protection,</b> static discharge, electrical bonding and grounding, interference shielding and current return through the structure. These drawbacks can be solved {{by the use of}} emerging technologies such as nanocomposites, which combine mechanical, electrical and thermal properties.|$|R
25|$|Some {{structures}} are inherently {{more or less}} {{at risk of being}} struck by lightning. The risk for a structure {{is a function of the}} size (area) of a structure, the height, and the number of lightning strikes per year per mi² for the region. For example, a small building will be less likely to be struck than a large one, and a building in an area with a high density of lightning strikes will be more likely to be struck than one in an area with a low density of lightning strikes. The National Fire Protection Agency provides a risk assessment worksheet in their <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> standard.|$|E
25|$|Objects {{struck by}} {{lightning}} experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude. The heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk. As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt, forming tubular structures called fulgurites. Even though roughly 90 percent of people {{struck by lightning}} survive, humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage. Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Lightning also serves {{an important role in}} the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.|$|E

The wall sheathing was usually vertically boarded but may be studded with the wall boards installed horizontally. Barns may be left unpainted or painted, most commonly an inexpensive red color. Ventilation was desired in barns so the walls were sometimes left without siding or covered with wood shingles or clapboards and then asphalt shingles. The New England barn may have been ornamented in an architectural style to match the farmhouse. Ventilators and cupolas were added to some barns in the 19th century to improve ventilation. <b>Lightning</b> <b>protection</b> systems were often strung along the roof ridge in intercept lightning strikes and prevent fire. New England barns are usually a type of bank barn, built into the side of a hill giving ground level access to one side, but a ramp or rarely a bridge were used to access the doors.
