40|$|The {{influence}} of the geometry of the hitch on the behaviour of the tractor and of the implement is theoretically analysed. Three-point hitches are compared to one-point hitches. In the vertical plane the possibility, when a three-point hitch is used, to position the virtual <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> very low and very {{far ahead of the}} implement is found to be advantageous, together with its property to allow easy adjustment of the position of the virtual <b>hitch</b> <b>point.</b> In the horizontal plane, the tractional <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> of a three-point hitch normally does not coincide with its directional <b>hitch</b> <b>point.</b> When a one-point hitch is used the tractional and the directional <b>hitch</b> <b>points</b> coincide. This very fundamental difference gives the three-point hitch some unique properties. Equations describing the angle deflection and the lateral deflection of both directional and non-directional implements are presented. They show that a non-directional implement's lateral deflection as well as its angle deflection when used on a hillside or when asymmetrically loaded, normally are much smaller when a three-point hitch is used than when a one-point hitch is used. An equation is also presented describing the return of an implement after a lateral deflection. The theory of a laterally mobile, but stable, front-mounted three-point hitch is presented...|$|R

40|$|Stability {{criteria}} of front-mounted lateral movable three-point hitches {{have been known}} for several years. The steering ability of the tractor will be improved by this kind of implement hitch, compared with an implement hitch unable to move sideways. This is applicable particularly when a soil-working implement is used. There are several other advantages with front-mounted lateral movable three-point hitches. In spite of all advantages, this kind of implement hitch is not used in practice. This work shows that the lateral motion of front-mounted directional implements mostly follows the simplified theory proposed by Jönsson (1983). Also the lateral motion of front- mounted non-directional implements follows the simplified theory, provided that the area within which the non-directional hitch-point is moving can be approximated by a point. Another necessary requirement for the simplified {{theory is that the}} friction in the links can be neglected. According to the simplified theory, directional implements are moving towards the directional hitch-point and non-directional implements are moving towards the non-directional hitch-point. The lateral disturbances, are exponentially reduced according to the equation (Jönsson, 1983) : Ls = Ls 0 ∙e^-(x/Lh) where Ls side disturbance X travelled distance Lh hitch length The simplified theory assumes that the areas within which the <b>hitch</b> <b>points</b> are moving, when implements are moving laterally, can be approximated by points. This assumption implies that the hitch length can be approximated as constant. This approximation was shown to be fulfilled when the implement was mounted on a rear-mounted three-point hitch. In this case, the force in the upper link was relatively small. This was shown by a study of two different pulled non-directional implements. One implement with a draught force in the upper link and one with a compressive force in the upper link. The return of the implement from the lateral disturbance was almost similar for both implements. Thus, small variations in the upper link force were shown to have only minor influence on the lateral motion of the implement. To get front-mounted three-point linkages laterally stable and self-centring a large draught force in the upper link is required. This complicates the application of the simplified theory to front-mounted laterally movable three-point hitches, because the simplified theory has so far neglected the influence of the force in the upper link. The influence of different hitch geometry variables on the areas, within which the <b>hitch</b> <b>points</b> move when the implement moves laterally, has been studied in this work. For laterally stable implement-hitch combinations it is normally possible to approximate the area, within which the directional <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> moves, by a point. The area, within which the non-directional point moves, is often larger. However, some combinations of hitch variables made it possible to reduce this area, within which the non-directional hitch-point moves, so much that also this area could be approximated by a point. Variable changes that contribute to reduce this area are: 1 Reducing the convergence of the lower links or moving forward the convergence point of the lower links 2 Reducing the length of the upper link 3 Increasing the relation between the upper link draught force and the soil force 4 Increasing the length of the lower links The influence on the lateral motion of the implements from these variables was studied partly by simulating the lateral motion of different implements and partly by measuring the lateral motion of different test hitch-implement combinations. In the simulations, the motion of the implement was always directed towards the momentary <b>hitch</b> <b>point.</b> The motion of the implements was then compared with the lateral motion of the implements according to the simplified theory. As long as the <b>hitch</b> <b>points</b> were moving within a small area, the lateral motion of the implement followed the simplified theory...|$|R

Results show basic feedback of voltage output on force load angle variation. In non-load condition, voltage output fluctuates around 5 V.

A non-linear finite element model of a tractor and a mounted sprayer is developed to simulate these unwanted boom vibrations during field operations. Representative disturbance signals at the <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> of the boom suspension are calculated for a tractor with a mounted sprayer driving over a standardized bumpy track. These disturbances are applied as input excitations to simulate boom movements for several types of suspensions (pendulum, single and double trapezium).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral motion of rigid, soil-engaging {{implements}} hitched to a tractor with a one-point or a three-point hitch, {{as well as}} the vertical motion of seed drill coulters for use in tilled seedbeds are investigated. The motion of most tractor-hitched soil-engaging implements is heavily overdamped, it was therefore described by a first order model, based on a quantitative description of the lateral properties of the implement and a functional description of the hitch. For each hitch-implement combination an effective hitch-point, towards which the implement tends to move, was defined and a method to calculate the effective hitch length was developed. The return of a laterally disturbed implement was shown to be exponential. The disturbance is reduced to 10 % of its initial value when the implement moves forward a distance of 2. 3 times the effective hitch length. The tractional <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> and the directional <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> coincide for one-point hitches but not for three-point hitches. This gives the three-point hitches unique properties: The angular {{as well as the}} lateral deflection of a three-point hitched implement will normally be smaller compared to those of a one-point hitched version of the same implement. This is true both when it is used on a hillside and when it is used with an asymmetric load. The three-point hitch is also shown to be versatile enough to enable the construction of a laterally movable and, for both directional and non-directional implements, self-centring front mounted three-point hitch. The horizontal and vertical soil forces on coulters with different rake angles (70 - 135 °) were measured under both pseudostatic (no vertical velocity and no accelerations) and fully dynamic conditions. Most of the measurements were made in a soil bin with dried sand, but some of the pseudostatic measurements were made in a clay field. Empirical models were developed for the soil forces acting on the coulter under both pseudostatic and dynamic conditions. These models were used to simulate coulter equilibrium depth and coulter penetration. The simulations led to the following conclusions: Coulters with a large rake angle (≥ 1 l 0 °) have several advantages when compared to coulters with smaller rake angles; their equilibrium depth is less sensitive both to speed and to soil parameters and their penetration is faster, better damped and less sensitive to suspension parameters (pivot arm length and pivot axis height) and to suspension type (single armed or parallel armed). The coulter penetration was found to improve with decreasing speed, decreasing moment of inertia and increasing depth of operation. No reasons were found for complicating the coulter suspension by using a parallel arm suspension or by using separate pivot axes for front and rear row coulters. The above conclusions apply to well tilled seedbeds without stones or clods. If there are frequent stones or clods in the seedbed the present recommendation of using coulters with rake angles around 90 ° seems valid...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} sought to more {{fully understand the}} types and causative factors of injury/fatality incidents resulting from the rearward-movement of tractors and other self-propelled agricultural machinery, with the view that such findings might lead to the development, improvement, and/or better utilization of safety procedures, design principles, and technologies that would prevent—or at least markedly reduce—their occurrence. Thus, {{the scope of this}} study focused only on rearward-travel (not mechanical malfunction) incidents, and principally on agricultural equipment (although cases involving similar equipment in industrial or construction settings were also drawn upon). Applying these two criteria, a search of published and online sources uncovered more than 100 documented cases, 35 of which could clearly be identified as rearward-movement incidents, of which 28 (80 %) were fatal. Each of these 35 cases were then assessed, based on the type of machine, type of worksite, and type/description of incident (i. e., ‘scenario’), which fell into one of three distinct categories or classifications—(1) co-worker run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator loses visual contact with co-worker; (2) bystander run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator is unaware of bystander’s presence; and (3) operator run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator loses visual contact with, or is unaware of, a stationary object or a hazard. Then, from each scenario, a representative incident (i. e., case study) was selected for a more in-depth analysis. The collective findings, from these three case studies and all 35 machinery rearward-movement incidents, were as follows: (1) The ‘victim’ could be the machine operator as well as a co-worker or a bystander; (2) The specific site of the co-worker or bystander injury/fatality was {{at the base of the}} machine’s rear tires or tracks, at the <b>hitching</b> <b>point,</b> or behind a towed implement; (3) The specific cause was loss of visual contact between the operator and co-worker/bystander due to visual obstruction, the operator’s physical limitations, or the operator’s and/or bystander’s lack of alertness.
