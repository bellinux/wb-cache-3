2500|$|Stewart's {{politics}} {{are rooted in}} his belief in fairness and equality. He considers himself a socialist {{and is a member}} of the Labour Party. He stated, [...] "My father was a very strong trade unionist and those fundamental issues of Labour were ingrained into me." [...] He has been critical of the Iraq War and UK government legislation in the area of civil liberties, in particular its plans to extend detention without charge to 42 days for terrorist suspects. He signed an open <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> to this proposal in March 2008. Stewart is a distinguished supporter of the British Humanist Association. He also identifies himself as a feminist, and has been a part of campaigns against domestic violence. [...] Additionally, he has publicly advocated the right to assisted suicide. In January 2011, Stewart became a patron for Dignity in Dying and campaigns for an assisted dying law in the UK. In August 2014, Stewart was one of 200 public figures in the UK who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. On 2 March 2017, Stewart said he was going to apply for US citizenship in order to oppose the Trump presidency. However, in an interview by the Press Association at the British Film Institute Luminous Fundraising Gala on 3 October 2017, Stewart said that he hoped the US would pass stronger gun laws, but did not mention any intention of becoming an American citizen in furtherance of that hope.|$|E

50|$|Avenue Road. An {{avenue of}} beech trees was planted in 1809 by George Purefoy Jervoise MP, {{to commemorate the}} golden jubilee of King George III in 1810. The {{original}} avenue was one mile long but in 1942 when Lasham Airfield was constructed, some of the avenue was cut down. When the plans became known, Sir George Jeffreys MP wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> {{which was published in}} the London Times newspaper on 7 October 1941.

5000|$|The {{premises}} were progressively extended between 2000 and 2004 {{with new}} classrooms and additional administrative space. [...] There was significant local opposition to this expansion {{on the grounds}} that children from outside the area would be attracted and so this would increase traffic. <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> and a petition were submitted to the council but the plans went ahead regardless.|$|R
50|$|In July 2008, Herts and Essex High School and Bishop's Stortford High School {{submitted}} a planning application to merge {{to a single}} site funded by the building of new residential estates on their existing land. This met with vigorous opposition, most notably from the Bishop's Stortford Civic Federation. Over 930 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> were received, and eventually the plan collapsed in September 2009 {{just prior to the}} planning hearing when the schools withdrew their application.|$|R

5000|$|Unless {{a member}} of the public raises one or more {{material}} planning considerations which were not apparent beforehand, it is unusual for public views to override the relevant planning policies when the decision is made. The importance of public opinion is in adding flavour to the issues {{from the point of view}} of the decision maker. They can be especially important in deciding how much [...] "weight" [...] to give to different material considerations. Unpopular proposals often attract well orchestrated public opposition and it is not unusual for an LPA to receive multiple copies of the same pre-written <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> from a large number of people, or petitions with numerous signatures. It is not unknown for LPAs to receive letters of objection to a proposal with fake names and addresses in an effort to increase the level of apparent public opposition to a planning application. Some objectors to a development will also write to their Member of Parliament or to other people who are mistakenly believed to have influence over the outcome of a planning application but MPs will scrupulously avoid seeking to influence the proper functioning of a democratically elected LPA. Although members are democratically elected, they should not decide applications on the basis of strength of public opinion, but according to planning law; if there are no substantial planning grounds for refusing an application, a planning inspector at appeal could well order the LPA to pay costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{plans have}} led to the {{formation}} by residents from the communities of Llanrumney, Rumney, St Mellons and Trowbridge, Cardiff of the Rumney Recreation and Eastern Leisure Centre Action Group (RREEL). The RREEL Action Group is a non-political organisation that seeks to preserve the Rumney Recreation Ground from the proposed development. Since its formation RREEL has presented Cardiff Council with an 8,000 signed petition and 3,500 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection.</b> In February 2009 under provisions set out in the 1972 Local Government Act RREEL organised a local community poll for the residents of Llanrumney and Rumney.|$|R
50|$|Druridge Bay again {{became the}} focus for {{environmental}} concerns in late 2015, when a planning application was submitted by Banks Group for an open-cast mine extending to 360 hectares (900 acres) immediately {{to the west of}} the beach, for the extraction of 3 million tonnes of coal. Six weeks after the application was submitted the UK government announced that all coal-fired energy generation would cease by 2025. Over 1800 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> were received. Northumberland County Council approved plans for the open-cast mine in July 2016. In September 2016, the plans were put on hold subject to a government inquiry.|$|R
50|$|The {{school had}} {{occupied}} what were originally two detached family homes. It was {{situated on the}} corner of two roads that also comprised only detached family homes. Soon after its closure, a proposal to build 13 flats on this site was made. This caused over 160 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> to be sent to the local Council and this resulted in the application being refused by the Councilâs Development Control Committee in June 2006. Objections were {{based on the premise that}} a high density development of flats in South Cheam was undesirable and out of keeping with the nature of the area.|$|R
30|$|Gaman {{and several}} others from Mantob wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> to the land office. At {{the time of this}} fieldwork, this author was {{informed}} that the Ketua Kampong (village head) of Mantob had been given a verbal assurance by the land office that the land application by X Company Sdn Bhd would be rejected. However, Gaman received another letter from the land office stating that the land he applied for is too steep and is unsuitable for agriculture, and as such his application would not be processed. Field investigations revealed that Gaman had applied for the land in May 1982.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reaction}} was more pronounced than previously with the council receiving over 220 individual <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> against this application.Council planners still recommended the application be granted. However, on 14 February {{in front of}} over 140 campaigning residents, the local councilâs Development Control Committee unanimously refused the application, expressing agreement with the residents argument that approval of this application would have led to it becoming a precedent for any development in any area of special local character in the borough. [...] The support for the retention of the school buildings was deemed unprecedented by the councillors.|$|R
25|$|The two {{researchers}} (both chief physicians at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, {{one of them}} {{married to}} Gillberg), defended their decision to shred the files by referring to the promises of confidentiality that had been issued to the subjects {{of the study and}} the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> that had been received from the families that they did not want their personal data used or shared with the private individuals. They argued that turning the files over would have exposed the researchers and the university to potential lawsuits from the subjects for failing to honor a written agreement. They were convicted and fined for destruction of government property.|$|R
500|$|Some local {{objections}} {{emerged in}} response to the plans to use of the fields for the stadium. Residents opposed to the stadium were concerned that it would lead to parking problems and devaluation of their property. There were also concerns about the loss of green space. There were also Moston residents who supported the stadium proposals, believing the stadium would provide sports facilities and activities for local children and teenagers, improving the overall health of people in the area. By the end of the consultation process 5,635 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> support and 2,226 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> were received. â of these 7,653 (97.3%) were [...] "standard letters" [...] with supporters and objectors simply adding a signature. There were also six petitions with 854 names in support and 1,420 names in objection.|$|R
50|$|Cardiff Council {{presented}} these objections {{and their}} proposals to the Welsh Assembly Government on 20 June 2009. Cardiff Council's report noted that 1,257 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> to the proposal were received. Notables who objected included Rumney High School Governing Body, Fields in Trust, Alun Michael MP, David Melding AM, Lorraine Barrett AM, Andrew R.T. Davies AM, Cllrs Cook, Parry, Ireland, Hudson, Morgan, Joyce and RREEL. The Council's report {{written by the}} Chief School's Officer, Chris Jones, stated {{that the majority of}} responses received have expressed support for a new high school to serve the East of Cardiff with the main objections being to the location of the new school. The Council concluded their case by stressing that their plans involved far more than educational changes, and stating their plans would transform the communities of Llanrumney and Rumney.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the discursive racialisation of asylum-seekers by residents of Portishead, a small English town, a process demonstrating a classed and placed set of expressions of whiteness. I study the racialisation of {{a diverse group of}} people from the bottom-up, through an analysis <b>of</b> residentsâ <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> to the Governmentâs request for planning permission to turn a building into an asylum processing centre in 2004. Three registers of language are presented: âtechnocraticâ, âresentfulâ and âconjecturalâ. Racialisation is expressed through shared ideas about the type of space in Portishead, and the type of people appropriate for it. The space is constructed as white and middle-class: the asylum-seekers are produced discursively as neither and therefore as not belonging. I suggest that the phenomenon of relatively powerful groups constructing themselves as weak and beleaguered can be conceptualised as a form of âdefensive engagementâ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{planning}} process for a Scottish prison located near a former mining village. Analysing the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> submitted by residents offers an opportunity to explore local views about prison and community and to relate these to the unique social and spatial history of the area. The planning process itself structured how residents were able to express themselves and defined what counted as a relevant objection. After deconstructing this process, the paper then restores and uses {{as a framework for}} analysis three geographies <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> stripped from local responses to the development proposal: the emotional, temporal, and spatial. Emotional expressions <b>of</b> <b>objection</b> added intensity and gave meaning to claims about the historical decline of the region and also conveyed a deep sense of the proposed building site as a lived space. Particular grounds of oppositionâover fear of strangers, the fragility of a local orchid, and the pollution from miningâprovide an opportunity to explore the complex nature of place meaning and community identity, ultimately leading to a conclusion that the meaning of place is always in flux. The paper argues that Simmelâs classic concept of the stranger, as the outsider who comes to stay, offers a useful analytic in understanding how the quality of proximal remoteness that prisons and other unwanted developments constitute participates in a constantly evolving sense of the local...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first charge}} under the Public Order Ordinance was taken after the {{handover}} was in 2000, when seven student leaders {{were arrested for}} joining [...] "illegal assemblies" [...] and obstructing the police on a demonstration on 26 June 2000 that was without a prior notice given to the police. The protest, served {{as a reminder of}} the Government's decision to seek for re-interpretation of the Basic Law after the right of abode rulings in 1999, received general public and media sympathy and was viewed by some as an orderly, non-violent and non-provoking act of civil disobedience. More than 500 academics and researchers signed a petition to support the students, about 1,000 people marched on the street without police's <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> no <b>objection</b> in open defiance of the Public Order Ordinance, and the Hong Kong Bar Association condemned the police for singling out students for arrest.
