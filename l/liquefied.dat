5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be <b>liquefied</b> through expansion cooling.|$|E

5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), <b>liquefied</b> petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be <b>liquefied</b> and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted.

5|$|Hydrogen was <b>liquefied</b> for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using {{regenerative}} cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year.

Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully <b>liquefied</b> chlorine {{and went on}} to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first <b>liquefied</b> by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{performance}} of a RepRap 3 D printer <b>liquefier</b> by studying its thermal behavior, focusing on the convective heat dissipation developed along the <b>liquefier</b> body during the 3 D printing process of a workpiece. More specifically, this work tackles with the influence of the airflow generated by a fan coupled to the extruder, on the heat transfer mechanisms during the printing process. The airflow is thus taken as the variable of study. The temperature at the top of the <b>liquefier</b> body, where a low temperature is desirable for the correct preservation of the 3 D printer components, is analyzed to assess the results for the different printing conditions. For the development of this study, a finite elements model was used to determine the theoretical temperature profile of the <b>liquefier</b> in a steady state working regime. This mathematical model was then validated with experimental data registered with four thermocouples fixed on the tested extruder. The data was taken for different airflows, finding a relation between printing parameters and resulting tem- perature profile. The <b>liquefier</b> used for experimental data acquisition was the BCNozzle model, designed by the BCN 3 D Technologies of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Determining the correct working parameters is necessary to optimize the fused filament fabrication process on which 3 D printing is based, ensuring a suitable temperature distribution along the <b>liquefier</b> body. This would allow a correct position of the melting front along the <b>liquefier</b> channel, and at the same time, a non-excessive temperature at its top, next to the feeding mechanism. This is the relevance of this study, through which a model is obtained to analyze the heat transfer mechanisms, applicable for other working regimes and other extruders based on the same working principles.

5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further <b>liquefied</b> by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a single-stage coaxial pulse tube refrigerator used as an oxygen <b>liquefier</b> is discussed. The <b>liquefier</b> is a half-size laboratory unit for NASA/JSC to demonstrate the technology of <b>liquefying</b> and storing oxygen on Mars. The <b>liquefier</b> {{would be part of}} a plant that extracts oxygen from the Martian carbon dioxide atmosphere and stores the oxygen in liquid form. The liquid oxygen could then be used either for the oxidizer of a fuel or for breathing in a manned mission. The pulse tube and regenerator, which are arranged coaxially, provide 18. 8 W of cooling at 90 K with 222 W of PV input power. The resulting coefficient of performance (COP) is 20. 0 % of the Carnot value based on PV input power, among the highest ever achieved. Liquid nitrogen was produced at a rate of 1. 75 g/min (2. 17 cm 3 /min) with 215 W of PV input power. Oxygen should be produced at about 2. 7 g/min (2. 37 cm 3 /min).
