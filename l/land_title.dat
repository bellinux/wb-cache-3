40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>titling</b> {{programs}} are increasingly encouraged by international organizations {{as an essential}} component of urban policy in developing countries. The clear definition of property rights is argued to be a sine qua non of economic development. However, most academic research on <b>land</b> <b>titles</b> has focused on the impacts of <b>land</b> <b>titles</b> and there is a dearth of analysis of the demand for <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> and the structure of <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> programs. A better understanding of <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> programs is essential for the policy to succeed in improving the lives of people living in informally developed neighborhoods. This paper presents a model of demand for land regularization in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. The model adapts previous work on land registration in agricultural areas to regularization in urban areas, incorporating insights on the different sources of value for urban <b>land</b> and <b>titles</b> in urban areas, as well as the characteristics of the regularization process in Mexico. An empirical test of the determinants of success in <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> is conducted using administrative and spatial data from 140 irregularly developed neighborhoods where regularization agencies are active. The prediction of previous modelsthat there should be more <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> for <b>land</b> that is valuabledoes not hold.

Specifically, we analyze the impact of government <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> in rural Peru. Our findings suggest that <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> does not achieve the positive benefits associated with secure property, such as access to credit. We also find that individuals prefer private enforce-ment methods of securing property to public means. This suggests that government <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> {{is not always a}} channel through which coun-tries can achieve secure property rights institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> {{programs}} have produced lackluster results {{in terms of}} achieving access to credit for the poor.

Using a household survey from Indonesia, we provide evidence that formal <b>land</b> <b>titles</b> do have a positive and significant eect on access to credit and {{at least part of}} this effect is best interpreted as an improvement in ex-ante information ows. This result stands in contrast to the prevailing notion that <b>land</b> <b>titles</b> only function as collateral.

5000|$|<b>Land</b> <b>titling</b> {{is a form}} of {{land reform}} in which private {{individuals}} and families are given formal property rights for land which they have previously occupied informally or used on the basis of customary land tenure.

25|$|Unlike the American {{pioneers of}} the Old West, Filipinos {{were not so}} willing to occupy remote, {{unsettled}} and undeveloped areas. So when the American colonial government introduced homesteading, there were few takers among Filipinos. Essentially, homesteading happens when someone lays claim on, harnesses the resources and develops a parcel of land, even if it's still wilderness and far from population centers, for economic use. Homesteading could be done through a legal process of acquiring a <b>land</b> <b>title,</b> or even without a title at all. In the latter case however, {{the lack of a}} title makes the informal homesteader vulnerable to any legal action attempting to take the land away from him.|$|E

If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous grantor could sell the property to another grantee.

25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where <b>land</b> <b>title</b> may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E
25|$|Papua New Guinea is richly {{endowed with}} natural resources, {{including}} mineral and renewable resources, such as forests, marine (including {{a large portion}} of the world's major tuna stocks), and in some parts agriculture. The rugged terrain — including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands — and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary <b>land</b> <b>title)</b> makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, oil, and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. Oil palm production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with palm oil now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces), followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders and tea, produced on estates and rubber. The Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust belt.|$|E
25|$|William Penn {{was asked}} to {{adjudicate}} the matter and he awarded 90% of the claim to Billinge and the remaining 10% and a cash settlement to Fenwick for his share. Fenwick was dissatisfied with Penn's judgement and refused {{to abide by the}} decision; essentially Fenwick had no assurance that a previously bankrupt man would convey ten percent of the net proceeds of the future venture since he had not even paid the adjudicated cash settlement. So Fenwick organized a colony of settlers and sailed to the Delaware Bay where he settled as Patroon on the eastern shore near the abandoned Swedish settlement of Fort Nya Elfsborg and set himself up as the local governor of the fifth Tenth (approximately 20% of the original Billinge property), issuing land patents and enforcing his own laws in defiance of Billinge and Penn. Billinge countered by suing Fenwick, causing uncertainty in the chain of <b>land</b> <b>title.</b> The economic damages to those who controlled property within and near Salem caused many injured persons over the next decade to declare a long line of complaints and lawsuits in the colonial courts. To preserve Salem, its inhabitants and their property, Fenwick remained under arrest for months until copies of documents proving his claims were obtained from England. Fenwick ultimately proved the right of his claim in the court of Dominion Governor Andros, and returned to govern the Salem tenth by 1689. Salem remained as a settlement and continued growing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explains}} how {{the effects of}} <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> are in part dependant to the decision to acquire <b>titles.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>titling</b> programs assign secure property rights on land assets. One of their potential effects {{is an increase in}} credit—the “credit effect”—as titled assets can be used as collateral to obtain loans. Empirical {{studies have shown that the}} credit effect has not taken place in many countries where <b>land</b> <b>titling</b> programs have been implemented. Most studies, however, fail to ask whether individuals acquire titles to increase their credit in the first place. I develop a theoretical framework based on the field of New Institutional Economics to explain why it is important to include a demand analysis when examining the effects of <b>land</b> <b>titling.</b> I apply this framework to the case study of the ejido in Mexico. The evidence from Mexico shows that the credit effect is unlikely to take place because individuals acquire titles to sell their land for urbanization rather than expand credit. The main implication of this study is that policymakers must include a demand analysis when considering the possible effects of <b>land</b> <b>titling.</b> Acknowledgment...|$|R
