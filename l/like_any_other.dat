5|$|Borscht, <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> soup in East Slavic cuisines, {{is seldom}} eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E

Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter milk) with meals. On festive occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried foods are consumed. A typical festive thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad, raita, salad and desserts (such as sewai or Kheer).|$|E

Until it {{was taken over by}} the Confederacy in 1861 it {{produced}} many different denominations, all of which were either silver or gold: silver three-cent pieces (1851 only), half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, silver dollars, gold dollars, $2.50 quarter eagles, three-dollar pieces, $5 half-eagles, $10 eagles, and $20 double eagles.|$|E
5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> chattel.|$|E

As of April 2016, the incumbent governor of Romblon is Eduardo C. Firmalo, from the Liberal Party. He first assumed office on 30 June 2010, following his victory in the May 2010 gubernatorial elections. He was reelected in 2013 {{for a second term}} which will expire in 2016.|$|E

The 16th century Maharal of Prague says that the circumstances of her birth were not coincidental. Alienation and loneliness are tools <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>others</b> and are given in order to enable one to become who they can be. The Maharal points out that she had an inner strength.|$|R

5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity {{from right to}} left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it would have killed Voss {{in less than a}} minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle. Werner Voss was buried <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} Phenomenological Phonology (PP), including its metatheory, theory and application, for comparison with Cognitive Phonology (CP). While PP and CP are in close agreement at the theory level, there are some significant differences {{at the level of}} metatheory. PP considers phonological terms (such as phoneme and word) to be words <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>others,</b> and gives detailed consideration to the concepts behind such terms. It also considers pronunciation to be a form of behaviour, driven by concepts created through general concept formation processes. This has important consequences for practical application in the areas of pronunciation and literacy teaching...|$|R
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
