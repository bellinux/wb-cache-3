25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was first}} arrested on 8 November 1973 {{for the killing}} on 28 October of Patrick Campbell, a Catholic trade unionist from Banbridge who was gunned down on his doorstep. Jackson's words after {{he was charged with}} the killing were: [...] "Nothing. I just can't believe it". Campbell's wife, Margaret had {{opened the door to the}} gunman and his {{accomplice}} when they had come looking for her husband. She had got a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men, who drove off in a Ford Cortina after the shooting, and although she identified Jackson as the killer at an identity parade, murder charges against him were dropped on 4 January 1974 at Belfast Magistrates' Court.|$|E

60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men, {{and they}} {{returned}} my gaze with interest.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid the}} label aside, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> bottles--the poison and <b>the</b> antidote--ranged {{together}} <b>at</b> her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I reckon we can tie {{him up in}} {{the barn}} till mornin'," [...] {{answered}} her husband, with an inquiring <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young hunters.|$|E
6000|$|Walter {{flashed a}} keen <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> faces and read there {{the success of}} the trip. [...] "Hey, you sleepy-heads, they've found the camp!" [...] he shouted, thumping Hal on the back.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to learn a lesson <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men, and see where the {{difference}} lies. The one has had some heart about him, and the other has been a coward." ...|$|E
60|$|She went slowly up-stairs <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> bills, {{which did}} not seem half so {{precious}} as when {{in the shape of}} gold.|$|R
60|$|As for Eve, {{being as}} {{innocent}} of pun-appreciation as her great original probably was, she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> boys in pleased gravity.|$|R
6000|$|To Foster's relief, {{the hotel}} manager {{came in and}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> ladies hesitatingly. Neither took the hint and Lucy said, rather sharply, [...] "Well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The modern {{works for}} the benefit of the {{community}} are really far greater than those which sprang from the caprice of kings. The London and North-Western Railway is an infinitely grander thing than the pyramids. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> headlights in the dark!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A Daniel come to judgment' indeed," [...] {{reflected}} Hadden, who {{had been}} watching this savage comedy with interest; [...] "our love-sick friend has got more than he bargained for. Well, that comes of appealing to Cæsar," [...] {{and he turned to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> suppliants.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nor {{to those}} who have no {{complexion}} to lose," [...] she cried, with a triumphant <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> maidens, who certainly had not the lilies nor the roses that she believed herself to have, though, in truth, her imprudences had left her paler and less pretty than at Winchester.|$|E
60|$|The {{umbrella}} owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a presentiment that {{luck would}} again run against him. <b>The</b> policeman <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> curiously.|$|R
6000|$|She leaned for {{a moment}} her little fair hand on the table, playing on it. [...] "And now, and now," [...] she said, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> gentlemen-- ...|$|R
50|$|If B wears a {{black hat}} as well, C can {{immediately}} {{tell that he}} is wearing a white hat after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> black hats in front of him.|$|R
60|$|<b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{women on}} the sofa together! The large, fair, mild-eyed Milly is timid even in friendship: {{it is not easy}} to her to speak of the affection of which her heart is full. The lithe, dark, thin-lipped Countess is racking her small brain for caressing words and charming exaggerations.|$|E
6000|$|EGO. [...] "'It is in {{this manner}} that the {{greatest}} Generals have often conducted their wars against each other. One has only to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Campaigns of M. de Montecuculi and M. de Turenne, in the Valley of the Rench [Strasburg Country, 1674 and 1675, two celebrated Campaigns, Turenne killed by a cannon-shot in the last].|$|E
60|$|Upon Bruno {{the change}} came later: {{but it was}} {{completed}} in both before they reached the golden gate, through which I {{knew it would be}} impossible for me to follow. I could but stand outside, and take a last <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sweet children, ere they disappeared within, and the golden gate closed with a bang.|$|E
60|$|A most unprofessional quiver {{got into}} Nan's voice as she spoke, and her keen eyes dimmed as she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> anxious young faces turned so confidingly {{to her for}} help.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jack; and he added, after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{bodies with}} a long-drawn whistle of concern, [...] "and I wouldn't, if I were you, say {{anything}} {{of this to}} Barker." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was several}} {{seconds before the}} three boy hunters {{realized}} that <b>the</b> battle was <b>at</b> an end. Slowly Whopper turned over and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> dead animals. He rose to his feet, panting heavily.|$|R
60|$|Blakeney {{took them}} from {{his friend and}} placed them on the little {{table in front of}} ex-Ambassador Chauvelin. The spectators {{strained}} their necks to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> weapons. They were exactly similar one to the other: both encased in plain black leather sheaths, with steel ferrules polished to shine like silver; the handles too were of plain steel, with just the grip fashioned in a twisted basket pattern of the same highly-tempered metal.|$|E
60|$|Then as {{the door}} {{remained}} obstinately closed--too long at any rate for M. le Marquis's impatience--he boldly placed {{his hand on the}} knob and threw it open. The heavy panels flew back, revealing Lord Eglinton sitting at his secrétaire writing. His head was resting on his hand, but he turned to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> gentlemen, as they stood, momentarily silent and subdued in the doorway itself. He rose to greet them, but stared at them somewhat astonished and not a little haughtily, and he made no motion requesting them to enter.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{possible}} that I may have spoken a little too sharply. Anyway, faithful Selina interceded for her friend. [...] "Oh, dear sir, don't be hard on Elizabeth! She always means well." [...] Mrs. Tenbruggen, as facetious as ever, made a grateful return for a small compliment. She chucked Miss Jillgall under the chin, with the air of an amorous old gentleman expressing his approval of a pretty servant-girl. It was impossible to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> in their relative situations, without laughing. But Mrs. Tenbruggen failed to cheat me into altering my opinion of her. Innocent Miss Jillgall clapped her ugly hands, and said: [...] "Isn't she good company?" ...|$|E
60|$|Gudrun {{had turned}} round and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men. They were to her {{sinister}} creatures, standing watching after her, by the heap of pale grey slag. She loathed {{the man with}} whiskers round his face.|$|R
6000|$|MRS BUILDER, who {{has so far}} {{seemed to}} {{accompany}} him, shuts the door [...] quickly and remains in the studio. She stands there with that faint [...] smile on her face, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young people.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sleds, with <b>the</b> dogs in harness, {{loaded with}} furs and fish. His rifle lay {{on top of}} the beaver skins. The six hunters who were to act as his guard stood by the sleds.|$|R
6000|$|... 203. Here, on the right, in Plate XX., is an Indian bull, colossal, and elaborately carved, {{which you}} may take as a {{sufficient}} type {{of the bad}} art of all the earth. False in form, dead in heart, and loaded with wealth, externally. We will not ask the date of this; it may rest in the eternal obscurity of evil art, everywhere and for ever. Now, besides this colossal bull, here {{is a bit of}} Dædalus work, enlarged from a coin not bigger than a shilling: <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> together, and you ought to know, henceforward, what Greek art means, to the end of your days.|$|E
6000|$|... 21. Which is so, indeed, in all {{the loveliest}} flowers; and, in usual botanical parlance, a flower is said to consist of its calyx, (or hiding part--Calypso having rule over it,) and corolla, or garland part, Proserpina having rule over it. But {{it is better to}} think of them always as separate; for this calyx, very justly so named from its main {{function}} of concealing the flower, in its youth is usually green, not coloured, and shows its separate nature by pausing, or at least greatly lingering, in its growth, and modifying itself very slightly, while the corolla is forming {81} itself through active change. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> for instance, through the youth of a pease blossom, Fig. 8.|$|E
6000|$|... "When the sun {{was well}} up we arose, and went very cautiously--at least Pharaoh and I did, for I would not allow Harry to come--to {{see if we could}} find any trace of the wounded lioness. She had ceased roaring {{immediately}} upon the arrival of the two lions, and had not made a sound since, from which we concluded that she was probably dead. I was armed with my express, while Pharaoh, in whose hands a rifle was indeed a dangerous weapon, to his companions, had an axe. On our way we stopped to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> dead lions. They were magnificent animals, both of them, but their pelts were entirely spoiled by the terrible mauling they had given to each other, which was a sad pity.|$|E
6000|$|They stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> roads,--one sandy, hot, and hilly; {{the other}} green and cool and level, along the river-side. They all chose the {{pleasant}} path, and walked on till Ned cried out, [...] "Why, where are our shadows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} but you are right, Bob. In <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> craft, last evening, I gave the {{preference}} to the Dragon, though I kept my opinion to myself, lest I might mortify those who built the Jonas." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{children}} <b>at</b> play, [...] "Ah! now," [...] I said, almost involuntarily [...] "the {{golden boy}} who has caught my horse's bridle in his hand, is not he Sleep? and he who considers his brother's boldness--that one is Death?" ...|$|R
