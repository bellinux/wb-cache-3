Copper’s greater conductivity versus other materials enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors. For example, to reduce <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> in continuous-use induction-type motors above 1 horsepower, manufacturers invariably use copper as the conducting material in windings. Aluminium is an alternate material in smaller horsepower motors, especially when motors are not used continuously.|$|E

The CDF is usually calculated based on defined market segments such as residential, commercial, and industrial.

40|$|The {{quantity}} of <b>loading</b> <b>losses,</b> {{which are the}} primary source of evaporative emissions from tank cars and trucks was analyzed in this paper. <b>Loading</b> <b>losses</b> occur as organic vapors in "empty" cargo tanks are displaced to the atmosphere by the liquid being loaded into the tanks. Emissions from loading petroleum liquid were estimated using three methods: the API (American Petroleum Institute) method, the VDI (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure -Association of German Engineers) method and the Yugoslav Standard JUS B. HO. 531 method. The mass of evaporative <b>losses</b> from <b>loading</b> operations {{is a function of the}} following parameters: the method of loading the cargo, the physical and chemical characteristics of the cargo and the ambient temperature during <b>loading.</b> Evaporation <b>losses</b> from the <b>loading</b> of motor gasoline (MB- 95, BMB- 95, MB- 98 and MB- 86) and diesel fuels (D- 2, Euro D- 2) were calculated. Losses on a monthly and annual basis were presented for an assumed amount of loaded cargo. It was estimated that the highest <b>loading</b> <b>losses</b> occur in the summer period because of high ambient daily temperatures and in the period of higher transporting levels. It should be pointed out that the <b>loading</b> <b>losses</b> of diesel fuel calculated using an empirical coefficient according to JUS B.

50|$|Joule heating is {{referred}} to as ohmic heating or resistive heating because of its relationship to Ohm's Law. It forms the basis for the large number of practical applications involving electric heating. However, in applications where heating is an unwanted by-product of current use (e.g., <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> in electrical transformers) the diversion of energy {{is often referred to as}} resistive loss. The use of high voltages in electric power transmission systems is specifically designed to reduce such losses in cabling by operating with commensurately lower currents. The ring circuits, or ring mains, used in UK homes are another example, where power is delivered to outlets at lower currents, thus reducing Joule heating in the wires. Joule heating does not occur in superconducting materials, as these materials have zero electrical resistance in the superconducting state.|$|E

The A 5056 bolt {{could reduce the}} bolt <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> compared to the SCM 435 bolt due to smaller mismatch of thermal expansion between the bolt material and the plates. The mismatch of thermal expansion between bolt material and AZ 91 D plates was found to induce the compressive creep deformation in the AZ 91 D plates which performed as the main mechanism of bolt <b>load</b> <b>loss.</b> At higher tightening stress, the bolt <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> could be intensified by additional plastic deformation in bolt occurred during the test.

50|$|Although a {{power supply}} with a larger than needed power rating will have an extra margin of safety against overloading, such a unit is often less {{efficient}} and wastes more electricity at lower loads than a more appropriately sized unit. For example, a 900-watt power supply with the 80 Plus Silver efficiency rating (which means that such {{a power supply}} {{is designed to be}} at least 85-percent efficient for loads above 180 W) may only be 73% efficient when the load is lower than 100 W, which is a typical idle power for a desktop computer. Thus, for a 100 W <b>load,</b> <b>losses</b> for this supply would be 37 W; if the same power supply was put under a 450 W load, for which the supply's efficiency peaks at 89%, the loss would be only 56 W despite supplying 4.5 times the useful power. For a comparison, a 500-watt power supply carrying the 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 82-percent efficient for loads above 100 W) may provide an 84-percent efficiency for a 100 W load, wasting only 19 W.|$|E

Different measures to reduce the stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> due the skin effect in the stator of the round wire winding generator are successfully tested and implemented in the manufacturing process. Thanks to these proven techniques the round wire winding is competitive to other expensive winding types. Analytical models for the estimation of the stator stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> due to the skin effect for profile, litz and round wire winding are compared to the measurements. A survey on the cheap and simple methods to measure the stray <b>load</b> <b>losses</b> in squirrel-cage induction motors, apart from the standardized methods, results in three equivalent “no-load” methods, where no coupling and no dynamometer or torque-meter are needed. The strengths and weaknesses of the measurement methods were investigated and compared with the standardized input-output test (residual loss method) and the reverse rotation test (RRT) on 27 standard TEFC grid-operated cage induction motors (2 -, 4 - and 6 -pole) with the current design of six European manufacturers with the rated power of 0. 37 kW, 0. 55 kW, 1. 1 kW, 5. 5 kW, 11 kW and 315 kW.

40|$|Stray <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> refers {{generally}} to {{the sources of}} induction machine loss not accounted for by typical calculations of primary or secondary copper <b>loss,</b> no <b>load</b> core <b>loss,</b> or friction and windage loss. Harmonic rotor bar currents from the non-sinusoidal distribution of the slotted stator winding contribute significant stray <b>load</b> <b>loss.</b> Rotor bars, especially on cast rotors for machines under fifty horsepower (37. 3 kW), can be skewed, helically twisted {{from one end to}} the other, to reduce loss, torque, and noise from alignment of rotor and stator slots and from harmonic rotor currents. Interbar currents flowing circumferentially through the laminations between skewed and non-insulated rotor bars can significantly increase stray <b>load</b> <b>loss.</b> Presented equations adjust the effective rotor resistance and skew factor of the extended per-phase induction machine equivalent circuit model in order to account for the impact of inter-bar currents. The average value of resistance between neighboring rotor bars significantly impacts calculations of rotor bar and inter-bar current and loss and has been determined for a number of measured rotors. Rotors fit into one of two distinct categories where either the bar-to-lamination contact resistance dominates the inter-bar resistance or the total resistance divides more equally between values of bar, lamination, and contact resistance. Performance calculations using the adjusted equivalent circuit model are verified theoretically against previous calculation methods and experimentally by comparison to measured test results including variations in rotor skew, conductor conductivity, and inter-bar resistance. (cont.) A number of different cast copper and aluminum five and ten horsepower test induction motors performed differently than originally predicted and variably between nominally identical machines. Inter-bar currents are part of the cause of both the variation and additional losses measured on these machines. The adjusted equivalent circuit equations improve estimations of motor performance and allow identification of means to increase machine efficiency by minimizing the stray <b>load</b> <b>loss</b> due to inter-bar currents. by Steven C.
