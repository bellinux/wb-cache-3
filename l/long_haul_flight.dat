40|$|Today, {{air travel}} is popular {{as a way}} of {{transportation}} for different purpose such as business and tourism. The numbers of air travel passengers are increasing every year. At the same time the flight distance is increased because of better fuel efficiency and technology advancement of airplanes. Sitting is the most common activity during the flight. The US Department of Health advised the disable people to change their sitting posture frequently to relieve sitting pressures at least every 1 hour, and every 15 minutes for normal people. Decubitus is widely recognized as serious complication for a person with spinal cord injury. Motor paralyses affected a person’s ability to respond unconsciously to potential noxious stimuli.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to facilitate test subjects to achieve a high level of presence in a <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>flight</b> simulator. The approach not only addresses the likeness of the static infrastructure, but also highlights the importance of integrating the dynamic services, such as flight attendant service, flying simulation service, etc. with the static infrastructure to create a dynamic flight virtual environment for test subjects. The integration procedure is a time driven unified process. User experiment result shows that the approach helps test subjects to achieve a high level of flight presence in the flight simulator. Keywords-long-haul flight simulation, presence, test bed, simulator. II. SEAT TEST BED The SEAT simulator consists of a small scale aircraft cabin residing on a moving platform, a project section to simulate the aircraft cabin outside sky, and a control room section. The interior of the aircraft cabin is divided into an economy class section, a business class section, a galley and a lavatory.
