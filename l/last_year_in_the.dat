500|$|The first {{bowl game}} in Connecticut history {{came at the}} {{conclusion}} of the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football season, the first year UConn was a full member of the Big East Conference for football. [...] The season before, UConn finished with a 93 overall record, but did not receive a bowl invitation due to the lack of conference affiliation. [...] Even as a full member of the Big East, UConn was shut out of the conference-affiliated bowl picture. [...] Pittsburgh, Boston College (in its <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Big East before leaving to join the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)), West Virginia, and Syracuse all finished ahead of the Huskies in a four-way tie for first place; they filled four of the five conference bowl slots. [...] The remaining slot was filled by Notre Dame, who was not a member of the Big East Conference for football but had a contract allowing them to be selected in place of a Big East team. [...] Fortunately for UConn, the Big Ten did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to fill all of its contracted bowl slots, allowing the Motor City Bowl to pick the Huskies. [...] UConn's opponent would be the Toledo Rockets of the Mid-American Conference (MAC), who earned their berth by winning the 2004 MAC Championship Game.|$|E

John Bracewell, the club's director of cricket, commented that he was [...] "excited by the prospect of signing an international spinning all-rounder to replace Ian during the Cheltenham Festival and the C semi-finals.

Mark Alleyne, the club's head coach, remarked that [...] "Shoaib did very well for us <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short time he was with us and fitted in very well.

Santorum views [...] "Islamic-fascism" [...] in Iran {{as the center of}} the [...] "world's conflict", and his geo-political strategy for peace involves the United States promoting [...] "a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq." [...] He sponsored the Syria Accountability Act of 2003 to require Syria cease all activity with Lebanon and end all support for terrorism. In 2005, Santorum sponsored the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated $10 million aimed at regime change in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. However, Santorum nevertheless voted against the Lautenberg amendment, which would have closed the loophole that allows companies like Halliburton to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates. Santorum reflected on his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate as one spent talking a lot about Iran, and was characterized by The Atlantic Wire as an [...] "extreme hawk" [...] in his approach with Iran. Santorum stated that Iran was the creator of Hezbollah and the driving force of Hamas. He said Iran {{was at the center of}} [...] "much of the world's conflict" [...] but he was opposed to direct military action against the country in 2006. Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against confirming the nomination of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. Santorum stated that his objection was to Gates' support for talking with Iran and Syria, because it would be an error to talk with radical Islamists.|$|E
