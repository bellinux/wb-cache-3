50|$|An {{extraordinary}} {{example of}} external sperm transfer {{is given by}} the great <b>grey</b> <b>slug</b> (Limax maximus). A pair of slugs climb a tree or wall to an overhang and suspend together head down from a 10-25 cm long mucus strand before everting their penises and exchanging sperm in mid air. Evolutionary explanations for this behaviour are unclear.|$|R

50|$|The giant Caribbean {{sea anemone}} is a macrophagous {{carnivore}} and feeds upon fish, mussels, shrimp, zooplankton, and sea worms. It will not, however, go near any natural predators, such as red leg hermits, the <b>grey</b> sea <b>slug,</b> or the tompot blenny.|$|R
50|$|In {{hermaphroditic}} animals, {{the costs}} of parental care can be evenly distributed between the sexes, e.g. earthworms. In some species of planarians, sexual behaviour {{takes the form of}} penis fencing. In this form of copulation, the individual that first penetrates the other with the penis, forces the other to be female, thus carrying the majority of the cost of reproduction. Post mating, banana slugs will some times gnaw off their partners penis as an act of sperm competition. In the <b>grey</b> <b>slug,</b> the sharing of cost leads to a spectacular display, where the mates suspend themselves high above the ground from a slime thread, ensuring none of them can refrain from taking on the cost of egg-bearer.|$|R
