5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses Tigranes suffered, {{the battle was}} not decisive in ending the war. In {{retreating}} northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to elude Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans {{during the battle of}} Artashat. In 68, Lucullus' forces' began to mutiny, <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> return home, and he withdrew his forces from Armenia the following year.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{intended}} that Fred would {{manage the}} estate as he recovered from his wounds and addictions. As {{an extension of}} her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: My plan...is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.|$|E

5|$|Giles' dream {{presents}} a choice: either {{to remain a}} father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented {{by the presence of}} his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E

6000|$|Her eagerness, her impatience, her <b>longings</b> <b>to</b> be with them, {{were such}} as {{to bring a}} line or two of Cowper's Tirocinium for ever before her. [...] "With what intense desire she wants her home," [...] was {{continually}} on her tongue, as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy's bosom to feel more keenly.|$|R
6000|$|She {{burned to}} pour {{out to her}} mother all the Micklethwayte tidings, and all her <b>longings</b> <b>to</b> be there; but when the Rectory party set her down at the door, the footman, {{with a look of}} grave importance, {{announced}} that Mr. Egremont was very unwell. 'Mr. Gregory thinks he has taken a chill from the effect of exposure, sir, and Dr. Hamilton has been sent for.' ...|$|R
60|$|That was a {{pleasant}} prospect, and Violet reposed on {{the thought of the}} enjoyment of Martindale without its formidable inhabitants; trying in it to forget the pain of parting with her husband for a month, and her <b>longings</b> <b>to</b> spend it at her own home, and see Johnnie strengthened by Helvellyn breezes; while to Theodora it seemed like the opening into peace and goodness.|$|R

Fred and Charley felt mighty <b>longings</b> <b>to</b> run away from a danger great enough to frighten the redoubtable Simpson gang and the valorous fireman, but they could not desert their comrade.|$|R
25|$|Bichier {{opened her}} heart to Fournet. She shared her <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> {{dedicate}} herself to God. He, for his own part, had seen first hand the situation of his rural congregants, who had lost all resources for education in the turmoil of the Revolution. He asked her to open her home for the catechesis of the local children. Elizabeth asked the permission of her mother, who agreed to this project and a small school slowly began to develop at La Guimetière.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, she {{was criticized}} {{by members of}} the black {{community}} for the roles she accepted and for pursuing roles aggressively rather than rocking the Hollywood boat. For example, in The Little Colonel (1935), she played one of the black servants <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> return to the Old South, but her portrayal of Malena in RKO Pictures's Alice Adams angered white Southern audiences, because she stole several scenes from the film's white star, Katharine Hepburn. McDaniel ultimately became best known for playing a sassy and opinionated maid.|$|E
25|$|Hudson {{moved to}} Los Angeles {{to pursue an}} acting career and applied to the University of Southern California's dramatics program, but he was {{rejected}} due to poor grades. He worked as a truck driver for some time, <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> be an actor but with no success in breaking into the movies. After he sent talent scout Henry Willson a picture of himself in 1947, Willson took Hudson on as a client and {{changed his name to}} Rock Hudson, although Hudson later admitted he hated the name. Hudson's name was coined by combining the Rock of Gibraltar and the Hudson River.|$|E

60|$|I now {{understood}} {{full well}} {{what was his}} plan. We were to engage the enemy in a regular battle so that the other sloop, laden with provisions, might succeed in going free.

60|$|She felt, too, {{for those}} fond, {{faithful}} servants, {{to whom she}} was as daylight and sunshine. Children do not usually generalize; but Eva was an uncommonly mature child, {{and the things that}} she had witnessed of the evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by one, into the depths of her thoughtful, pondering heart. She had vague <b>longings</b> <b>to</b> do something for them,--to bless and save not only them, but all in their condition,--longings that contrasted sadly with the feebleness of her little frame.|$|R
25|$|When Ulysses was {{stationed}} on the West coast of California at Fort Humboldt in 1854 {{he had at}} that point been away from his wife and family two years. <b>Longing</b> <b>to</b> return home, and also prompted by rumors of excessive drinking, Ulysses tendered his resignation. Shocked by the news, Jesse intervened, feeling Ulysses was making a terrible mistake, and urged Congressmen Andrew Ellison, and old friend of Jesse's, to get the War Department to order Grant home on recruitment duty instead, or otherwise grant him a six-month leave. Ellison presented the request to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, but the request was denied. This {{would prove to be}} one more example of Jesse's involvement with his son's affairs.|$|E
25|$|After her {{conversion}} to the Bábí faith, the poems of Táhirih flourished. In most {{she talks about}} her <b>longing</b> <b>to</b> meet the Báb. Her poetry illustrates an impressive knowledge of Persian and Arabic literature which Táhirih possessed, seldom seen in a woman in mid-nineteenth century Iran. One {{of the most famous}} poems attributed to her is named Point by Point. Although it is widely considered her signature poem and a masterpiece, it has been claimed by Mohit Tabátabá'i to be older and by someone else – though in making this claim he offered no proof and any argument to the contrary is not possible in Iran. When Táhirih was killed, hostile family members suppressed or destroyed her remaining poems, whilst her others were spread across Iran. It has been suggested that Táhirih had little interest in putting her poems in print. `Abdu'l-Bahá recalls that when he was aged five Táhirih would chant her poetry to him in her beautiful voice. Edward Granville Browne procured her poems from Bábí, Bahá'í and Azali sources and published them in his book A Year Amongst the Persians.|$|E
25|$|In July 1924 when Arthur Dove and Helen Torr sailed into Huntington Harbor aboard their 42-foot yawl, Mona, {{they could}} not have {{anticipated}} the extent to which Long Island’s North Shore would inspire some of their greatest paintings. They lived in Halesite until the Great Depression when both Dove and Torr moved back to the Dove's estate located in Geneva. <b>Longing</b> <b>to</b> be back on Long Island, in 1938 they moved back into their first home, a former post office and general store on Center Shore Road in Centerport, New York. They purchased the house for $980.00. Their tiny, one-room cottage stood {{on the edge of the}} Titus Mill Pond. Almost immediately, Dove was found to have pneumonia; he eventually suffered from a heart attack and was diagnosed with a debilitating kidney disorder. In terrible health for the remainder of his days, he lived quietly, finally about to devote himself entirely to painting, and focusing on the inspiration of his surroundings and his home. Some of the most powerful paintings of his career, including Indian Summer, were painted in Centerport. Torr remained in the house on the millpond but never painted again. After her death in 1967, works by Torr and Dove were hung together in The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1979.|$|E

50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{that was}} {{to become the first}} novel in the Book of Words trilogy was submitted as Immortal <b>Longings</b> <b>to</b> Warner Books in 1993. In a joint essay, The Road to a First Novel, J. V. Jones and Betsy Mitchell describe the editing process that followed the arrival of the manuscript in the publisher's slush pile. The novel was published in 1995 as The Baker's Boy. The Book of Words trilogy was completed in 1997 and followed by a standalone novel, The Barbed Coil the same year. The Sword of Shadows series was launched in 1999 and will eventually contain five books.|$|R
