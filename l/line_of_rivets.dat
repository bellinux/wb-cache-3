40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect <b>of</b> controllable <b>riveting</b> parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality <b>of</b> formed <b>rivet.</b> The quality <b>of</b> a formed <b>rivet</b> is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation <b>of</b> the <b>riveting</b> process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data <b>of</b> <b>riveting</b> and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality <b>of</b> formed <b>rivet</b> head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation <b>of</b> <b>rivet</b> head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry <b>of</b> <b>rivet</b> head is not enough to determine the quality <b>of</b> a <b>riveted</b> joint, because the countersunk rivet head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length <b>of</b> <b>rivet</b> has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R

40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. Blind rivets and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames <b>of</b> this paper. <b>Rivets</b> have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost <b>of</b> <b>riveted</b> connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types <b>of</b> <b>rivets</b> are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind rivets, zinc-coated steel blind rivets, stainless steel blind rivets and blind nuts. The features of each type <b>of</b> <b>rivets</b> are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear <b>of</b> <b>riveted</b> connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types <b>of</b> <b>riveted</b> connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets.
