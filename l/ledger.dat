50|$|Close-studding panels {{create a}} much more narrow space between the timbers: {{anywhere}} from 7 to 16 inches (18 to 40 cm). For this style of panel, weaving is too difficult, so the wattles run horizontally and are known as <b>ledgers.</b> The <b>ledgers</b> are sprung into each upright timber (stud) through a system of augered holes {{on one side and}} short chiseled grooves along the other. The holes (along with holes of square paneling) are drilled at a slight angle towards the outer face of each stud. This allows room for upright hazels to be tied to <b>ledgers</b> from the inside of the building. The horizontal <b>ledgers</b> are placed every two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 metres) with whole hazel rods positioned upright top to bottom and lashed to the <b>ledgers.</b> These hazel rods are generally tied a finger widths apart with 6-8 rods each with a 16-inch (40 cm) width.
