5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> statistics. All three Northern England {{statistical}} regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> at birth in England – male <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. For women, the numbers are much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of these women, less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.|$|E
5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower <b>life</b> <b>expectancy.</b> Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} improvements in <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> of patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) over time, {{but it is not}} clear whether these improvements are explained by changes in baseline clinical characteristics, longer duration on ART, or changes in clinical practices. METHOD Two parametric survival models were fitted to mortality data from South African ART cohorts that had linked patient records to the national vital registration system. The first model estimated mortality by age, sex, cohort, baseline CD 4 count, time since ART initiation and period of ART initiation; the second model included only age, sex, cohort and period of follow-up. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancies</b> were calculated from the estimated mortality rates. RESULTS The first model estimated little change in mortality over time: women starting ART at age 35, at CD 4 counts of 200  cells/μl or higher, had <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> of 32. 7 (95...|$|R
40|$|Healthy <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> {{are almost}} always {{calculated}} by using health data from cross-sectional surveys. This type of calculation is done partly because data from longitudinal surveys are not always available, {{and when they are}} available, they are collected at intervals that are longer than one year. In such cases, collecting health information retrospectively for the years skipped by the survey is useful. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to show how retrospective health information can be used to estimate <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> in different health states. Healthy <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> are estimated with and without using data on retrospective health information, and the corresponding estimates are compared. The two sets of estimates are similar. We conclude that retrospectively assessed health information based on a one-year recall period can be used to estimate years of life in various health states and that estimates based on such information will closely approximate estimates based on concurrent health information...|$|R
