ISBN 9984 – 676 – 87 – 0 The views expressed in this publication {{are those of the}} author, senior econometrist of Monetary Policy Department. The paper has been revised and may differ from the <b>Latvian</b> <b>version</b> of this publication. The author assumes responsibility for any errors or omissions. To determine whether economic progress of a country presents a threat to its macroeco-nomic sustainability, the difference between actual and potential output is usually used in the formulation of the economic policy. A number of methodologies, including the time series method, HP filter approach and CD function, {{have been used}} in the estimation of potential GDP. Potential production factor values were calculated for the needs of the pro-duction function. The data used in the paper lead to an inference that the economic growth depends on increases in capital stock and technological progress, both contributing to labour productivity and offsetting workforce shrinkages...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify, which of the {{following}} two measures: verbal intelligence or measurements of eye movements, is better predictor of reading ability. In addition, the study also investigated the relationships between reading ability, fluid intelligence and measurements of eye movements. Participants of the study (N = 28; mean age = 8. 80; SD =. 41; 54 % boys) were assessed in reading with LMST-I Reading achievement test, verbal and fluid intelligence was measured using two scales – Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual reasoning – from Latvian edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition (WISC- IV, <b>Latvian</b> <b>version),</b> as well as eye tracking was made during reading. The results show that reading ability is better predicted by fixation duration and fixation count measurements of eye movements for 8 - 9 old children, whereas verbal ability in general does not predict reading ability. The better link with level of reading is provided by measurements of eye movements, but not so accurately reflected by verbal ability in appropriate age group, when the acquisition of reading ability still continues. No relationships among children‘s fluid intelligence, reading ability and measurements of eye movements were reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} explores {{differences}} in early literacy skills of Latvian preschool children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) compared to children from general population. The participants were 21 children with diagnosis of Specific developmental disorders {{of speech and}} language (F 80; ICD- 10) and 21 children as matched control group (in each group: mean age= 79 months, 88 % boys). Both samples were selected from the adaptation and standardization study of Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS Next) in Latvia (Good & Kaminski et al., 2011; <b>Latvian</b> <b>version,</b> Rascevska et al., 2013 a). The results show significant differences between two groups in DIBELS Next composite score (t= 3. 09, p<. 01), First Sound Fluency (t = 2. 54, p<. 05), Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (t = 2. 80, p<. 01), Correct Letter Sounds (t = 3. 38, p<. 01) and Whole Words Read (t = 3. 39, p<. 01) from Nonsense Word Fluency. Phoneme awareness represented by first sound and phoneme segmentation fluency and phonological decoding observed during nonsense word reading was poorer for the SLI group, albeit letter naming {{did not differ in}} both groups. No differences in letter naming might be explained due to intensive instruction the children with SLI are receiving in their institution of special education, while children from general population might not have this enhanced support...|$|E
