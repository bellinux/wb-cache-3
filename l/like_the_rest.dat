5|$|Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Ace Attorney series, a {{cross between}} the {{adventure}} game and visual novel genres. The player's goal is to defend their clients in four cases, and prove their innocence. The gameplay is separated into two types of situations: Investigations and trials.|$|E
5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt a blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the playing squad, was told he could find a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Houtman Abrolhos, North Island is Australian territory. It {{is a part}} of Western Australia, {{and falls}} within the {{boundaries}} of the federal Electoral Division of Durack and the state electoral district of Geraldton. It is part of the Houtman Abrolhos Nature Reserve, an A-class reserve managed by Western Australia's Department of Fisheries.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of {{the northeastern}} United States, the {{population}} of Massachusetts has continued {{to grow in the}} past few decades. Massachusetts is the fastest growing state in New England and the 25th fastest growing state in the United States. Population growth was largely due to a relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system in the state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, Vogel State Park {{and the surrounding area}} consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1978, Tōei {{released}} a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man TV series at the Tōei Cartoon Festival. The film {{was directed by}} Kōichi Takemoto, who also directed eight episodes of the TV series. The week after the film's release, a character introduced in the film, Jūzō Mamiya (played by Noboru Nakaya), began appearing in episodes of the TV series. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the series, the film was made available for streaming on Marvel's official website in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Salta, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Solway plain, has an {{oceanic climate}} (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the substructure {{is located on the}} pyramid's northern side and consists of a descending passage leading to a T-shaped chamber. This chamber was located under the tip of the pyramid and is oriented on an east–west axis <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the queen's pyramid complex. It has a pented roof made of large limestone blocks, a construction technique common to all pyramid chambers of the 5th dynasty. The substructure is thus a scaled-down version of Userkaf's without the magazines.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the Bleach anime series was {{directed}} by Noriyuki Abe and produced by Studio Pierrot. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the series, it follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki, but instead of adapting Tite Kubo's Bleach manga, it features an original, self-contained story arc. The twenty-eight episodes form the , which focuses on {{the introduction of the}} Bount, a race of humans that consume human souls to extend their lives, and their conflicts with Ichigo Kurosaki and his allies.|$|E

5|$|Both ships served {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they {{operated}} against Russian {{forces in the}} Black Sea. They were primarily tasked with supporting Ottoman forces ashore, though Muin-i Zafer also helped to defend the port of Sulina. After the war, both vessels were placed in reserve, and saw no further activity until 1897, when they were mobilized {{at the start of}} the Greco-Turkish War. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Ottoman fleet, both ships were in poor condition and were unable to be used offensively.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where Lüft-ü Celil was sunk by a Russian {{artillery}} battery on the Danube. Hifz-ur Rahman engaged Russian minelayers {{at the mouth}} of the Danube but otherwise saw little action. She survived the war and was laid up for the following twenty years. She was mobilized at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Ottoman fleet, was in poor condition. The ship was eventually sold in 1909 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, who served as a deputy to the national congress, was, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political reform party formed in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} highly {{variable}} terrain, so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, {{although most of the}} time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{first started}} writing the script {{in the summer}} of 2008, when they were {{in the early stages of}} conceiving the series. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the series, the pilot was filmed in the same mockumentary style as The Office, the NBC comedy series also {{directed}} by Daniels. About one month before the pilot aired, a focus group report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was leaked to the media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was not ready for prime-time television. The pilot episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Indiana, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the nation, was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana. Urbanization declined. Governor Paul V. McNutt's administration struggled to build from scratch a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were cut drastically {{in response to the}} Depression. The state government was completely reorganized. McNutt also enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law {{to put an end to}} worker strikes.|$|E

5|$|Hifz-ur Rahman {{was laid}} up in Constantinople. She was refit at the Imperial Arsenal in 18911894, but was {{nevertheless}} in poor condition by {{the outbreak of}} the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the ancient Ottoman ironclad fleet. As a result, the fleet was kept safely behind the Dardanelles forts and it saw no action. The ship remained in service for another decade until she was decommissioned in 1909; she was sold in November that year to ship breakers and thereafter dismantled.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Toronto City Council again {{proposed}} {{to extend the}} line northeastward {{as a replacement for}} the aging Scarborough RT. In 2006, this proposal was then altered when Scarborough councillors agreed to support plans to refurbish the existing line using other light-metro options for Scarborough. Using heavy-rail rapid transit <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Toronto subway in Scarborough was not yet examined. In 2007, mayor David Miller included the refurbishment of the Scarborough RT using modern light rail transit as part of his Transit City plan.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} intake, by 1937 there were 201 undergraduates; {{it was a}} uniform {{selection}} that was almost completely middle class, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the University. Over 60% of entrants came from independent schools, {{perhaps because of the}} £250 a year cost of reading towards a degree. It had, unlike some other college, students from several other nations: Muhammad Aslam Khan Khattak and Abbas Khaleeli from British India among them. Students were varied: Baptist Thomas George Cowling became an astronomer and member of the Royal Society, in contrast, Jew Paul Dehn {{went on to become a}} film critic and screenwriter. Other alumni of this period include Charles Langbridge Morgan, Edward Atiyah and William Golding.|$|E
