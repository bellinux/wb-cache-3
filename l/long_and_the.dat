5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bony palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} any color or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly , the neck is arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E

Though both films were on a split reel, sometimes the films were advertised independently or listed Everybody Saves Father only. Theaters showing the one or possibly both films are known in North Carolina Indiana, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and California. A surviving nitrate print of The Only Girl in Camp was sold on eBay in 2009. The film was purchased and deposited in the Library of Congress for preservation.|$|E

For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E
5|$|In Variety opinion, Johansson's {{roles in}} Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring {{established}} her {{as among the}} most versatile actresses of her generation. Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film The Perfect Score, the drama A Love Song for Bobby <b>Long,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> drama A Good Woman—were critical and commercial failures. Co-starring with John Travolta, Johansson played a discontented and suspicious teenager in A Love Song for Bobby Long, {{which is based on}} the novel Off Magazine Street by Ronald Everett Capps. Variety David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.|$|E

5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis {{are flat}} on top, {{especially}} {{over the back}} of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> associated femur is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length.

In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261mm (10in), whereas it averaged 301mm (12in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269mm (10.5in) and 305mm (12in) in the Kangaroo Island emu. Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.|$|E

5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tip of the upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles.

5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately <b>long</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distal elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|This tiling {{is called}} the Pythagorean tiling {{because it has been}} used as the basis of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem by the ninth-century Arabic {{mathematician}}s Al-Nayrizi and Thābit ibn Qurra, and by the 19th-century British amateur mathematician Henry Perigal. If the sides of the two squares forming the tiling are the numbers a and b, then the closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle having sides a and b. For instance, in the illustration to the left, the two squares in the Pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> side length of the tiles in the overlaying square tiling is 13, based on the Pythagorean triple (5,12,13).|$|E

5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E
