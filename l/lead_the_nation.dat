Furthermore, Dewey's non-interventionist stance became problematic when Germany quickly conquered France, and seemed poised to invade Britain. As a result, many Republicans switched to Wendell Willkie, who was a decade older and supported aid to the Allies fighting Germany. Willkie lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the general election.|$|E

25|$|The {{third period}} of Black {{nationalism}} arose during the post-Reconstruction era, particularly among various African-American clergy circles. Separated circles were already established and accepted because African-Americans had long endured {{the oppression of}} slavery and Jim Crowism in the United States since its inception. The clerical phenomenon led {{to the birth of}} a modern Black nationalism that stressed the need to separate from non-blacks and to build separated communities to promote racial pride and to collectivize resources. The new ideology became the philosophy of groups like the Moorish Science Temple and the Nation of Islam. By 1930, Wallace Fard Muhammad had founded the Nation of Islam. His method to spread information about the Nation of Islam used unconventional tactics to recruit individuals in Detroit, Michigan. Later on, Elijah Muhammad would <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> of Islam becoming mentors of people like Malcolm X. Although the 1960s brought a period of heightened religious, cultural and political nationalism, still it was Black nationalism that would lead the promotion of Afrocentrism.|$|E

According to historian Doron Ben-Atar, [...] "Jefferson gambled [...] commerce {{could be used as}} an instrument for forcing the belligerent nations to do America justice and to respect the republic's honor". The Embargo Act of 1807, which virtually sealed the U.S. off from the outside world, has been cited as the most dramatic example of the failure of Jefferson's [...] "inflated assessment" [...] of American power—a failure the president never fully grasped, and which helped <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> into the War of 1812.|$|E

500|$|As the [...] presidential {{election}} of 1792 approached, Washington, {{pleased with the}} progress his administration had made in establishing a strong, stable federal government, was planning to retire rather than seek a second term. He complained of old age, sickness, the in-fighting plaguing his cabinet, and the increasing hostility of the partisan press. However, {{the members of his}} cabinet—especially Jefferson and Hamilton—worked diligently through the summer and fall to persuade Washington not to retire. They apprised him of the potential impact the French Revolutionary Wars might have on the country, and insisted that only someone with his popularity and moderation could <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> effectively during the volatile times ahead. In the end, [...] "Washington never announced his candidacy in the election of 1792," [...] writes historian John Ferling, [...] "he simply never said that he would not consider a second term." ...|$|E

500|$|George did not {{consider}} the peace with France as real; in his view it was an [...] "experiment". In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and {{at the height of}} the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. The Times said, [...] "The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression." [...] A courtier wrote on 13 November that, [...] "The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning". George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, [...] "We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them."
