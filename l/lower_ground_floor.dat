25|$|By 1975 it {{was being}} used by the Social Work Department of Strathclyde Regional Council as an {{occupational}} day centre. In 1982 a decision was taken to sell it on the open market. This proved controversial—the residents of Pollokshields protested due to its connection to the heritage of the town and the historical significance to the area. Further protests ensued so a charitable trust was formed to ensure that the building would continue to be publicly owned. The Trust acquired the building for £1 in 1986. Only in 1991 was the title transferred with the condition that the derelict lodge house be restored within five years. Historic Scotland supported the heritage campaign as well as other organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, Glasgow City Council, the Glasgow Development Agency and the local community and so the lodge house and the ground floor of the Hall were completely refurbished and reopened around 1997. The <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> has since attracted further funding and what was once little more than cellar space has been converted to a contemporary conference room, which can be directly accessed from the outside.|$|E

In May 2011, the British fashion retailer Superdry announced it would move into the building, paying £12m for the lease. In return, Austin Reed moved to a former Aquascutum shop {{on the other side}} of the road. In 2016, Austin Reed filed for administration, ending over 100 years' presence on Regent Street.|$|E

5000|$|The theatre and cinema {{closed in}} 1939 with the {{outbreak}} of World War II, with the building {{being used as a}} canteen for troops. The building suffered major damage in the storms of 1996 with the glass canopy over the entrance being destroyed and flood damage to the hall. The building was restored for use as an amusement arcade and then a public house, at one time called the Mambo bar. It currently operates under its original name, [...] "The Queen's Hall," [...] as a pub. The pub closed in 2015. The lease was sold in 2012 for an undisclosed sum. It incorporated uppwer and <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> with the balcony set up as a VIP area. There were also a kitchen and washing up area with a managers flat above.

50|$|At the {{southern}} end of Upper Street is a former tram shed, which was originally built in 1850 as a tram station, used for commuter service to the City. By the 1940s the service had ceased, and it was converted to an electricity substation, which was then closed by the 1970s. Following some years of lying derelict, it was reopened on 14 November 1979 as The Mall Antiques Arcade, and at its height housed over 35 dealers on its <b>ground</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors.</b> The building also housed other businesses, such as a restaurant in its upper floors, but the mall closed in 2008. Since 2013, the building has housed several chains. It is currently a sofa.com outlet.

5000|$|In 19th-century London, many {{buildings}} were built {{with the main}} entrance floor a metre above <b>ground,</b> and the <b>floor</b> below that being two metres below ground. This was done partly for aesthetics, and partly to allow access between the lower lever and the street without going through the main floor. In this situation, the lower level is called <b>Lower</b> <b>Ground,</b> the main <b>floor</b> is called Upper <b>Ground,</b> and <b>floors</b> above it are numbered serially from 1. There {{may also be a}} storage floor called [...] "Cellar" [...] below <b>Lower</b> <b>Ground.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{second phase}} of {{building}} at Bedlay {{took place in the}} late 17th century, with a large extension added to the west. This extension is of the same height as the original building, with a single room on each floor. Round towers finish off both western corners of the extension. Because the extension was built on <b>lower</b> <b>ground,</b> an extra <b>floor</b> was created at the lower level, accessed from the <b>ground</b> <b>floor,</b> and including a hidden room beneath one of the towers.|$|R

50|$|The {{antiques}} {{market was}} founded in the 1960s, {{in conjunction with the}} Metropolitan Borough of Islington by John Payton. The venture was initially successful, attracting over 350 traders, but recently the centre of Islington has undergone regeneration, leading to higher rents being asked at the renewal of leases. Following some years of lying derelict, a former tram shed was reopened on 14 November 1979 as The Mall Antiques Arcade, and at its height housed over 35 dealers on its <b>ground</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors.</b> The building also housed other businesses, such as a restaurant in its upper floors, but the mall closed in 2008. In 2013 it became a Jack Wills shop, and as of 2014 is currently a Superdry store. The closure of the arcade reflects the {{reduction in the number of}} antique traders in the nearby Camden Passage, though a weekend antiques market is still held there. The building is a Grade II listed building. Its severe windowless brick aspect is dictated by its original use, English Heritage describe its architecture as influenced by, and a tribute to, Newgate Prison (by George Dance the Younger), which had been demolished in 1902, three years before this building's construction by the LCC.|$|R

A carport was added. Windows were modified so that the occupants could open and close them to control the internal environment. [...] The interior is designed around a central staircase in the dodecagonal prism structure. Most rooms are wedge shaped.|$|R
