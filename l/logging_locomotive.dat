50|$|Geared {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for power, not for speed, and were popular with logging companies {{who had to}} move heavy trains up and down grades safely. Four types of <b>logging</b> <b>locomotives</b> were utilized {{in the early twentieth}} century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which actuate rods attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of actuating rods for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with a crown gear. The Heisler configured geared-locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a central axle. This central axle was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the <b>logging</b> <b>locomotives</b> is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a central axle, thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order.|$|R

50|$|Weyerhaeuser Corporation {{operated}} the line almost exclusively for twelve years. The only other railroad activity the Weyerhaeuser Corporation tolerated was {{the development of}} the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad. The Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad was the brainchild of L. T. “Tom” Murray Jr., President of the Murray Pacific Corporation. The Mount Rainier Scenic was, and is today, an excursion road that shuttles passengers about seven miles on former Tacoma Eastern tracks through the foothills of Mount Rainier using antique train equipment. The primary emphasis of the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad’s historic collection is logging railroad equipment. The Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad has grown since 1980 from being a one-locomotive railroad to the world’s only rail heritage group with one of each type of <b>logging</b> <b>locomotive</b> in working order.|$|E
50|$|The {{top of the}} {{mountain}} is a grassy bald that affords a panoramic view. The origin of grassy balds in southern Haywood county is a result of extensive clear-cut <b>logging</b> and <b>locomotive</b> fires in 1925 and 1942. These fires burned deep down into the mineral-rich topsoil slowing reforestation or stopping it altogether. Examples of this can also be found on many of its neighboring peaks and ridges. These features contribute to the area's popularity, but foot traffic also causes some ecological damage to the ecosystem. The Art Loeb Trail follows the grassy ridge of Black Balsam Knob.|$|R

50|$|The first mill {{was founded}} by Albert B. Klise in 1895, and a small town grew up around it. It was a {{large-scale}} operation that deemed a logging railway necessary. A railroad, Sturgeon Bay Railway, was built from the shore of Lake Michigan east about 14 mi to within 2 mi of Levering. The railroad was standard gauge and was known to operate at least two Shay locomotives: SN 1984, built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1907, the same year the railroad was built, and SN 155, built by Lima Locomotive Works in 1886. The inventor of the Shay Locomotive, Ephraim Shay, was a local in the area, living in Harbor Springs about 20 mi to the south. They were also known to have operated a Heisler <b>logging</b> <b>locomotive.</b> A visible remnant of the railroad grade is one quarter mile east of the Sturgeon Bay Trail and M-119 intersection. The grade {{was used for the}} power lines from this point out to Lake Michigan, and the grades can be seen at many places in the area. The grade was still included on state surveyor maps as late as 1957.|$|E
50|$|Many other model {{engineers}} have contributed numerous designs notable for their enduring popularity. Prior to {{the appearance of}} Engineering in Miniature magazine in 1979 and Model Engineers' Workshop in 1990, these authors wrote almost exclusively in Model Engineer. Among these, Edgar T. Westbury produced many internal combustion engine designs, W.J. Hughes designed many agricultural and traction engine models. Colonel C. E. Bowden {{will be remembered as}} one of the most prolific experimenters with model aircraft, model boats and radio control, particularly his successes in powered model flight co-operating with E. T. Westbury, who made the Atom Minor engine that powered several of his early models. Martin Evans produced a great many more model locomotive designs, George H. Thomas specialised in designs for workshop accessories, Tubal Cain (T. D. Walshaw) developed a number of stationary engine designs, and Claude B. Reeve produced many clock designs. Ian Bradley and Norman Hallows wrote individually and together under the pen-name of Duplex on a wide range of topics, notably finely finished and ingenious tooling. Don Young contributed locomotive designs to Model Engineer and then published his own quarterly live steam magazine Locomotives Large and Small from 1979 until his death in 1994. More recently, Kozo Hiraoka has authored several series of <b>logging</b> <b>locomotive</b> articles in the U.S. magazine Live Steam.|$|E
50|$|Certain early British steam {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} powered tenders. As well as holding coal and water, these had wheels powered from the locomotive to provide greater tractive effort. These were abandoned for economic reasons; railwaymen working on locomotives so equipped demanded extra pay {{as they were}} effectively running two locomotives. However, the concept was tried again on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway's River Mite, and the Garratt locomotive {{may be seen as}} an extension of this principle. Powered tenders were also seen on the 2-8-8-8-2 and 2-8-8-8-4 locomotives in the United States, but these experiments were not considered successful. Powered tenders were used extensively on geared <b>logging</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> like the Shay locomotive, Climax locomotive, and Heisler locomotive where the steep grades and heavy trains necessitated the extra tractive effort.|$|R
