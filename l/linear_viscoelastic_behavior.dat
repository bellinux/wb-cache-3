40|$|The <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> of an {{ordering}} polystyrene latex during steady {{shear flow}} has been investigated. In this study a home-made instrument {{has been used}} that superimposes a small-amplitude oscillatory shear orthogonal onto the steady shear flow. The measurements {{can be interpreted as}} due to the coexistence of two phases under flow. For increasing shear rate the ordered (or solidlike) phase melts away until the suspension becomes completely disordered (or fluidlike). A model is presented in which the fluid is conceived as a viscoelastic matrix containing spherical viscoelastic domains.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} our experimental {{testing of}} <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> creep <b>behaviors</b> in Hami Melon. Experimental data shows that Hami Melon has complex viscoelastic property {{which can not}} be well described by the standard model. Consequently, this study develops a fractional derivative model to describe such complex <b>viscoelastic</b> creep <b>behaviors</b> of Hami Melon. The analytical creep function of the proposed fractional <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> models is derived via the Boltzmann superposition principle and discrete inverse Laplace transform. And then such analytical solutions are used to fit the experimental data of viscoelastic Hami Melon. Our study shows that the present fractional <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> model with merely three parameters is more efficient and accurate than the generalized Kelvin viscoelastic model of six parameters to describe the stress—strain constitutive relations of Hami Melon. It is noted that the present fractional model with adjustable parameters {{can also be used to}} describe creep damage...|$|R

EVA with vinyl acetate (VA) content of 18 and 28 % by weight and commercially modified montmorillonite clay (Cloisite (R) 30 B) were melt blended in a twin-screw extruder. Nanocomposites of 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 % by weight were produced. Wide angle X-ray scattering {{was used to}} ascertain the degree of layer swelling that {{could be attributed to}} the intercalation of polymer chains into the interlayer of the silicates. Transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the dispersion and extent of exfoliation of the layered silicates in the polymer matrix. All nanocomposites were found to have mixed intercalated/exfoliated morphologies. Both storage and loss moduli and complex viscosity showed improvement at all frequencies tested with increase in silicate loading. Terminal zone behavior was also shown to disappear gradually with silicate content. Increase in silicate loading had caused the divergence of viscosity profile from low-frequency Newtonian plateau to non-Newtonian slope corresponding to a possible finite yield stress. The gradual disappearances of terminal zone and Newtonian homopolymer-like characteristics with silicate loading were attributed to the formation of lattice spanning three-dimensional network structures...|$|R

Furthermore the variations found within one thrombusare of the same order of magnitude as the variation between patients. To study the non-linear regime, stress relaxation experiments are performed. To describe the phenomena observed experimentally,a non-linear multi mode model is presented. The parameters for this model are obtained by fitting this model successfully to the experiments. The model can not only describe the average stress response for all thrombus samples but also the highest and lowest stress responses.

As a preliminary step to obtain the time-temperature master curve, {{as well as to}} characterize the changes in matrix dominated properties over storage time, physical aging effects were evaluated on both systems using the short-term test method established by Struik. The results showed that the surface treatment carried out in the SM-CF improved fiber-matrix adhesion, enhancing the mechanical performance of CF/PPS composites but with minor effects on the creep response.

40|$|AbstractOpen cell {{materials}} with cubic anisotropy and structures made thereof are investigated {{with respect to}} their <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> properties, in particular their relaxation behavior. The study is concerned with the prediction of the effective behavior which results from the isotropic bulk material properties as well as the cellular architecture. Finite Element Method simulations of three-dimensional structures are employed to predict the effective response {{to a wide range of}} loading modes in the time domain. For predicting the properties of the cellular materials and structures by the Finite Element Method different modeling strategies are employed. The first approach is a periodic unit cell method modeling an infinite medium by means of periodic boundary conditions. This way the entire effective <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> constitutive <b>behavior</b> can be computed. However, it is not possible to capture effects as being attributed to traction free faces and load introduction in specimens or structures. A second approach follows to account for these effects by generating finite sample models to represent situations which occur in experimental testing. Finally, an analytical constitutive material law is developed to model linear viscoelasticity for cubic anisotropy in the time domain. It is implemented into the commercial Finite Element software ABAQUS/Standard and the material parameters are gained from the unit cell investigations. This enables the simulation of structures, parts, and components which consist or contain such cellular materials...|$|R

30|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{model is}} by far the most widely used for modeling the mechanical behavior of wood. In fact, the <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> is represented generally by constructing a model consisting of an assembly of springs and dashpots. It is therefore an analog and symbolic model represented by a combination of springs and dashpots in series and in parallel more or less complex (Foudjet 1986; Placet 2006; Dlouhà 2009). The works of Haque et al. (2000), devoted to the comparison of the relevance of these different models plus an empirical model based on the equation of Bailer-Norton empirical model, it was found that the Kelvin model seems to be the best suited to interpolate the experimental curves (Moutee 2006; Husson 2009). Thus, several authors adopt the Kelvin’s model, or more precisely the series connection of n Kelvin elements to restore the viscoelastic behavior of timber in a creep test. However, identifying problems quickly become insoluble because one needs to determine at least as many coefficients as elements introduced, which may be unworkable especially in practice just for the fact that these parameters highly depend on the moisture and temperature. In this context, Foudjet (1986) showed a rheological model with maximum two (2) Kelvin-Voigt elements connected in series which was widely enough to represent the own <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> of wood.|$|E

Based on some simple assumptions, this combination predicts satisfactorily the rheological behavior of asphaltite-modified bitumens and, consequently, it can be used for dosage purposes. Beyond asphaltite-modified bitumens, the modeling approach developed here can be applied on reclaimed asphalt-modified bitumens, polymer-modified bitumens, and on blends of partially miscible polymers presenting a suspended droplet morphology...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{consisted of}} two major parts, first modeling and simulation of the combined effects of aging and damage on polymer composites and secondly an experimental phase examining composite response at elevated temperatures, again activating both aging and damage. For the simulation, a damage model for polymeric composite laminates operating at elevated temperatures was developed. <b>Viscoelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> of the material is accounted for via the correspondence principle and a variational approach is adopted to compute the temporal stresses within the laminate. Also, the effect of physical aging on ply level stress and on overall laminate behavior is included. An important feature of the model is that damage evolution predictions for viscoelastic laminates can be made. This allows us to track the mechanical response of the laminate up to large load levels though {{within the confines of}} <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> constitutive <b>behavior.</b> An experimental investigation of microcracking and physical aging effects in polymer matrix composites was also pursued. The goal {{of the study was to}} assess the impact of aging on damage accumulation, in ten-ns of microcracking, and the impact of damage on aging and <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>behavior.</b> The testing was performed both at room and elevated temperatures on [+/- 45 / 903](sub s) and [02 / 903](sub s) laminates, both containing a set of 90 deg plies centrally located to facilitate investigation of microcracking. Edge replication and X-ray-radiography were utilized to quantify damage. Sequenced creep tests were performed to characterize viscoelastic and aging parameters. Results indicate that while the aging times studied have limited]Influence on damage evolution, elevated temperature and viscoelastic effects have a profound effect on the damage mode seen. Some results are counterintuitive, including the lower strain to failure for elevated temperature tests and the catastrophic failure mode observed for the [+/- 45 / 9 O 3](sub s), specimens. The fracture toughness for transverse cracks increases with increasing temperature for both systems: transverse cracking was completely absent prior to failure in [+/- 45 / 903](sub s), and was suppressed for [02 / 903](sub s). No significant effect of damage on aging or viscoelastic parameters was observed...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework is}} developed {{for measuring the}} dilatational rheological properties of gas-liquid interfaces by analyzing small amplitude radial oscillations of an air bubble blown into a liquid substrate. Contrary to earlier analyses which customarily require the bubble radius change during the oscillation, {{the present study is}} based on the readily measurable quantities of bubble pressure change during the oscillation and phase lag between the bubble pressure and the relative displacement of the oscillation generating device. To expose the extensive interrelationships among the various experimental parameters that {{have a profound effect on}} bubble dynamics, the analysis is focused on the influence of the variable gas volumes at the sides of the differential pressure transducer, the gas phase compressibility, the dynamic behavior of the transducer membrane and the bubble surface being only a segment of a sphere, as they play a key role in the response of the system. A <b>linear</b> <b>viscoelastic</b> surface <b>behavior</b> is assumed which includes intrinsic surface viscosities and Gibbs elasticities. New data are deduced from previous measurements on the dilatational surface properties of stearic acid monolayers which, being practically insoluble in water, offer an ideal experimental system without the complications due to bulk-interface interactions.
