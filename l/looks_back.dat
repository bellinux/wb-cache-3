5|$|Despite early {{interest}} in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, Exiles, begun shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> to The Dead (the final story in Dubliners) and forward to Ulysses, which Joyce began {{around the time of the}} play's composition.|$|E

She {{reflects on the}} nature of her marriages and <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle. She explains to the reader how personal achievement may result from the allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity inherent in the mystique of celebrity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the bridge}} sequence, Minogue and Fletcher park {{in front of}} a shop, and Minogue seductively tries to {{distract}} the cashier outside by staring and posing at him, while Fletcher tries to steal money from the till. In the last scenes, Minogue is in another outfit trying to walk out of an alley with a bag of money, but sees a police car driving towards her and tries to walk off. Fletcher is caught by police and is escorted into the police car while yelling at Minogue.

Both Höpfl and Frühwirth accompanied Nowitzki throughout his career, collecting interviews and photos used in the book. It <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on the 2011 NBA Finals but also has a strong focus on Nowitzki's relation to his hometown Würzburg and his career progression beginning there. The book features insights from former coaches, family members, and friends.|$|E

5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species.|$|E
5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he <b>looks</b> <b>back,</b> and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

25|$|In his {{characteristic}} fashion, Hazlitt <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> to {{an earlier}} subject of these essays and compares Mackintosh with Coleridge. While the latter's genius often strays from reality, his imagination creates something new. Mackintosh, on the other hand, with a similarly impressive command of his subject matter, mechanically presents the thinking of others. There is no integration of his learning with his own thinking, no passion, nothing fused {{in the heat of}} imagination.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the performance of}} dingoes (Canis dingo) on the rope-pulling task, previously used by Miklo´si et al. (Curr Biol 13 : 763 – 766, 2003) to highlight a key distinction in the problem-solving behaviour of wolves compared to dogs when {{in the company of}} humans. That is, when dogs were confronted with an unsolvable task, following a solvable version of the task they <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> or gazed at the human, whereas, wolves did not. We replicated the rope-pulling task using 12 sanctuary-housed dingoes and used the Miklo´si et al. (Curr Biol 13 : 763 – 766, 2003) definition of <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> behaviour to analyse the data. However, at least three different types of <b>look</b> <b>backs</b> were observed in our study. We, then developed a more accurate operational definition of <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> behaviour that was task specific and reanalysed the data. We found that the operational definition employed greatly influences the results, with vague definitions potentially overestimating the prevalence of <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> behaviour. Thus, caution must be taken when interpreting the results of studies utilising <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> as behaviour linked to assistance seeking during problem solving. We present a more stringent definition and make suggestions for future research...|$|R

The other Escobar in the film title refers to former Colombian defender Andrés Escobar (no relation to Pablo), who was shot and killed one month after conceding an own goal that contributed to the elimination of the Colombian national team from the 1994 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
