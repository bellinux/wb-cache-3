40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{focuses on}} a design of <b>loadbearing</b> <b>frame</b> and raising {{mechanism}} of straddle carrier, which is used in container terminals. It’s made for transport of container {{on the surface of}} terminal. It’s about designer calculation of individual parts of crane frames, applicability of designed parts is checked by strength calculation. Raising mechanism is designed with drive of stroke. Outputs of this bachelor’s thesis are drawings...|$|E
40|$|This Report {{presents}} the results from substantial experimental studies of sound transmission, together with an explanation of calculation procedures to predict the sound transmission between adjacent spaces in a building whose walls and floors have cold-formed steel (CFS) framing. This first edition contains mainly data for <b>loadbearing</b> steel <b>framing</b> formed from sheet steel with thickness from 1. 37 mm (16 gauge) to 0. 94 mm (20 gauge). Non-loadbearing CFS studs formed from thinner steel (nominally 0. 54 mm) are also commonly used {{but these are not}} included in the data tables for sound transmission through wall assemblies in this Report.

50|$|Interior {{partitions}} supporting floor, ceiling or roof loads {{are called}} loadbearing walls; others are called non-loadbearing or simply partitions. Interior <b>loadbearing</b> walls are <b>framed</b> {{in the same}} way as exterior walls. Studs are usually 1.5 x 3.5 in lumber spaced at 16 in on center. This spacing may be changed to 12 or 24 in depending on the loads supported and the type and thickness of the wall finish used.|$|R
40|$|RSUM This paper {{presents}} an analytical thermal-structural model for <b>loadbearing</b> lightweight steel <b>framed</b> (LSF) walls {{exposed to fire}} on one side. The model reflects temperature and deformation data from six standard fire resistance tests conducted recently by the National Research Council of Canada {{in partnership with the}} North American steel industry. Some characteristic patterns in thermal transmission and structural behaviour are discussed. Temperature histories across LSF assemblies are simulated numerically by explicit integration of transient heat transfer equations. The apparent thermal properties are calibrated for gypsum board and three types of insulation. Analytical procedures are presented to simulate lateral deformation histories and predict structural failure times. The model illustrates how different heating regimes in cold formed steel studs cause different structural failure modes...|$|R
