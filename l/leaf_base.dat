5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E

When one receives the ring as an undergraduate, it is worn with the logo facing the heart to inspire and motivate continued academic achievement.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples include}} the half-domes of the late 13th century tomb of Balban and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes. Under the Lodi dynasty {{there was a large}} proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period. The first major Mughal building is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs. The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture {{can be seen in the}} dome shape of the Taj Mahal: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the finial with lotus <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> is derived from Hindu temples. The Gol Gumbaz, or Round Dome, is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters. The dome was the most technically advanced built in the Deccan. The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the tomb of Safdar Jang (1753–54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.|$|E
500|$|Ficus aurea is a tree {{which may}} reach heights of [...] It is monoecious: each tree bears {{functional}} {{male and female}} flowers. The {{size and shape of}} the leaves is variable. Some plants have leaves that are usually less than 10cm (4in) long while others have leaves that are larger. The shape of the leaves and of the <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> also varies—some plants have leaves that are oblong or elliptic with a wedge-shaped to rounded base, while others have heart-shaped or ovate leaves with cordate to rounded bases. F. aurea has paired figs which are green when unripe, turning yellow as they ripen. They differ in size (0.6–0.8cm , about 1cm , or 1.0–1.2cm [...] in diameter); figs are generally sessile, but in parts of northern Mesoamerica figs are borne on short stalks known as peduncles.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{importance}} of leaf choice in their reproductive success, sugarbeet root aphid stem mothers are highly territorial and will compete with each other for the chance to form galls at the bases of the largest leaves. This competition usually takes the form of kicking and shoving contests; two stem mothers will align rear-to-rear and push against the other forcefully using their hind legs. The winner of these contests then settles closest to the <b>leaf</b> <b>base,</b> and the loser settles more distally. If the basal stem mother dies or is removed, the distal stem mother often moves down {{to the base of the}} gall to replace her. These territorial contests are unusually long, and can span the course of several days. A side effect of this intense territorial competition is the creation of a [...] "floater population" [...] of unsettled stem mothers searching for unoccupied leaves.|$|E

2500|$|P. elizabethiae {{was first}} {{collected}} by Ricardo Zirahuen Ortega from the Moctezuma River canyon during {{an environmental impact}} assessment survey for the Zimapán Dam in 1990. [...] Ortega, not realizing he had discovered a new taxon, identified his collections as the somewhat similar P. cyclosecta. [...] Mexican botanist Sergio Zamudio Ruiz observed the same population and others nearby in 1996, {{and came to the}} same conclusion. [...] A third botanist, Johan van Marm, then indicated that he had also observed Pinguicula in the canyon system, but assumed he had discovered a range extension for P. colimensis. [...] In 1998 Zamudio had the opportunity of comparing the two established species with the plants from the Moctezuma River and Arroyo Toliman canyon systems, and concluded that they were indeed three distinct species. [...] P. elizabethiae was described in 1999 and placed in the section Orcheosanthus along with other species with purple, deeply bilabiate corollas with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not protruding past this tube. [...] Morphological similarities have been noted between this species and [...] P. colimensis and P. cyclosecta, though differences in {{the size and shape of}} the summer leaves, presence of large multi-cellular trichomes at the <b>leaf</b> <b>base,</b> and other morphological features can be used to distinguish the geographically isolated species in cultivation.|$|E
2500|$|Meesia triqueta {{grows in}} small tufts or cushions. The plants, often large, are acrocarpous and dioicous. In color they are dark-green to grass-green above, {{occasionally}} red-brown below due to dense rhizoids. The plant's stems are not branched or little branched, pale-brown to yellow-brown, closely foliate, and 2–14cm high. [...] Its leaves are decurrent, squarrose (spreading) when moist, triangular to ovate to lanceolate, somewhat crispate (contorted), 2–3½ mm long, and tristichous (in three obvious ranks). The leaf margins are sharply serrate or denticulate {{to the base}} or nearly so, plane or sometimes recurved {{in the middle of}} the leaf. The costa is relatively narrow (less than 1/5 the width of the <b>leaf</b> <b>base),</b> subpercurrent to percurrent, gradually tapering at distal end.

[...] The capsule is asymmetrical, somewhat pyriform, 2¾–5½ mm long including the neck; the hypophysis (neck) is long (comprising up to ½ of capsule length), moderately well-defined, not much wrinkled when dry; the urn is oblong to short-cylindric, arcuate and asymmetric, brown to yellow-brown, up to 4mm long, and when dry, wrinkled but not regularly sulcate.

50|$|The cotyledon, the {{primordial}} Angiosperm leaf {{consists of a}} proximal <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> or hypophyll and a distal hyperphyll. In moncots the hypophyll {{tends to be the}} dominant part in contrast to other angiosperms. From these, considerable diversity arises. Mature monocot leaves are generally narrow and linear, forming a sheathing around the stem at its base, although there are many exceptions. Leaf venation is of the striate type, mainly arcuate-striate or longitunally striate (parallel), less often palmate-striate or pinnate-striate with the leaf veins emerging at the <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> and then running together at the apices. There is usually only one leaf per node because the <b>leaf</b> <b>base</b> encompasses more than half the circumference.
