5|$|Organ pipes {{are divided}} into flue pipes and reed pipes {{according}} to their design and timbre. Flue pipes produce sound by forcing air through a fipple, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recorder, whereas reed pipes produce sound via a beating reed, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clarinet or saxophone.|$|E
5|$|Shrikes are {{passerine}} birds {{known for}} the habit of catching other birds and small animals and impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns. A shrike's beak is hooked, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical bird of prey.|$|E

50|$|Civets have {{a broadly}} cat-like general appearance, though the muzzle is {{extended}} and often pointed, rather <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> otter or a mongoose. They range in length from about 17 to 28 in (excluding their long tails) and in weight from about 3 to 10 lb.|$|R
50|$|A Denver {{firefighter}} {{known as}} Merriman invented an early hose mask that {{was featured in}} the January 7, 1892 issue of Fireman's Herald. This respirator featured <b>a</b> tube <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elephant trunk connected to an air hose that ran parallel to the firefighter's water hose.|$|R
5|$|Shrikes are {{passerine}} {{birds with}} {{a habit of}} catching other birds and small animals and impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns. A typical shrike's beak is hooked, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird of prey. There are about 30 species worldwide, three {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|This black, {{white and}} pink bird is quite unmistakable, {{especially}} in its erratic flight, which is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant butterfly. It {{is the only}} member of its family. The song is a trisyllabic oop-oop-oop, which gives rise to its English and scientific names.|$|E
50|$|Alexander Borodin is also {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} the aldol reaction together with Wurtz. In 1872 Borodin announced to the Russian Chemical Society the discovery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new byproduct in aldehyde reactions with properties <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alcohol, and he noted similarities with compounds already discussed in publications by Wurtz from the same year.|$|R
25|$|The waitoreke {{is usually}} {{described}} as a small otter-like creature sometimes {{as big as a}} cat. It is described as having brownish fur and short legs. The sightings usually place the creature near or in the water on the South Island of New Zealand. Its fur is described as being short <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> otter.|$|R
50|$|Eiduk is {{best remembered}} for his poetry extolling the {{political}} {{terror of the}} Soviet secret police. In Moscow, Eiduk reportedly admitted to a friend, with enjoyment in his voice <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ecstatic sexual maniac, how pleasing he found the roar of truck engines used at the Lubyanka to drown out the noise of executions.|$|R
5|$|When voicing child characters, {{the voice}} actors speak within their normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection. The {{recorded}} audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered {{to make the}} voice sound more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fish, then in turn <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 {{that there was no}} linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is generally}} one <b>of</b> two types: <b>a</b> super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver works <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne works {{like the one}} in a radio receiver. The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in intelligent lighting is digital lighting, with fixtures such as High End Systems' DL3. These fixtures consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bright LCD or DLP projector {{mounted on a}} moving yoke, much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordinary moving head. These fixtures also contain an integrated media server, which allows for millions of colour choices, endless libraries of gobo-like images, and projection of images and video.|$|R
500|$|The headstones of Medal of Honor {{recipients}} {{buried at}} Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf. Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordinary soldier. The headstone contains the birth year 1924, based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records. In 1974, a large granite marker was erected {{just off the}} Appalachian Trail at [...] at 3,100′ elevation, near the crash site.|$|R
5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
2500|$|In Chinese, Korean and Japanese, the tapir {{is named}} after a beast from mythology that has <b>a</b> snout <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elephant. In Chinese and Japanese folklore, tapirs, like their chimerical counterpart, are thought to eat people's nightmares. In Chinese, {{the name of this}} beast, {{subsequently}} the name of the tapir, is mò in Mandarin (...) and mahk in Cantonese (...) [...] The Korean equivalent is maek (Hangul: , Hanja: [...] ), while in Japanese it is called [...] (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|Both {{the flesh}} and the inner kernel of the fruit {{have been used as}} food by Native Americans. The fatty outer flesh of the fruit, or mesocarp, is {{palatable}} raw for only a brief time when ripe; prior to this the volatile aromatic oils are too strong, and afterwards the flesh quickly becomes bruised, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overripe avocado. Native Americans dried the fruits in the sun and ate only the lower third of the dried mesocarp, which is less pungent.|$|R
40|$|Platinum diamine {{dichloride}} and tetrachloride {{inhibit the}} formation of antibody-forming cells in the mouse spleen after injection of sheep red cells. The dichloride is the more effective agent. It acts best when given 2 days after the antigen, which suggests that cells are more sensitive to its action when they are rapidly proliferating than when they are resting. Its dose-response curve is exponential, suggesting that its action is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alkylating agent. Platinum ethylene diamines were relatively ineffective in this system...|$|R
5|$|The {{effect of}} Kenny's speech is {{achieved}} by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny's lines, while the recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fourth grader. As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.|$|E
5|$|These {{are often}} called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{flounder}} (Old English flóc). There are about 11,000 species, {{more than all}} other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along {{what would be the}} underside in a free-living flatworm.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
40|$|Reaction of the bis-bidentate {{bridging}} ligand L 1 with Co(ClO 4) 2 or Zn(BF 4) 2 affords <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> complexes [M 8 (L 1) 12]X 16 and [M 6 (L 1) 9]X 12 {{having the}} same metal : ligand ratio: the former is a molecular cube with a metal ion at each vertex and a bridging ligand spanning each edge, whereas the latter has <b>a</b> metal framework <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open book containing cross-linked double helical metal–ligand subunits...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} 1200 V punch-through type IGBTs, {{designed with}} improved short-circuit immunity are now fabricated on silicon direct bonded wafers. The emitter ballast resistance (EBR) structure {{is used to}} improve short-circuit immunity. These IGBTs exhibit short-circuit times which are longer than 50 microseconds. They exhibit remarkable DC and AC characteristics such as 2. 0 V of Vce(sat) and 90 nanoseconds of turn-off time at 125 °C. The temperature dependence of the IGBT has <b>a</b> positive coefficient <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> NPT type IGBT...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{mechanical}} design <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active soft orthotic implementation for AFP, which is powered by the pneumatic artificial muscles. Ankle foot orthosis makes a neuromuscular patient’s having gait pattern more rehabilitate <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unaffected person, but the devices can also be associated with compensations of their own. And some patients with a normal gate pattern are not necessary for its functionality. In this paper our study focuses on the rehabilitation performance based on the ankle foot orthotic device...|$|R
5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a bright green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|Legend {{goes that}} Tulsidas was born after {{staying in the}} womb for twelve months, he had all thirty two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> five-year-old boy, {{and he did not}} cry {{at the time of his}} birth but uttered Rama instead. He was {{therefore}} named Rambola (literally, he who uttered Rama), as Tulsidas himself states in Vinaya Patrika. As per the Mula Gosain Charita, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Jyotisha (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his parents on the fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi. In his works Kavitavali and Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas attests to his parents abandoning him after birth due to an inauspicious astrological configuration.|$|E
5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E
40|$|Pleased to {{hear that}} Smith may be joining his mother {{on a visit to}} Mrs Martin [Smith's sister] in Liverpool. Relieved to be free of {{political}} life, especially as he has attained his "one great object", the abolition of the slave trade, and pleased to return to his botanical and poetical pursuits. Recommends [William] Wordsworth's [(1770 - 1850), poet] new poems, which he listens to "with <b>a</b> pleasure something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infant to the prattle <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old woman", and are to be read in "listlessness & leisure"...|$|R
5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{standard}} {{approach to the}} so-called paradoxes of identity has been to argue that these paradoxes do not essentially concern the notion of identity but rather betray misconceptions on our part regarding other metaphysical notions, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object or a property. This paper proposes a different approach by pointing to an ambiguity in the identity predicate and arguing <b>that</b> the concept <b>of</b> identity <b>that</b> figures in many ordinary identity claims, including those that appear in the para-doxes, is not the traditional philosophical concept but {{one that can be}} defined in terms of relevant similarity. This approach to the paradoxes will be argued to be superior to the standard one...|$|R
