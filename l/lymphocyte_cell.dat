40|$|Background: Tooth {{extraction}} is {{the ultimate}} treatment option for defective teeth followed by the need for dentures. Inflammation is one phase of the healing process that should be minimized {{in order to preserve}} alveolar bone for denture support. Macrophage, PMN and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> are indicators of acute inflammation. Spirulina and chitosan are natural compounds with the potential to be anti-inflammatory agents. Purpose: This research aimed to determine macrophage, PMN and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> of animal models treated with a combination of 12 % spirulina and 20 % chitosan on the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd post-extraction day. Methods: Animal models were randomly divided into control (K) and treatment (P) groups. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (KI, KII, KIII and PI, PII, PIII). The post-extraction sockets of the control group animals were then filled with CMC Na 3 %. Meanwhile, the post-extraction sockets of the treatment group members were filled with a combination of 12 % spirulina and 20 % chitosan. Subsequently, the number of PMN, macrophage and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> was analyzed by means of HE analysis on the 1 st., 2 nd. and 3 rd. days. Statistical analysis was then performed using a T-test. Results: There was a decrease in PMN cells and an increase in macrophage and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> on Days 1, 2, and 3. Conclusion: It can be concluded that a combination of 12 % spirulina and 20 % chitosan can not only decrease PMN cells, but can also increase macrophage and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> on Days 1, 2 and 3 after tooth extraction...|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} major types of lymphocytes, many sub-types, and {{hundreds}} or thousands of <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cell</b> types that have been identified by scientists. All are generated by normal or abnormal lymphopoiesis except for certain artificial strains created in the laboratory by development from existing strains. Although lymphocytes are usually considered mature (as seen in blood tests) they are certainly not inert but can and do get around the body to anywhere there is a need; and when such need arises, new rounds of 'downstream' lymphopoiesis such as cell multiplication and differentiation may arise, coupled with intense mitotic and metabolic activity.|$|E

50|$|Efficient Dock180 GEF {{activity}} in a cellular context {{is known to}} require {{the formation of a}} complex between Dock180 and its cognate adaptor proteins, which assist its translocation to the plasma mambrane and binding to Rac. Similarly, Dock2 has been shown to form a complex with the well described DOCK-binding protein ELMO1 and this interaction is required for Dock2-mediated Rac activation in <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cell</b> lines. ELMO proteins contain a C-terminal proline-rich region which binds to the N-terminal SH3 domain of DOCK proteins and mediates their recruitment to sites of high Rac availability (primarily the plasma membrane). ELMO proteins also contain a PH domain which appears to induce conformational changes in DOCK and thus allow binding to Rac.|$|E
50|$|Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} {{a type of}} <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cell</b> {{involved}} in the innate immune system’s response to viral infection and tumor transformation of host cells. Like T cells, NK cells have many qualities characteristic of the adaptive immune system, including the production of “memory” cells that persist following encounter with antigens {{and the ability to}} create a secondary recall response. Unlike T cells, NK cell receptors are germline encoded, and therefore do not require somatic gene rearrangements. Because NK cells target self cells, they have an intricate mechanism by which they differentiate self and non-self cells in order to minimize the destruction of healthy cells and maximize the destruction of unhealthy cells.|$|E

Methods: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>cells</b> obtained from eight healthy donors were infected in vitro with HIV- 1 and p 24 was measured with and without IL- 2, IL- 12 and IL- 15. We studied the effect of NM pulsed in vitro with IL- 2, IL- 12 and IL- 15 on HIV replication by measurement of p- 24 and DNA-provirus load when added into the culture of PBMCs and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>cells</b> infected in vitro. We evaluated the effect of NK cells pulsed with IL- 2, IL- 12 and IL- 15 on HIV replication and DNA-load into the culture of CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>cells</b> and PBMCs by trans-well chamber. Results: We found high levels of p 24 in the supernatants of PBMCs and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>cells</b> cultured with IL- 2, IL- 12, and IL- 15. We observed a significant reduction of p 24 in the culture both of infected PBMCs and CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>cells</b> in which was added NK pulsed with IL- 15. We did not obtain the some results with NM pulsed with IL- 2 and IL- 12. We observed a power effect of NK pulsed with IL- 15 on HIV-DNA. The trans-well chamber experiments showed that the effect of NM is both direct and both mediated by realizing of soluble factors. Conclusions: This study highlights some important effects of IL 15 on NK in HIV patients anyway our results are preliminary and descriptive and others studies will be needed to provide rationale for immune therapies.

50|$|CFSE was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} fluorescent dye {{that could be used}} to stably label lymphocytes and track their migration within animals for many months. Subsequent studies revealed that the dye can be used to monitor lymphocyte proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo, due to the progressive halving of CFSE fluorescence within daughter cells following each cell division. The only limitation is that CFSE at high concentrations can be toxic for cells. However, when CFSE labelling is performed optimally, approximately 7-8 cell divisions can be identified before the CFSE fluorescence is too low to be distinguished above the autofluorescence background. Thus CFSE represents an extremely valuable fluorescent dye for immunological studies, allowing lymphocyte proliferation, migration and positioning to be simultaneously monitored. By the use of fluorescent antibodies against different <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cell</b> surface markers it is also possible to follow the proliferation behaviour of different lymphocyte subsets. In addition, unlike other methods, CFSE-labeled viable cells can be recovered for further analysis.|$|E

The present study evaluates the toxic effect of commercially available TiO 2 nanoparticles (~ 100 nm) using a battery of cytotoxic, genotoxic, hemolytic and morphological parameters. The cytotoxic effects of TiO 2 nanoparticles in human <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> were studied with respect to membrane damage, mitochondrial function, metabolic activity and lysosomal membrane stability. Genotoxicity in <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells</b> was quantitated using a comet assay. The mode of cell death (apoptosis/necrosis) was evaluated using PI/Annexin V staining. TiO 2 nanoparticles were also evaluated for their hemolytic properties, osmotic fragility and interaction with hemoglobin.

Results suggest that the particles could induce a significant reduction in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in human <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cells.</b> Membrane integrity remained unaffected by nanoparticle treatment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{transcriptional}} repressor BCL- 6 regulates B <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cell</b> fate {{during the}} germinal center reaction by preventing terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells until appropriate signals are received.

MTA 3 {{is expressed in}} the same pattern in germinal centers as BCL- 6. BCL- 6 physically interacts with Mi- 2 /NuRD and this interaction is sensitive to BCL- 6 acetylation status. Depletion of MTA 3 by RNAi impairs BCL- 6 -dependent repression and alters the cell-specific transcriptional pattern characteristic of the B lymphocyte. Remarkably, exogenous expression of BCL- 6 in a plasma cell line leads, in an MTA 3 -dependent manner, to repression of plasma cell-specific transcripts, reactivation of the B cell transcriptional program, expression of B <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>cell</b> surface markers, and reprogramming of cell fate...|$|E
