Millions {{of miles}} of pipeline are carrying fluent energy for our daily life, including water, natural gas, crude oil and nuclear materials. Micro in-pipe robot offers an effective technical method for pipe inspection and maintenance. A new bidirectional telescopic in-pipe robot was presented in this paper. In the first place, the whole structure of the in-pipe robot was described, illustrating its functions of motion principle and telescopic mechanisms, respectively.

40|$|A sliding mode {{vibration}} controller for <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives Orang Vahid-Araghi 1 and Farid Golnaraghi 2 The conversion of rotary to translational motion in <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives {{occurs at the}} meshing <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>nut</b> threads. A decreasing coefficient of friction with sliding velocity, may lead to instabilities in these drives. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed for a {{two degrees of freedom}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive model. This controller has two objectives: to regulate the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> angular velocity to a preset value and to attenuate friction-induced vibrations. Only upper and/or lower bounds of system parameters are assumed to be known. In addition, {{in the development of the}} controller no specific model is assumed for the dependence of the coefficient of friction on the relative sliding velocity. Two modifications are applied to the basic discontinuous sliding mode controller to eliminate the inherent chattering problem and to limit the controlled input torque levels. Numerical simulation results are presented that show the applicability and the per-formance of the proposed controller...|$|R
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> A <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is a <b>lead</b> <b>nut</b> or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (typically the <b>nut</b> interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|R
50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>lead</b> <b>nut.</b> Some use a ball <b>screw</b> and ball <b>nut.</b> In either case the screw may {{be connected to}} a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|R

The wear and fatigue life of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuators is a typical multidisciplinary problem. The wear behaviors of actuators closely relate to many factors such as loads, lubrications, materials properties, surface properties, pressures, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. In this paper, the wear and fatigue life of a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuator is modeled and validated. Firstly, the theory of asperity contact and Archard’s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under certain circumstances. Secondly, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol, and the wear phenomenon at the ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Thirdly, finite element analysis is conducted using Nastran to assess the contact stresses in the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>nut</b> assembly model.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of some main {{components}} of a lunar rover assigned to working tasks. The main task of this rover is to clear areas of the lunar soil allocated to the building of a lunar base. In {{the first part of the}} work the lunar environment is studied and described with particular attention to the rover tasks. The rover in the final configuration will be able to advance in all directions on the soil, to control the attitude and to grasp and to remove obstacle and object on the soil. It will be provided by a frame, legs and will, grasping system. The design of the lifting system for the attitude control, based on the action of four motorized legs, has been approached with particular regard to the structural characteristics and to the transmission and motorization. The transmission of the lifting system uses a precision coupling between a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>nut,</b> driven by electrical motors. To allow optimal working conditions for the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>nut,</b> the lifting device was designed as a compact apparatus which also comprises a particular joint which is capable to uncouple shear and bending loads transmitted to it from the other parts. The design of the components has to keep into account the peculiar characteristics of the lunar environment. This aspect was considered by an appropriate geometrical design of the components and a careful choice of the materials. The gripper mechanism of the rover is designed to operate without dedicated motors and it is able to be self-adaptive to the shape of the picked up item also if the object is placed in a non defined position, in any case in a working space. The design optimization of the grasping mechanism, choosing shape and dimension of the different arms, was performed by means of parametric modeling and numerical simulations. Finally an innovative type of wheel was designed and realized to verify the real ability to operate. The wheel is a non pneumatic system with and integrated suspension and energy scavenging system to power the sensors and control system on board. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives {{are used}} in various motion {{delivery}} systems ranging from manufacturing to high precision medical devices. <b>Lead</b> <b>screws</b> come in many different shapes and sizes; they may be big enough to move a 140 tons theatre stage or small enough {{to be used in}} a 10 ml liquid dispensing micro-pump. Disproportionate to the popularity of <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> and their wide range of applications, very little {{attention has been paid to}} their dynamical behavior. Only a few works can be found in the literature that touch on the subject of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> dynamics and the instabilities caused by friction. The current work aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive study of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> dynamics focusing on the friction-induced instability in such systems. In this thesis, a number of mathematical models are developed for <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive systems. Starting from the basic kinematic model of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>nut,</b> dynamic models are developed with varying number of degrees of freedom to reflect different components of a real <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive from the rotary driver (motor) to the translating payload. In these models, velocity-dependent friction between meshing <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and <b>nut</b> threads constitute the main source nonlinearity. A practical case study is presented where friction-induced vibration in a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive is the cause of excessive audible noise. Using a complete dynamical model of this drive, a two-stage system parameter identification and fine-tuning method is developed to estimate parameters of the velocity-dependent coefficient of friction. In this approach the coupling stiffness and damping in the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> supports are also estimated. The numerical simulation results using the identified parameters show the applicability of the developed method in reproducing the actual systems behavior when compared with the measurements. The verified mathematical model is then used to study the role of various system parameters on the stability of the system and the amplitude of vibrations. These studies lead to possible design modifications that solve the system’s excessive noise problem. Friction can cause instability in a dynamical system through different mechanisms. In this work, the three mechanisms relevant to the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> systems are considered. These mechanisms are: 1. negative damping; 2. kinematic constraint, and; 3. mode coupling. The negative damping instability, which is caused by the negative gradient of friction with respect to sliding velocity, is studied thorough linear eigenvalue analysis of a 1 -DOF <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive model. The first order averaging method is applied to this model to gain deeper insight into the role of velocity-dependent coefficient of friction and to analyze the stability of possible periodic solutions. This analysis also is extended to a 2 -DOF model. It is also shown that higher order averaging methods can be used to predict the amplitude of vibrations with improved accuracy. Unlike the negative damping instability mechanism, kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can affect a system even when the coefficient of friction is constant. Parametric conditions for these instability mechanisms are found through linear eigenvalue analysis. It is shown that kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can only occur in self-locking <b>lead</b> <b>screws.</b> The experimental case study presented in this work demonstrates the need for active vibration control when eliminating vibration by design fails or when it is not feasible. Using the sliding mode control method, two speed regulators are developed for 1 -DOF and 2 -DOF <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive system models where torque generated by the motor is the controlled input. In these robust controllers, no knowledge of the actual value of any of the system parameters is required and only the upper and lower bounds of parameters are assumed to be available. Simulation results show the applicability and performance of these controllers. The current work provides a detailed treatment of the dynamics of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives and the topic of friction-induced vibration in such systems. The reported findings regarding the three instability mechanisms and the friction parameters identification approach can improve the design process of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives. Furthermore, the developed robust vibration controllers can be used to extend the applicability of <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> to cases where persistent vibrations caused by negative damping cannot be eliminated by design modifications due to constraints...|$|R
50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the <b>screw</b> shaft, <b>nut</b> and planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between <b>screw</b> and <b>nut.</b> The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with <b>screw</b> and <b>nut.</b> The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers.

The manipulator model is constructed with a fixed base and a movable platform which are linked through three rigid links of equal lengths spaced at equal angular distances from each other. One end of each link is provided with a spherical pair and is attached to the movable platform and the other end to a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> through a <b>nut</b> with revolute joints. The three screws are individually actuated to translate the nut which in turn moves the corresponding link to achieve the desired position and orientation of the top movable platform. Experimental analysis were carried out to find the angular tilt of moving platform. The rotations of screw and the position and orientation of the moving platform are used to perform the kinematic analysis of the manipulator. In order to validate the model the software package Pro-E is used to simulate and perform dimensional synthesis. The results obtained from experimental, analytical and simulation methods are verified and found to be closer in all the three cases and the behaviour of angle of tilt is analysed. The proposed triglide type manipulator may find its application in positioning and orientation of an end effectors for drilling inclined holes and angular machining and positioning of models inside a wind tunnel with considerable payload capacity and quickness...|$|R
