500|$|Furtado has {{characterized}} [...] "Maneater" [...] as [...] "a 'couture pop' song", explaining {{that it is}} [...] "in your face and very fashionable, stylistic and of-the-moment." [...] In an interview with MTV News, she compared it favorably to eating too much cheesecake: [...] "It's got a crazy loud beat, and the vocals are bitchy and loud. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> it sounds like Peaches, because of the delivery, the spooky vocals." [...] According to Furtado, the song is related to how people become [...] "hot on themselves" [...] when dancing in their underwear {{in front of a}} mirror. [...] " [...] truly has a life of its own; it makes you move", she said.|$|E
500|$|Lauren London as New New/Erin Garnett, Rashad's love {{interest}} and John Garnett's daughter. The character of New-New was {{loosely based on}} R group TLC's [...] "T-Boz as a kid," [...] said London. [...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained to me how it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, {{to the fact that}} she's new. And there's just so much truth in her, and she doesn't know how to lie yet as an actress. It was perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{techniques}} used to craft the overall {{sound of the}} album, August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the band foregoing the use of full chords and verse-chorus-verse structures in favor of [...] "distant guitar effects, crunchy bass grooves and smatterings of percussion." [...] Regarding the songs from the album, Maust said that lead singer Nathan Willett's lyrics were a mixture of folk tales and topical stories, stating that [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> the last record was more about yesteryear. This [...] has some of that, but it's much more today. The characters are people from today." [...] The thirteen tracks off the album deal {{with a variety of}} philosophies and politics that range from contemplating suicide, crisis of faith, alienation, anonymity, public security and job satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he admitted, [...] "it doesn't {{sound very}} hopeful. I'm no sort of judge in these matters, but I have heard <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that one gets on all right after {{marriage}} without caring very much before. You don't {{seem to have}} a very comfortable life now, do you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{came about}} {{by just a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> 'how come the Sprints and Midgets have a Hall of Fame and the dirt Late Models, which {{obviously}} have ten times more cars, doesn't have one?'" [...] explained Bill Holder. [...] "I got to talking with CJ (Rayburn) and them and everyone was standing there {{and looked at me}} and said, 'why don't you do it?' (laughs)." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shahrukh Khan, the film's producers' {{first choice}} of actor to play game show host Prem Kumar, defended it, stating [...] "I think it's really nice {{that it will}} open doors for people to {{understand}} that there is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> visual appeal to India. I hear a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> that India has been shown in bad light. But then my logic to everyone is that why is it that somebody comes from outside and makes a film like Gandhi and Slumdog...all we can say about it is that it is showing India in a poor light?" ...|$|R
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I'm it. I'm {{the divine}} incarnation. I'm here {{and let me}} hip you." [...] … But Prabhupada was never like that … I always liked his humility and his simplicity: [...] "the servant of the servant of the servant" [...] is really what it is, you know. None of us are God – [...] just His servants.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, {{just before}} Worcestershire's 2007 {{campaign}} got underway, Hick said that despite being contracted {{only for the}} season, {{he did not want}} to retire at the end of the summer. He said, [...] "I am not looking at it as my last season ... a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> you are a long time retired ... I am still one of the fitter members of the side and I love and enjoy what I do ... Why should I pack it in if I am contributing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|David Miliband, {{the former}} Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and former Shadow Foreign Secretary said [...] "However, {{if you look}} at Birmingham, I think a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> would <b>say</b> that it's a city, Britain's second city..." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. Don't say that, Duchess. As {{a wicked}} man I am a {{complete}} failure. Why, there are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who <b>say</b> I have never really {{done anything wrong}} in the whole course of my life. Of course they only say it behind my back.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson and Dr Feelgood were an {{influence}} on the English punk movement. Paul Weller has said of Johnson: [...] "Wilko {{may not be as}} famous as some other guitarists, but he's right up there. And there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who'll <b>say</b> the same. I can hear Wilko in <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> places. It's some legacy." ...|$|R
2500|$|The dispute {{ended in}} 2010, when the pair reunited {{for a full}} tour. Paul Wall stated [...] "It {{took a long time}} and us growing. You know, we started off as a group {{and a lot of times}} when you go your {{separates}} ways, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Oh you can't do it without him" [...] and so you wanna prove them wrong. I know for me, I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that I could make it on my own." [...] Chamillionaire replied; [...] "We had been bumping into each other a lot. It's kinda been died down for a little bit now but we just kinda needed that stamp of approval. I think the tour kinda just solidifies it for other people. It's not like today we just stopped beefing, we stop beefing along time ago, but nobody believed us." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{is what a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> about Blacky the Crow. Of {{course it}} is true that Blacky does get into a lot of mischief, but if people really knew him they would find that he isn't as black as he looks. In fact, Blacky the Crow does a whole lot of good in his own {{peculiar}} way, but people are always looking for him to do bad things, and you know you most always see what you expect to see. Thus the good Blacky does isn't seen, while the bad is, and so he has grown to have a reputation blacker than the coat he wears.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> {{we started}} the crust-punk genre, but whatever. If they wanna say that, I don't mind, but I'm {{certainly}} no Malcolm McLaren, saying I invented something I didn't.|$|E
5000|$|Frances {{has played}} the role of Morag on and off for twenty-nine years. During flashbacks to the character's past, Morag was portrayed by Eve Kelman, Vanessa Goddard and Pheobe Taylor-Bush respectively. After an eight-year hiatus, in 2001 it was {{announced}} that Frances had returned to the serial and Morag would be [...] "more evil" [...] than ever. In 2002 Frances again returned to the serial. In 2008, Frances signed another six-month contract with the serial. She also revealed that fans miss her when she is absent. Discussing this, Frances said [...] "I really adore playing her and I get a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>saying</b> 'when are you coming back?" [...] Of her return Frances said [...] "I've played Morag for so long that I have no trouble slipping back into character. I know her so well." ...|$|R
5000|$|More recently, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} at the board level with one director resigning and another making public statements about other directors and major shareholders. Fast's board member Robert Keith said in a newspaper interview, [...] "I ought to have seen the problems in Fast earlier. And I ought to have understood that Hans Gude Gudesen is a crazy liar. Also, I ought have shot Oystein Stray Spetalen the first time I met him. That would have helped a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>says</b> the controversial Brit to the paper Finansavisen." [...] Spetalen and Hans Gude Gudesen are both major shareholders in Fast. Furthermore, directors Keith and Fussel are allegedly being pursued by the Norwegian tax authorities for USD 50M in unpaid taxes the government says it is owed by them. In the event of non payment liability may fall on the company.|$|R
5000|$|Marshall’s {{high school}} coach Clarence Inscore praised the synergy saying, [...] "The idea of two highly {{recruited}} athletes ... playing the same position, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> would <b>say,</b> man, that's kind of crazy, you're {{going to give up}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> your carries. They were so mature in having that forethought to think, ... it's going to take two guys to get it done in the SEC." ...|$|R
5000|$|Malcolm [...] "Scruff" [...] Lewty, vocalist and guitarist of Hellbastard, commented, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> {{we started}} the crust-punk genre, but whatever.

5000|$|Jeffrey Lewis {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with Audio Antihero Records that [...] "It seems like a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that “The Ones Who’ve Cracked” is their preferred album, but to me that one feels too in-between, it’s in-between being a lo-fi album and a nicer studio album." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> will <b>say</b> it was right and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> will <b>say</b> it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|R
5000|$|It {{was written}} by Matt Barus, {{frontman}} of Christchurch band The Dukes, who supported Blondie on a small 2010 New Zealand tour, and Barus has named his wife Lauren Mitchell as {{a contributor to the}} song, although Mitchell is uncredited in the album booklet. Chris Stein, guitarist for Blondie, asked if Barus wrote songs for other artists. Barus responded that he didn't, but he'd have a go. He described the process as: [...] "I said sure, thinking 'yeah, cool, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> nice things to you in the music industry'. But I went off and wrote a couple of songs and emailed them to him anyway, really rough demo versions, and I didn't hear from him for about a year. And then he started emailing back saying, 'we're starting to record some new tracks, and we're interested in using one of your songs'." [...] Barus also wrote a second song entitled “Hollow Man” which he preferred, but learned that Blondie were already working on “Drag You Around”.|$|R
50|$|Misc or {{sometimes}} 'misk' is another gender title pronoun. The word {{is derived from}} the Latin word miscellus, meaning “mixed,” following the rationale that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> non-binary <b>people</b> would <b>say</b> that they have aspects of various genders at various times.|$|R

5000|$|The uptempo {{song was}} {{described}} as pop punk skate punk, rap rock and hip hop, with Deryck Whibley, Dave Baksh and Steve Jocz sharing vocals. [...] "The verses are really about what we do: {{growing up in the}} suburbs, going to parties and hanging out with our friends, and causing trouble. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> they relate to it," [...] said Whibley. The song gets its name from the slang term for a swollen lip as a result of being punched in the face.|$|E
5000|$|... "There's been a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> confusion, with <b>people</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Well, {{they see}} the {{questions}} beforehand,' which we do," [...] revealed Merton in 1999.

5000|$|In the 1500 m race, Ohno won {{the gold}} medal, {{with a time of}} 2:18.541. During the 1500 m final race, South Korean Kim Dong-Sung was first across the finish line, but was disqualified for {{blocking}} Ohno, in what is called cross tracking. Ohno was in second place with three laps remaining, and on his third attempt to pass on the final lap, Kim drifted slightly to the inside where Ohno raised his arms and came out of his crouch to signal that he was blocked. Fourth-place finisher of the same race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the decision saying that it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified." [...] China's Li Jiajun, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect the decision of the referee, I'm not going to say any more."

5000|$|He {{also worked}} with Marciano to shorten his punches and narrow his stance. Goldman tied Marciano's ankles {{together}} with a string to help him to narrow his stance. He taught him to throw combinations, rather than one big bomb at a time. Although the finished product was still crude and clumsy, compared to the style of many boxers, Marciano became a formidable offensive and defensive fighter. But, as Goldman pointed out: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> Rocky don't look too good in there, but {{the guy on the}} ground don't look too good either." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mickey may {{be based}} on Charley Goldman. Both were bantamweights, had Jewish ancestry, and have similar-sounding names. In addition, Goldman was the boxing trainer of Rocky Marciano, on whom Rocky Balboa is based. Goldman trained Marciano in many ways similar to how Goldmill trained Balboa, such as tying their ankles {{together}} with string {{to teach them to}} spread their feet at the appropriate width. Goldman was (again like Goldmill) well known for making wise remarks (ex. [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> Rocky Marciano don't look too good in there, but the guy on the ground don't look too good either.").|$|E
5000|$|Filoni wished {{most for}} the series to address the fates of Rex and Ahsoka {{because they do not}} appear in Revenge of the Sith, which was {{released}} before The Clone Wars but is set after the series' timeline. In April 2011, he hinted that the two characters' stories were possibly connected and remarked: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> they {{want to know more about}} her Ahsoka, and along with that goes Rex." [...] He also voiced the production team's conscious effort to write story arcs for Rex: [...] "I think one of the other things is we have such a great development of Rex that we really want to keep telling Rex's story and things centered around Rex." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{trouble with}} being a popular band is that all your changes are aired for the public. So yeah, we ventured and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the stuff went too far. But {{how do you know}} where you are if you don't go too far? Using synthesizers wasn't popular with hardcore. To be honest, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the synth sounds at that time weren't very good, but we went for it. I've met a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who <b>say</b> [...] "That record was cool." [...] At the time, it was...for me, at least.|$|R
50|$|Bunt {{begins his}} story by recounting a herding {{experience}} in a Nevada blizzard. He and Cock-Eye Blacklock rubbed tobacco juice in their eyes to stay awake. Blacklock was a bad man and had killed a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Bunt <b>says</b> that he went bad about two years after that, though, He traveled around gambling, taking all the money from a community before moving on. He got through New Mexico and Arizona and was making his way through Nevada when he shot a kid in Reno and headed up to a mining camp in Placer County, California. He immediately got into trouble there, too, and before long was driven out of camp.|$|R

A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> are <b>saying</b> ‘why isn’t this person on this song,’ or ‘why isn’t that person on that song,’ you know?
