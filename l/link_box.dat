40|$|This paper {{describes}} the RPC <b>Link</b> <b>Box</b> Control System (RLBCS) {{developed for the}} RPC muon trigger 1 in the CMS experiment on LHC collider under construction in CERN (Geneva). RLBCS subsystem is responsible for relatively slow, bidirectional communication between the link electronics placed on detector and devices of CMSDetector Control System (DCS) located in the control room. The RLBCS is used for diagnostic and control purposes, and therefore {{it is essential for}} the RPC muon trigger. The RLBCS is also responsible for configuration of the FPGAs in the RPC link electronics, working in the harsh, irradiated environment. Additionally most part of the RLBCS itself works in the irradiated area, so assuring its reliable operation required some special solutions. All the above factors make this subsystem an important and non-trivial task in the CMS RPC muon trigger development...|$|E

40|$|Power cables are {{preferred}} {{in urban}} areas for power transmission and distribution because of their high reliability, environmental friendliness and the visual invisibility. Whilst the volume of underground power cable has been growing steadily, the voltage level of the power cables have also increased significantly in recent years. The increasing volume of high voltage power cables brings about technical challenges to the power system operators and maintenance engineers. One of these challenges is the application of appropriate condition monitoring techniques to detect incipient cable faults and to reduce unplanned outages. This paper aims to analyse the causes, modes and mechanisms, among cable joint failures, and to propose an applicable sheath circulating current monitoring technique with the associated criteria for fault diagnosis. Two joint faults, flooded <b>link</b> <b>box</b> and joint insulation breakdown, are analysed in detail. Finally, a set of criteria is proposed for cable joint fault diagnosis based on the simulation of an 110 kV underground power cable system of length 1. 5 km...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} the sands in the Venice lagoon {{has been the subject}} of an {{extensive}} field survey in parallel with numerical modelling. Four transects along Treporti and Burano canals were conducted from which 33 bottom sediment samples were collected. These samples were analysed for grain size and sorting to examine any trends in the granulometry of these sediments that might shed light on transport paths. The modelling study consists of three parts: the sediment transport model sedtrans 96 was used with a finite-element hydrodynamic model (Shyfem) and an empirical wave model (US Army Corps of Engineering) to simulate sand transport in the Treporti canal. A type of <b>link</b> <b>box</b> model was created where finite elements of the hydrodynamic model have been combined to macro-boxes on which the water and sediment flux over the sections, and a mass balance has been computed. Several grain size classes were simulated; the distributions before and after the simulation were examined. Idealised wind and tidal values were initially used to force 12 h simulations to test the sediment transport sensitivity. Finally, a full-year simulation (1987) has been carried out using measured tidal and wind data. Only a part of Venice lagoon was covered by the simulation: a major channel (Treporti) running from Lido inlet towards the northern lagoon. The total sand transport through all of the sections was computed for 1 year. Sediment mass balance was determined, and the resulting trends of erosion and deposition were computed. There were no trends in the median grain diameter and sorting of bottom samples from the Treporti canal; all sands were fine (120 ?m, one outlier of 300 ?m was removed). The absence of a trend in grain size suggests that there is no significant import of sand to the lagoon through the Lido inlet. The results from the simulations seem therefore to confirm the hypothesis of reworking of sand within the lagoon. The computed erosion is some centimeters per year diagnostic of channel scouring and enlargement with time. The Treporti canal is subject to strong current velocities of around 1 m/s, which hold fine sand in suspension and thus prevent sedimentation...|$|E

These boards will be in the radiation field, composed mainly of thermal neutrons and high-energy hadrons (E = 10 [...] 100 MeV). The most important electronic devices used on these boards are FPGAs chips and memories that store the FPGAs configuration data.

40|$|In {{order to}} address the {{detection}} and localization of partial discharge (PD) in cross-bonded (CB) high voltage (HV) cables, this paper investigates the characteristics of PD propagation in CB HV cables. On-line PD detection and location in power cables has been a research topic for many years. The issue has not been solved due to surrounding interference and complicated propagation modes in cable joints. It becomes even more complex with CB cables. The main challenge to PD monitoring of CB cables is {{as a result of}} the interconnectedness of the sheaths of the three single phase cables. The cross-bonding of the sheaths makes it difficult to localize which of the three phases a PD signal has emanated from. Co-axial cables are used to connect cable sheaths to cable <b>link</b> <b>boxes,</b> for ease of installation and protection against moisture. A second challenge is, therefore, the coupling characteristic when a PD pulse propagates in HV cable joints and the co-axial cables, making PD detection and localization more complex. The paper presents experimental investigations into PD pulse coupling characteristic between the cable center conductor and the sheath and the behavior of PD pulse propagation in CB HV cables, which can be used for PD localization in CB HV cable system...|$|R
