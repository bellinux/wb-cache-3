Before {{and during the}} Battle of Normandy, RAF Andover {{was used by the}} United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force as an {{operational}} tactical fighter airfield. It was also known as USAAF Station 406, Pundit Code AV. The code AV was broadcast in morse code by a mobile red <b>light</b> <b>beacon</b> at night, during {{the latter part of the}} Second World War. The Pundit Code was also painted on the airfield hangar nearest to the control tower, and remained visible until the hangars were demolished in 2001.|$|E

500|$|A bite from a {{radioactive}} spider triggers {{mutations in}} Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers. In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man {{has the ability}} to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense ("spider-sense") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility. [...] The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters. This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to swing from, a net to snare or bind enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider wing. Other equipment include a <b>light</b> <b>beacon</b> that can either be used as a flashlight or project a [...] "Spider-Signal" [...] design, a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically, and spider-tracers, which are spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense.|$|E

The party was landed by winch line from the Wessex 5 helicopters of the Royal Naval Air Services Commando Headquarters Squadron, commanded by Lt Cmdr Neil Foster RN. As well as collecting samples of the aegerine granite, rockallite, for later analysis in London, the top of the rock was blown off using a newly developed blasting technique, Precision Pre-Splitting. This created a level area that was drilled to take the anchorages for the <b>light</b> <b>beacon</b> that was installed the following year. There was no evidence of the brass plate thought to have been installed in 1955 and two phosphor bronze plates were chased into the wall above Hall's Ledge, each secured by four 80-tonne rock-anchor bolts.|$|E

[...] Clark's concept of incorporating the water tank into the building's architecture was aesthetically pleasing, but also {{was designed to}} eliminate its possibility of being the aviation hazard {{it might have been}} were it a stand-alone structure. Radio antennas and a climate detector on the dome supported the communications office headquartered in the building. The base water system is contained within the [...] tank which rests on an independent foundation inside the central octagon tower. The removable concrete walls of the tower are designed for tank maintenance. Topping the tower is a <b>light</b> <b>beacon</b> resting on a dome with a mosaic chevron design of blue and gold.
