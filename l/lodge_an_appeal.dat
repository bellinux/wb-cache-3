2500|$|On 27 June, with Hicks's British {{citizenship}} confirmed, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office {{announced that}} it would not seek to lobby for his release as it had with the other British detainees. The reason given was that Hicks was an Australian citizen when he was captured and detained and that he had received Australian consular assistance. On 5 July 2006 Hicks was registered as a British citizen, albeit only for a few hours — Home Secretary John Reid intervened to revoke Hicks's new citizenship almost as soon as it had been granted, citing section 56 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 allowing the Home Secretary to [...] "deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good".

2500|$|On 26 October 2010, the Iraqi High Tribunal {{handed down}} a death {{sentence}} against Aziz for the offense of [...] "persecution of Islamic parties," [...] amongst them the serving Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Islamic Dawa Party, following a crackdown on a Shia uprising after the 1991 Gulf War. The Associated Press reports that [...] "the judge gave no details of Aziz's specific role" [...] in the crackdown. His lawyer stated that Tariq Aziz's role in the former Iraqi government was {{in the arena of}} [...] "Iraq's diplomatic and political relations only, and {{had nothing to do with}} the executions and purges carried during Hussein's reign." [...] His lawyer further stated that the death sentence itself was politically motivated and that timing of the death sentence may have been aimed at diverting international attention away from documents released by WikiLeaks, which detailed crimes in which Maliki government officials have been implicated. His lawyers have 30 days to <b>lodge</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal,</b> following which the court would have another 30 days to look into the appeal; if the appeal is turned down the sentence would be carried out after another 30 days. On 26 October 2010 the Vatican urged the Iraqi government not to carry out his execution, and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton stated that Aziz's execution would be [...] "unacceptable and the EU will seek to commute his sentence." [...] That same day, the human rights organization Amnesty International issued a statement condemning the use of the death penalty in this case, as well as for the cases of two other former Iraqi officials; the statement also expressed concern regarding the manner in which trials may have been conducted by the Iraqi High Tribunal. On 27 October 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the Russian Foreign Ministry both released statements urging the Iraqi government not to carry out the death penalty against Tariq Aziz. Also on 27 October 2010, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon was reported to have [...] "stressed that the UN is against the death sentence and in this case, as in all others, it is calling for the verdict to be cancelled." [...] On 28 October 2010, it was reported that some Iraqi Bishops and many ordinary Iraqis also condemned the death penalty for Tariq Aziz. Furthermore, according to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "several international human-rights groups have criticised the procedures and questioned the impartiality of the court." ...|$|E
