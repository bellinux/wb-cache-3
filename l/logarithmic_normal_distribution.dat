40|$|Hitherto much {{attention}} in palaeomagnetic {{work has been}} paid to the analysis of directions of magnetization and comparatively little to the analysis of intensities or susceptibilities. It is generally found that these values are not symmetrically distributed so that it is not meaningful to calculate an arithmetic mean and a standard deviation using Gaussian methods. However the logarithms of such values are found to be sym-metrically distributed to a good approximation for the Torridonian sandstones. It is thus proposed that intensity observations may be usually analysed by the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> a geometric mean and standard deviation being calculated. A further useful applica-tion of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> is shown to be in the measure-ments of the inhomogeneity of magnetization of rock specimens in disk form. This inhomogeneous magnetization may be described by a quad-rupole term in the external magnetic potential of the disk.

30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} emissions over time of α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, and total {{volatile organic compounds}} (TVOC) emanating from three common and industrially important softwood species grown in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We employed Bayesian hierarchical modeling to develop robust emission-over-time models that could quantify intraspecies and interspecies variations in emissions. Bayesian modeling describes parameters as probability distributions. This approach can describe arbitrary probability distributions and thus can be efficient when skewed distributions are expected, such as the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> that are often observed in measurements of chemical concentrations. Hierarchical modeling has a multi-level structure. In this study, we investigated a two-layer model: one layer describing emission behaviors common to all species, using entire data to avoid species-specific overfitting, the other layer describing species-specific parameters to model variations in individual species using data from individual species. We used the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to obtain model parameters. The Bayesian model and the MCMC method provided both point estimates for model for those parameters. To demonstrate the advantages of using Bayesian predictions to explain variation, we conducted indoor air concentration simulations using the distributions that we derived from the model.|$|R

However, the dense-phase flow regime is rather characterised by transient dunes or discrete full bore slug flows, which limit steady-state approaches {{in their ability}} to accurately describe these systems. Steady-state approaches as well as {{pressure drop}} prediction models for discontinuous slug flow depend on the total slug length - sum of all slugs in a pipeline - which can be related to the air-gap/slug-length ratio. As such, {{there is a need to}} accurately predict this ratio. This paper reports on investigations on describing slug length, air gap length and air-gap/slug-length ratio using a probabilistic approach. In particular, the primary variables of slug lengths and air gap lengths have been modelled under the assumption that their variations have <b>logarithmic</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions.</b> Subsequently, the probability distribution of air-gap/slug-length ratios has also been derived from the logarithmic distributions of these two basic variables. The resulting distribution models have been applied to compare experimental slug- and air gap length data observed from multi-slug conveying trails for polyethylene pellets, which showed a strong influence of the solid loading ratio. The derived probability model for the air-gap/slug-length ratio was also validated by the Kolmogorov-Smimov (K-S) test for goodness of fit...|$|R

Results showed that the concentration of total culturable microorganisms ranged from 4. 8 X 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU) /m 3 to 2. 4 X 10 (4) CFU/m(3), with an arithmetic mean of 3. 7 X 10 (3) +/- 2. 1 X 10 (2) (standard deviation) CFU/m(3). As a whole, the percentage of airborne bacteria, accounting for 59. 0 % of the total culturable microorganisms, {{was significantly higher than}} those of airborne fungi (35. 2 %) and actinomycetes (5. 8 %).

Conventional methods can also estimate prediction intervals, but such methods assume that variations have been generated from normal distributions. Therefore, prediction intervals of emissions may include values less than zero, a nonsensical result relative to emission rates and concentrations. In contrast, the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach and the MCMC method provide reliable probability distributions {{for changes in}} VOCs over time that reflect both interspecific and intraspecific variations. Bayesian modeling explains observed data quite well, enabling one to describe skewed distributions (such as a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution)</b> and estimate prediction intervals in VOC emission rates that are positive. In this paper, we used informative prior distributions {{based on data from}} previous research. This approach could be subjective, but prior distributions would be supplanted by enough data, and these results tend to converge on the same posterior distribution regardless of different prior distributions [30]. Therefore, more measurements provide more objective and precise estimates of changes in VOC emissions over time.|$|E

Emphasis is placed on quantifying the degree of potential degradation of the physical properties of concrete in high-level waste storage tanks. The temperature elevation range of interest is from ambient to 315 C (600 F). The literature has been reviewed to examine the applicable experimental data and quantify the degradation in the concrete and reinforcing steel.
