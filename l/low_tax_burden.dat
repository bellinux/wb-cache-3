50|$|From the 1950s onward, {{there was}} {{significant}} {{growth in the}} use of tax havens by corporate groups to mitigate their global tax burden. The strategy generally relied upon there being a double taxation treaty between a large jurisdiction with a high tax burden (that the company would otherwise be subject to), and a smaller jurisdiction with a <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden.</b> By structuring the group ownership through the smaller jurisdiction, corporations could take advantage of the double taxation treaty, paying taxes at the much lower rate. Although some of these double tax treaties survive,, for example between Barbados and Japan, between Cyprus and Russia and Mauritius with India, which India sought to renegotiate in 2007, most major countries began repealing their double taxation treaties with micro-states in the 1970s, to prevent corporate tax leakage in this manner.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{tax burden}} in Arizona is lower than in most states, and lower {{than it was in}} the past. This low overall burden is the result of a very <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> for {{individuals}} and a moderate tax burden for businesses. However, very small unincorporated businesses have a relatively <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> while the taxes paid by large businesses are relatively high. The differential in tax burden between small and large businesses results from two factors. Business property taxes are moderate for properties with a low valuation but quite high for large businesses. In addition, unincorporated businesses file under the individual income tax code, which results in a lesser relative tax burden than for businesses filing under the corporate income tax code. The tax burden in Arizona is low to moderate on most business taxes. However, the sales tax burden is quite high. On net, the business property tax burden also is high. While taxes on properties of low valuation are near the national average, taxes on higher-value properties are considerably higher than the national average. Thus, large companies, especially those classified as industrial and having a considerable amount of personal property, have a very high property tax burden. High-technology manufacturing companies are among those with a high property ta...|$|E

40|$|This paper hypothesizes that {{fiscal policy}} is one {{important}} factor determining {{whether or not}} environmentally and socially sustainable economic growth is possible.

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} analyse {{the impact of}} {{different}} public policies on inequality, unemployment, growth and the tax burden. Design/methodology/approach – A dynamic general equilibrium model is built, in which growth is driven by endogenous technical progress, to analyse the impacts of several policies (minimum wage, redistribution and R&D subsidies financed by an income tax). Findings – All policies except pure redistribution are better than non-intervention in terms of growth. The authors distinguish three major policy patterns. The Anglo-Saxon model is characterised by high growth, high inequality, low unemployment and a <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden.</b> The Nordic model combines high growth, low inequality and low unemployment, and a high tax burden. The Continental European model puts together medium inequality and a medium tax burden, and higher long-term growth is paid for by high unemployment.

Originality/value – The paper distinguishes three configurations that capture the main features of the developments in Anglo-Saxon countries, Scandinavian countries, and Continental European countries in the 1990 s.

The government has focused on improving the collection of its current revenues with a focus on indirect taxes. Leftist politicians criticize such a structure since indirect taxes (like the value added tax) affect everyone alike, whereas direct taxes can be weighed according to levels of income and are therefore fairer taxes. However, some basic goods are exempt from the indirect taxes. A 10% value-added tax (VAT), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995.

40|$|One {{challenge}} in transition economies {{has been to}} avoid being caught between overrapid restructuring (harmful to the private sector) and gradual change (can undermine robust private sector emergence). Empirical evidence suggests thatin most of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, insiders, by exerting decision making control, have materially affected the restructuring rate. Still, shocks to firms have generally led to sharp rises in unemployment. Unemployment benefits, initially generous, combined with lost payroll taxes substantially increased fiscal costs. In the former Soviet Union, both restructuring and unemployment have remained limited and firm subsidies remained high. The private sector expanded, but chiefly in the gray (untaxed) part of the economy. The authors examine the implications of various restructuring speeds, explicitly introducing probabilities of closure and restructuring. They find that when the probability of closure is small, unemployment will peak at a lower level than when the probability of closure is high, although the transition speed will be much slower. They also find that widespread private sector tax avoidance can stimulate that sector's growth and result in a speedier transition. Thus, while a private sector <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> can drive unemployment up rapidly by increasing the state sector closure probability, it can also help speed up the transition by provoking a quicker private sector response. The authors show that while the state sector restructuring speed is sensitive to the tax burden, (dependent on unemployment {{and the ability to}} tax the private sector) {{it is also true that}} the private sectors growth depends on the tax burden it faces. In particular, capturing the private sector in the tax net early in the transition can lead to collapse and hence to the failure of restructuring.

40|$|The fifteen {{year period}} 1880 - 1895 {{was one of}} {{profound}} change in government finance, {{not only in the}} scale of expenditure (which increased by a quarter) but the very expectation of what that expenditure should be as the traditional governing elite began to take notice of the "democratic" society which would soon displace it. Although governed by the Conservatives for six of those years, it was dominated by the fiscal theory of "Sound Finance", especially as practiced and perfected by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer. This philosophy demanded balanced budgets, a <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> and minimal government expenditure. It is necessary to explain why this philosophy came about and how it adapted to changing circumstances. "Sound Finance" as a fiscal theory was also closely associated with a belief in free trade and a commitment to the gold standard. Together these formed the trinity of fiscal orthodoxy for the late Victorian governing class in Parliament, the Treasury, and at the Bank of England. But as Britain fell into the "Great Depression" and economic growth seemed to stagnate, this consensus was attacked by those who believed that these old doctrines were capable of fulfilling neither the government's revenue requirements nor the economic imperatives of the nation. Hence their advocacy of bimetallism and "Fair Trade". In spite of this, at no time were these critics able to implement such doctrines nor even to deviate in any substantial ways from the imperatives of "Sound Finance". "Sound Finance" dominated the fiscal thinking of politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders, regardless of political stripe, because it {{was at the heart of}} contemporary economic theory, and indeed because it seemed to explain for them the place of the state in that economy while allowing crucial flexibility.

40|$|The {{transition}} from socialism characteristically reduces existing tax revenues {{at the same}} time that it increases the need for government spending. An increasing need for revenue combined with an eroding tax base creates a transition-related fiscal gap and a challenge for tax policy. The solution, say the authors, is not to lay a heavier tax burden on new private firms. The issue is how to meet revenue needs without inhibiting private sector development. Large-scale tax evasion in the private sector - the de facto outcome in Bulgaria and in many other transitional economies - may be a good incentive for development of private enterprise, but it is illegal and inequitable to wage-earners and salaried workers. The chief means of increasing tax revenue are to: (1) reduce tax rates to decrease the benefit of evasion; (2) improve tax administration (to increase tax coverage and better dectect evasion); and (3) increase penalties for evasion. These three measures effectively decrease the benefits and increase the cost of tax evasion to economic agents. It takes time to improve tax administration, however. Given administrative limitations, what should the tax structure be? The authors contend that an administratively feasible system designed to encourage development of the private sector during the transition should: (i) be simple, not complex or oversophisticated; (ii) be administratively implementable with current resources; (iii) impose a <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> on all economic agents; (iv) rely on broad tax bases with minimum exemptions; (v) begin the long-term improvement of tax administration; and (vi) limit the severity of tax penalties in the {{transition from}} an authoritarian to a democratic regime. In theory, reducing the cost of compliance and increasing the expected cost of noncompliance should reduce tax evasion and increase tax revenue. In practice, small businesses and self-employed citizens tend to evade taxes, providing an effective zero tax base. The government has little to lose from reducing taxes on the self-employed but, to be equitable, it should reduce taxes for everyone. As a general rule, say the authors, economies in transition should impose lower tax burdens than are imposed in mature western market economies. It may also reduce the perception of"exploitation"by giving the impression of a more modest government consistent with the dynamic private sector led economy.
