40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} {{the shipping}} container {{as a political}} artefact – a box which {{is not simply a}} neutral, cost-cutting technology taking things from one place to another, but rather a powerful force of world politics with its own distinctive spatial effects, sociological impact and (geo) political dimensions. Contrary to the prevailing conception of the shipping container as a technology that smoothens economic transactions across borders, thereby deepening international interdependence, I emphasise below the points of friction that accompany the ‘social life’ of containers – moments and places where the ‘striated’ spaces of national jurisdictions, state and international bureaucracies, <b>logistical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and class politics also act as key protagonists, both slowing down, yet also facilitating transnational mobility...|$|R
40|$|Planning for the {{transportation}} of {{large amounts of}} equipment, troops, and supplies presents a complex problem. Many options, including modes of transportation, vehicles, facilities, routes, and timing, must be considered. The amount of data involved in generating and analyzing {{a course of action}} (e. g., detailed information about military units, <b>logistical</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> and vehicles) is enormous. Software tools are critical in defining and analyzing these plans. Argonne National Laboratory has developed ELIST (Enhanced Logistics Intra-theater Support Tool), a simulation-based decision support system, to assist military planners in determining the logistical feasibility of an intra-theater course of action. The current version of ELIST (v. 8) contains a discrete event simulation developed using the Java programming language. Argonne selected Java because of its object-oriented framework, which has greatly facilitated entity and process development within the simulation, and because it fulfills a primary requirement for multi-platform execution. This paper describes the model, including setup and analysis, a high-level architectural design, and an evaluation of Java...|$|R

25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the <b>logistical</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would do if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact this would happen a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major problem}} for the British {{was the lack of}} <b>logistical</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> When ships arrived at Basra, they had to be {{unloaded}} by small boats which then unloaded their cargo which was then stored in warehouses, which there were not enough of in Basra. Ships often sat for days waiting to be unloaded. Then supplies had to be sent north along the river in shallow draft river steamers because there were almost no roads north. Usually the amount of supplies being sent north was barely adequate to supply the forces in place. A plan to build a railway was rejected by the Indian Government in 1915, but after Kut it was approved. After the defeat at Kut, the British made a major effort to improve the ability to move men and equipment into theater, and keep them supplied. The port at Basra was greatly improved so that ships could be quickly unloaded. [...] Good roads were built around Basra. Rest camps and supply dumps were created to receive men and material from the port. More and better river steamers were put into service moving supplies up river. [...] New hospitals were also set up to better care for the sick and wounded. As a result, the British were able to bring more troops and equipment to the front lines and keep them properly supplied for a new offensive.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The <b>logistical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> {{supporting}} the transport {{and distribution of}} consumer goods has created a disjuncture in the urban landscape, severing the local space of the city from the space of global product flows. Sprawling agglomerations of mega-warehouses, (such as Amazon "Fulfillment" centers) disregard the local communities that they border, and create environmental concerns due to trucking of freight across increased distances. The rapid growth of e-commerce retail has further separated consumers from the physical realities of distribtion, yet has paradoxically created a need for these facilities to be located closer to urban populations. Capitalizing on this trend, this thesis proposes a new model for a consolidated e-commerce fulfillment center, intermodal freight terminal, and retail marketplace on an industrial site near Downtown Los Angeles. By bringing the point-of-exchange back {{to the site of}} product distribution {{in the form of a}} retail marketplace, this thesis aims to "revive" a classic retail typology in a new urban context - ultimately bringing consumers into direct contact with this infrastructure. Eschewing the current horizontal warehouse typology, a vertical storage typology is proposed, allowing the interweaving of multiple programmatic elements along a new plane of public activity, and the regeneration of land formerly occupied by sprawling railyard operations. Through these design tactics a new synthesis between infrastructure, public activity, and urban space in Los Angeles emerges...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the sociology of theatre, this thesis explores the current performance-making landscape of Prague, mapping the emergence of the nové divadlo (new theatre) movement since 2000. An examination of the historical development of Czech theatre foregrounds the discussion of contemporary practice, charting its changing social-political role in domestic and international contexts. Theatre’s significance in forging an ethnolinguistically defined national consciousness is considered as a legacy that continues to impact the field. Theatrical values originating in the nineteenth-century national revival are traced through the interwar avant-garde, dissident small theatre movement of the 1960 s and auteur’s theatre of the 1970 s and 1980 s. The Velvet Revolution of 1989 and theatre artists’ contributions to the defeat of communism are considered as catalysing a period of self-reflexivity, as theatres grappled with new <b>logistical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and faced a crisis of purpose both dramaturgical and social ins cope. These changes are framed by discussion of the divergent visions of the country’s future posited by Václav Havel and Václav Klaus throughout the 1990 s, as well as tensions surrounding European Union ascension and other globalizing processes. A close examination of the nové divadlo infrastructure that has arisen in the past twenty years identifies the strategies by which this faction of the field has forged a third theatre- making space, distinct from either the repertory system or the pre-revolution avant-garde. Central to this discussion is a consideration of the nové divadlo’s companies, venues and festivals as both reactive and active: responding to an increasingly international city and, simultaneously, actively positioning Czech theatre on world stages. The work and critical reception of Farma v jeskyni (Farm in the Cave) and Krepsko, both self-defining as “international” by virtue of their composition and international touring presence, are considered with regard to the companies’ dramaturgy, methodology and social function. Finally, the thesis considers how the work of the new theatre movement and, specifically, Farma v jeskyni, constitutes a “practical politics” rooted in the political philosophy of Havel and Jan Patočka...|$|R

The exposed approach relies on the client to build higher-level services, with more abstract semantics, out of such primitive tools using sophisticated compilation or run-time algorithms.

In order to evaluate the scheduling procedure we have employed the multicast operation used in the Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP) middleware suite. Investigation into the merits of such a scheduling procedure involved a control group that performs a broadcast to a set of logistical depots and an experimental group that is configured to perform a multicast via schedules generated based on historical network data.
