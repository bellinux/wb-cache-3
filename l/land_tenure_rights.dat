I focus {{mainly on the}} Post-Fast Track Land Reform (2004; 2011) period and the interactive processes in this new resettlement area. The research - premised on the rights approach - sought to explore <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>rights</b> systems and poverty reduction mechanisms seen by the Mafela community to be improving their livelihoods; it also sought {{to find out if}} there is evidence linking tenure rights to poverty reduction and how <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>rights</b> governance systems affect their livelihoods. Suffice to say in both the animal kingdom and human world, territorial space and integrity, its demarcation as well as how resources are used within the space, given the area - calls for a - defined system of rights by the residents themselves. Whilst it is true that there is no one story about Zimbabwens land reform (Scoones et al 2011) the contribution of this research towards insights emanating from the newly resettled farmers adds another invaluable contribution in the realm of rural development issues. The oft rigidified perceptions about the land reform in Zimbabwe as having dismally failed draw contrasting findings from this research. The findings, themselves drawn mainly through interviews, seem to suggest that there are indeed improved livelihoods for resettled farmers more than what is generally believed from a distance. The perception that secure tenure rights (among other myths) determines livelihoods improvement also revealed otherwise with Mafela community. The resettlers dynamic socio-economic milieu presents opportunities and challenges which only the resettled farmers can solve if given adequate support and empowerment in terms of decision making processes. The power basis wielded by the war veterans and the culture of top-down decision making processes as lamented by the resettled farmers suggest that the evolution of resettlements is still far from over. This research therefore hopes to challenge its readers and other stakeholders to engage with issues and recommendations raised here in order for a rethink about <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>rights</b> and poverty reduction initiatives associated with the new resettlement areas in Zimbabwe in general.

40|$|Nations {{around the}} world are {{beginning}} to acknowledge that climate change is an imminent threat to our planet and are responding with mitigation efforts. REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation plus) may be a way to minimize the deforestation that has lead to the increased greenhouse gas emissions causing a change in our global climate. Although REDD+ is one the leading proposals to address climate change, it lends itself to potentially harmful effects on indigenous people, if the regulating nation does not possess adequate policy for protections of their indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples face the challenge of safeguarding access to their lands and the surrounding forests. In Brazil, there have been issues regarding who has property rights to the rainforest, and because of Brazil’s current legal framework, ambiguity regarding <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>rights</b> is the greatest obstacle to overcome when implementing successful REDD+ programs. As demonstrated in Colombia, the enumeration of specific environmental rights in their newest Constitution has effectively acknowledged indigenous rights and specific autonomy in land rights to their communities, thus requiring equal treatment and guaranteeing respect for indigenous cultures. Is constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples’ <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>rights</b> enough to ensure a successful implementation of REDD+ programs? If so, can Brazil effectively balance the need to implement climate change mitigation efforts while upholding indigenous people’s sacred ties to their lands?

30|$|Being {{the second}} populous country in Africa, Ethiopia is {{experiencing}} enormous land cover change (Kindu et al. 2013; Gashaw and Dinkayoh 2015). These changes are mainly from natural vegetation land to agricultural land and settlement. Different {{studies have been}} conducted to quantify land cover change in both highland and lowland parts of Ethiopia (Belay 2002; Woldeamlak 2002; Tefera 2011; Kindu et al. 2013; Molla 2014; Alemu et al. 2015). According to these studies, the country is characterized by a reduction of forest, woodlands, grasslands, and shrub lands, but a remarkable expansion of agricultural land and bare lands in space and time. In Ethiopia, expansion of agricultural land and bare lands and loss of natural vegetation are associated with population growth, poverty and food insecurity, unemployment, drought, resource use competition, national and regional policies on land use and economic development, distribution of land and other resource between people and traditional land use systems, unclear <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>right,</b> and several other socio-political factors (Woldeamlak 2002; Melaku 2003; Molla 2014). Ecosystem change is more severe in the highlands of Ethiopia (Eshetu and Hogberg 2000).

Recent experience with decentralization of authority over land suggests {{that the cost of}} creating new local land administration capacities is high. A less costly option is reliance at least in part upon traditional authorities, who de facto retain considerable popular legitimacy and still control land in much of rural Africa, and experience suggests opportunities for creative institutional amalgams of civil and traditional local authority. There are very considerable differences among traditional authority structures in Africa, and so the potential of this approach will vary from case to case. In developing such decentralized systems, the interests of transparency and accountability will best be served by creating checks and balances between the different levels of land administration. decentralization <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> property <b>rights</b> <b>land</b> administration Africa...|$|R

This multiple case study research, conducted in Eastern Province, Kenya, investigates the formal forest regulations and <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>rights,</b> as well as local enforcement and understanding of those rules, in order to understand their impact on the ability of vulnerable populations to use WEPs as a coping strategy.

Since {{the independence of the}} Central Asian countries (after the breakup of the former Soviet Union) the situation has changed dramatically in terms of institutional, political and technical systems.
