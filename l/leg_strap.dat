2500|$|From 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set {{was issued}} to some generals in the US Army. It was {{composed}} of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather tie-down <b>leg</b> <b>strap,</b> leather two-pocket magazine pouch, and a rope neck lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or [...] "male") piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or [...] "female") piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines.|$|E
5000|$|Legendary rugby league hardman John Sattler {{is quoted}} as follows in the Writer reference:"People talk about the enforcers in the game, but Langlands and his mate Smithy were the toughest of the tough because they could play with injury - arm hanging off, crook <b>leg,</b> <b>strap</b> 'em up and send 'em out - and they could perform. And they had such club spirit. They were knockabouts and larrikins off the paddock, but they {{respected}} their club and teammates and treated Frank Facer like their own father." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once the K.E.D. is {{slid into}} position, it is secured {{to the victim}} with straps {{in order to prevent}} movement. The first strap that is secured is the middle torso strap. According to the K.E.D. users' manual {{securing}} this strap secures the greatest area of the device and therefore provides the greatest stability while securing the rest of the device. Next the bottom torso strap is secured, however the top torso strap is not secured until just prior to moving the patient to the long spine board. This is to allow the patient to breathe easily {{while the rest of the}} device is secured. Following the bottom torso <b>strap</b> the <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> are secured. These may be applied in a [...] "criss-cross" [...] fashion (according to the K.E.D. users' manual this is the most commonly used method), or applied by securing them to their respective sides. If there is any evidence of a groin injury the [...] "criss-cross" [...] method cannot be used. Following application of the <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> the void between the head and device is padded as needed and the head is secured. Finally, just prior to moving the patient to a long spine board the top strap is secured. Some schools teach this order by remembering the phrase [...] "My Baby Looks Hot Tonight", [...] "Money Buys Lots of Hot Toys" [...] or [...] "Maori Boys Love Hairy Teke", where the beginning of each word stands for Middle torso strap, Bottom torso <b>strap,</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>straps,</b> Head strap and Top torso strap.|$|R
25|$|Accessories such as <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> can be {{utilized}} {{to keep the}} inflated chambers in position for floating in a stable attitude, and splash or face shields constructed of clear see-through vinyl covers the head and face to prevent water from waves from inundating the face and entering the airway through the nose or mouth.|$|R
5000|$|The STS (Slishman Traction Splint) {{is another}} lateral {{monopole}} traction splint. It is lightweight and compact, however, it {{differs from the}} KTD and CT-6 in {{that it does not}} stick out past the foot. It offers a proximal point of traction, rather than distal, making it better suited for tight transports in ambulances, helicopters or baskets. The STS can also be used despite lower extremity trauma, because the distal strap can be applied proximal to the calf or patella. Rotational stability is provided by one mid <b>leg</b> <b>strap</b> which can be wrapped around both legs.|$|E
50|$|To ready a STABO harness for rope extraction, the two leg straps (normally {{folded and}} stowed during ground {{operations}} (secured by utility tape or rubber bands)) were {{freed from the}} back of the harness, routed up between the legs, and each <b>leg</b> <b>strap</b> was then snapped onto a V ring, with one mounted on each lower front waist of the harness. A standard issue LBE pistol belt was laced through the center sections of the rig, and fastened around the operator's waist, which served as the main closure device for the overall rig on the operator.|$|E
5000|$|While pole sitting, Kelly {{was said}} to have subsisted mainly on coffee and cigarettes. He learned how to nap while sitting upright, and never was secured by more than a simple <b>leg</b> <b>strap.</b> He once claimed that he doesn't [...] "take as many chances as a window cleaner." [...] Journalist Jay Maeder wrote that [...] "The {{newspapers}} were regularly full of pictures of Shipwreck Kelly, matter-of-factly brushing his teeth and shaving his face, hundreds of feet in the air." [...] He said {{that he was able to}} sleep while pole sitting by putting his thumbs in holes in the pole shafts. If he swayed, the pain in his thumbs would force him to right himself without waking him up.|$|E
50|$|At the IWBF 1998 World Congress, two {{proposals}} were made. One was to allow everyone to use strapping. Another was to specifically ban strapping by 4.5 point players. The practice of strapping had begun by lower point players {{earlier in the}} sports history to give them better trunk control. Eventually, it was taken up by higher point players and included <b>leg</b> <b>strapping.</b>|$|R
50|$|A riding coat is {{a garment}} {{originally}} designed as outerwear for horseback riding. Original waterproof designs - {{similar to a}} mackintosh - generally comprised a full-length coat with wide skirt and <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> {{to keep it in}} place.

5000|$|Standard {{components}} {{included a}} belt (issued in sizes Normal and Large), cross straps, cartridge pouches for [...]303 ammunition (which {{gave way to}} 'universal' pouches to carry ammunition for an array of infantry weapons then in use by the British Army, in addition to grenades), a carrier for the waterbottle and a small pack. The large (1908) pack—intended to be carried in regimental transport except when in full marching order—and entrenching tool carrier were retained from World War I issue, although the later was initially issued in modified form before being reintroduced in 1941. Frogs for the 1907 SMLE and No.4 Rifle bayonets were also issued. Different combinations of these components comprised the 'marching order' and the 'battle order' respectively. In addition various items were issued {{to be used by}} officers and often armoured crewmen, such as pouches for binoculars, pistol ammunition and compass (externally the same as that for pistol ammunition but with felt padding inside), as well as a 'valise' side pack and holster for the [...]38 revolver (a tank crew version with <b>leg</b> <b>strap</b> also existed in two versions).|$|E
50|$|The Graffiti on the Train Tour was a {{worldwide}} concert tour by rock band Stereophonics. The band have played at festivals {{as well as}} their own shows while on the tour. It was the band's first tour without drummer Javier Weyler, who was replaced by Jamie Morrison. The tour started in Newport, Wales on 15 December 2012 and is set to end in London, England on 28 November 2013. During their leg in Japan, lead singer Kelly Jones twisted his ankle after a night out with Morrison. With their flight due to leave within a few hours and Jones unable to walk, bassist Richard Jones had to transport the singer across the airport in a luggage trolley. For the next gigs, Jones had to wear a <b>leg</b> <b>strap</b> which restricted his movement on stage. Later on while on the Australian leg, he also suffered from a respiratory tract infection which forced the band to cancel their show in Melbourne on 23 July, Stereophonics' first cancellation in 17 years. Before their American leg of the tour, a competition was held by Creative Allies for people to design a poster for the leg. The winner, Yiotu, won $500 and a Stereophonics prize pack. During the last leg of the tour, The Wind and The Wave supported the band from 7-16 November. For the remaining dates, Kitty, Daisy & Lewis were the band.|$|E
50|$|The PlayStation3 {{version of}} UFC Personal Trainer is a fitness video game that has {{training}} instruction in three separate sections from three champion UFC fighters and trainers; Mark Delagrotte, Greg Jackson, and Javier Mendez. They {{start with a}} warm up, followed by stretching, and then the work out you selected from the menu under their section, ending with a cool down stretching period. They give tips, instruction, and encouragement throughout the entire work out. You can workout alone or {{side by side with}} a partner. You will need to plug in the PlayStation Eye Camera and calibrate the PlayStation Move before the disc will go to the menu screen. You will need the PlayStation <b>Leg</b> <b>Strap</b> to hold the PlayStation Move in place when doing the leg exercises. You set up your account to your height and weight and fitness level {{with the use of the}} adjustable menu and short fitness test, which you can retake as many times as you want. You can choose to do the menu of workouts under the three UFC fighters or you can choose separate preset 30 or 60 day workouts or make your own customized workouts. As you progress, there are prizes and trophies you earn and instructional and motivational videos that you unlock. There are also separate activities you can choose for fun or as a break from your work out. You don't need to be a gamer to use this program and it can used by men or women.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} dusters were full-length, light-colored canvas or linen coats worn by horsemen {{to protect}} their clothing from trail dust. These dusters were typically slit up the back to hip level for ease of wear on horseback and were the recommended [...] "uniform" [...] for Texas Rangers. Dusters intended for riding may have features such as a buttonable rear slit and <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> to hold the flaps in place. For better protection against rain, dusters were made from oilcloth and later from waxed cotton.|$|R
5000|$|In the film, Ferrer plays both Henri and his father, the Comte Alphonse de Toulouse-Lautrec. To {{transform}} Ferrer into Henri {{required the}} use of platforms and concealed pits as well as special camera angles, makeup and costumes. Short body doubles were also used. In addition, Ferrer used a set of knee-pads of his own design allowing him to walk on his knees [...] He received high praise not only for his performance, but for his willingness to have his <b>legs</b> <b>strapped</b> {{in such a manner}} simply to play a role.|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of inter-limb interaction, contraction intensity and arousal on the steadiness in force production of knee extensors. Ten healthy men, mean age 25. 4 yrs (range 20 - 33), gave their consent and participated in the study. Sitting in a test chair with each <b>leg</b> <b>strapped</b> to a load cell, subject performed a series of unilateral and bilateral maximal and submaximal voluntary knee extensions.

50|$|This birds-of-prey {{demonstration}} {{is held in}} {{the open}} desert and spectators watch from the flight path. The birds fly so close visitors often feel the brush of feathers. The museum hosts two demonstrations daily from mid-October through mid-April. The birds fly completely untethered, without any jesses (<b>leg</b> <b>straps)</b> and most often without leg rings. Only birds native to the Sonoran Desert Region are flown. A featured species is Harris's hawks, the only raptor species {{in the world to}} hunt as a family using strategy, like wolves. The morning and afternoon demonstrations showcase different species, so each is unique. Species include: Harris's hawk, peregrine falcons, barn owls, red-tailed hawks, ferruginous hawk, great horned owl, gray hawk, prairie falcon, and chihuahuan raven.|$|R
50|$|Fracture Table Position: For hip {{fracture}} surgery. Upper torso is in {{supine position}} with unaffected leg raised. Affected leg is extended with no lower support. The <b>leg</b> is <b>strapped</b> at the ankle {{and there is}} padding in the groin to keep pressure on the leg and hip.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the success}} in {{teaching}} parents {{the steps of}} correct Pavlik harness application using a simulated learning module we also believe {{it is essential that}} healthcare providers should still retain a role in parental education, particularly in assisting with setting of the required hip angles. Furthermore, to ensure the hip angles remain correctly set on the Pavlik harness, parents should avoid altering the <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> on their child’s harness. Instead, they should be advised to only undo the chest strap when removing it. However, as an alternative, markings can also be made on the straps at each visit by the healthcare provider to ensure the harness is repositioned correctly. Accordingly, instructions for marking the straps are included in the teaching video as this is performed in most clinics and is considered very useful for reapplication.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether static muscle contraction in the contralateral limb at different intensities and arousal {{in response to an}} electric shock (ES) would affect the steadiness of ipsilateral knee extensors, and whether males would respond differently to females to these stressors. METHOD Ten males and ten females who were healthy and physically active, aged 19 - 33 years, gave their consent and participated in the study. Sitting in a test chair with each <b>leg</b> <b>strapped</b> to a load cell, subjects performed a series of unilateral and bilateral maximal and submaximal static voluntary knee extensions. The steadiness of the left leg, as indicated by the coefficient of variation (CV = Standard Deviation / Mean) of the torque production, was assessed when performing a 15 -s contraction at 10, 30 or 50...|$|R
50|$|Typically {{there are}} two head straps, three torso <b>straps,</b> and two <b>legs</b> <b>straps</b> which are used to {{adequately}} secure the K.E.D. to the victim. Unlike a long spine board or litter, the K.E.D. uses a series of wooden or polymer bars in a nylon jacket, allowing the responders to immobilize the neck and upper spine and remove the victim from the vehicle or other confined space. Although the K.E.D. {{can also be used}} to immobilize infants and children, it is preferable to use specifically designed pediatric immobilization devices whenever possible. If the K.E.D. is used to immobilize an infant or child, appropriate padding must be used to ensure complete immobilization in a manner that does not obscure the thorax and abdomen, thereby preventing continued assessment of these vital areas.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of mermaid tails used on the show: custom-fitted tails that the girls swim in, a [...] "floppy tail" [...] used for stationary shots, and a [...] "hard tail" [...] for stunts. The custom costumes took six months to build, with the tails and tops made from body casts and comprising individually hand-crafted scales. The finished product weighs between 12 and 15 kg. Inside the tail are <b>leg</b> <b>straps</b> where the girls are strapped up and then zipped up. Once in costume, the girls have to be lifted into the water. Attempts were made to minimise the on-screen visibility of the zips on the tails, such as adding extra scales and crafting a ridge of material around {{the length of the}} zip. The tail fin itself was designed with a foot pedal to assist the actresses with swimming. This, along with the fin, adds some 60 cm to the length of the costume.|$|R
50|$|Manly {{were without}} former Test star and captain-coach Wally O'Connell {{who had a}} {{fractured}} bone in his wrist. The Seagulls were instead captained by hooker Kevin Schubert.

5000|$|From a {{distance}} the stocky, bow-legged Potts {{looked like a}} white trapper in his buckskin clothing, his Stetson at a jaunty angle upon his head. Two [...]44 pistols hung from his gun belt complimenting the Henry rifle which never left his side. On his <b>leg</b> was <b>strapped</b> a long-bladed skinning knife.

5000|$|CP1 sportspeople {{can compete}} in race running. CP1 race runners are {{classified}} as RR1. The classes events include the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400 meters. They often require that their arms or <b>legs</b> be <b>strapped</b> {{in order for them}} to run. When they do run, their legs to butterfly out and can inadvertently cross. [...] Compared to other CP race running classes, CP1 and CP2 have a low economy of movement.|$|R

The boxing match is to take place at Broughton's Amphitheatre, a notoriously tough venue established by the [...] "father of pugilism", Jack Broughton: a contemporary bill records that the contestants would fight with their left <b>leg</b> <b>strapped</b> to the floor, with the one with the fewest bleeding wounds being adjudged the victor. One of the advertised participants in the boxing match is James Field, who was hanged two weeks before the prints were issued and features again in the final image of the series; the other participant is George [...] "the Barber" [...] Taylor, who had been champion of England but was defeated by Broughton and retired in 1750. On Taylor's death in 1757, Hogarth produced a number of sketches of him wrestling Death, probably for his tomb.|$|R
5000|$|H2O: Just Add Water (2006): this TV series {{involves}} three {{teenage girls}} who, after encountering a mysterious island grotto, transform into mermaids whenever water touches {{any part of}} their bodies. A spin-off series, Mako: Island of Secrets, was released on 26 July 2013. Three different types of mermaid tails are used on the show: custom-fitted tails that the girls swim in, a [...] "floppy tail" [...] used for stationary shots, and a [...] "hard tail" [...] for stunts.

50|$|The Kendrick {{traction}} device (KTD) {{eliminates the}} need for leg-raising and unnecessary rolling of the patient, and can be easily applied to both pediatric and adult applications. It consists of a round pole that can be located on the lateral aspect of the <b>leg,</b> with <b>straps</b> at the upper thigh and ankle for immediate placement, and three wider straps for immobilization. It is very light at 20 ounces. The KTD does not afford the rotational stability normally seen in long bone traction splints.|$|R
50|$|Many fashion {{designers}} incorporate {{elements of the}} fetish subculture into their creations or directly create products based on elements that are not accepted by the mainstream. Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood created several restrictive BDSM-inspired clothing items for the 1970s punk subculture; in particular bondage trousers, which connect the wearer's <b>legs</b> with <b>straps.</b> The more recent fetish clothing makers House of Harlot and Torture Garden Clothing, Breathless of London, Vex Latex Clothing and Madame S of California focus on using latex and leather as the base material for their creations, {{rather than as an}} accessory.|$|R
