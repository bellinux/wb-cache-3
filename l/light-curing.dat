40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} light-cured composite resins {{are related to the}} material composition, but also vary according to the light-source characteristics used for polymerization. In this study we followed the compressive strength variation for a light-cured composite resin according to the time of exposure to the curing light. With that end in view, 18 test pieces were made from a light-cured hybrid composite material (Filtek Z 250). The test pieces where then submitted to a compressive force by a {{mechanical properties}} universal testing machine. Our results didn’t show an increase of the compressive strength according to the <b>light-curing</b> time increasing, than only in the <b>light-curing</b> time limit indicated by the manufacturer. A longer <b>light-curing</b> time may induce a shrinkage polymerization growth with the formation of internal tensions inside the material. The composite materials <b>light-curing</b> in short layers {{as long as there is}} indicated by the manufacturer seems to be a safer method to make the best from a resin qualities, then an exaggerated increase of the <b>light-curing</b> time. The <b>light-curing</b> is indicated to be done in the direction of the compressive forces. To confirm this supposition other mechanical tests are also necessary.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Adhesive luting of {{indirect}} restorations {{can be carried}} out employing dual- or <b>light-curing</b> materials. This in vitro study evaluated the degree of conversion (DC) of the materials employed in this procedure, seeking how the combination of time and power of curing applied during polymerisation, as well as the temperature of the <b>light-curing</b> composite, influenced the DC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty onlays of different thicknesses (2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm) were luted with three different composites: two dual-curing cements (Variolink II and Calibra) and a <b>light-curing</b> composite (Venus). The same halogen lamp was used with three different modalities selected to provide a constant quantity of energy. The time/power combinations tested were 400 mW/cm(2) for 120 s, 800 mW/cm(2) for 60 s and 1200 mW/cm(2) for 40 s. The <b>light-curing</b> composite was employed at room temperature and after preheating at 54 degrees C. Each sample was examined in three positions using the Micro-Raman Dilor HR LabRam spectrometer to evaluate the polymer conversion degree. The data were analysed using analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p= 0. 05). RESULTS: The dual-curing materials showed average conversion percentages close to 64 %, although onlays thickness clearly influence the degree of conversion, the <b>light-curing</b> composite showed satisfactory results only when onlays thickness was thin, however preheating significantly improved the performance of the <b>light-curing</b> composite under onlays of great thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal luting {{of indirect}} restorations is clearly dependent from light source power, irradiation time and dual-cure luting cement or <b>light-curing</b> composite chosen. It should be calibrated for each material to acquire high DCs. Preheating of <b>light-curing</b> only composites allows for the materials to reach optimal conversion degrees...|$|E

40|$|Background Surface {{sealants}} {{have been}} successfully used {{in the prevention of}} erosive tooth wear. However, when multiple tooth surfaces should be sealed, the <b>light-curing</b> procedure is very time-consuming. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether reduced <b>light-curing</b> time (while maintaining similar energy density) has an influence on resin-based surface sealant cytotoxicity. Methods Bovine dentine discs were treated as follows: group 1 : untreated, groups 2 – 5 : Seal&Protect and groups 6 – 9 : experimental sealer. Groups 2 and 6 were light-cured (VALO LED <b>light-curing</b> device) for 40 s (1000 mW/cm 2), groups 3 and 7 for 10 s (1000 mW/cm 2), groups 4 and 8 for 7 s (1400 mW/cm 2) and groups 5 and 9 for 3 s (3200 mW/cm 2). Later, materials were extracted in culture medium for 24 h, and released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as a measure of cytotoxicity was determined photometrically after cells (dental pulp cells and gingival fibroblasts) were exposed to the extracts for 24 h. Three independent experiments, for both sample preparation and cytotoxicity testing, were performed. Results Overall, lowest cytotoxicity was observed for the unsealed control group. No significant influence of <b>light-curing</b> settings on the cytotoxicity was observed (p[*]=[*] 0. 537 and 0. 838 for pulp cells and gingival fibroblasts, respectively).

Two Cl II cavities were prepared in each tooth, one on the mesial aspect 1 mm coronal to the CEJ and one on the distal aspect 1 mm apical to the CEJ. The teeth were divided into 4 groups: A: The cavities were restored using the bulk-fill technique with Filtek P 90 composite resin and its adhesive system and light-cured with quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) <b>light-curing</b> unit. B: The cavities were restored similar to that in group A but light-cured with an LED <b>light-curing</b> unit. C: The cavities were restored using the bulk-fill technique with X-tra Fil composite resin and Clearfil SE Bond adhesive system and light-cured with a QTH curing unit. D: The cavities were restored similar to that in group C but light-cured with an LED <b>light-curing</b> unit. The gaps were examined under a stereomicroscope at × 60. Data were analyzed with General Linear Model test. In cases of statistical significance (P< 0. 05), post hoc Bonferroni test was used for further analyses. Results. The <b>light-curing</b> unit type had no effect on gap formation. However, the results were significant in relation to the composite resin type and margin location (P< 0. 001).

30|$|There {{are various}} types of <b>light-curing</b> units with {{different}} spectral profiles and light intensities.

40|$|Objectives: To {{verify the}} effect of {{interposing}} different indirect restorative materials on degree of conversion (DC), hardness, and flexural strength of a dual-cure resin cement. Methods: Discs (2 mm-thick, n= 5) of four indirect restorative materials were manufactured: a layered glass-ceramic (GC); a heat-pressed lithium disilicate-based glass-ceramic veneered with the layered glass-ceramic (LD); a micro-hybrid (MH); and a micro-filled (MF) indirect composite resin. The light transmittance of these materials was determined using a double-beam spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Bar-shaped specimens of a dual-cure resin cement (Nexus 2 /SDS Kerr), with (dual-cure mode) and without the catalyst paste (<b>light-cure</b> mode), were photoactivated through the discs using either a quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) or a light-emitting diode (LED) unit. As a control, specimens were photoactivated without the interposed discs. Specimens were stored at 37 ºC for 24 h before being submitted to FT-Raman spectrometry (n= 3), Knoop microhardness (n= 6) and threepoint bending (n= 6) tests. Data were analyzed by ANOVA/Tukey’s test (α= 0. 05). Results: MH presented the highest transmittance. The DC was lower in <b>light-cure</b> mode than in dual-cure mode. All restorative materials reduced the cement microhardness in <b>light-cure</b> mode. GC and LD with QTH and GC with LED decreased {{the strength of the}} cement for both activation modes compared to the controls.

Material and METHODS: Cylindrical cavities with 5. 0 mm diameter and three different depths (A= 1. 0, B= 2. 0 and C= 3. 0 mm) were prepared on the occlusal surface of 30 human molars and restored in a single increment with P 60. The composite resin was light-cured according to two protocols: standard - 850 mW/cm² / 20 s and gradual - 100 up to 1000 mW/cm² / 10 s + 1000 mW/cm² / 10 s. After storage in distilled water (37 °C/ 7 days), the restorations were cut into three slices in a buccolingual direction and the gap widths were analyzed using a 3 D-scanning system.

Maximum irradiances were determined using a MARC PS radiometer, and exposure duration was varied to obtain two or three levels of radiant exposure (SM: 13. 2 and 27. 2 [*]J/cm 2; HPM: 15. 0 and 30. 4 [*]J/cm 2; XPM: 9. 5, 19. 3, and 29. 7 [*]J/cm 2) (n= 17).

40|$|AIM Dental curing {{lights are}} {{vulnerable}} to contamination with oral fluids during routine intra-oral use. This controlled study aimed to evaluate whether or not disposable transparent barriers placed over the light-guide tip would affect light output intensity or the subsequent depth of cure of a composite restoration. METHODS The impact on light intensity emitted from high-, medium- and low-output <b>light-cure</b> units {{in the presence of}} two commercially available disposable infection-control barriers was evaluated against a no-barrier control. Power density measurements from the three intensity <b>light-cure</b> units were recorded with a radiometer, then converted to a digital image using an intra-oral camera and values determined using a commercial computer program. For each curing unit, the measurements were repeated on ten separate occasions with each barrier and the control. Depth of cure was evaluated using a scrape test in a natural tooth model. RESULTS At each level of light output, the two disposable barriers produced a significant reduction in the mean power density readings compared to the no-barrier control (P< 0. 005). The cure sleeve inhibited light output {{to a greater extent than}} either the cling film or the control (P< 0. 005). Only composite restorations light-activated by the high level unit demonstrated a small but significant decrease in the depth of cure compared to the control (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION Placing disposable barriers over the light-guide tip reduced the light intensity from all three curing lights. There was no impact on depth of cure except for the high-output light, where a small decrease in cure depth was noted but this was not considered clinically significant.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} reduced light exposure times on Vickers hardness (VH) of class II composite resin restorations. METHODS: Class II restorations were made in vitro in three 2 mm thick increments in a human molar. Two composite resins (Clearfil AP-X; Esthet-X) were polymerized with four <b>light-curing</b> units (Halogen; Astralis 10, LED; The Cure, L. E. Demetron I, Smartlite) following four curing protocols. Three protocols with exposure times of 10 s, 20 s or 40 s (control) per layer. In the fourth protocol, 10 s irradiation per layer was combined with additional lateral curing for 10 s from buccal and palatal after removal of the metal matrix. VH of the axial surface was determined at top and bottom layers directly after <b>light-curing</b> and after 7 days storage. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the effect of protocol variables. RESULTS: Directly after <b>light-curing</b> VH of both composite resins was significantly influenced by curing protocols.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Recent technologic {{advances}} make {{it possible}} to increase the light power density to reduce the necessary exposure duration. The kinetics of polymerization are complex. The special case of indirectly curing the thin layler of composite below the metallic bracket base further increases this complexity. It was hypothesized that the concept of "total energy," [...] the reciprocity between power density and exposure duration [...] does not hold for orthodontic <b>light-cure</b> bracket bonding. METHODS: Stainless steel brackets were bonded on deciduous bovine incisors with a standard light-cured composite. A calibrated, powerful halogen lamp allowed for modification of power density from 300 to 3000 mW/cm 2. Metallic brackets were bonded in 8 groups of 20 incisors each with various combinations of power densities and exposure durations to obtain 3 levels of energy density (6000, 12000, and 24000 mJ/cm 2). Another group of 20 incisors served as the positive control with a conventional powerful halogen lamp (1000 mW/cm 2) for 40 seconds. After storage for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in water, the bracket shear bond strength (SBS) and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) were measured. RESULTS: It was confirmed that bracket SBS mainly depends on the energy density of the light cure. All groups with an energy density of 6000 mJ/cm 2 had significantly lower SBS than the groups with higher energy densities (P < 0. 01). The dependence of SBS on exposure duration for the same energy density followed an exponential model of nonlinear regression (r 2 = 0. 98). CONCLUSIONS: The concept of "total energy" does not hold for orthodontic <b>light-cure</b> bracket bonding. An exposure time of less than 4 seconds, irrespective of the power density, cannot guarantee sufficient bracket bond strength. There seems to be an advantage of power density over exposure duration in the context of metallic bracket bonding. These results show that, for an efficient <b>light-cure</b> bracket bonding, there is an absolute lower limit of exposure duration (4 seconds) and an upper limit of useful power density (3000 mW/cm 2) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Incomplete {{polymerization}} of composite resins has unfavorable {{effects on}} the clinical function and the esthetics of the restoration. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the relationship between the light intensity of <b>light-curing</b> units in the Department of Operative Dentistry of Isfahan Faculty of Dentistry and the curing depth according to ISO 4049 standards and also to compare the primary and final light densities of the units. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, first the light intensities of 9 <b>light-curing</b> units of the Department of Operative Dentistry were measured by a radiometer. According to ISO 4049 if the intensity of the <b>light-curing</b> unit was higher than 200 mW/cm 2, the unit was used to cure five samples of Z 100 composite resin. A total of 7 units were used to cure 35 specimens. The exposure time of the units with 200 - 300 mW/cm 2 light intensity was twice those of units with over 300 mW/cm 2. The uncured composite resins were removed by scraping and half of the least remaining composite resin thickness was recorded as the curing depth. Finally the light intensity of each unit was measured again. Data was analyzed with SPSS using t-test and correlation coefficient (α = 0. 05). Results: The light intensity of <b>light-curing</b> units was 40 ‒ 620 mW/cm 2 : four units with above 300 mW/cm 2; three with 200 - 300 mW/cm 2 and two with less than 200 mW/cm 2. Only two <b>light-curing</b> units exhibited significant differences between primary and final light intensities (p value < 0. 001). The correlation coefficient between the light intensity and curing depth was 0. 58. All the curing depths were within the ranges of ISO 4049 standards regardless of duration of exposure. Conclusion: All the <b>light-curing</b> units with a light intensity of more than 200 mW/cm 2 had achieved the necessary curing depth specified by ISO 4049 and there was a positive correlation between light intensity and curing depth.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of etching and <b>light-curing</b> time on the shear bond strength (SBS) and adhesive remnant index (ARI) of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) upon debonding of orthodontic brackets. Sixty-eight bovine permanent incisors were obtained and embedded in acrylic resin. Edgewise metallic brackets were bonded to the teeth with Fuji Ortho LC RMGIC. The specimens were randomly assigned to 4 groups, using the following etching and <b>light-curing</b> times: G 1 : 10 % polyacrylic acid and 40 s (control); G 2 : 37 % phosphoric acid and 40 s; G 3 : 10 % polyacrylic acid and 50 s; and G 4 : 37 % phosphoric acid and 50 s. Shear test was performed at 0. 5 mm/min and the ARI was assessed. G 2 (3. 6 ± 0. 98 MPa) presented significantly higher (p 0. 05) between G 2 and G 3 (2. 94 ± 0. 67 MPa). ARI presented prevalence of scores 2 and 3 in all groups. RMGIC SBS enhanced with 37 % phosphoric acid etching and 40 s <b>light-curing</b> time, but this did not occur when the <b>light-curing</b> time was increased, regardless of the acid used. RMGIC presented prevalence of failures at the adhesive/bracket interface...|$|E
30|$|In full {{agreement}} {{with previous research}} [2, 28], the studied kinetics clearly obeys single-exponential functional with best-fitted time constant τ approaching 15.0  s for NHD (under saturation level of 0.33  GPa and narrow scattering of experimental variables enveloped within err[*]=[*] 1.8 ⋅ 10 − 3) and 18.7  s for elastic modulus E (under 7.2  GPa saturation and err[*]=[*] 2.8 ⋅ 10 − 3). This <b>light-curing</b> regime, which can be termed as “weak and long illumination” [28], provides optimal 40  s exposure ensuring deep <b>light-curing</b> as recommended by Dipol® manufacturer [22]. Effect of crosslinking gradient due to light absorbance {{is estimated to be}} no more than 80 % in difference for top-surface and deep-interior part of the sample, needed to consider this DRC as adequately activated resin [4, 31]. Thus, in harmony with [31], we claim that post-irradiation NHD and E increase in the DRC Dipol® is quite commensurable with realistic <b>light-curing</b> kinetics.|$|E
30|$|In <b>light-cure</b> {{adhesive}} group, CPP-ACP-F (B 1) showed superior results {{compared to}} the control group (C 1), whereas the CPP-ACP group (A 1) showed lower mean SBS {{than the control group}} (C 1). Both these differences were not statistically significant (p[*]>[*] 0.05). In chemical-cure adhesive group, control group C 2 showed significantly superior results (p[*]<[*] 0.05) compared to group A 2 and group B 2. The results of two-way ANOVA showed highly significant difference due to adhesive types (p[*]<[*] 0.01), whereas enamel pre-treatment showed non-significant difference (p[*]>[*] 0.01).|$|R
40|$|Background: Newer {{available}} {{composite resin}} adhesives have chromatic agents that change their color during setting from pink to colorless. It has an advantage of easy flash removal thus {{reducing the amount}} of plaque accumulation and helping patients to maintain better hygiene. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare shear bond strengths of <b>light-cure</b> orthodontic bonding agents, namely glass ionomer (FujiOrthoLC, GC Orthodontics), conventional composite resin (Transbond XT, 3 M Unitek), and color-changing composite resin (Transbond Plus, 3 M Unitek) with conventional etch and self-etch primer (Transbond PlusSEP, 3 M Unitek). Materials and Methods: Maxillary premolars (n= 300) were bonded on the facial surface in five groups. The INSTRON machine was used for shear bond strength testing. Statistical Analysis: Comparison of the mean rank among the groups was done by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To determine the mean difference among groups, the Mann-Whitney test with Bon Ferroni adjustment was applied. Observations: It was observed that <b>light-cure</b> conventional composite resin with the conventional etchant group had the highest and glass ionomer resin adhesive had the lowest shear bond strength. There was no statistically significant difference between conventional composite used with conventional etchant and color-changing composite resin used with conventional etchant or with self-etch primer. Conclusion: Considering the advantages of a color-changing composite and self-etch primer especially in patients having high DMFT scores or physically and mentally compromised patients unable to maintain their hygiene properly, it was concluded in the present study that it would be the most suitable material for direct bonding...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this study was 1) To {{determine}} the impact of eliminating or delaying the photo-activation procedure on the polymerization contraction stress (PCS) and degree of conversion (DC) of a dual-cured resin luting agent, and 2) To determine the amount of delay in photo-initiation of the dual-cured resin cements that can achieve a reduced PCS value with the highest possible DC. The amount of PCS and DC of a dual-cured resin luting agent was determined using a tensometer and ATR spectroscopic technique, respectively. Photo-activation delay in seven tested groups was 0 min, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min, 10 min and no photoactivation. Five samples for each group were tested. There were two hypotheses for this study: 1) A significant decrease in the amount of PCS associated with delayed photo-activation, and 2) A significant increase in DC associated with delayed photo-activation. The PCS of the chemical-cure luting agent had significantly lower value than all of the <b>light-cure</b> groups. For the <b>light-cure</b> groups, those with a 4 -min delay had higher PCS than those with delays of 0 min, 2 min, 6 min, 8 min, and 10 min. The zero (0) -min and 2 -min delay had higher PCS than the 6 -min, 8 -min, and 10 -min delay; and the 6 -min delay had higher PCS than the 8 -min and 10 -min delay. The PCS decreased 0. 086 MPa per minute of delay. The DC of the chemical-cure luting agent had significantly lower value than the 2 -min, 4 -min, 6 -min, 8 -min, and 10 -min delaylight cure. For the <b>light-cure</b> groups, 0 -min delay had a lower DC than the 2 -min, 4 -min, 6 -min, 8 -min, and 10 -min delay; 2 -min delay had lower DC than 4 -min, 6 -min, 8 -min, and 10 -min delay. The 4 -min and 6 -min delay had lower DC than the 8 -min and 10 -min delay; and the 8 -min delay had a lower degree of conversion by peak area than the 10 - minute delay. The DC increased 0. 021 per minute of delay. Extending the stress relief period of the dual-cured luting agents by delaying light activation has a significant impact on PCS and DC values. There was significant decrease in PCS with the delayed light curing of the resin luting agent. Significant increase in DC was noticed when light activation was delayed in the dual-cured resin luting agents...|$|R
