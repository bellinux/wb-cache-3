40|$|Most of the {{empirical}} {{literature on the}} informational role of options markets and the stock price response {{is based on a}} simple dichotomy of companies with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> versus companies without <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> with an implicit assumption that the benefits of options trading are homogenous across companies with <b>listed</b> <b>options.</b> However, when options trading volume is low, <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> may hardly have any impact on the underlying stock price and the company value in turn. This study was therefore taken up to investi-gate relationship between options trading volume and the valuation of underlying company. Using regression analysis between Tobin’s q, which captures company value and options trading volume, along with other control variables that could impinge upon company valuation, we find conclusive evidence that company valuation is significantly related to options trading volume. Therefore, investors and traders must remember that <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> must be supported by sufficient liquidity to offer any insights to future price trends...|$|R

40|$|Lévy {{processes}} {{have gained}} great success in pricing single asset options. In this thesis, we introduce a methodology enabling us {{to extend the}} single asset pricing technique based on Lévy processes to multiasset cases. In our method, we assume the log-return of each asset as a linear sum of independent factors. These factors are driven by the Lévy processes, and the specific Lévy process we are studying in this thesis is the Variance Gamma (VG) process. We recover these factors by a signal processing technique called independent component analysis (ICA), from which we get the physical measure (P measure). To price the contingent claims, we still need the risk-neutral measure (Q measure). We {{bridge the gap between}} physical measure and risk-neutral measure by introducing the transformation of measure between the P measure and the Q measure. We next write each asset as the linear sum of factors under risk-neutral measure. Thus, we may calibrate the measure change parameters simultaneously through individual <b>listed</b> <b>option</b> data. With the measure change parameters (from P measure to Q measure) being recovered, we’re able to price multiasset products by doing Mont...|$|E
40|$|This article uses {{a unique}} option data set to provide {{detailed}} descriptive {{statistics on the}} purchased and written open interest and open buy and sell volume of several classes of investors. We also show that volatility trading through straddles and strangles accounts for {{a small fraction of}} option trading volume and presents evi-dence that a large percentage of call writing is part of covered call positions. Finally, we find that during the stock market bubble of the late 1990 s and early 2000 the least sophisticated investors in the data set substantially increased their purchases of calls on growth but not value stocks.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. It {{is widely}} {{believed}} among South African agricultural market participants that the United States' corn price, as represented by the Chicago Board of Trade-listed corn contract, is causal {{to the price of}} white and yellow maize traded on the South African Futures Exchange. Although a strong correlation exists between these markets, the corn contract is far from causal to the South African maize price, as indicated by Auret and Schmitt (2008). Similarly, South African market participants believe that volatility generated in the United States corn market spills over to the South African market. Given the perceived volatility spill-over from the corn market to the maize market, market participants might inadvertently include a higher volatility component in an option price in the South African maize market than is necessary. This study sought to quantify the amount of volatility spill-over to the South African white and yellow maize market from the United States corn contract. This task was accomplished by applying an Exponential Generalised Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model, within an aggregate shock framework, to the data. The findings indicated that the volatility spill-over from the United States corn market to the South African maize market is not statistically significant. This result suggests that volatility in the South African market is locally driven; hence, it should not be necessary for a South African <b>listed</b> <b>option</b> contract to carry an international volatility component in its price. It was also found that the returns data of the South African maize market is asymmetrically skewed, indicating that bad news will have a greater effect on the price of maize compared with good news.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to model and forecast returns and realized volatility using two different methods: time series models that exploit the historical information set and options-based approach {{that provides a}} natural forecast of return variation from <b>listed</b> <b>option</b> prices. Both univariate and multivariate estimation of the time series models are considered in our analysis. Chapter 1 : This chapter introduces a modified fractionally co-integrated vector autoregressive model, M-FCVAR, that caters for systems with I(0) and I(d) variables under the presence of long memory in the co-integrating residuals. Model inference of the FCVAR and M-FCVAR are compared using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application. The M-FCVAR is found to yield better in-sample fit and more precise model estimates. Higher return predictability is observed over long horizons using the M-FCVAR in the empirical example. In addition, the shocks associated with the I(0) variables could be permanent or transitory. We show that particular equation specifications are required to restrict these shocks when they produce only transitory effects on the I(d) variables. The simulation {{results show that the}} inappropriate treatment of the shock to the I(0) variable may negatively affect the precision in the estimation of the model parameters as well as the in-sample fit. Chapter 2 : This chapter evaluates the performance of various measures of model-free option-implied volatility in predicting returns and realized volatility. The critical role of the out-of-the money call options is highlighted through an investigation of the relevance of different components of the model-free implied volatility. The Monte Carlo simulations show that: first, volatility forecasting performance of measures of implied volatility can be enhanced by employing an interpolation-extrapolation technique; second, for most measures considered, gains in their predictive power for future returns can be obtained by implementing an interpolation procedure. An empirical application using SPX options recorded from 2003 to 2013 further illustrates these claims. Chapter 3 : This chapter compares the performance of various least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) based models in forecasting future log realized variance (RV) constructed from high-frequency returns. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study using the SPY and 10 individual stocks selected from 10 different sectors. In an in-sample analysis, we provide evidence for the invalidity of the lag structure implied by the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model which has been heavily adopted in volatility forecast. In our out-of-sample study considering the full time period, the best forecasting performance is usually provided by the Lasso-based model and the idea of forecast combination tends to improve the forecasting accuracy of the Lasso-based model. Among all models of interest, the ordered Lasso AR using the forecast combination serves as the top performer most frequently in forecasting RV and its improvements over the HAR model are, in most cases, significant over monthly horizons. Moreover, we observe a strong impact of the financial crisis on the performance of the Lasso-based models. Nevertheless, the ordered Lasso AR with the forecast combination still retains its advantages in the post-crisis period, especially over long horizons. In line with the existing study, the superiority of the Lasso-based models is more evident in a larger forecasting window size. The conclusions outlined above are not affected by the variation in the sampling frequency upon which the RV series are based. However, as the sampling frequency increases, there tends to be more situations where the Lasso-based model achieves the top performance in the full sample analysis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether investors produce more information on firms that have <b>listed</b> stock <b>options</b> than on similar firms that do not have options and, if so, whether this additional information translates into a smaller stock-price reaction to releases of public information such as earnings announcements.

We also find, contrary to previous research, that this additional information production does not lead to a smaller price reaction to earnings announcements.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented that {{the introduction of}} options seems to affect the volatility, liquidity, price and other characteristics of the underlying stock. Existing research, however, has not adequately accounted {{for the fact that}} <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> is endogenous, a result of decisions made by exchanges and regulators. We investigate the factors affecting the exchanges’ listing decisions by comparing the characteristics of stocks selected for <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> to other stocks that were eligible but not listed. We find that firm size, volume, and volatility are positively related to the probability of listing, but their relative contributions have changed significantly over time. We re-examine the <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> effects by using control samples of stocks that were eligible, and appeared to be good candidates for listing, but were not selected. Contrary to previous research, we find that in recent subperiods, volatility increases with <b>option</b> <b>listing,</b> consistent with the hypothesis that forward-looking exchanges <b>list</b> <b>options</b> in anticipation of increasing volatility. We verify previous findings that underlying volume increases with <b>option</b> <b>listing,</b> and that there was a positive price effect associated with <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> prior to 1981. However, evidence of a negative price effect after 1981 appears to be much weaker than previously reported.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume {{has focused on}} the benefits of trading in options to shareholders only, arguing that stock <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and subsequent trading volume improve the informational environment of equity market. While debt capital is a major part of firms’ capital structure, the cost of debt capital implications of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume has been overlooked in the literature. Again, the extant literature shows that much of the benefits that shareholders might receive from <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume stems from the informational advantage arising from increased trading by informed investors who possess private information in optioned firms compared to firms without <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> and increased activities of information intermediaries. This informational advantage should also benefit the lenders of the firms because <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume facilitate access to more and higher quality information and also increase stock liquidity. Therefore, informational advantage of optioned firms should allow lenders to better assess the risk of default and facilitate more effective monitoring of debt agreements, which in return, lowers the rates of returns demanded by the lenders. Further, this informational advantage of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and <b>options</b> trading may be far more beneficial to lenders of young firms than old firms because young firms have shorter credit history in the market, thus, exposing their lenders to higher information asymmetry costs. This suggests that lenders could consider the age of borrowing firms as a risk factor when reacting to the informational advantages from options trading and deciding on the rate of return they demand on their lending. To empirically examine the above conjectures, I use three proxies of cost of debt capital comprising credit rating, interest rate on debt, and offering yield spread on new bond issues. My thesis documents the following main findings. First, the results show that all the three proxies used for cost of debt capital are negatively and statistically significantly associated with <b>options</b> <b>listing.</b> Second, the results from further tests on a restricted sample of firm-year observations with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> show that all three proxies of cost of debt capital are negatively and statistically significantly associated with options trading volume. Third, the results of the analysis based on credit rating and interest rate proxies of cost of debt capital show that the reducing effect of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> on the cost of debt capital gradually subsides over time, as firms accumulate a credit history in the capital market. Finally, the results of the analysis based on a restricted sample of firm-year observations with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> and all three proxies of cost of debt capital show that that the reducing effect of options trading volume on the cost of debt capital gradually diminishes over time. The above results remain robust in most of the additional and robustness tests. My thesis contributes to the stream of literature that examines the effect of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume on the cost of capital by providing empirical evidence on the decreasing effect of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and <b>options</b> trading volume on the cost of debt capital. It also contributes to the extant literature on the determinants of the cost of debt capital by documenting that increased information quality stemming from <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume is priced by lenders, i. e., they demand lower rate of return. Also, my thesis improves our understanding of the moderating influence of firm’s age on the ex ante effect of information asymmetry and quality, proxied by <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume, on the cost of debt capital. The findings of this thesis would inform firm managers that {{they may be able to}} access cheaper debt if they can influence options exchanges to select their firm for <b>options</b> <b>listing,</b> and also would be insightful for options exchanges so as to understand the critical implications their selection decisions may have in terms of influencing the firms’ cost of debt capital...|$|R
