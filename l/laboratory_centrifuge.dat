50|$|A <b>{{laboratory}}</b> <b>centrifuge</b> is a {{piece of}} laboratory equipment, driven by a motor, which spins liquid samples at high speed. There are various types of centrifuges, depending on the size and the sample capacity.|$|E
50|$|The load in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>centrifuge</b> must be {{carefully}} balanced. This is achieved by {{using a combination of}} samples and balance tubes which all have the same weight or by using various balancing patterns without balance tubes. Small differences in mass of the load can result in a large force imbalance when the rotor is at high speed. This force imbalance strains the spindle and may result in damage to the centrifuge or personal injury. Some centrifuges have an automatic rotor imbalance detection feature that immediately discontinues the run when an imbalance is detected.|$|E

50|$|A {{centrifuge}} is a {{piece of}} equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle), applying a potentially strong force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward). The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction. At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and move to the center. In a <b>laboratory</b> <b>centrifuge</b> that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration causes denser particles to settle {{to the bottom of the}} tube, while low-density substances rise to the top.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a disposable battery-driven heating system for loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) inside a centrifugally-driven DNA-extraction platform (LabTube).

The system is disposable, fully closed and automated, requiring only a single pipetting step. The microcontroller-driven heating system is low-cost (< 1 $) {{and it can be}} easily parallelized.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a disposable battery-driven heating system for loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) inside a centrifugally-driven DNA purification platform (LabTube). We demonstrate LabTube-based fully automated DNA purification of {{as low as}} 100 cell-equivalents of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) in water, milk and apple juice in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> followed by integrated and automated LAMP amplification with a reduction of hands-on time from 45 to 1 min. The heating system consists of two parallel SMD thick film resistors and a NTC as heating and temperature sensing elements. They are driven by a 3 V battery and controlled by a microcontroller. The LAMP reagents are stored in the elution chamber and the amplification starts immediately after the eluate is purged into the chamber. The LabTube, including a microcontroller-based heating system, demonstrates contamination-free and automated sample-to-answer nucleic acid testing within a <b>laboratory</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> The heating system can be easily parallelized within one LabTube and it is deployable {{for a variety of}} heating and electrical applications...|$|E

40|$|Subclasses of {{lymphocytes}} can {{be separated}} on gradients of non-toxic polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated colloidal silica (Percoll) {{by virtue of}} differential densities. Such gradients can yield functionally active lymphocyte populations after brief centrifugation. Gradients can be generated in a discontinuous step fashion and centrifuged in standard table-top <b>laboratory</b> <b>centrifuges</b> or as self-generating gradients during ultracentrifugation. The density medium has low viscosity and can be made isotonic for virtually any use. Gradients have proved useful in both human and experimental animal studies, and high percentage yields allow for separations from small cell numbers. Methods are described for separation of whole blood and lymphoid subpopuctions. The cytoxic capability of various density fractions was evaluated for mixed lymphocyte culture-induced allogeneic killing and spontaneous, so-called "natural" killer cell activity. The lower density associated with blast transformation allows for significant enrichments of stimulated cells from in vitro cultures. Higher thymidine incorporation, restimualtion in mixed lymphocyte reactions, and greater cytotoxic capacity are associated with these "blast" fractions...|$|R

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of laboratory-scale {{centrifuges}} are used in chemistry, biology, biochemistry and clinical medicine for isolating and separating suspensions and immiscible liquids. They vary widely in speed, capacity, temperature control, and other characteristics. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>centrifuges</b> often can accept a range of different fixed-angle and swinging bucket rotors able to carry different numbers of centrifuge tubes and rated for specific maximum speeds. Controls vary from simple electrical timers to programmable models able to control acceleration and deceleration rates, running speeds, and temperature regimes. Ultracentrifuges spin the rotors under vacuum, eliminating air resistance and enabling exact temperature control. Zonal rotors and continuous flow systems are capable of handing bulk and larger sample volumes, respectively, in a laboratory-scale instrument.Another application in laboratories is blood separation. Blood separates into three main components: red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma. DNA preparation is another common application for pharmacogenetics and clinical diagnosis. DNA samples are purified and the DNA is prepped for separation by adding buffers and then centrifuging it for {{a certain amount of}} time. The blood waste is then removed and another buffer is added and spun inside the centrifuge again. Once the blood waste is removed and another buffer is added the pellet can be suspended and cooled. Proteins can then be removed and the entire thing can be centrifuged again and the DNA can be isolated completely.|$|R
