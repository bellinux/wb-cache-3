25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E
25|$|Leo and Chen {{also suggest}} that the two tests are similar in most respects, with only a narrow gap between them, and would produce the same result in most cases. They caution that judges, rather than {{concerning}} themselves with the labels given to the tests for bias, should be wary of taking extraneous matters into consideration, no matter which test is applied. The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges to be mindful of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> which test is used, but in ensuring that judges have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded extraneous considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E

25|$|In {{the example}} of salat, since salat is {{commanded}} in the Qur'an, all Muslims agree that salat is an obligatory part of Islamic religious practice. According to hadithists, {{the details of how}} to correctly perform salat, to validly fulfill the Qur'anic commmand of salat, can only be found in the ahadith. Despite this, salat is performed differently by different hadithist Islamic sects, depending on which hadith collection each sect relies upon. Quranists, for their part, leave the detail of salat to be a matter between each individual Muslim and Allah, with salat performance done to each Muslim's own individual understanding, interpretation and need. In the Quranists' view, correctly performed salat <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> any supposed correct details of the prayers' performance, but on a correct intention to perform the prayers, valid however it may be individually performed.|$|E
500|$|The talisman connects these precepts to {{the theory}} of vitalism; it {{physically}} represents the life force of its owner, and is reduced with each exercise of the will. The shopkeeper tries to warn Valentin that the wisest path <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> exercising his will or securing power, but in developing the mind. [...] "What is folly", he asks Valentin, [...] "if not an excess of will and power?" [...] Overcome with the possibilities offered by the skin, however, the young man throws caution to the wind and embraces his desire. Upon grabbing the talisman, he declares: [...] "I want to live with excess." [...] Only when his life force is nearly depleted does he recognize his mistake: [...] "It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge of how to use it... had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Away {{from its}} context as a song {{designed}} purely to {{bring attention to}} the Bengalis' cause, as Harrison himself described it, [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] has often been viewed by commentators as a rushed and underwhelming composition. Robert Rodriguez qualifies this opinion, however: [...] "As a single, the song was possibly not the most commercial of records, but as a call to service, it could scarcely have been improved upon." [...] "Bangla Desh"'s standing as rock music's first charity single is not overlooked, with Ian Inglis stating: [...] "'Bangla Desh' serves {{as a model for}} the charity singles that would become commonplace in the decades ahead, although, in this instance, the power of Harrison's song <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> its assembly of famous performers but in its literal and absolute commitment." [...] On this point, Leng deems the song as having [...] "as much raw energy as anything [...] Plastic Ono Band ever offered". In The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes: [...] "Harrison's lyric and vocal were concise and powerful, a direct call for action in a specific crisis. As such, 'Bangla Desh' remains one of the most cogent social statements in music history." ...|$|E

500|$|Znaniecki {{coined the}} term [...] "humanistic coefficient" [...] for a method of social {{research}} by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject's world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only {{if they can be}} objectively described. He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.|$|E

Pitchfork Media critic Jordan Sargent praised the song, and wrote [...] "this isn't a tale of bedroom triumph; instead it's a beguiling sketch of a relationship just out of his reach.

[...] Billboard stated that the [...] "Odd Future member tries out different singing styles, showing off his beautiful falsetto vocal range in certain sections." [...] MTV journalist Jenna Hally commented that Ocean had a [...] "surprisingly gorgeous falsetto" [...] and [...] "retains Frank's classic laid-back and relaxed R vibe." [...] Katherine Asaph of Popdust wrote that the track [...] "might as well be Ocean’s final audition for R stardom" [...] and that it was a [...] "smooth ballad version of [...] "Novacane" [...] without the sleaze {{getting in the way of}} its purpose is just about the best thing possible for Ocean’s burgeoning fame.

Charlie McCollum of the San Jose Mercury News described the latter episodes of the third season as [...] "an absolute thrill ride". Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode as an 8.5/10, commending the character development of Jack and Charlie, and the acting skills of Emerson, who portrays Ben. Lulu Bates of Television Without Pity graded the episode as an [...] "A–". Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad rated [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] as a 6/7, saying that it succeeded in building momentum for the season finale, but pointed out the plot inconsistency regarding Charlie's (in)ability to swim. Scott Juba of The Trades decided that [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] was the best episode of the third season, saying that the flashbacks [...] "evok the type of identifiable human emotions that drives the success of Lost. The true genius of the show <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> its plot twists or mysteries but rather in its ability to make the audience invested in the characters by evoking themes that almost anyone can identify with." [...] Jon Lachonis of BuddyTV noted that the episode was [...] "wildly successful" [...] in turning Charlie into a likeable and relatable character.|$|E

2500|$|From Eliade's perspective, Christianity's [...] "trans-historical message" [...] may be {{the most}} {{important}} help that modern man could have in confronting the terror of history. In his book Mito ("Myth"), Italian researcher Furio Jesi argues that Eliade denies man the position of a true protagonist in history: for Eliade, true human experience <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> intellectually [...] "making history", but in man's experiences of joy and grief. Thus, from Eliade's perspective, the Christ story becomes the perfect myth for modern man. In Christianity, God willingly entered historical time by being born as Christ, and accepted the suffering that followed. By identifying with Christ, modern man can learn to confront painful historical events. Ultimately, according to Jesi, Eliade sees Christianity as the only religion that can save man from the [...] "Terror of history".|$|E

Lilienfield went on further {{to suggest that}} the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> definitional issues, but in different [...] "epistemic attitudes" [...] between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of empiricism, (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of romanticism, (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in [...] "train future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".|$|E

[...] "The foundation of Orthodox bell ringing <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> melody but in rhythm, with its intrinsic dynamic, and in {{the interaction of the}} timbres of [...] bells." [...] These sequences have a very special harmony, since Russian bells (unlike Western European ones) are not tuned to a single note. [...] Western bells usually have an octave between the loudest upper tone ("ring") and the loudest lower tone ("hum"). Russian bells have a seventh between these sounds. Generally, a good Russian bell is tuned to produce a whole scale of sounds (up to several dozen of them). This effect is accomplished both by the composition of the alloy from which the bell is cast and the sculpting of the sides of the bell in the mold.|$|E
