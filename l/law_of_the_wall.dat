40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} a single component liquid film evaporation model.

In order to propose a new <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> the profile of turbulent mixing length was estimated from data processing; it was shown to behave nonlinearly with the radial wall distance. Based on this turbulent mixing length expression, a <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was proposed for the Reynolds averaged azimuthal velocity, derived from momentum balance and validated by comparison to different data.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in a {{turbulent}} flow between two parallel flat plates, the horizontal mean velocity varies logarithmically with height (the so-called 'logarithmic-law-of-the-wall'). The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is a description of the mean velocity profile in wall bounded flows and has been {{regarded as one of the}} underpinning doctrine in the turbulence community for more than half a century. Much of our understanding in wall turbulence has been based from the continuum Navier-Stokes Equation (NSE). More recently, following studies of a modified Navier Stokes Equation, we applied a modified incompressible NSE to the flow of turbulent fluid between two parallel flat plates and solved it analytically [1]. We extended the analysis to the turbulent flow along a single wall and compared the results with the established controversial von Karman logarithmic <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> [2].

Results obtained for incompressible, two-dimensional flow over flat plates and ellipses are compared with solutions from a baseline method which uses a finite-difference method for the entire boundary layer. Since the present method used the finite-difference method in the outer region only, the number of grid points required was about half that needed for the baseline method.
