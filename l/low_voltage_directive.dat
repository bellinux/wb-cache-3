40|$|L OW voltage of the QRS {{deflections}} in {{the standard}} limb leads has engaged the attention of many investigators {{since the early days}} of electrocardi-ography, and the significance attributed to it has undergone. many fluctuations. In recent years, since the use of precordial leads has become more widespread, various reports have appeared on <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> occurring in these leads. Several attempts have been made to show some correlation linking <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the two types of leads, but there has been little agreement among different writers as to whether any correlation of this kind exists. There is, furthermore, no con-sensus as to whether <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the precordial leads is of any important sig-nificance. The present study was undertaken partly to ascertain whether <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the precordial leads has, as a rule, the same or a different origin than <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the limb leads and whether it should be regarded as more, or less, important.

40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage circuits on SiC has profound applications. SiC power devices have proved their superiority {{in terms of}} high temperature operation, faster switching frequencies and larger power densities when compared with Si power devices. The control of SiC power devices however, lies {{in the hands of}} <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> circuits built on Si. Thus, there exists a separation in the overall system between the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage side, which increases system cost, weight and reduces efficiency. With the advancement in <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> SiC processing technology, <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> control circuits can be made on the same die as power devices, and power systems will become compact, robust and more efficient. A new <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> process in 4 H-SiC has been characterized and modeled. In order to design circuits with the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> process, designers need accurate device models for simulation. Currently, there exist no compact models in the public domain for <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> SiC MOSFETs. This work aims at filling that void, by providing a modified PSP model for SiC MOSFETs. In addition, a new compact model for SiC power MOSFETs has also been developed and validated with characterization data from a commercially available 1200 V, 20 A power MOSFET. A gate driver chip has been designed and fabricated in 4 H-SiC using the developed models. The gate driver chip will drive commercially available power MOSFETs in an integrated AC/DC converter application...|$|R
