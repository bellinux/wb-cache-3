40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the identification problem arising in the age-period-cohort models, {{as well as in}} the extended chain ladder model. We propose a canonical parametrization based on the accelerations of the trends in the three factors. This parametrization is exactly identified. It eases interpretation, estimation and forecasting. The canonical parametrization is shown to apply for a class of index sets which have trapezoid shapes, including various <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagrams</b> and the insurance reserving triangles. ...|$|R

5000|$|It was in Zürich that Zeuner {{made his}} {{model of a}} {{locomotive}} front end in 1858; he recognised its potential for creating momentum but was only interested in the theory and did not develop the design any further. Also in Zürich (in 1869) Zeuner invented the three-dimensional population graph now sometimes known as a Zeuner diagram but more often as a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> after Wilhelm Lexis who modified the idea slightly.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{can take}} various forms, the typical <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> is a {{graphical}} illustration of the lifetime of either an individual or a cohort of same-aged individuals. On the diagram, each such lifetime appears as a straight line in a two-dimensional plane, with one dimension representing time and the other representing age. The use of Lexis diagrams is very common amongst demographers, {{so much so that}} they often are used without being identified as Lexis diagrams.|$|E
50|$|In {{demography}} (the {{branch of}} statistics {{that deals with}} the study of populations) a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> (named after economist and social scientist Wilhelm Lexis) is a two dimensional diagram {{that is used to}} represent events (such as births or deaths) that occur to individuals belonging to different cohorts. Calendar time is usually represented on the horizontal axis, while age is represented on the vertical axis. In some textbooks the y-axis is plotted backwards, with age 0 {{at the top of the}} page and increasing downwards. However, other arrangements of the axes are also seen. As an example the death of an individual in 2009 at age 80 is represented by the point (2009,80); the cohort of all persons born in 1929 is represented by a diagonal line starting at (1929,0) and continuing through (1930,1) and so on.|$|E
40|$|Relevant {{events in}} a three state illness-death model (IDM) of a chronic disease are the {{diagnosis}} {{of the disease and}} death with or without the disease. In this article a simulation framework for populations moving in the IDM is presented. The simulation is closely related to the concept of <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagrams</b> in event history analysis. Details of the implementation and an example of a hypothetical disease are described. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, 2 algorithm...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{we believe}} in the {{pedagogical}} value of the framework introduced in this paper. We hope that the present inquiry will be useful as a teaching instrument {{in the same way as}} <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagrams</b> have formed a part of basic demographic education. Our generalized time framework and the relationship between the six dimensions of demographic time both help situate the APC paradigm in a broader context. Just as scientific discovery in general depends partly on the development of finer optics and instrumentation, we hope that the framework we describe will prove an instrument to enable new discoveries in formal and empirical demography, as well as other diverse fields of investigation.|$|R
40|$|Previous twin {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that approximately 25 %of the variation in life span can be attributed to genetic factors and recent studies have also suggested a moderate clustering of extreme longevity within families. Here we discuss various definitions of extreme longevity and some ana-lytical approaches with special attention to the challenges due to censored data. <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagrams</b> are provided for the Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish Twin registries hereby outlining possibilities for longevity studies within GenomEUtwin. We extend previous analyses of lifespan for the Danish 1870 – 1900 twin cohorts to include the new 1901 – 1910 cohorts, which are consistent with the previous findings. The size of the twin cohorts in GenomEUtwin and the existence of population-based, nationwide health and death registers make epidemiological studies of longevity very pow-erful.

30|$|The <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> {{has long}} been used in {{demography}} as a conceptual tool for structuring data, observations, and rate estimation, as inspiration for work on statistical identification, and as the coordinate basis of contemporary Lexis-surfaces. Since the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> could have been named for others (Keiding 2011; Vandeschrick 2001), and since we compare with other temporal configurations, we {{refer to it as}} the APC diagram.|$|E
40|$|The ‘Lexis Diagram’ has {{traditionally}} been used in Demography and Epidemiology for graphical representation of event histories. Timeliness is often cited as the Achilles' heel of Swedish health care. This paper explores {{the use of the}} <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> for monitoring lead times and thus contributing to improved timeliness of healthcare processes. The study was exploratory in nature and followed a qualitative approach. For illustrative purposes, data on an outpatient referral process consisting of four milestones were used to produce a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram.</b> The <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> may complement the reporting of waiting times imposed by maximum waiting-time guarantees. It is expected to contribute to a more holistic view of processes and to a more precise measurement of lead times, enhance the ability of practitioners to react on time while the object is still active in the system and motivate improvements in staff scheduling by increasing the knowledge about the number of objects currently active in the system. However, it may contribute to an excessive emphasis being placed on time, which may distort clinical priorities. To the best of our knowledge, using the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> for monitoring lead times represents a novel application of the diagram...|$|E
30|$|Any {{mapping of}} two time {{measures}} to an (x,y) coordinate system constitutes a temporal plane. If the two given time measures {{are members of}} the same triad identity, the third member is a derived measure. If we assign A to y and P to x, thereby implying C (and the APC triad identity), we state this relationship explicitly by writing AP(C). The temporal plane that corresponds to this informative dyad is the contemporary representation of the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> (Lexis 1875; Pressat 1961). The informative dyads AC(P) and CP(A) also belong to the Lexis identity but imply different less-common rotations and projections of the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{times of}} wide {{availability}} of yearly mortality information {{of age and}} period groups all over the world, we lack in tools that detect and graph fine-grained deviations from mortality trends. We provide a new age-period-cohort based methodology, combining information from age-period (AP) and APC-Detrended (APCD) analyses to detect all-cause mortality increases. Plotting the resulting AP coefficients and APCD residuals in equilateral <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagrams,</b> mortality patterns can easily be distinguished as age, period, or cohort trends and fluctuations. Additionally, we detect abnormalities as interactions of age and period (‘big red spots’). We then investigate the ‘red spots’ of mortality of young-adult cohorts in the early 1990 s in Spain, other southern European countries and the U. S. to delineate their simultaneously occurring public health crises. Additional analyses with WHO mortality data show that mortality increases are mostly due to increased HIV/AIDS mortality. We discuss possible applications of the new method...|$|R
40|$|Age–period–cohort models {{provide a}} useful method for {{modeling}} incidence and mortality rates. It {{is well known}} that age–period–cohort models suffer from an identifiability problem due to the exact relationship between the variables (cohort = period − age). In 2007, Carstensen published an article advocating the use of an analysis that models age, period, and cohort as continuous variables through the use of spline functions (Carstensen, 2007, Statistics in Medicine 26 : 3018 – 3045). Carstensen implemented his method for age–period–cohort models in the Epi package for R. In this article, a new command is introduced, apcfit, that performs the methods in Stata. The identifiability problem is overcome by forcing constraints on either the period or cohort effects. The use of the command is illustrated through an example relating to the incidence of colon cancer in Finland. The example shows how to include covariates in the analysis. apcfit, poprisktime, age–period–cohort models, incidence rates, mortality rates, <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagrams...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Lexis</b> {{introduced}} his <b>diagram</b> {{in his first}} book, Introduction to the Theory of Population Statistics (Strasbourg: Trubner, 1875). However, the notion of using a time vs. age diagram {{appears to have been}} developed more or less simultaneously by other authors. See the paper by Vandeschrick (2001) for more detail.|$|R
30|$|We {{begin by}} {{defining}} some terms {{used throughout the}} manuscript. We then explore all combinations of two time measures, the dyadic relationships, followed by the four triad identities and their diagrams, a generalization of the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> to n-dimensional space, and finally, we present the hexad demographic time-identity.|$|E
40|$|Around 1870, demographers {{felt the}} need for a simple chart to present {{population}} dynamics. This chart is known as the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram,</b> but it is a misnomer. To be useful, this chart must allow for the systematic location on one plane of the three classical demographic co-ordinates, namely: the date, the age and the moment of birth. There are three solutions for this problem. In 1869, Zeuner worked out a first solution. In 1870, Brasche proposed a second one with networks of parallels; it is the version most currently used now. In 1874, Becker proposed the third one. In 1875, certainly after Verwey, Lexis took back the Zeuner’s diagram and just added networks of parallels. In spite of all this, the name "Lexis diagram" has imposed itself in a seemingly invincible way. history, <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram...</b>|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{rates from}} disease {{registers}} are often reported inadequately because of too coarse tabulation {{of data and}} because of confusion about {{the mechanics of the}} age–period–cohort model used for analysis. Rates should be considered as observations in a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram,</b> and tabulation a necessary reduction of data, which should be as small as possible, and age, period and cohort should be treated as continuous variables. Reporting should include the absolute level of the rates as part of the age-effects. This paper gives a guide to analysis of rates from a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> by the age–period–cohort model. Three aspects are considered separately: (1) tabulation of cases and person-years; (2) modelling of age, period and cohort effects; and (3) parametrization and reporting of the estimated effects. It is argued that most of the confusion in the literature comes from failure to make a clear distinction between these three aspects. A set of recommendations for the practitioner is given and a package for R that implements th...|$|E
30|$|In {{the course}} of training, all demographers are {{introduced}} to the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram,</b> a convenient graphical identity between the three main time measures used to structure demographic stocks and flows: age, period, and birth cohort. This representation {{does not account for}} time of death, time until death, or length of life, which may be of interest to researchers as structuring rather than latent variables in order to capture variation in demographic data.|$|E
30|$|The age-period-cohort {{relationship}} {{is a special}} subset of a richer and unbounded set of potential time identities. Of this infinite set of temporal relationships, we present one six-way demographic time identity that expands the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> to a Lexis “space” so as to structure transitions with respect to both birth and death (entry and exit). We call this hexad relationship a demographic time framework because {{it is based on}} the events of birth and death in calendar time, entailing six time measures: chronological age (A), period (P), birth cohort (C), time to death (T), death cohort (D), and individual lifespan (L). In the “From dyads to the triad identities” section, we show how combinations of these time measures imply four triad identities, each of which consists in simple linear relationship between its three constituent time measures. We describe how each triad identity can be extended into a temporal plane, with a characteristic diagram. The four triad identities underly a family of four diagrams that include the familiar <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram,</b> but also three either new or uncommon diagrams: The TPD, which is a sort of dual to the Lexis diagram; the TAL, whose use we deomonstrate in the “Application” section; and the LCD diagrams.|$|E
30|$|Using this terminology, we {{say that}} the “Lexis” {{measures}} constitute a triad identity between chronological age, period, and birth cohort. Each dyad combination of elements in this identity can be mapped to a temporal plane, the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram.</b> If we know that Mindel turned 50 on the 21 st of May, 1963, then we also can derive that she was born on the 21 st of May, 1913. Hence, any two pieces of information {{in this case will}} give the third, and the same holds for the other triad identities.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the first}} {{analytical}} tools {{that can be used}} to analyze data is the graphical representation. The time that is used as a measure in tasks in a wide range is problematic to grasp, and its mapping is not easy. In demographics, some tools, such as the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram,</b> are used. However, the list of graphical tools can be extended by diagrams that look at the time measure in different ways. Their use can be demonstrated not only on demographic data but also on non-demographic data and the modern statistical program R can be used too...|$|E

The extension of these ideas to viewing many criminal histories is then described. The <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> provides a suitable paradigm and is used to position the pencils in space.

30|$|The four identity-based {{diagrams}} {{discussed in}} prior sections are likely straightforward, either because the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> is already {{familiar to the}} reader, or because Cartesian representations are widely used. However, the special relationship between these diagrams {{is based on a}} single hexad identity, which is less straightforward, and its resultant diagram is best derived from a more general groundwork. In this section we therefore describe a more general approach to understanding and constructing higher order temporal identities. This approach is based on a categorization of time measures into events and durations, and the realization that durations derive from events in calendar time.|$|E
40|$|The {{software}} package BAMP provides {{a method of}} analyzing incidence or mortality data on the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram,</b> using a Bayesian version of an age-period-cohort model. A hierarchical model is assumed with a binomial model in the first-stage. As smoothing priors for the age, period and cohort parameters random walks of first and second order, with and without an additional unstructured component are available. Unstructured heterogeneity can also {{be included in the}} model. In order to evaluate the model fit, posterior deviance, DIC and predictive deviances are computed. By projecting the random walk prior into the future, future death rates can be predicted. ...|$|E
30|$|Just as the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> is a {{fundamental}} instrument to teach demography, {{we hope that the}} demographic time measures and their graphical depictions presented here will be helpful to teachers and young demographers who wish to explore time structures beyond age, period, and cohort. The temporal relationships we describe will also be useful for researchers to better detect and understand patterns in their data and for methodologists to rigorously account for the structure of data in demographic methods or statistical designs. Substantively, the concepts we present are applicable to the structure and study of any phenomenon or transition that varies in time, including single or multistate processes.|$|E
40|$|CpG {{islands are}} genome subsequences with an {{unexpectedly}} {{high number of}} CG di-nucleotides. They are typically identified using filtering criteria (e. g., G+C% expected vs. observed CpG ratio and length) and are computed using sliding window methods. Most such studies illusively assume an exhaustive search of CpG islands are achieved on the genome sequence of interest. We devise a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> and explicitly show that filtering criteria-based definitions of CpG islands are mathematically incomplete and non-operational. These facts imply that the sliding window methods frequently fail to identify {{a large percentage of}} subsequences that meet the filtering criteria. We also demonstrate that an exhaustive search is computationally expensive. We develop the Hierarchical Factor Segmentation (HFS) algorithm, a pattern recognition technique with an adaptive model selection device to overcome the incompleteness and non-operational drawbacks, and to achieve effective computations for identifying CpG-islands. The concept of a CpG island “core” is introduced and computed using the HFS algorithm, which is independent from any specific filtering criteria. Upon such a CpG island “core,” a CpG-island is constructed using a <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram.</b> This two-step computational approach provides a nearly exhaustive search for CpG islands that can be practically implemented on whole chromosomes. In a simulation study realistically mimicking CpG-island dynamics through a Hidden Markov Model we demonstrate that this approach retains very high sensitivity and specificity, that is, very low rates of false positives and false negatives. Finally, we apply the HFS algorithm to identify CpG island cores on human chromosome 21...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{addition}} to the right-censoring of the lifetimes, sampling bias pos-sibly occurs in many situations while collecting the data. In practical situations, {{the form of the}} bias function is always assumed to be known, but if no information is available on the selection bias this can turn out to be unbearable. We provide a model selection strategy for estimating the hazard and the density functions in presence of both censoring and unknown sampling bias. We use a new sampling scheme description based on the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> including time-window or cohort studies. Adaptive projection estimators on trigonometric bases are developed by contrast penalization and optimal nonparametric rates of convergence are given.

40|$|After first {{examining}} {{the issues in}} visualising individual event histories, {{a description of a}} new method for viewing such data is given. The technique displays an event history as a pencil-like multi-faceted object in three-dimensional space, with changes of state being represented by changes in colour, texture or height {{along the length of the}} pencil. Viewing a single history allows a detailed examination of an individual's life events, and allows the relationship between changes of state in many variables to be examined. The extension of these ideas to viewing populations of event histories is then described. The <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> provides a suitable paradigm and is used to position the pencils in space. The resulting graphical representation is closely related to the ideas of Bertin, but with some important differences...|$|E
40|$|Survival {{analysis}} problems often involve dual timescales, {{most commonly}} calendar date and lifetime, {{the latter being}} the elapsed time since an initiating event such as a heart transplant. In our main example {{attention is focused on}} the hazard rate of 'death' as a function of calendar date. Three different estimates are discussed, one each from proportional hazards analyses on the lifetime and the calendar date scales, and one from a symmetric approach called here the 'two-way proportional hazards model', a multiplicative hazards model going back to Lexis in the 1870 s. The three are connected through a Poisson generalized linear model for the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram.</b> The two-way model is shown to combine the information from the two 'one-way' proportional hazards analyses efficiently, at the cost of more extensive parametric modelling.

40|$|Modied {{versions}} of the life time distribution are often used in survival analysis. The modifications depend on how we choose individuals for the study and on the assumptions {{on the behavior of}} the population. A rigorous point process description of the <b>Lexis</b> <b>diagram</b> is used to make the sampling mechanisms and the preconditions transparent. The point process description gives a framework to handle all possible sampling patterns. The setup is generalized so it can handle more complicated life descriptions than just lifetimes, and the disability model is used as an example. Two setups can be used. Conditional on the birthtimes, the life time distribution is left truncated and subject to either right censoring or right truncation. Assuming that the birthtimes can be described by a Poisson process the modications are length bias and the recurrence time distribution known from renewal theory...|$|E
