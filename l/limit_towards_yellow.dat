50|$|The obvious {{properties}} we can {{see when}} we look at an isolated colour and let it act alone, on one side is the warmth or coldness of the colour tone, {{and on the other side}} is the clarity or obscurity of that tone. Warmth is a tendency <b>towards</b> <b>yellow,</b> and coldness a tendency <b>towards</b> blue; <b>yellow</b> and blue form the first great, dynamic contrast. Yellow has an eccentric movement and blue a concentric movement; a yellow surface seems to move closer to us, while a blue surface seems to move away. Yellow is a typically terrestrial colour, whose violence can be painful and aggressive. Blue is a celestial colour, evoking a deep calm. The combination of blue and yellow yields total immobility and calm, which is green.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of process conditions (time, pH, temperature and consistency) on the optical properties of mechanical pulps during storage in a clean system as a reference for further work. Laboratory storage trials were performed with unbleached and hydrogen-peroxide bleached well-washed Norway spruce pulps. In general, the pulp darkened during storage due {{to an increase in}} light absorption, especially at shorter wavelengths. After long storage times, the light absorption coefficient, k had increased also at longer wavelengths. No specific peaks were seen in Delta k-spectra. The increase in light absorption was most rapid initially, during the first four hours, for all pulps when stored at high temperature (80 degrees C), and then proceeded more slowly. The corresponding change in colour, measured as a* and b*, was shifted towards red and somewhat <b>towards</b> <b>yellow,</b> and over longer periods of storage, the shift <b>towards</b> <b>yellow</b> became greater. Time and temperature were found to have the largest impact. The effects were similar regardless of the starting pH (4. 3 - 9. 7) and pulp consistency (5 %- 25 %). The hydrogen-peroxide bleached pulps were more sensitive to storage compared to the unbleached pulp at temperatures above 50 degrees C. At storage times of up to four hours, the unbleached pulp showed no loss of brightness at either of the storage temperatures. A slightly less bleached pulp darkened more than a highly bleached pulp at all wavelengths. The only difference measured between the two pulps was that the less bleached pulp had a higher content of iron. This higher iron content may be {{at least part of the}} reason for the more extensive darkening...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground. - Postural control {{associated}} with self-paced movement {{is critical for}} balance in frail older adults. The present work aimed to investigate {{the effects of a}} 2 D virtual reality-based program on postural control {{associated with}} rapid arm movement in this population. Methods. - Participants in an upright standing position performed rapid arm-raising movements towards a target. Practice-related changes were assessed by pre- and post-test comparisons of hand kinematics and centre-of-pressure (CoP) displacement parameters measured in a training group and a control group. During these pre- and post-test sessions, patients have to reach <b>towards</b> <b>yellow</b> balls appearing on the screen, form a standardized upright position (with 15 cm between the two malleoli). Training group patients took part in six sessions of virtual game. In this, patients were asked to reach their arm <b>towards</b> <b>yellow</b> balls appearing on the screen, from an upright position. Results. - After training, we observed improvements in arm movements and in the initial phase of CoP displacement, especially in the anticipatory postural adjustments. Learning curves for these two types of motor improvements showed different rates. These were continuous for the control of the arm movement, and discontinuous for the control of the CoP during the anticipatory postural adjustments. Conclusion. - These results suggest that some level of motor (re) -learning is maintained in frail patients with low functional reserves. They also suggest that re-learning of anticipatory postural control (i. e. motor prediction) is less robust than explicit motor learning involved for the arm reaching. This last point should encourage clinicians to extend the training course duration, even if reaching movement improvements seems acquired, in order to automate these anticipatory postural activities. However, other studies should be done to measure the retention of these two types of learning on a longer-term period. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

Rosemary extract increased the absorption of color in the visible region, which in turn led to increase of the parameters a (index color tends toward green) and b (index color tends <b>towards</b> <b>yellow).</b> The results showed that increasing concentrations of rosemary extract have a significant effect (p < 0. 05) to reduce the amount of oxygen and water vapor permeability.
