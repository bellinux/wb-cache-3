5|$|Young Filitti made {{a remarkably}} early {{entry into the}} {{diplomatic}} corps, and stayed on with the Romanian <b>Legation</b> in France. In this capacity, he purposefully embarrassed PNL Foreign Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu by not sending in all <b>Legation</b> employees to receive him during an official visit. During his return trips to Romania, Filitti was focusing on researching his own family archives, and, in 1910, published the volume Așezământul cultural al mitropolitului Dositei Filitti, de la înființare până azi ("Metropolitan Dositei Filitti's Cultural Foundation, from Its Establishment to the Present Day"). In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in Greece and Macedonia, and from Romanian diplomats working in Istanbul. In a show of perfectionism, Filitti constantly revised the work as new data surfaced, and, in 1936, declared the 1910 edition to be entirely unusable.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, {{three years}} after von Eulenburg's visit in Tokyo, a Shogunal <b>legation</b> arrived at the Prussian court of King Wilhelm I and was greeted with a grandiose {{ceremony}} in Berlin. After the treaty was signed, Max von Brandt became diplomatic representative in Japan – first representing Prussia, and after 1866 representing the North German Confederation, and by 1871 representing the newly established German Empire.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese garden had a {{very strong}} {{influence}} on early Japanese gardens. In or around 552 AD, Buddhism was officially installed from China, via Korea, into Japan. Between 600 and 612, the Japanese Emperor sent four <b>legations</b> to the Court of the Chinese Sui Dynasty. Between 630 and 838, the Japanese court sent fifteen more <b>legations</b> to the court of the Tang Dynasty. These <b>legations,</b> with more than five hundred members each, included diplomats, scholars, students, Buddhist monks, and translators. They brought back Chinese writing, art objects, and detailed descriptions of Chinese gardens.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, other insurrections {{arose in the}} Papal <b>Legations</b> of Bologna, Forlì, Ravenna, Imola, Ferrara, Pesaro and Urbino. These {{successful}} revolutions, which adopted the tricolore in favour of the Papal flag, quickly spread {{to cover all the}} Papal <b>Legations,</b> and their newly installed local governments proclaimed the creation of a united Italian nation. The revolts in Modena and the Papal <b>Legations</b> inspired similar activity in the Duchy of Parma, where the tricolore flag was adopted. The Parmese duchess Marie Louise left the city during the political upheaval.|$|R
5|$|Prominent {{among the}} German {{members of the}} {{delegation}} were Niedermayer and von Hentig. Von Hentig was a Prussian military officer who had served as the military attaché to Beijing in 1910 and Constantinople in 1912. Fluent in Persian, he was appointed secretary of the German <b>legation</b> to Tehran in 1913. Von Hentig was serving on the Eastern front as a lieutenant with the Prussian 3rd Cuirassiers when he was recalled to Berlin for the expedition.|$|E
5|$|There {{remains a}} small degree of mystery {{concerning}} Caroline's early life. One account states {{that her father}}, Jules Delacroix, was a janitor of the French <b>Legation</b> at Bucharest. Another states that her father lived in Bucharest to seek his fortune, and she was born there as the thirteenth child of her parents. In her youth, Caroline worked as a barmaid.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of appeals for help, the Danish <b>legation</b> in Russia issued Olga a passport, which she used to enter Germany {{on the eve of}} its defeat, {{eventually}} joining her eldest son and his family in Switzerland in early 1919. Other members of the Russian imperial family did not escape. Among those killed were the Tsar, Tsarina and their five children; Olga's brothers Grand Dukes Nicholas and Dmitri Constantinovich; three of her nephews Princes John, Constantine and Igor Constantinovich; and the Tsarina's sister Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of establishing <b>legations</b> gradually fell from favor as the embassy became the standard form of diplomatic mission. The {{establishment of the}} French Third Republic and the continued growth of the United States meant {{that two of the}} Great Powers were now republics. The French Republic continued the French Empire's {{practice of}} sending and receiving ambassadors. In 1893, the United States followed the French precedent and began sending ambassadors, upgrading its <b>legations</b> to embassies. The last remaining American <b>legations,</b> in Bulgaria and Hungary, were upgraded to embassies in 1966.|$|R

5|$|Following his {{admission}} to the New York Bar, MacMurray sought a career in government. A letter of commendation from Woodrow Wilson helped MacMurray secure {{an opportunity to take}} the foreign service examination. In 1907, he was appointed as Consul-General and Secretary of <b>Legation</b> in Bangkok, Siam, and then became second secretary at the U.S. embassy in St. Petersburg. There he worked under ambassador William Woodville Rockhill, who was credited with helping to shape the United States’ open door policy towards China.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a senior}} Kodokan {{instructor}} named Yamashita Yoshiaki {{traveled to the}} United States {{at the request of}} the Seattle businessman Sam Hill. In Washington, DC, Yamashita's students included Theodore Roosevelt and other prominent Americans. At Roosevelt's request, Yamashita also taught judo at the US Naval Academy. Capitalizing on the publicity, the Japanese <b>Legation</b> in the USA asked the Kodokan to send more judo teachers to America, providing continuity to Yamashita's work. Tomita reluctantly accepted the task; Maeda and Satake embraced the opportunity.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{it needs}} to be {{highlighted}} that before World War II there was a division between embassies and <b>legations</b> based on the system of diplomatic ranks established by the Congress of Vienna of 1815. Until the mid-20th century, most diplomatic representations were still <b>legations</b> as embassies were reserved for a few of the major world powers or close allies. The division between <b>legations</b> and embassies changed after World War II when it was no longer considered appropriate to treat states differently in line with the United Nations principle of equality of sovereign states, enshrined in the UN Charter.|$|R
2500|$|With {{conflicting}} allegiances {{and priorities}} motivating the various forces inside Beijing, {{the situation in}} the city became increasingly confused. The foreign <b>legations</b> continued to be surrounded by both Qing imperial and Gansu forces. While Dong Fuxiang's Gansu army, now swollen by the addition of the Boxers, wished to press the siege, Ronglu's imperial forces seem to have largely attempted to follow Empress Dowager Cixi's decree and protect the <b>legations.</b> However, to satisfy the conservatives in the imperial court, Ronglu's men also fired on the <b>legations</b> and let off firecrackers {{to give the impression that}} they, too, were attacking the foreigners. Inside the <b>legations</b> and out of communication with the outside world, the foreigners simply fired on any targets that presented themselves, including messengers from the imperial court, civilians and besiegers of all persuasions. Dong Fuxiang was denied artillery held by Ronglu which stopped him from leveling the <b>legations,</b> and when he complained to Empress Dowager Cixi on June 23, she dismissively said that [...] "Your tail, is becoming too heavy to wag." [...] The Alliance discovered large amounts of unused Chinese Krupp artillery and shells after the siege was lifted.|$|R
5|$|Laid down on 25 May 1910, Rivadavia was {{launched}} and christened on 26 August 1911 by Isabel, {{the wife of}} the Argentine Minister to the United States Rómulo Sebastián Naón. Thousands of people were present to witness the event, including representatives from the Argentine Navy and the country's <b>legation</b> in Washington. The United States sent the assistant chief of the Latin American Division in the State Department, Henry L. James, to be its official representative. Two United States Navy bureau chiefs also attended.|$|E

5|$|The British {{diplomatic}} mission to Belgium, under Ambassador Lancelot Oliphant, {{was attached to}} the government in exile. In March 1941, the Americans also sent an Ambassador, Anthony Biddle Jr., to represent the United States to the governments in exile of Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and Norway. The Soviet Union, which had broken off diplomatic relations with Belgium in May 1941 (heavily influenced by the then-in force Nazi-Soviet Pact), re-established its <b>legation</b> to the government in exile {{in the aftermath of the}} German invasion and eventually expanded it to the rank of Embassy in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the Chinese Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and {{calisthenics}} they practiced. It began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist, peasant-based movement that attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui. Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city. The Qing ordered foreign diplomats and personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the <b>legation</b> quarter of Beijing.|$|E
5|$|William Warburton's {{treatise}} The Divine <b>Legation</b> of Moses, published from 1738 to 1741, {{included an}} analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence. Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt, Warburton argued that {{the public face of}} Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper, monotheistic truth to elite initiates. One of them, Moses, learned this truth during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to reveal it to the entire Israelite nation.|$|E

Trees were blown down in the parks of Havana. Twenty {{people were killed in}} the city, while in Batabanó, nine people were killed, with many others missing. In Matanzas, the location of the United States' 28th Infantry, tents were destroyed and there was widespread damage. However, nobody was killed or injured in the city. In San Luis, tobacco crops were ruined, and 150 tobacco barns in the Alquízar municipality were destroyed. The sugar crop in Pinar del Río Province survived well during the hurricane. In the La Guria section of Cuba, the banana crops were completely destroyed. Rivers topped their banks throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|In April 1928, Andrić {{was posted}} to Madrid as vice-consul. While there, he wrote essays on Simón Bolívar and Francisco Goya, and {{began work on}} the novel Prokleta avlija (The Damned Yard). In June 1929, he was named {{secretary}} of the Yugoslav <b>legation</b> to Belgium and Luxembourg in Brussels. On 1 January 1930, {{he was sent to}} Switzerland as part of Yugoslavia's permanent delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva, and was named deputy delegate the following year. In 1933, Andrić returned to Belgrade, and shortly thereafter France decorated him with the Legion of Honour. Two years later, he was named head of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 5 November 1937, Andrić became assistant to Milan Stojadinović, Yugoslavia's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The <b>legation</b> was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.|$|E
