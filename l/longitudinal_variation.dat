5000|$|The {{most recent}} types of optical {{dilatometer}} use a direct-beam system {{so as to}} avoid contact-related problems by measuring the image that the specimen projects on an image sensor, when irradiated by a light beam. By using a single beam of light with short wavelength and a very high resolution image sensor it is possible to achieve good resolutions, although not comparable to those of the standard dilatometers. For example, using a blue light with a wavelength below 1500 micrometers, it is possible to achieve images with an actual resolution of nearly 1500 micrometers/pixel of the camera (not an interpolated resolution but an actual resolution). By using two light beams, which illuminate two small portions of material at the extremities of the sample, set perpendicularly to the beams direction, it is then possible to achieve an absolute measurement of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variation</b> while heat-treating the specimen.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, NACA {{research}} {{began to}} focus on near-sonic and low-supersonic airflow. After considering the sudden drag increase which a wing-fuselage combination experiences at somewhere around 500 mph, Whitcomb concluded that [...] "the disturbances and shock waves are simply a function of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variation</b> of the cross-sectional area" [...] - that is, the effect of the wings could be visualized as equivalent to a fuselage with a sort of midriff bulge whose frontal area was {{the same as that of}} the wings. Since the wings could not be dispensed with in the actual case, the alternate to removing the [...] "bulge" [...] would be to decrease the fuselage's cross-section near the wings. This became known as the area rule, which allowed a significant reduction in the drag felt by airplanes near the speed of sound. Its impact on aircraft design was immediate: the prototype Convair YF-102, for example, was found not to be capable of exceeding the speed of sound in level flight. This was rectified by re-sculpting the fuselage. For his insight, Whitcomb won the Collier Trophy in 1954.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{indicated}} that the observed Weddell Sea anomaly (WSA) {{appeared to be an}} extreme manifestation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, since the WSA is characterized by greater evening electron density than the daytime density in the region near the Weddell Sea. In the present study, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> of the nighttime F 2 -layer peak electron density at southern midlatitudes are analyzed using the observations of the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites between 2006 and 2008. It is found that significant longitudinal difference (> 150 %) relative to the minimum density at each local time prevails in all seasons, although the WSA phenomenon is only evident in summer under this solar minimum condition. Another interesting feature is that in summer, the maximum longitudinal differences occur around midnight (~ 23 : 00 – 00 : 00 LT) rather than in the evening (19 : 00 – 21 : 00 LT) in the evening, when the most prominent electron density enhancement occurs for the WSA phenomenon. Thus the seasonal–local time patterns of the electron density <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> during nighttime at southern midlatitudes cannot be simply explained in terms of the WSA. Meanwhile, the variations of the geomagnetic configuration and the equivalent magnetic meridional winds/upward plasma drifts are analyzed to explore their contributions to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> of the nighttime electron density. The maximum longitudinal differences are associated with the strongest wind-induced vertical plasma drifts after 21 : 00 LT in the Western Hemisphere. Besides the magnetic declination–zonal wind effects, the geographic meridional winds and the magnetic inclination also have significant effects on the upward plasma drifts and the resultant electron density...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEmpirically, {{pedestrian}} motion can {{be studied}} at various levels. At the macroscopic level one may study the basic flow parameters (like speed and density) of pedestrian motion, at the microscopic level one may track the paths followed by individual pedestrians while moving. Whereas, at a mesoscopic level one can study pedestrian motion by concentrating on how the flow parameters change spatially and temporally. Such studies help in understanding pedestrian flow at a reasonably fundamental level and also aid in understanding how various geometric features impact pedestrian motion. In this study, macroscopic and mesoscopic level data are collected from various experiments aimed at understanding impact of corridor geometry on uni–directional and bi– directional pedestrian flow. First one is a “basic uniform width” or a “reference” corridor. To impose geometric variations in the corridor two different procedures are adapted, i) narrowing (symmetric as well as asymmetric) of the corridor, and ii) partial bifurcation of the corridor (by placing obstacle for a certain distance inside the corridor). Experimental details and results on narrowed corridors and their comparisons with the “reference” corridor are presented in another earlier paper. This study concentrates on experimental details and results on partially bifurcated corridor and their comparisons with the “reference” corridor. These experiments are intended to observe the lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> in density and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> in speed due {{to the impact of}} various corridor geometry when pedestrians can walk side–by–side as well as overtake one another. To understand the lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>variations</b> in density some crucial parameters are introduced in this study, which prove to be good quantitative measure in this regard. Results both on density and speed accentuate the fact that partial bifurcation in the corridor adversely impacts pedestrian flow inside the corridor...|$|R
