5|$|In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican {{and flat}} tax {{advocate}} Demaris H. Miller. In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in {{his support of}} President Bill Clinton, after Moran, {{who had been a}} vocal supporter of the Clinton White House, voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though she had {{originally}} hoped {{to publish the}} book during the 1998 <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal,</b> in which US President Bill Clinton was discovered {{to have had a}} sexual relationship with a White House intern, the research took several years longer than she had initially planned. The book was finally released in 2006 by Doubleday and Three Leaves Press in hardback, paperback, and e-book editions.|$|E
2500|$|At times acerbic, Cockburn {{could also}} be gently and humorously ironic, once declaring Gerald Ford America's {{greatest}} president for [...] "doing the least damage" [...] and praising the <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal's</b> entertainment value. In the same vein, he has also expressed his admiration for the beauty of both Tipper Gore and Laura Bush. His nudge-nudge, wink-wink brand of humor is demonstrated in his {{response to a question}} asking for a comparison between George W. Bush and Napoleon. He replied that he wasn't sure about Bush as Napoleon, [...] "though surely Josephine's heart beats beneath Laura's delicious bosom".|$|R
50|$|During the Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandals,</b> Livingston {{was one of}} many Republicans {{who demanded}} President Bill Clinton's resignation, and later impeachment, for perjury. After Newt Gingrich {{resigned}} as Speaker in part because of Republican losses in the 1998 elections, majority leader Dick Armey and majority whip Tom DeLay had opted not to contest the Speaker's chair. Livingston subsequently announced that he was not only running for Speaker, but had lined up enough support to win. He was nominated as the Republican candidate for Speaker without opposition. As the GOP had retained a narrow majority in the House, this effectively made him Speaker-elect. Although the Speaker is formally elected by the entire House, in practice the majority party's candidate is all but assured of winning that vote.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the usefulness}} of recent offerings from scholars, such as John Thompson, that have aimed to bring {{a greater understanding of}} the subject of political scandal, by applying them to case studies of authentic political scandals during the Clinton Presidency. Academics have attempted to discover a more authoritative definition of a political scandal and have suggested tentative theories to explain the phases of high and low scandal activity that have been experienced throughout history, this is no more evident than in the United States. By applying these offerings to the highly detailed examinations of the Whitewater and Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandals,</b> this study argues that the academic theories, thus far, are found to have limitations when faced with complex, modem political scandals in the United States. While this study does not offer a theory on political scandal of its own, it suggests that, although important contributions have been made, that more academic work is required to gain a greater understanding to potentially develop a new theory on political scandal...|$|R
5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal,</b> which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal,</b> and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{required a}} Saxbe fix, passed and {{signed into law}} in December 2008. Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, {{a week before the}} Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton. By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65percent, the highest point since the <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal.</b> On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2. Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day. She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the public {{coverage}} of the political <b>scandal,</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> gained international celebrity status; she subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures that included designing a line of handbags under her name, being an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, and working as a television personality.|$|R

Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored.

5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal</b> were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E

2500|$|The {{case went}} to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her {{original}} legal team, and it was dismissed via summary judgment. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, [...] "... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal {{to submit to the}} governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment." [...] The ruling was appealed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> sex <b>scandal.</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} in contemporary American politics, presidential scandal is poorly understood within political science. Scholars typically interpret scandals as {{resulting from the}} disclosure of official misbehavior, but the likelihood and intensity of media scandals is also influenced by the political and news context. This article provides a theoretical argument for two independent factors that should increase the president’s vulnerability to scandal: low approval among opposition party identifiers {{and a lack of}} congestion in the news agenda. Using new data and statistical approaches, I find strong support for both claims. These results suggest that contextual factors shape the occurrence of political events and how such events are interpreted. From Iran-Contra to Monica <b>Lewinsky,</b> presidential <b>scandal</b> has come to play an especially important role in contemporary American politics since Watergate, but it remains an elusive and poorly understood topic within political science. 1 To date, most quantitative research on scandal has focused on the effects of allegations of impropriety on trust in government and the media, 2 members of Congress 3 or the president. 4 No clea...|$|R
2500|$|For {{the next}} several months and through the summer, the media debated whether an affair had {{occurred}} and whether Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the <b>scandal,</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton. [...] She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (that Linda Tripp had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators, thereby providing unambiguous DNA evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials.|$|R
25|$|Barr is {{best known}} for his role as one of the House {{managers}} during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial. It was Barr who first introduced a resolution directing the House Judiciary Committee to inquire into impeachment proceedings – months before the Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal</b> came to light. Foremost among the concerns Barr cited at the time was apparent obstruction of Justice Department investigations into Clinton campaign fundraising from foreign sources, chiefly the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis began as the property bubble in the Far East began to burst in Thailand, causing large financial losses {{in those countries}} that greatly affected foreign investors. While Bill Clinton was preoccupied with the Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal,</b> Robert Rubin took control of foreign policy and forced loans onto the affected countries. However, after each country agreed to be bailed out by the IMF, foreign investors immediately pulled their money out of those countries, leaving their taxpayers with enormous debts and triggering massive economic disasters.|$|E

40|$|One {{need not}} be a deep thinker to grasp the {{intimate}} linkage between sex and politics, enshrined in the hoary adage that “Politics makes strange bedfellows ” and more recently in the confession of Henry Kissinger [...] surely one of history’s most unlikely Casanovas [...] that “Power is the greatest aphrodisiac. ” Still, pundits and political scientists alike were left groping for an explanation in early 1998 when, with allegations of sexual improprieties involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky surging rampantly around him, President Clinton’s public standing rose higher and higher instead of going down. Why wasn’t the normally puritanical American public condemning the president rather than getting behind him? Perhaps, some opined, Americans were ceding a “zone of privacy ” to the president. Or perhaps, having grown accustomed to Clinton’s recurrent “bimbo eruptions, ” they considered the latest allegations simply more of the same. Or perhaps half of the public [...] the male half [...] was engaging in projection. These speculations are wrong, of course, but an even more grievous failing is that they cannot be derived from the theory of rational choice, which holds the key to understanding all of politics, economics, and indeed life. Thus, in what follows I outline and then provide empirical validation of a rational theory of the American public’s fluid reaction to the <b>Lewinsky</b> sex <b>scandal.</b> The statistical results demonstrate that I have indeed hit on the key to understanding presidential performance. The Interpretation in a Nutshell Underlying my interpretation is the assumption that the American public behaves rationally. This penetrating insight simply means that, given a modicum of information, the public is capable of reaching a satisfying conclusion. Once this seminal assumption has been laid out, the rest of the interpretation flows: (1) The public wants presidents to succeed. (2) The most successful presidents are those who are sexually active outside the marital bed. (3) Therefore, the public wants presidents to engage in extramarital sex, and welcomes signs that they are doing so. Of the three components of the model, (1) is noncontroversial, and (3), when combined with the rationality assumption, is simply the logical climax of (1) and (2). My task, then, is to establish the correctness of (2) ...|$|R
25|$|Historically, two doctrines {{concerning}} {{executive power}} have developed that enable {{the president to}} exercise executive power {{with a degree of}} autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, , that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the <b>Lewinsky</b> <b>scandal,</b> the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, , that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.|$|E
