40|$|Background. Alopecia areata (AA) is an {{autoimmune}} condition, {{in which}} hair is lost from {{some areas of}} the body. Though its etiopathogenesis is not fully understood, there are claims that imbalance of trace elements may trigger the onset of AA, by distorting immune functions. In this study, we tried to investigate the relationship between AA and iron, zinc, and copper levels of serum and hair. Materials and Methods. Sixteen female patients with AA (14 – 40 years old) and 27 healthy female controls were enrolled in this study. Serum and <b>hair</b> <b>level</b> of iron, zinc, and copper were measured by flame emission spectroscopy. The resulting data was analyzed with SPSS 15. Results. We did not detect {{a significant difference in the}} serum and <b>hair</b> <b>level</b> of iron, zinc, and copper between patients and controls. There was a significant correlation between serum and <b>hair</b> <b>level</b> of iron (r= 0. 504,[*][*]P= 0. 001), zinc (r= 0. 684,[*][*]P= 0. 0001), and copper (r= 0. 759, P= 0. 0001) in patients and controls. Discussion and Conclusion. According to this study, there was no statistically significant difference between trace elements among AA patients and controls. So the trace elements <b>level</b> in <b>hair</b> and serum may not be relevant to the immunologic dysfunction that exists in AA patients...|$|R

Hair samples were collected at 9 : 00 h and 17 : 00 h two weeks after the behavioural tests. Results showed that behavioural reactivity to playback of the various stimuli correlates with cortisol <b>levels</b> in <b>hair</b> samples collected at 9 : 00 h, and the same was the case for the separate measures of behaviour (i. e. hiding, running away, seeking attention from the tester, panting and lowering of the body posture).

40|$|Pre-exposure {{prophylaxis}} (PrEP) trials using tenofovir-based regimens {{have demonstrated}} that high levels of adherence are required to evaluate efficacy; the incorporation of objective biomarkers of adherence in trial design has been essential to interpretation, given the inaccuracy of self-report. Antiretroviral measurements in scalp hair have been useful as a marker of long-term exposure in the HIV treatment setting, and hair samples are relatively easy and inexpensive to collect, transport, and store for analysis. To evaluate the relationship between dose and tenofovir concentrations in hair, we examined the dose proportionality of tenofovir in hair in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. A phase I, crossover pharmacokinetic study was performed in 24 HIV-negative adults receiving directly-observed oral tenofovir tablets administered 2, 4, and 7 doses/week for 6 weeks, with a ≥ 3 -week break between periods. Small samples of hair were collected after each six-week period and analyzed for tenofovir concentrations. Geometric-mean-ratios compared levels between each pair of dosing conditions. Intensive plasma pharmacokinetic studies were performed during the daily-dosing period to calculate areas-under-the-time-concentration curves (AUCs). Over 90 % of doses were observed per protocol. Median tenofovir concentrations in hair increased monotonically with dose. A log-linear relationship was seen between dose and <b>hair</b> <b>levels,</b> with an estimated 76 % (95 % CI 60 - 93 %) increase in <b>hair</b> <b>level</b> per 2 -fold dose increase. Tenofovir plasma AUCs modestly predicted drug concentrations in hair. This study found a strong linear relationship between frequency of dosing and tenofovir <b>levels</b> in scalp <b>hair.</b> The analysis of quantitative drug <b>levels</b> in <b>hair</b> {{has the potential to}} improve adherence measurement in the PrEP field and may be helpful in determining exposure thresholds for protection and explaining failures in PrEP trials. Hair measures for adherence monitoring may also facilitate adherence measurement in real-world settings and merit further investigation in upcoming PrEP implementation studies and programs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: The {{efficacy}} of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV will diminish with poor adherence; pharmacologic measures of drug exposure have proven critical to PrEP trial interpretation. We assessed drug exposure in hair against other pharmacologic and more routinely used measures to assess pill-taking. DESIGN:: Participants were randomized to placebo, daily PrEP, or intermittent PrEP to evaluate safety and tolerability of daily versus intermittent tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC) in 2 phase II PrEP clinical trials conducted in Africa. Different measures of drug exposure, including self-report, medication event monitoring system (MEMS) -caps openings, and TFV/FTC <b>levels</b> in <b>hair</b> and other biomatrices were compared. METHODS:: At weeks 8 and 16, self-reported pill-taking, MEMS-caps openings, and TFV/FTC <b>levels</b> in <b>hair,</b> plasma, and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) were measured. Regression models evaluated predictors of TFV/FTC {{concentrations in the}} 3 biomatrices; correlation coefficients between pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures were calculated. Both trials were registered on ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 00931346 /NCT 00971230). RESULTS:: Hair collection was highly feasible and acceptable (100 % in week 8; 96 % in week 16). In multivariate analysis, strong associations were seen between pharmacologic measures and MEMS-caps openings (all P < 0. 001); self-report was only weakly associated with pharmacologic measures. TFV/FTC hair concentrations were significantly correlated with levels in plasma and PBMCs (correlation coefficients, 0. 41 - 0. 86, all P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS:: Measuring TFV/FTC exposure in small hair samples in African PrEP trials was feasible and acceptable. <b>Hair</b> <b>levels</b> correlated strongly with PBMC, plasma concentrations, and MEMS-caps openings. As in other PrEP trials, self-report was the weakest measure of exposure. Further study of <b>hair</b> TFV/FTC <b>levels</b> in PrEP trials and demonstration projects to assess adherence/exposure is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the exposure to lead from various sources by investigation of mineral composition of human scalp hair. The research was carried out on hair sampled from 267 young adults living in Wrocław (southwest Poland). The effect of the place of residence, diet, and lifestyle on lead content in hair was examined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Lead was determined at the wavelength 220. 353 nm. These outcomes were reached by linking the results of lead <b>level</b> in <b>hair</b> with the results of questionnaire survey. The mean lead <b>level</b> in <b>hair</b> of the whole examined population was 2. 01 ± 2. 10 mg kg− 1. Lead can enter the human body mainly by inhalation and gastrointestinal absorption. It was found that consuming cheese, fish, and lettuce caused increased level of lead in hair. On the other hand, drinking of milk, tea, coffee, or lemon resulted in decreased content of lead in hair. Additional source of exposure to lead could be cigarette smoking, distance to the traffic road, painting the walls, amalgam filling. Based on the results, it can be concluded that exposure to lead can occur mainly from eating habits and environmental exposure...|$|R

He taught martial arts to Papal pontifical college Pune many years. The six-foot 3-inch actor also known as Bob Antony in Hindi films made his debut by playing a {{negative}} role in renowned late director Bharathan’s Malayalam film Chilambu. His monopoly in quick punches, fast kicks and fluid movements in action scenes has merited him roles.
