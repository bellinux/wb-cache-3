5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a <b>layout</b> <b>artist.</b> Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E

The layout process {{is the same as the}} blocking out of shots by a cinematographer on a live-action film. It is here that the background <b>layout</b> <b>artists</b> determine the camera angles, camera paths, lighting, and shading of the scene. Character <b>layout</b> <b>artists</b> will determine the major poses for the characters in the scene and will make a drawing to indicate each pose.

However, in subsequent interviews, both Faust and Jayson Thiessen mentioned that the geography and continuity of the show are loosely defined and may change as necessary, and a <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> stated on December 10, 2011 that the production team had no official map of Equestria at their disposal.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of doing}} an {{animated}} film about Sherlock Holmes with animals was first discussed about during {{the production of}} The Rescuers. Veteran <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children's book series Basil of Baker Street by Eve Titus, but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to The Rescuers. In 1982, Ron Clements proposed adapting the children's book series into an animated feature and, along with story artist Pete Young, it was pitched to Disney President and CEO Ron Miller who approved the project. Earlier in his career, Clements created a fifteen-minute Sherlock Holmes animated short recorded on Super 8 film. Because the animators were displeased with the direction The Black Cauldron was heading, Basil of Baker Street was approved as an alternative project.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} finale was to {{take place}} on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of the Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben. Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour. Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Dave Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben, with each gear produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer that was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added.|$|E

Meanwhile, her husband, McGill, worked as a <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> for Lever Brothers Agency, while continuing to paint in his spare time. While some critics have proffered this stint in England as evidence of the semi-autobiographical nature of Tirra Lirra by the River, Anderson rejected such claims, asserting that, while all of her characters had something of her in them, none were entirely autobiographical.|$|E
500|$|Executively {{produced}} {{and directed by}} William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's Hanna-Barbera Productions, Charles A. Nichols served as the series' main producer.

The show's official theme song was written by Hoyt Curtin, who also served as the series' music composer. Other than the main cast, frequent Hanna-Barbera voice actors Janet Waldo, Joan Gerber, Lennie Weinrib, Hal Smith and Vic Perrin played several minor characters for the show. A group of five writers wrote for Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!, including Joel Kane, Heywood Kling, Howard Morgenstern, Joe Ruby, and Ken Spears. Despite Stephenson ultimately {{playing the role of}} Mr. Peevly, Barbera had intended for Joe Flynn to play the part since the character was based on Flynn's Captain Binghampton from McHale's Navy; however, when Flynn came into audition for the part, Barbera was unimpressed and cast Stephenson for the part instead. Barbera claimed [...] "that Joe Flynn didn't sound enough like Joe Flynn." ...|$|E
500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E

500|$|Animation on The Sorcerer's Apprentice {{began on}} January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the {{director}} of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem Der Zauberlehrling, and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. <b>Layout</b> <b>artist</b> Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as [...] "brilliantly colored thumbnails" [...] from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to his eyes {{for the first time to}} achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water.|$|E
500|$|By 1982, fantasy {{films such}} as The Beastmaster and Conan the Barbarian had proven {{successful}} at the box office, and Bakshi {{wanted to work with}} his long-time friend, the fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Fire and Ice was financed by some of American Pops investors for $1.2 million, while 20th Century Fox agreed to distribute. Fire and Ice was the most action-oriented story Bakshi had directed, so he again used rotoscoping; the realism of the design and rotoscoped animation replicated Frazetta's artwork. Bakshi and Frazetta were heavily involved in the production of the live-action sequences, from casting sessions to the final shoot. The film's crew included background artists James Gurney and Thomas Kinkade, <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> Peter Chung, and established Bakshi Productions artists Sparey, Steve Gordon, Bell and Banks. Chung greatly admired Bakshi's and Frazetta's work, and animated his sequences while working for The Walt Disney Company. The film was given a limited release, and was financially unsuccessful. Andrew Leal wrote, [...] "The plot is standard [...] recalling {{nothing so much as a}} more graphic episode of Filmation's He-Man series. [...] Fire and Ice essentially stands as a footnote to the spate of barbarian films that followed in the wake of Arnold Schwarzenegger's appearance as Conan." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} at the seminar, a {{character}} closely resembling the mascot of Hasbro's Monopoly can be seen sitting next to Mr. Burns. Because the design is slightly different from the real-life mascot, the Simpsons staff did not have to pay Hasbro for using their character in the episode. The design of Homer in a Jamaican attire was very popular among the staff, and Mike Scully, the showrunner for the episode, called the design [...] "great". A scene in the episode shows Homer buying a square watermelon, which turns out to be round and slips out of his hands. In the background, cars are driving {{on the left side of}} the street. Originally, the animators had drawn the cars driving on the right side. However, Tomi Yamaguchi, a Simpsons <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> at the time, pointed out that cars in fact drive on the left side of the street in Japan. Because of this, the animators had to redraw the whole scene, and Yamaguchi received a technical advisor credit for the episode. The speech that Homer gives to the audience in The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show was originally much longer, and would partially involve kitchenettes from Broyhill. The design of the male Canadian in the game show was based on Canadian Simpsons director Neil Affleck.|$|E

5000|$|For the {{aesthetics}} {{in the background}} designs, the background <b>layout</b> <b>artists</b> sparingly use digital matte paintings to render out the naturalistic elements, including {{the trees and the}} baseball diamond, but they were retouched using Adobe Photoshop as background cards featured in the film.

An interface designer may hold the job title of web designer in a web development company.|$|R
500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, the Springfield {{residents}} try to set the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the [...] "people ball", was very difficult to animate, and it [...] "almost gave [...] a migraine" [...] determining how to implement it in the episode. While {{trying to figure out how}} to animate the [...] "people ball", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned <b>layout</b> <b>artist</b> Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the Simpsons animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the [...] "people ball", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the [...] "people ball" [...] by hand would have [...] "murdered" [...] the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the [...] "people ball" [...] was [...] "extremely interesting", [...] although it has never been used again in the series. The [...] "master drawing" [...] of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a couple of days to draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.|$|E

Craig Gardiner, the game's lead animator, oversaw the work of the animation team, to ensure the character animations were consistent and did not feel out of place, fitting within Cecil's vision of the game. Tim Robins was the graphic artist; he created text information seen on the screen, such as icons, menus and maps, was responsible for the visual style of interactive elements in the game and also served as an assistant <b>layout</b> <b>artist.</b> Backgrounds were traditionally hand-drawn and then colored in Photoshop, while Robins usually worked in Photoshop and Illustrator.|$|E
50|$|Rotation is now {{a common}} feature of modern video cards, and is widely used in tablet PCs (many tablet devices can sense the {{direction}} of gravity and automatically rotate the image), and by writers, <b>layout</b> <b>artists,</b> etc. Operating systems and drivers do not always support it; for example, Windows XP Service Pack 3 conflicts with monitor rotation on many graphics cards using ATI's Catalyst control software, Nvidia's proprietary drivers for Linux do not support screen rotation unless manual changes are made to its configuration.|$|R
50|$|While the {{animation}} is being done, the background artists will paint the sets {{over which the}} action of each animated sequence will take place.
