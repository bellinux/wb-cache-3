50|$|The bridge {{would be}} {{completely}} reconstructed in 1983. Since that time, only one significant incident has taken place on the water below. On May 18, 1996, a towboat moving 21 barges upstream bumped a bridge pier damaging the <b>lead</b> <b>barge</b> but not the bridge itself. The structure was further rehabilitated in 2005. On November 29, 2010, {{in an attempt to}} slow the deterioration of the aging structure, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) reduced the bridge's weight limit to 15 tons. At that time, roughly 3,500 vehicles traversed the span daily, of which nearly one quarter were tractor-trailers. The signs were largely ignored by truck drivers, accumulating nearly $70,000 of traffic fines in less than three months.|$|E

Rainey was passed by Doohan on the {{straight}}, but he re-took the <b>lead</b> by <b>barging</b> through {{the inside of the}} hairpin. Doohan passed on the straight again: the Yamaha was never beaten on straight-line speed. The trio became a quartet as Schwantz caught up, having set the fastest lap of the race.|$|R

Pierce's {{exclusion}} <b>leads</b> him to <b>barge</b> into the game, and torment everyone. A later episode called Advanced Advanced Dungeons & Dragons included a game of D&D which is played in order to reunite Buzz Hickey with his son.|$|R
5000|$|The {{procession}} of boats, which was 7.5 mi long, was formed up in sections, each {{led by a}} [...] "Herald Music Barge" [...] carrying ensembles playing music of different genres. The procession took approximately 90 minutes to pass any given point on the river, while it was recorded as comprising 670 vessels of various types, both historic and modern. Participating vessels came mainly from the UK with some Commonwealth, and a few non-Commonwealth participants. They ranged from rowing boats to sail and steam-powered vessels with historic vessels including many of the surviving Dunkirk little ships, a MƒÅori waka (war canoe) which {{was present at the}} signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 and the tall ship Amazon which was present at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Royal Fleet Review. Also taking part was the gig St Michael's Mount State Barge which was rowed rather than sailed down the river. Built around 1740, it {{is believed to be the}} oldest operational boat in the world and had ferried Queen Victoria in 1846.The start of the pageant was signalled by a whistle from steam locomotive 6201 Princess Elizabeth on Battersea Railway Bridge. The Royal Family watched the beginning of the parade from the moored royal <b>barge.</b> <b>Leading</b> the pageant was a floating belfry fitted with eight bells, newly cast by Whitechapel Bell Foundry for the Church of St James, Garlickhythe. Named after the eight senior members of the Royal Family and granted the title [...] "The Royal Jubilee Bells", their sound was answered by churches along the route and around the UK.|$|R
