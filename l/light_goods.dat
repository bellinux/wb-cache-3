25|$|In 1834 a {{clock and}} a large bell were placed at the {{entrance}} to the pier. The bell was rung just before each steamer's departure time in order to prevent delays. That year there were ferries from Trinity to Stirling, Alloa, Charlestown, Aberdour, Dysart, Leven, and Largo. In 1835 a journey to Dundee cost 5 shillings, or 3/- for steerage. The Rothesay left the Chain Pier at 6:30 am and returned from Dundee at 2 pm each day during the summer. Other destinations by 1842 included Crombie Point, Bo'ness and Limekilns. The Stirling Castle made a pleasure trip to the Bass Rock and the Isle of May from the pier in 1832. In 1836 the steam packet from the Chain Pier to Dundee was advertised as carrying mail, including parcels and <b>light</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Lundberg, the 60 {{families}} slowly wrested {{control of}} the state during the 19th century and, beginning with the presidency of Grover Cleveland, essentially held total control over national institutions.

2500|$|With the Federation of Australia in 1901, {{responsibility}} over coastal lighthouses was to {{be transferred}} to the commonwealth. [...] In 1911, the Lighthouses Act was passed, giving the Commonwealth the power to take responsibility over navigational aids as required. The actual transfer of responsibility took place with the formation of the Commonwealth Lighthouse Service (CLS) on 1 July 1915, during a period that was termed [...] "the Golden Age of Australian lighthouses", from 1913 to the early 1920s. The CLS took over a group of 104 manned and 18 unmanned lighthouses. Lighting the northern Inside Passage, the shipping route inside the Great Barrier Reef, was one of the urgent tasks taken by the CLS. At the time, only four lights were present between the Torres Strait and Cooktown, namely Grassy Hill Light, Pipon Island <b>Light,</b> <b>Goods</b> Island Light and Booby Island Light. [...] The CLS tackled this task with the installation of twenty new fully automatic unattended lights, a decision motivated by the shortage of manpower, materials and funding caused by World War I.|$|E

I do not know what they would do without it here. I only open the store on the first Monday of each month, and they then lay in what stores they require, so it gives me very little trouble. I generally take produce in return. My bills run on until they get up to the value of something a customer wants to sell--a horse, or two or three dozen sheep.

6000|$|Let me ask the British {{reader who}} is {{disposed}} to sneer at the League of Nations {{and say he}} is very well content with the empire, thank you, to get his atlas and consider one or two propositions. And, first, let him think of aviation. I can assure him, because upon this matter I have some special knowledge, that long-distance air travel for men, for letters and <b>light</b> <b>goods</b> and for bombs, is continually becoming more practicable. But the air routes that air transport will follow must go over {{a certain amount of}} land, for this reason that every few hundred miles at the longest the machine must come down for petrol. A flying machine with a safe non-stop range of 1500 miles {{is still a long way}} off. It may indeed be permanently impracticable because there seems to be an upward limit to the size of an aeroplane engine. And now will the reader take the map of the world and study the air routes from London to the rest of the empire? He will find them perplexing--if he wants them to be [...] "All-Red." [...] Happily this is not a British difficulty only. Will he next study the air routes from Paris to the rest of the French possessions? And, finally, will he study the air routes out of Germany to anywhere? The Germans are as badly off as any people. But we are all badly off. So far as world air transit goes any country can, if it chooses, choke any adjacent country. Directly any trade difficulty breaks out, any country can begin a vexatious campaign against its neighbour's air traffic. It can oblige it to alight at the frontier, to follow prescribed routes, to land at specified places on those routes and undergo examinations that will waste precious hours. But so far as I can see, no European statesman, German or Allied, have begun to give their attention to this amazing difficulty. Without a great pooling of air control, either a world-wide pooling or a pooling at least of the Atlantic-Mediterranean Allies in one Air League, the splendid peace possibilities of air transport--and they are indeed splendid--must remain very largely a forbidden possibility to mankind.|$|E
