5|$|Pintails in North America at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> {{been badly}} {{affected}} by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling {{from more than}} 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{principal}} councils of the sovereign. The other three are the courts of law, the Commune Concilium (Common Council, or Parliament) and the Magnum Concilium (Great Council, or the assembly of all the Peers of the Realm). All are still in existence, or at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> never been formally abolished, but the Magnum Concilium has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct even then.|$|E

Hugh Sebag-Montefiore concludes that substantial breaks into German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers by the British would have occurred only after November 1941 at the earliest, after an Enigma machine and key lists had been captured, and similarly into Naval Enigma only after late 1942.|$|E

25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{are known}} for being {{gigantic}} Ichthyosaurs. According to the paleontologist Michael Maisch, species of Temnodontosaurus were large, exceeding 12 meters (39ft) in length. There {{is a possibility that}} they reached a similar size to another giant Ichthyosaur, Shonisaurus popularis, which was previously considered the largest ichthyosaur. There seems to be a general consensus between paleontologists that they could at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> reached 9m.|$|E
25|$|Now as for {{the tribe}} of the Suebi, it is the largest, for it extends from the Rhenus to the Albis; {{and a part of}} them even dwell {{on the far side of}} the Albis, as, for instance, the Hermondori and the Langobardi; and at the present time these latter, at <b>least,</b> <b>have,</b> to the last man, been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river.|$|E

25|$|He was {{ambivalent}} about requiring written opinions of arbitrators. While generally opposing {{them on the}} grounds that they would slow the process down, since the losing party would in many instances simply use it as the starting point for an appeal, he allowed that arbitrators should at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> to put it in writing if they were making their decision on one aspect of the case. The SEC ultimately agreed and declined to order written opinions of arbitrators.|$|E
25|$|In most concerts, {{the main}} item will at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> a section {{at the end}} of the item, for the {{percussion}} to perform solo (called the tani avartanam). The percussion artists perform complex patterns of rhythm and display their skill. If multiple percussion instruments are employed, they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again. Some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a ragam thanam pallavi mid-concert, if they do not use it as the main item.|$|E

Secondly, he held that even though the ordinance discriminates against New Jerseyans who are not Camden residents just as much as it discriminates against out-of-state citizens, New Jersey citizens at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> the chance to remedy the problem through the political process (the state legislature). Out-of-state residents have no such option.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scientists}} {{argue that}} humans dream {{for the same}} reason other amniotes do. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> no negative impact on fitness. In 2000 Antti Revonsuo, a professor at the University of Turku in Finland, claimed that centuries ago dreams would prepare humans for recognizing and avoiding danger by presenting a simulation of threatening events. The theory has therefore been called the threat-simulation theory. According to Tsoukalas (2012) dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by encounters with predators, a fact that is still evident in the control mechanisms of REM sleep (see below).|$|E
25|$|Each week, NBC {{releases}} a Heroes webcomic. The comics give additional character background and plot information not {{shown in the}} television episodes. The graphic novels continued {{on a weekly basis}} during the show's 2007 summer hiatus. Wildstorm, a subsidiary of DC Comics, released them in published form on November 7, 2007. The first collected volume included novels 1–34, and featured two different covers by Alex Ross and Jim Lee as well as an introduction by Masi Oka and artwork by Tim Sale. The second volume included 35–80. It has an advertisement for a third volume, that would at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> 81–103, and more, and it was scheduled for fall 2009. For unknown reasons, it has missed this deadline and has not yet been released.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century {{what was}} {{recognised}} as the Great Schism {{took place between}} Rome and Constantinople, which led to separation between the Church of the West, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Byzantine Churches, now the Orthodox. There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and {{the authority of the}} Roman Pope involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding Papal supremacy, the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope's centralization of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to Papacy approvals. It used to be that the Emperor would at <b>least</b> <b>have</b> say when a new Pope would be elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern iconoclasm and the Photian schism.|$|E
