5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
25|$|India {{made a bad}} start, {{falling to}} 3/73. The middle order scored fluently, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls, 7 fours) top scoring. Before Azharuddin was removed lbw by Eddie Hemmings, India were at 5/204, needing 5 runs an over from the last 10 overs, with 5 wickets in hand, and it looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a very close game. However, the middle and tailend order for India collapsed, as India lost 5/15. India were {{eventually}} bowled all out for 219 (all out, 45.3 overs), giving England both a berth in the final and a measure of revenge for the loss they suffered to India in the semifinal of the World Cup four years earlier in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} looking <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{scoreless}} at half-time {{until just before}} the break, centre Lee Child scored to put Ireland ahead. After the break Scotland hit back, Sean Cusack scoring Scotland's first ever try. Gavin Manclark then scored to propel Scotland into the lead. This {{did not last long}} though, as Leo Casey scored for Ireland in the 55th minute. Ireland then scored again, with Seamus McCallion going over. Four minutes later in the 69th minute, Scotland quickly scored two tries with Manclark and Shelford sealing the eight points. However, this was not enough as Ketteridge had only kicked three conversions compared to Ireland's Ian Devery who had kicked five. The match finished with Ireland winning 26–22, but Thompson for Scotland did win Man of the Match.|$|E

500|$|Brad Silberling {{signed on}} to direct in February 2003. He was not {{familiar}} with the series when he was first approached.

Handler, who wrote eight drafts of the script for Sonnenfeld, was replaced by Robert Gordon in May 2003. Handler approved of the changes that were made to his original screenplay.

500|$|The {{layout of}} the [...] long {{anti-clockwise}} track was revealed on 17 October. Nelson Piquet Jr. felt {{it would be a}} fast circuit because it was purpose-built for motor racing and other series had visited the track before. He described it as seeming <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> slightly wider and easier along with relying less on driver skill and making competitive racing closer. Heidfeld stated that the track layout would mean the drivers would be challenged on electrical energy management and there would a high chance of a full course yellow flag being shown or a safety car being deployed because of the large amount of barriers lining the circuit. José María López, who raced on the track in the WTCC, said it would be [...] "tricky" [...] having been used to touring cars which require more space and it would feel wider with Formula E vehicles and there would be plenty of space for overtaking manoeuvres.|$|E

500|$|Michelson and Morley (1887) {{and other}} early experimentalists using {{interferometric}} techniques {{in an attempt}} to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the <b>like,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easy for an observer to [...] "get lost" [...] when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the [...] "2pi ambiguity".|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{feelings}} {{when she got}} the part, Bell expressed, [...] "Since I was 4 years old, I dreamed {{of being in a}} Disney animated film," [...] she said. [...] "It was the first goal I ever set for myself. It seemed <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a very unrealistic one." [...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-Semitism, as the Dreyfus Affair {{had shown}} {{at the end of}} the 19th century, was {{widespread}} in France, especially among anti-republican sympathizers. Long before the rise of the Nazis, anti-Semtism was so pronounced in France, that according to intellectual historian George Mosse, France seemed <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the country where racism might direct its political future. Before the onset of World War II, there were roughly 350,000 Jews residing in France with only 150,000 being native-born. Approximately 50,000 were refugees fleeing Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, while another 25,000 came to France from Belgium and Holland; the remaining Jews were arrivals to France in the 1920s and 30s from Eastern Europe.|$|E

I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these words came out. I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, but {{how do you feel about}} this one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E

True, the water wears the rock away; but could she be satisfied with that? She could master him, she knew; even if things were so, she could win him to herself, she had read it in his eyes that afternoon; but could she, who had promised to her dead mother to cherish and protect her sister, whom till this day she had loved better than anything in the world, and whom she still loved more dearly than her life--could she, if it should happen to be thus, rob that sister of her lover?
