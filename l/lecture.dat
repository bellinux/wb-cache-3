5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public <b>lecture</b> on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel <b>lecture</b> as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the <b>lecture</b> within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his <b>lecture</b> in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY This guide {{provides}} an overview of research on <b>lecturing,</b> a model of the processes of <b>lecturing</b> and suggestions for improving <b>lecturing,</b> learning from <b>lectures</b> and ways of evaluating <b>lectures.</b> Whilst primarily directed at teachers in the healthcare professions, it is equally applicable to all teachers in higher education. <b>Lectures</b> are the most ubiquitous method of teaching so they {{are an important part of}} a teacher’s repertoire. <b>Lectures</b> are at least as effective as other methods of teaching at imparting information and explaining. Intention, transmission and output are the basis of a model of <b>lecturing.</b> The key skills of preparing <b>lectures,</b> explaining and varying student activities may be derived from the model. Preparation is based on purposes, content, various structures of <b>lectures</b> and the prepa-ration of audiovisual aids. The essential ingredients of explaining are clarity, interest and persuasion. By varyin...|$|R
