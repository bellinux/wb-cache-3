5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plane, {{the position of the}} particle can be described by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E

5|$|All {{three of}} the stelae were {{discovered}} by Teoberto Maler in 1901 {{near one of the}} site's main temple, the O-13 pyramid. Stela 13 was possibly erected on a terrace reached by the pyramid's main stairway, and Stela 18 <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row on the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway. Stela 23, on the other hand, was erected at the very base of the pyramid. This pyramid was most likely the burial place for Itzam K'an Ahk II, and—seeing as how Ha' K'in Xook, Yo'nal Ahk III, and K'inich Yat Ahk II all revered the site as a dynastic shrine—it is further evidence to back the argument that Ha' K'in Xook was the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E

5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E

It {{is based on}} the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of flats and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).|$|E

Oklahoma <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{transition zone}} between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern {{portions of the}} state. Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E

5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected {{enormous}} amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) is {{a plot of}} {{luminosity}} {{versus a}} color index {{for a set of}} stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto {{with any degree of}} accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
