After storage at 26 C, bacterial counts were obtained from the exterior shell surfaces (rinse), air cell, egg contents, and shell structure. SE and PF survived at different rates on the shell surface with as much as a 1 log difference during a given collection period. Egg content counts tended to be higher than egg-shell counts in PF, whereas the opposite was true for SE...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Four layer genetic stocks {{consisting}} of 3 Ottawa control strains (5, 7, and 10) and a commercial <b>laying</b> <b>stock</b> (CCS) were utilized to evaluate potential changes in behavioral profiles {{due to the}} effects of genetic selection through 2 production cycles. The Ottawa strains were started as random bred strains from the crosses of several popular commercial layers in 1950, 1959, and 1972, and the commercial strain used herein was from calendar year 1993, and its ancestors were involved in the forma-tion of all of the random bred strains. The behavior study utilized 2 replicates from each strain that contained 4 cages, 6 hens/cage, for a total of 192 hens. Behavioral observations were recorded on 2 consecutive days begin-ning at 22 wk of age and every 28 d thereafter during the first production cycle, themolt period, and the secon...|$|R

40|$|THE {{chicken and}} turkey have been sub-jected {{to changes in}} {{breeding}} and methods of production. Intense inbreeding and development of early-feathering strains, coupled with highly efficient rations and special brooding and housing methods, have shortened the usual growing period of broil-ers and <b>laying</b> <b>stock.</b> This accelerated growth may change requirements of nutri-ents and alter the pattern of physiological response to disease and stress-producing en-vironmental conditions. Since 1950, {{a high incidence of}} hemor-rhagic anemia (hemorrhagic syndrome), which is characterized by anemia and vari-ous degrees of hemorrhage in any or all organs of the body, has occurred in fast-growing broilers. Acute, sub-acute and chronic forms of the disease have been re-ported with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Blood pigments in the tissues of birds that survive greatly diminish the market value of the carcass. This disease has been associated with possible stressors such as overcrowding, chilling, lack of feeder space, poor ventilation, chronic re-spiratory disease and drug-fortified rations. It has been postulated that each of the stressors might be mild alone, but the ef-fects of several stressors may not be com-pensated by the adaptive mechanisms of 1 Published with the approval of the Director o...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study effect of feed restriction during growing period on the subsequent performance of commercial White Leghorn (Babcock) layers. Two hundred and seventy chicks (6 -weeks-old) were randomly divided into three equal groups i. e., A, B and C. The birds in group A were given feed ad libitum (full feeding -FF) while those in groups Sand C maintained on the restricted feeding (RF) were given 10 and 20 percent less feed than the recommended daily feed allowance, respectively from 7 to 9 and 13 to 15 weeks and 20 and 30 percent lesser feed respectively, of the daily allowance from 10 tol 2 weeks of age. From 6 weeks onward til 158 weeks of age all the groups were fed ad libitum. The results showed reduction (p< 0. 01) in feed intake and body weight (p< 0. 05) of pullets and delay in age of sexual maturity (p< 0. 01) due to feed restriction. During the laying phase a non-significant effect of the feed restriction programme on egg production, feed consumption, feed conversion efficiency (feed/dozen eggs), mortality rate and cost of feed/dozen eggs was noted. An overall benefit of Rs. 13. 54 and 21. 54 on RF-I (group-B) and RF-II (group-C), respectively, in comparison to that of FF during the growing period reflect on better economics of feed restriction programme in <b>laying</b> <b>stock</b> under given environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{fast and}} frugal {{heuristics}} framework assumes that people rely on an adaptive toolbox of simple decision strategies—called heuristics—to make inferences, choices, estimations, and other decisions. Each of these heuristics is tuned to regularities {{in the structure}} of the task environment and each is capable of exploiting the ways in which basic cognitive capacities work. In doing so, heuristics enable adaptive behavior. In this article, we give an overview of the framework and formulate five principles that should guide the study of people’s adaptive toolbox. We emphasize that models of heuristics should be (i) precisely defined; (ii) tested comparatively; (iii) studied in line with theories of strategy selection; (iv) evaluated by how well they predict new data; and (vi) tested in the real world in addition to the laboratory. Key words: fast and frugal heuristics; experimental design; model testing As we write this article, international financial markets are in turmoil. Large banks are going bankrupt almost daily. It is a difficult situation for financial decision makers — regardless of whether they are lay investors trying to make small-scale profits here and there or professionals employed by the finance industry. To safeguard their investments, these decision makers need to be able to foresee uncertain future economic developments, such as which investments are likely to be the safest and which companies are likely to crash next. In times of rapid waves of potentially devastating financial crashes, these informed bets must often be made quickly, with little time for extensive information search or computationally demanding calculations of likely future returns. <b>Lay</b> <b>stock</b> traders in particular have to trust the contents of their memories, relying on incomplete, imperfec...|$|R
