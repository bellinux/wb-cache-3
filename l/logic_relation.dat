40|$|In many domains, {{characterizations}} {{of a given}} attribute are imprecise, uncertain and incomplete in the available learning examples. The definitions of classes may be vague. Learning systems are frequently forced {{to deal with such}} uncertainty. Traditional learning systems are designed to work in the domains where imprecision and uncertainty in the data are absent. Those learning systems are limited because of their impossibility to cope with uncertainty [...] a typical feature of real-world data. In this thesis, we developed a fuzzy learning system which combines inductive learning with a fuzzy approach to solve problems arising in learning tasks in the domains affected by uncertainty and vagueness. Based on Fuzzy Logic, rather than pure First Order Logic used in FOIL, this system extends FOIL with learning fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>relation</b> from both imprecise examples and background knowledge represented by Fuzzy Prolog. The classification into the positive and negative examples is allowed to be a degree (of positiveness or negativeness) between 0 and 1. The values of a given attribute in examples need not to be the same type. Symbolic and continuous data can exist in the same attribute, allowing for fuzzy unification (inexact matching). An inductive learning problem is formulated as to find a fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>relation</b> with a degree of truth, in which a fuzzy gain calculation method is used to guide heuristic search. The Fuzzy FOIL's ability of learning the required fuzzy logic relations and dealing with vague data enhances FOIL's usefulness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to complexity reduction of Mamdani-type Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) based on removing logical redundancies. We first generate an FRBS from data by applying a simplified version of the well-known Wang and Mendel method. Then, we represent the FRBS as a multi-valued <b>logic</b> <b>relation.</b> Finally, we apply MVSIS, a tool for circuit minimization and simulation, to minimize the relation and consequently to reduce complexity of the associated FRBS. Unlike similar previous approaches proposed in the literature, the use of MVSIS let us deal with nondeterminism, that is, let us manage rules with the same antecedent but different consequents. To allow nondeterminism guarantees to achieve a higher (or at least not worse) complexity reduction than the one achievable from removing nondeterminism {{as soon as it}} appears. We apply our approach to six popular benchmarks. Results show a considerable complexity reduction associated only sporadically with consistent accuracy degradation. Moreover, quite surprisingly, the complexity reduction often comes together with an improvement in the classification accuracy.

It includes paralysis (muscle-relaxation), unconsciousness (depth of anaesthesia) and analgesia (pain relief). Depth of anaesthesia (DOA) is hard to define, and hence to measure accurately. Attention has turned to auditory evoked potentials (AEP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in search for a signal that reflects the subjective clinical signs that anaesthetists have used to assess DOA [1, 2, 3]. Since direct measurements are unavailable, the field of DOA is a very promising area for fuzzy logic. A fuzzy relational classifier (FRC) trained by fuzzy clustering and used to classify DOA is presented in this paper. The FRC uses a set of features extracted from the AEP by multiresolution wavelet analysis and cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate and systolic arterial pressure.

40|$|This study {{developed}} a new micro drill-grinding tool for precision micro-drilling of hard brittle materials, such as alumina ceramic and soda-lime glass, and analyzed the material removal mechanism of micro drill-grinding. A model of the micro drill-grinding force F z was built using a physical method based on the undeformed chip thickness h m. Experiments examining micro drill-grinding were conducted on a micro-machining desktop for micro drill-grinding. The failure modes and the lifespan of this new tool were investigated compared to the conventional micro-grinding method. The variation of the micro drill-grinding force was investigated, {{and the effects of}} rotation speed n g are discussed. The change law of F z was revealed based on experimental results, which also verified the scientific internal <b>logic</b> <b>relation</b> of the model that this study proposes. The brittle-ductile transition in the micro drill-grinding of hard brittle materials was investigated. A ductile regime propelling technology of a resin coating was proposed and successfully developed in this study. This paper demonstrated that this technology could effectively propel the ductile-regime of soda-lime glass in micro drill-grinding and reduce the fracture size. Experimental machining examples indicate that the average fracture size is reduced from 239. 58 μm to 15. 11 μm, and the ductile regime is propelled from 50 nm/rev to above 200 nm/rev.
