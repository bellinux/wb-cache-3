50|$|Outdoor cricket nets are the {{standard}} and {{most common form}} of practise nets. They take shape and form in many different guises, with some nets being homemade whilst others are professional manufactured and installed, and this is reflected throughout the world. Regardless of their design and construction, outdoor crickets all have the same purpose of allowing batting and bowling practise within an enclosed space where the ball is contained. The design and construction of outdoor cricket nets tends to be based around two factors; the frequency and age of those who will use it, and also the space which is available. In schools and cricket clubs where levels of use will be high the construction of the cricket cage will be tailored to suit these requirements. A further unfortunate consideration has to be made into the likelihood that the cricket nets will be subject to misuse or vandalism. Therefore, the frames of cricket cages are often constructed out of heavy duty galvanised steel with an overall diameter ranging from 34mm - 50mm, the steel tube is then joined by galvanised key-clamp brackets. This system requires ground sockets to be concreted into the ground, although these cannot be removed the actual frame of the cage can still be dismantled. There are variations in the design of outdoor nets such as a pulley and ratchet system where the net is mounted on a cable which spans posts located {{at either end of the}} practise net. Garden cricket nets are frequently DIY and quite often take the form of a professional design with locally sourced components. This occurs primarily due to cost implications, but also due to the fact cricket nets are fundamentally simple in design and purpose and thus greatly increase the feasibility of constructing a homemade cricket net. There are few rules of thumb to follow particularly with size. The width should be no less than 9 ft, with 12 ft being optimum. The height should be no less than 9 ft if the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> is longer than 24 ft, this is increased to 10 ft up to a length of 36 ft and nets with roof lengths beyond 36 ft should have a net height of 12 ft - this is to prevent balls ending up on the roof of the cricket net after being bowled. The length of the net is flexible, however the longer the net the more ball containment and the safer the surround training area is. There is a further type of outdoor cricket nets, this is a mobile cricket net. A steel framed cricket cage can be adapted with wheels to allow them to be become completely portable.|$|E

This fishery began in 1969 with a catch of 355 fish and, by 1975 had increased dramatically to 33, 607. However the catch declined to {{less than half the}} maximum and in 1979 was down to 15, 171. There are 76 drift net licences in the Bay which incorporates two fishery districts, Galway and Connemara. The vessels used vary from 5 metre currachs to 20 metre trawlers. The majority of the boats are half deckers of between 9 and 11 metres. The fishery starts in mid-May but the bulk of the catch is taken in June and July. The main component of the catch is grilse with an average weight of 3 kg. During the period fishing is carried on over 24 hours daily except for the weekly close season time. The fishery extends from west of a straight line from Spiddal Harbour to Blackhead, Co Clare in the east, and from Slyne Head to Hag's Head, Co.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general feasibility study on double rigged versus single rigged trawls. This study used model experimental nets {{tested in a}} circulating water tank. Three kinds of trawls were tested, i. e. the Mexican semi ballon double rigged shrimp trawl designed by Nichimo (hereafter called net A), the traditional two seam single rigged Malaysian shrimp trawl (net B) and the four seam trawl modified from the above Malaysian trawl (net C). The head rope <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> A is about half that of net B and net C. Primary objectives are to determine physical characteristics, working performance and to estimate the main engine output necessary to pull these nets. To provide a double rigged shrimp trawl in the Malaysian shrimp fisheries, results of experiments are summarised as follows: 1) At 2 knots, which is a normal towing speed of a Malaysian shrimp trawler, net mouth height of net A is 1. 2 meter, net B is 2 meter and net C is 1. 8 meter. In accordance to the behaviour of shrimp, these net mouth height are sufficient. 2) In order to ensure {{the security of the}} catch, the most efficient average mesh opening was determined to be five vertical cross-sections. The mesh opening is bigger at the square panel and becomes smaller towards the cod end. The opening is about 3 centimeter for 5. 7 centimeter mesh size. 3) The wing tip spread of net A is 11 meter, which is 80 % of its head rope length. Net B is 14 meter (55 %) and net C is 14. 4 meter (60 %). 4) The working performance of a shrimp trawl is determined by its sweeping area. The obtained experimental equations of the sweeping area of the three net are slimplified as follows: 2 net A: A's= 2. 18 Vnet B: A"s= 1. 57 Vnet C: A‴s= 1. 58 V 5) The estimation of suitable main engine output necessary to pull the net is calculated from the conversion of total gear drag force values to horse power values. Equations of the above power of the three nets are: 2 net A: EHP'= 12. 19 V^ net B: EHP"= 11. 01 V^ net C: EHP‴= 10. 89 V< 2. 61...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} on the {{economic}} performance indicators for coastal fisheries are {{needed in order to}} implement fisheries policy in Khanh Hoa as well as in Vietnam. The research project “Economic performance indicators for coastal fisheries - the case of pure-seining in Khanh Hoa” established to fulfill these demands. A questionnaire about technical characteristics and economic data is used for data collection through interviews with vessel owners. This paper presents preliminary findings for 100 purse seiners, representing 10 % of the total population, in Nha Trang and Cam Ranh (Khanh Hoa province) in the group of vessels with engine power of less than 90 HP. The following indicators are presented: gross revenue, gross value added, gross cash flow, net profit and crew share. The results show that the coastal purse seine fishery in Cam Ranh is more profitable than in Nha Trang for each engine power group. The owner of an average purse seiner of all groups of horse power in both locations of Nha Trang and Cam Ranh is not only capable paying for all expenses, but also has a reward for the operating year. The boat owner of an average vessel in the group of horse power of 75 -< 90 Hp has the highest values of annual gross cash flow and net profit following location. Thus, the annual average of crew shares for this group of horse power was quite high. It was almost 2. 0 times more than the average earnings of labor in the whole country. The boat owners of the engine power group of < 20 Hp and 20 -< 45 Hp have lowest values of annual vessel gross cash flow and net profit following location. Thus, the annual average of crew shares for those groups of horse power is quite low. They are almost 1. 2 times more than the average earnings of labor in the whole country. Regression analysis of gross revenue using technical characteristics as independent variables is performed, and the results are demonstrated. The technical factors that impact on the gross revenue are the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>net,</b> fishing experience of skipper and location. These are significant factors impacting on the gross revenue.

40|$|A priori wirelength {{estimation}} {{is concerned}} with predicting various wirelength characteristics before placement. In this work we propose a novel, accurate estimator <b>of</b> <b>net</b> <b>lengths.</b> We observe that in “good ” placements, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a <b>net</b> is very strongly correlated with the numbers <b>of</b> <b>nets</b> in the shortest paths connecting node pairs <b>of</b> the <b>net,</b> when each shortest path is computed under the restriction that the net itself does not exist.

Based on ISPLs, we characterize VLSI netlists with a single value and develop an intuitive, empirical link between our proposed value and the Rent parameter.

Average ICU <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay, <b>net</b> mortality rate and bed turnover rate were lower in semi closed model than open model management significantly (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Semi closed model improves patient care and lead to lower mortality rate and resources utilization too...|$|R
40|$|Hat of gray {{felt with}} gray beads and silver sequins. The {{cylindrical}} crown flares from lower edge to upper, {{and has a}} low domed, set in top. The surface of the hat is covered in curving, meandering lines of gray beads, enhanced by double-bands of silver sequins which form "zig-zag" motifs on sides, and around dome of crown. Front and sides of hat overlaid with short <b>length</b> <b>of</b> light gray <b>net</b> veil. Hat is unlined, with gray grosgrain ribbon inner hatband. No labels in hat...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the classic}} wire-length {{estimation}} problem is addressed {{and a new}} statistical wire-length estimation approach that captures the probability distribution function <b>of</b> <b>net</b> <b>lengths</b> after placement and before routing is proposed. These types of models are highly instrumental in formalizing a complete and consistent probabilistic approach to design automation and design closure where, along with optimizing the pertinent cost function, the associated prediction error is also considered. The wire-length prediction model was developed {{using a combination of}} parametric and nonparametric statistical techniques. The model predicts not only the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> using input parameters extracted from the floorplan of a design, but also probability distributions that a net with given characteristics after placement will have a particular length. The model is validated using the learn-and-test and resubstitution techniques. The model can be used for a variety of purposes, including the generation {{of a large number of}} statistically sound, and therefore realistic, instances <b>of</b> designs. The <b>net</b> models were applied to the probabilistic bufferinsertion problem and substantial improvement was obtained in net delay after routing (∼ 20 %) when compared to a traditional bounding box (BBOX) -based buffer-insertion strategy...|$|R
