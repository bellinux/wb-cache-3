25|$|The island's unique {{social and}} {{economic}} organisation has evolved over the years, but {{is based on the}} principles set out by William Glass in 1817, when he established a settlement based on equality. All Tristan families are farmers, owning their own stock and/or fishing. All land is communally owned. All households have plots of land at The Patches on which they grow potatoes. <b>Livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> are strictly controlled to conserve pasture and to prevent better-off families from accumulating wealth. Unless the community votes for a change in its law, no outsiders are allowed to buy land or settle on Tristan; theoretically the whole island would have to be put up for sale. All people– including children and pensioners– are involved in farming, while adults additionally have salaried jobs working either for the government, or, a small number in domestic service. Many of the men are involved in the fishing industry, going to sea in good weather. The nominal fishing season lasts 90 days; however, during the 2013 fishing season– 1 July to 30 September– there were only 10 days suitable for fishing.|$|E
2500|$|According to Exodus 12:37–38, the Israelites {{numbered}} [...] "about {{six hundred}} thousand men on foot, besides women and children", plus many non-Israelites and <b>livestock.</b> <b>Numbers</b> 1:46 gives {{a more precise}} total of 603,550 men aged 20 and up. It is difficult to reconcile the idea of 600,000 Israelite fighting men with the information that the Israelites were afraid of the Philistines and Egyptians. The 600,000, plus wives, children, the elderly, and the [...] "mixed multitude" [...] of non-Israelites would have numbered some 2 million people. Marching ten abreast, and without accounting for livestock, they would have formed a line 150 miles long. The entire Egyptian population in 1250 BCE is estimated to have been around 3 to 3.5 million, and no evidence {{has been found that}} Egypt ever suffered the demographic and economic catastrophe such a loss of population would represent, nor that the Sinai desert ever hosted (or could have hosted) these millions of people and their herds. Some have rationalised the numbers into smaller figures, for example reading the Hebrew as [...] "600 families" [...] rather than 600,000 men, but all such solutions have their own set of problems.|$|E

50|$|Although winters are {{generally}} cold and clear, and livestock can survive, under various weather conditions livestock {{are unable to}} graze and die in large numbers. A winter in which this occurs {{is known as a}} zud; causes include blizzards, drought, extreme cold, and freezing rain. Such losses of livestock, which are an inevitable and, in a sense, normal consequence of the climate, have made it difficult for planned increases in <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> to be achieved.|$|E

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey of 408 households explored {{the role of}} socio-economic and cultural factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.) varietal diversity management on-farm in two contrasting eco-sites in Nepal. Multiple regression outputs suggest that number of parcels of land, <b>livestock</b> <b>number,</b> number of rice ecosystems, agro-ecology (altitude), and use of chemical fertilizer have a significant positive influence on landrace diversity on-farm, while membership in farmers' groups linked to extension services has significant but negative influence on landrace diversity. Factors with significant positive influence on diversity of modern varieties on-farm were number of parcels of land and of rice ecosystems, access to irrigation, membership in farmers' groups, and use of insecticide. Within communities, resource-endowed households maintain significantly higher varietal diversity on-farm than resource-poor households and {{play a significant role}} in conserving landraces that are vulnerable to genetic erosion and those with socio-cultural and market-preferred traits. Resource-poor households also contribute to local diversity conservation but at lower richness and area coverage levels than resource-endowed households. Households where a female had assumed the role of head of household due to death or migrant work of her husband had less diversity due to lower labor availability. Landraces with socio-cultural and market-preferred traits are few in number but have potential to be conserved on-farm...|$|R
5000|$|Since 1996 and 2001 census {{showed that}} <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> have {{increased}} to record levels cattle: up by 4.4%, pigs by 26.4%, and sheep by 46%.

50|$|One {{important}} change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to turnips and clover {{in place of}} fallow. Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep rooted, allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow rooted crops. Clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> whose manure added further to soil fertility.|$|E

30|$|Until {{recently}} the nomads {{involved in the}} Nomadic settlement project {{did not have to}} meet any obligations concerning pastureland or <b>livestock</b> <b>number</b> reductiond. The financial support for their new houses is an additional governmental assistance. Therefore most of the nomadic households want to use this chance to get the money and build a house, even if this was not absolutely necessary. Officially, participation of nomads on governmental programs such as this is voluntary, nevertheless in some places such as Zeku or Hongyuan County the executive officials made clear to the nomads that a refusal to participate would lead to denial of any future governmental help. Therefore, the nomads usually accepted even those less advantageous conditions included in a resettlement or settlement contract, in order to avoid possible trouble with the local government.|$|R
30|$|Respondents {{mentioned}} that <b>livestock</b> <b>number</b> {{was the best}} indicator for evaluating rangeland condition in Afar region. The existing empirical evidence based on metrological data did not show any significant decline in precipitation {{for the last four}} decades between 1971 and 2011 as opposed to the perception of pastoralists where 80 % of them reported a decline in precipitation. A one unit increase in labor force suggested about 16.1 % decrease in the choice of livestock selling as coping strategy in Afar pastoral areas of North-East of Ethiopia. The non-intervened pastoral households had more preference (3.78 %) to practice herd splitting than those pastoral households in the intervened district. Similarly, the non-intervened pastoral households had 4.43 % more preference to use crop residue for livestock feeding than pastoral HHs in the intervened areas.|$|R
30|$|Communities’ {{perceptions}} {{showed that}} <b>livestock</b> <b>number</b> {{was the best}} indicator of rangeland condition in the study area. Afar pastoralists’ observations with regard to temperature and precipitation trends {{over the last four}} decades greatly corresponded with the existing metrological-based empirical evidence. However, pastoralists’ perception in terms of reduced precipitation was not confirmed by the meteorological-based data records for the short rainy season (SRS). Afar pastoralists’ experience showed that the short rainy season was the best indicator for the occurrence of droughts as compared to other seasons in Afar. Our results suggest that most coping strategies are labor force demanding, and the situation worsens during the long rainy season (LRS). We suggest that differences in intervention between the study areas should not be overlooked as a policy tool in tackling the impact of climate change.|$|R
50|$|Poaching {{for meat}} {{appears to be}} an {{increasing}} problem in Mongolia. For some parts of the local population, wild ass and other wildlife meat seems to provide a substitute or even a cheap alternative to meat from domestic animals. In 2005, a national survey based on questionnaires, suggested that as many as 4,500 wild asses, about 20% of the whole population, may be poached each year. Moreover, political changes in the early 1990s allowed urban populations to return to nomadic land use, resulting in a sharp increase in human and <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> in many rural areas.|$|E
50|$|From prerevolutionary times {{until well}} into the 1970s, animal {{husbandry}} was the mainstay of the Mongolian economy. In the traditional economy, livestock provided foodstuffs and clothing; after the 1921 revolution, livestock supplied foodstuffs and raw materials for industries and for export. Mongolia had 9.6 million head of livestock in 1918 and 13.8 million head in 1924; arad ownership was estimated to be 50 to 80 percent of all livestock, and monastic and aristocratic ownership to be 50 to 20 percent. Policies designed to force collectivization in the early 1930s met with arad resistance, including the slaughter of their own animals. Reversal of these policies led to a growth in <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers,</b> which peaked in 1941 at 27.5 million head. World War II brought new commitments to provide food and raw materials for the Soviet war effort. With the levy of taxes in kind, <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> fell to about 20 million in 1945, and they have hovered between 20 million and 24 million head since then. Collectivization and advances in veterinary science have failed to boost livestock production significantly since the late 1940s. In 1940 animal husbandry produced 99.6 percent of gross agricultural output. The share of animal husbandry in gross agricultural output declined after World War II, to 71.8 percent in 1960, 81.6 percent in 1970, 79.5 percent in 1980, and 70 percent in 1985. The rise in crop production since 1940 has accounted for animal husbandry's decline in gross agricultural output.|$|E
50|$|Roughly 79 {{per cent}} of Scotland’s total land area is under {{agricultural}} production.

Around 15 per cent of the total land area of Scotland is forested, most in public ownership controlled by the Forestry Commission. Total income from farming has been rising {{since the turn of}} the millennium. Aquaculture production is focused on the West and North of the country. Some farm businesses rely on sources of income other than from farming. Scottish agriculture employs around 1.5 per cent of the workforce and contributes to around 1 per cent of the Scottish economy.|$|E
30|$|Observations of {{respondents}} {{suggest that the}} processes of land use/cover changes are more manifested in terms of shifts in forest cover, shrinkage of grazing lands, and increase in crop fields. Respondents’ perceptions of deforestation, major shifts in grazing lands, and increased agricultural fields into mountain areas are also confirmed by the existing satellite image analyses. Respondents further believed that there are enormous ongoing changes {{with regard to the}} impact on forest and grassland resources. Generally, respondents stated that <b>livestock</b> <b>number</b> has exceeded the capacity of the land due to population growth and expansion of crop cultivation. Perceptions of reduced forest cover and available grazing lands are consistent with our results from the remotely sensed images. Our results indicate that although the forest cover initially showed a downward trend, there had been an improvement in forest cover of the study areas since 2000.|$|R

Based on the census from 1855, the number of persons living within the destroyed area was 808. Adding an assumed extra number due to later development, it was estimated in contemporary newspaper reports that about 1,000 persons lost their homes due to the fire. The <b>number</b> of <b>livestock</b> <b>numbered</b> to 38 horses and eight cows in 1855, and was presumed to be of the same order in 1858, although no specific report is available.

30|$|Afar pastoralists {{have long}} years of {{experience}} in terms of responding to the impacts of climate change through analysis and evaluation of the local situations with regard to issues central to their livelihood. However, their efforts were largely overlooked by inappropriate land use policies and development interventions. Pastoralists’ observations suggest that <b>livestock</b> <b>number</b> and plant productivity were the best indicators for rating rangeland condition. The findings of this study confirmed that pastoralists’ perceptions are well-matched with the existing meteorological analysis in terms of the increased trend of temperature during the two Afar rainy seasons. Pastoralists’ perceptions of downward trend in precipitation were not supported by the existing meteorological analysis. Generally, the short rainy season was the best indicator in terms of drought occurrence in the study districts with a clear indication of recurrent droughts in history (1972 / 73; 1984 / 85; 1991; 2000).|$|R

The immediate effects of forced collectivization were reduced grain output and almost halved <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers,</b> thus creating major famines throughout the USSR during 1932 and 1933.

30|$|This {{survey of}} {{pastoral}} livelihoods of Fulani herders is {{set against a}} backdrop of agricultural change and general insecurity. The survey showed that the majority of pastoral households in the study area are better off or in the middle wealth categories and only a few are poor in terms of livestock holdings. However, many households are poor in terms of land holdings. Income diversity is significant but as many as 30 % of households still rely on one source of cash revenue: livestock sales. Pastoralists are less vulnerable to livestock disease but increasingly vulnerable to the risks of conflict and poor access to natural resources. Cattle productivity parameters are more stable, but the overall productivity has decreased and reproductive rates were particularly low. The amount of wealth concentrated in <b>livestock,</b> <b>number</b> of land-poor households and those still reliant on one source of income suggest that there is still a degree of vulnerability to the risks of disease, drought/dry season and conflict in pastoral livelihoods in the area.|$|R

50|$|Animal {{husbandry}} is an underdeveloped sector. Cattle, goats, {{sheep and}} pigs are reared in extensive grass-based (ruminants) or back-yard scavenger systems. There is, also a small fast-growing modern poultry industry. In 2009, livestock accounted for 1.2 million of head of cattle, 4.5 million sheep and goats, 1.3 million pigs, and 18 million poultry. Beef production {{was estimated at}} 22,000 tons; pig meat, 91,000 tons; poultry meat, 22,000 tons; cows' milk, 75,000 tons; and hen eggs, 14 million. The high prevalence of disease is the main constraints undermining an increase in <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers.</b> For example, Newcastle disease is a major ubiquitous problem for poultry, in the northern provinces tsetse flies affect cattle, and African swine fever affects pigs. The southern region {{is the heart of}} livestock activities because animals there are less prone to diseases.|$|E
50|$|Wheat and cereal {{production}} is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. National wheat production in 2010 was 4,532 MT. The overall agricultural production dramatically declined following {{four years of}} drought {{as well as the}} sustained fighting and instability in rural areas. Soviet efforts to disrupt production in resistance-dominated areas also contributed to this decline. Furthermore, since 2002 more than 4 million expats returned to Afghanistan. Many of these former refugees are now involved in the farming industry. Some studies indicate that agricultural production and <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> may only be sufficient to feed about half of the country's population. Shortages are exacerbated by the country's limited transportation network, which is currently being rebuilt. A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that Afghanistan was nearing self-sufficiency in grain production.|$|E
