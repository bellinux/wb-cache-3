40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of bank-specific and business cycle factors in explaining the development of credit standards and <b>loan</b> <b>volumes</b> of the larger Danish banks during the recent financial crisis. The analysis {{is based on a}} unique panel data set combining the individual answers from the Danish Bank Lending Survey with bank characteristics such as <b>loan</b> <b>volumes</b> and prices. We find that business cycle variables and the financial soundness of the individual bank are important factors in explaining its credit standards. We also find that credit standards and credit demand play complementary roles for loan developments at the individual bank level. Throughout most of the study period, shocks to credit demand are significantly related to growth in lending. Changes in credit standards have mainly played a role after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers in early 2009, and during the peak of the sovereign debt crisis in late 2011 and early 2012...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} loan supply, as well as aggregate demand,aggregate supply and monetary policy shocks between 1998 and 2014 in Macedonia using a structural vector autoregression model with sign restrictions and Bayesian estimation. The main results indicate that loan supply shocks have no significant effect on <b>loan</b> <b>volumes</b> and lending rates, or on economic activity and prices. The effects of monetary policy on lending activity are fairly limited, although {{there is some evidence}} that it affects lending rates more than <b>loan</b> <b>volumes.</b> Monetary policy shocks have strong effects on inflation, while the central bank reacts strongly to adverse shocks hitting the economy. Baseline results are confirmed by several robustness checks. According to historical decomposition, the lending activity was supporting economic growth before and during the crisis, but its contribution became negative during the recovery and it was a drag on growth until the end of the period. Pre-crisis GDP growth is mostly explained by supportive monetary policy. However, the restrictive monetary policy during the crisis contributed to the fall of GDP, before becoming supportive again during the early stages of the recovery. Policy rates in recent years mostly reflect subdued lending activity and aggregate supply factors, which the central bank tries to counteract with a more accommodative policy...|$|R

40|$|Risk-sensitive capital {{requirements}} aim at enforcing appropriate minimum amounts of capital to absorb losses resulting from credit defaults and other risk sources. These requirements {{are considered to}} be important as they are supposed to strengthen financial stability. Nevertheless, practitioners and scholars have worried about negative side effects arising from capital-based regulation such as the reinforcement of cyclicality in lending. These concerns are based upon the notion that regulatory rules, which become tighter in downturns, restrict the bank's total lending. As a consequence, valuable projects are not financed during recessions, which may enhance the cyclical downturns. A situation commonly known as credit crunch arises. In this thesis, we address the question of if and how bank capital regulation may enhance cyclical patterns in lending. We analyze the sensitivity of the lending volume to changes of fundamental economic variables, called shocks, under a Value-at-Risk approach, under approaches with fixed risk weights, and under a laissez-faire economy. We endogenize the bank's risk-allocation and size decision. In particular, the deposit volume and the deposit interest rate are based on decisions made by the household and the bank. The deposit interest rate and the deposit volume reflect the bank's risk-taking and the regulatory constraints. Our results concerning pro-cyclicality lead {{to the conclusion that the}} effect of a given shock should be distinguished according to the type of the shock. Regulation effectively constrains bank lending after realized losses. Thus, equity shocks lead to pro-cyclical effects on lending. This observation is in line with common fears. The effects of expectation shocks, that is the effects of changes of distribution parameters or of borrowers' productivity, are dampened by regulation. More precisely, regulation effectively constrains bank lending when expectations turn more favorable. Thus, regulation may hamper economic recovery. In this respect, regulation is identified as non-pro-cyclical. We can observe counter-cyclical effects through regulation on the level of single <b>loan</b> <b>volumes.</b> These insights can be found regardless of the degree of risk sensitivity of the respective capital adequacy rule. Furthermore, a bank may grant higher <b>loan</b> <b>volumes</b> to less risky firms under risk-sensitive {{capital requirements}} than it would do under fixed requirements or under a laissez-faire regime. Including two periods shows that total <b>loan</b> <b>volumes</b> react to expectation shocks as in the one-period setting when the very period is considered at whose beginning the shock occurred. Likewise, the expected or average reaction of total <b>loan</b> <b>volumes</b> in the second period to the shifts thus implied in the bank's equity are in the same order of magnitude as in the one-period model. There is by no means an acceleration of sensitivities as such. Furthermore, this work emphasizes that enhanced risk-taking may occur under capital regulation without any interplay with other regulatory measures, such as deposit insurance schemes. Rather, the degree of risk-taking can be directly aligned with the sort of capital rules considered. A flat capital requirement always induces the bank to take more risk than under any other regime considered. The reduction in size is always compensated by taking more risk since this is the only possibility to raise the bank's expected final wealth. However, as capital requirements become risk-sensitive, our models yield mixed results. If loan repayments are normally distributed, the Value-at-Risk approach generally has no impact on risk-taking compared to the laissez-faire equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we relate a bank's choice between retail and {{wholesale}} liabilities to real economic uncertainty {{and the resulting}} volatility of bank <b>loan</b> <b>volumes.</b> We argue that since the volume of retail deposits is slow and costly to adjust to shocks in the volume of bank assets, banks facing more intense uncertainty and more volatile loan demand tend to employ more wholesale liabilities rather than retail deposits. We empirically confirm this argument using a unique dataset constructed from the weekly reports of the 122 largest U. S. commercial banks. The high frequency of the data allows us to employ dynamic identification schemes. Given the evidence {{presented in this paper}} we argue that regulatory measures targeting a cap on wholesale funding would limit funding uncertainty but will increase the exposure to asset-side shocks...|$|R

Lending to non-financial corporations is more sensitive to wholesale funding shocks than lending to households. Moreover, bank characteristics matter for monetary transmission: loan growth of large banks that are typically more dependent on wholesale funding and of banks with large exposure to government bonds shows relatively stronger responses to wholesale funding shocks...|$|R
