5|$|Going into spring {{training}} in 2014, Gyorko began focusing on improving his plate discipline, while maintaining his aggressiveness in swinging at hittable pitches. He also <b>lost</b> <b>weight</b> {{in an effort}} to improve his flexibility. Gyorko agreed to a $510,900 salary for the 2014 season. On April 14, Gyorko signed a five-year extension with the Padres worth $35 million, which was the third largest for a player with only one year of service in the majors. After committing four errors in his first 25 games, Gyorko increased his infield practice with Glenn Hoffman, the Padres' third base and infield coach.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and <b>lost</b> <b>weight,</b> affecting {{the way he looked}} in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of the}} highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E

5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have <b>lost</b> <b>weight</b> since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron {{to know he was}} unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle the day before and noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had <b>lost</b> <b>weight.</b> Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler {{carcasses}} <b>lost</b> greater <b>weight</b> when stored 4 {{days than}} when stored 1 or 3 days and <b>lost</b> greater <b>weight</b> after 6 and 8 days than after 4 days, particularly at high refrigerated storage temperatures. Carcasses stored at —. 5 C (31 F) <b>lost</b> significantly less <b>weight</b> than those stored above the freezing point of water. Whole carcasses <b>lost</b> significantly less <b>weight</b> than did cut-up carcasses. Carbon dioxide (C 02) -chilled carcasses <b>lost</b> less <b>weight</b> than did standard-immersion-chilled carcasses, because {{they picked up}} less water in the chilling process. The superficial freezing on C 02 -chilled carcasses delayed microbial growth and resulted in slightly longer shelf-life of C 02 -chilled carcasses than of those immersion chilled, particularly when comparisons were at higher refrigerated storage temperatures. Carcasses stored at 3. 9 C (39 F) had strong off odors by about 9 days of storage; at 1. 0 C (34 F) by about 14 days; and at- 2. 2 C (28 F) by about 35 days. Whole carcasses without giblets had a longer shelf-life than did cut-up carcasses, but whole carcasses stuffed with giblet packs had a shorter shelf-life than did cut-up carcasses...|$|R

25|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} not only reduces the gut's {{capacity}} for food but also dramatically lowers ghrelin levels compared to both lean controls {{and those that}} <b>lost</b> <b>weight</b> through dieting alone.

25|$|Over {{the next}} 40 years, the denarius slowly <b>lost</b> <b>weight.</b> The {{reason for this}} is unclear, but in the early days {{it may have been the}} ongoing {{pressure}} of the Second Punic War. Afterwards the Roman state had a debt equivalent to 25 years direct taxation on Roman citizens (~1 million denarii); this was not fully repaid until Cn. Manlius Vulso returned with the spoils of Asia after the Treaty of Apamea, (188 BC). The weight was officially changed from 72 to the pound (6 scruples) to 84 to the pound at that time; it remained relatively stable thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The city of Leningrad endured more {{suffering}} and hardships {{than any other}} city in the Soviet Union during the war, as it was under siege for 900 days, from September 1941 – January 1944. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege of Leningrad; civilians <b>lost</b> <b>weight,</b> grew weaker, and became more vulnerable to diseases. Citizens of Leningrad managed to survive {{through a number of}} methods with varying degrees of success. Since only 400,000 people were evacuated before the siege began, this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. More managed to escape the city; this was most successful when Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or “Road of Life”—to safety.|$|E
