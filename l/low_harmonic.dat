It can generate a constant 15Hz sine wave tone at 140dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely <b>low</b> <b>harmonic</b> distortion. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80Hz, and is down 3dB at 12Hz. It was built within an intermodal container [...] long and [...] square. The container doors swing open to reveal a tapped horn driven by 40 long-throw 15-inch (40cm) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000-watt amplifier.

This work presents an investigation of the diesel engine combustion-related {{fault detection}} capability of crankshaft torsional vibrations. Proposed methodology state the way of early fault detection in the operating six-cylinder diesel engine. The model of six cylinders DI Diesel engine is developed appropriately. As per the earlier work by the same author the torsional vibration amplitudes are used to superimpose the mass and gas torque. Further mass and gas torque analysis is used to detect fault in the operating engine. The DFT of the measured crankshaft’s speed, under steady-state operating conditions at constant load shows significant variation of the amplitude of the <b>lowest</b> major <b>harmonic</b> order. This is valid both for uniform operating and faulty conditions and the <b>lowest</b> <b>harmonic</b> orders may be used to correlate its amplitude to the gas pressure torque and mass torque for a given engine. The amplitudes of the <b>lowest</b> <b>harmonic</b> orders (0. 5, 1, and 1. 5) of the gas pressure torque and mass torque are used to map the fault.

50|$|Vereker {{believed}} that loss of information, often due to overload protection, was a damaging type of distortion that amplifiers were vulnerable to. Vereker attempted to reduce information loss at the design stage, by unconventionally disregarding test-bench measurements of harmonic distortion performance and output into a static resistive load. Naim says that to achieve amplifiers with <b>low</b> <b>harmonic</b> distortion, low noise, wide power-bandwidth, and constant dynamic output impedance, they {{pay attention to}} balancing dynamic impedance, open-loop bandwidth, slew rate, and propagation delay; the amplifiers {{are not subject to}} slew-rate limitation between 5 Hz and 50 kHz.|$|E
50|$|The SIPO (Serial Input, Parallel Output) block {{typically}} has a {{receive clock}} output, {{a set of}} data output lines and output data latches. The receive clock may have been recovered from the data by the serial clock recovery technique. However, SerDes which do not transmit a clock use reference clock to lock the PLL to the correct Tx frequency, avoiding <b>low</b> <b>harmonic</b> frequencies present in the data stream. The SIPO block then divides the incoming clock down to the parallel rate. Implementations typically have two registers connected as a double buffer. One register is used to clock in the serial stream, {{and the other is}} used to hold the data for the slower, parallel side.|$|E
5000|$|In the Mongolian Gobi farmer's {{daily life}} the Morin Khuur has another {{important}} use. When a mother camel {{gives birth to}} a calf sometimes it rejects her calf due to various natural stress situations and Mongolian camel farmers use Morin Khuur-based melodies alongside special <b>low</b> <b>harmonic</b> types of songs called [...] "Khoosloh" [...] to heal mother camels' stress and encourage it to re-adopt its calf. This re-adoption of farm animal practice is widely used in various nomadic civilizations worldwide but for Mongolian Gobi farmers' cases, only this instrument is used on camels. In other cases if a mother camel dies after giving birth to a calf, a farmer would use this Khoosloh technique alongside Morin Khuur melodies to encourage another mother camel who has its own calf to adopt the new one. The practice is well documented on documentary called Ingen Egshig directed by Badraa J. in 1986 and was also remade in 2003 by director Byambasuren Davaa with a different title of The Story of the Weeping Camel which nominated for 2005 Academy Award for Best Documentary.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{address the}} issue of <b>low</b> order <b>harmonics</b> in a modular {{multilevel}} converter (MMC). Using fundamental switching selective harmonic elimination (SHE), the control angles are calculated from nonlinear equations by Newton-Raphson method.

The concept is validated using a 9 -level detailed model of MMC in PSCAD/EMTDC®. The simulation result shows a good agreement with theoretical analysis and in comparison with conventional sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM), the proposed method, eliminates <b>low</b> order <b>harmonics,</b> leading to a <b>low</b> total <b>harmonic</b> distortion...|$|R

40|$|Methods which {{determine}} the number and disorder of lattice planes in a crystal from the Fourier cosine coefficients of the intensity profile of an X-ray reflection use only the <b>low</b> <b>harmonics</b> and require that the coefficients be normalized so that the zero harmonic is unity. Experimentally, the profiles can only be recorded over a smaller range of scattering angle than required by the theory, and {{it is necessary to}} subtract background, which is likely to be estimated with considerable error, before determining the coefficients. It is shown that with polymer fibres this causes serious errors in the normalization, and in the values of those <b>low</b> <b>harmonics</b> used in the size and disorder determination, and prevents reliable values being obtained. Methods which avoid normalization and use only high harmonics are needed. It is shown that disorder may be obtained in such a way, but not size, for which low-order normalized coefficients are essential. A method of extrapolation is described and tested which enables the accurate high harmonics to be used to improve the estimates of the low ones.
