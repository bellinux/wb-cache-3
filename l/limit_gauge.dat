Here we present evidence that large Nc equivalence extends to the baryon sector, under the same type of symmetry-realization assumptions as in the meson sector, by adapting the classic Witten analysis of large Nc baryons.

40|$|Consequences {{of large}} N volume {{independence}} are examined in conformal and confining gauge theories. In the large N <b>limit,</b> <b>gauge</b> theories compactified on ^d-k× (S^ 1) ^k {{are independent of}} the S^ 1 radii, provided the theory has unbroken center symmetry. In particular, this implies that a large N gauge theory which, on ^d, flows to an IR fixed point, retains the infinite correlation length and other scale invariant properties of the decompactified theory even when compactified on ^d-k× (S^ 1) ^k. In other words, finite volume effects are 1 /N suppressed. In lattice formulations of vector-like theories, this implies that numerical studies to determine the boundary between confined and conformal phases may be performed on one-site lattice models. In N= 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the center symmetry realization {{is a matter of}} choice: the theory on ^ 4 -k× (S^ 1) ^k has a moduli space which contains points with all possible realizations of center symmetry.

40|$|Alpine {{snowmelt}} is {{an important}} generation mode for runoff in the source region of the Tarim River basin, which covers four subbasins characterized by large area, sparse gauge stations, mixed runoff supplied by snowmelt and rainfall, and remarkably spatially heterogeneous precipitation. Taking the Kaidu River basin as a research area, this study analyzes the influence of these characteristics on the variables and parameters of the Snow Runoff Model and discusses the corresponding determination strategy to improve the accuracy of snowmelt simulation and forecast. The results show that: (i) The temperature controls the overall tendency of simulated runoff and is dominant to simulation accuracy, as the measured daily mean temperature cannot represent the average level of the same elevation in the basin and that directly inputting it to model leads to inaccurate simulations. Based on the analysis of remote sensing snow maps and simulation results, {{it is reasonable to}} approximate the mean temperature with 0. 5 time daily maximum temperature. (ii) For the conflict between the <b>limited</b> <b>gauge</b> station and remarkably spatial heterogeneity of rainfall, it is not realistic to compute rainfall for each elevation zone. After the measured rainfall is multiplied by a proper coefficient and adjusted with runoff coefficient for rainfall, the measured rainfall data can satisfy the model demands. (iii) Adjusting time lag according to the variation of snowmelt and rainfall position can improve the simulation precision of the flood peak process. (iv) Along with temperature, the rainfall increases but cannot be completely monitored by <b>limited</b> <b>gauge</b> stations, which results in precision deterioration. © Science in China Press 2007...|$|R

40|$|Dark matter (DM) with {{sizeable}} self-interactions {{mediated by}} a light species offers a compelling {{explanation of the}} observed galactic substructure; furthermore, the direct coupling between DM and a light particle contributes to the DM annihilation in the early universe. If the DM abundance {{is due to a}} dark particle-antiparticle asymmetry, the DM annihilation cross-section can be arbitrarily large, and the coupling of DM to the light species can be significant. We consider the case of asymmetric DM interacting via a light (but not necessarily massless) Abelian gauge vector boson, a dark photon. In the massless dark photon <b>limit,</b> <b>gauge</b> invariance mandates that DM be multicomponent, consisting of positive and negative dark ions of different species which partially bind in neutral dark atoms. We argue that a similar conclusion holds for light dark photons; in particular, we establish that the multi-component and atomic character of DM persists in much of the parameter space where the dark photon is sufficiently light to mediate sizeable DM self-interactions. We discuss the cosmological sequence of events in this scenario, including the dark asymmetry generation, the freeze-out of annihilati ons, the dark recombination and the phase transition which gives mass to the dark photon. We estimate the effect of self-interactions in DM haloes, taking into account this cosmological history. We place constraints based on the observed ellipticity of large haloes, and identify the regimes where DM self-scattering can affect the dynamics of smaller haloes, bringing theory in better agreement with observations. Moreover, we estimate the cosmological abundance of dark photons in various regimes, and derive pertinent bounds...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} in the following manner. In section 2, we present the problem formulation. In Section 3, we discuss the issues involved {{in the design of}} 5 control charts for grouped data. Solution methodology for both the large and the small sample size cases are presented. When a and b are small, or if the difference between 0 and 1 is small, then large sample sizes are required and we can appeal to the central limit theorem. If small sample sizes are required, the solution is more difficult. Section 3 also addresses the issue of discreteness. Since we are working with grouped (discrete) data and integer sample sizes the design problem is complicated. In Section 4, we address the related but separate problem of step-gauge design. There are two decisions to be made in specifying the grouping criteria: we must decide how many groups are to be used, and how these groups are to be distinguished. In general, a k-step gauge classifies units into (k+ 1) groups. As more groups are used, more information becomes available about the parameters of the underlying distribution. The limiting case occurs when the variable is measured to arbitrary precision. Given that a k-step gauge is to be used, not all gauge limits will provide the same amount of information about the parameters of the underlying distribution. It is not intuitively clear how to set the k-steps of the gauge to minimize the sample size required. In Section 4, we give tables of step gauge limits that minimize the sample size required for tests with specific type I and II risks. We consider in detail the important special case where the error risks are equal and the gauge limits are placed symmetrically about 0 + 1 () 2. It is well known that the optimal single <b>limit</b> <b>gauge</b> should be placed at 0 + 1 () [...] ...|$|E
