5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the final by defeating French club Lens in their semi-final. Galatasaray beat English team <b>Leeds</b> United but their matches were marred by violence: two <b>Leeds</b> United fans were stabbed to death before their semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000. The events happened at 22:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between <b>Leeds</b> fans and Galatasaray fans. <b>Leeds</b> fans had been drinking in bars reportedly taunting local people and Turkish police intervened to stop fights breaking out. There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a telephone to call for support when he saw <b>Leeds</b> fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between {{the two sets of}} supporters. This led to the two <b>Leeds</b> fans being stabbed.|$|E

However, with three minutes of extra time remaining, St. John scored.

VA commissioned a study to determine the impact of USGBC’s new requirement on VA’s construction program.

5|$|On 3 March 2010, Dickov {{signed for}} <b>Leeds</b> United {{until the end}} of the season. It was {{initially}} thought that MLS side Toronto had beaten <b>Leeds</b> to Dickov's signature, however United eventually won the race for the Scot. <b>Leeds</b> also had to receive special dispensation from FIFA to sign Dickov due to the fact he had already played for two clubs this season, the maximum permitted. Dickov was named on Leeds' bench against Brentford and made his debut for <b>Leeds</b> when he came on as a late substitute.

5000|$|Morphosis' {{design was}} {{selected}} {{at least partly}} because of its projected energy efficiency; a requirement of the GSA's brief. At the time of design, the GSA did not mandate <b>LEED</b> certification, and the building was not evaluated for <b>LEED</b> certification until after construction. The building then failed to meet a significant level of <b>LEED</b> certification. Mayne said [...] "I wasn't arrogant, but I was confident — I just assumed we had the platinum (the highest <b>LEED)</b> rating. All {{of a sudden we}} went through <b>LEED</b> and it wasn't working." [...] In fact, the building only received silver <b>LEED</b> qualifications; two steps below platinum.|$|R

50|$|Development of <b>LEED</b> {{began in}} 1993, spearheaded by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) senior {{scientist}} Robert K. Watson. As founding {{chairman of the}} <b>LEED</b> Steering Committee, Watson led a broad-based consensus process which included non-profit organizations, government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, builders, product manufacturers and other industry leaders until 2006. The <b>LEED</b> initiative {{was supported by a}} strong USGBC Board of Directors, chaired by Steven Winter from 1999 to 2003, and very active staff, including Nigel Howard. At that time, USGBC’s current Senior Vice President of <b>LEED,</b> Scot Horst, became chair of the <b>LEED</b> Steering Committee before joining USGBC staff. Early <b>LEED</b> committee members also included USGBC co-founder Mike Italiano, architects Bill Reed and Sandy Mendler, builder Gerard Heiber and Myron Kibbe and engineer Richard Bourne. As interest in <b>LEED</b> grew, in 1996, engineers Tom Paladino and Lynn Barker co-chaired the newly formed <b>LEED</b> technical committee.|$|R

In Europe they beat DWS (Netherlands), Valencia (Spain), Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Dinamo Zagreb (Yugoslavia); Zagreb won 2–0 at the Stadion Maksimir and held <b>Leeds</b> to a 0–0 draw at Elland Road to leave <b>Leeds</b> with another second-place finish.|$|E

He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at <b>Leeds,</b> Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. <b>Leeds</b> pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for <b>Leeds,</b> who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{increasing}} demand towards environmental safety forces <b>LEED</b> certification to play major role. The {{process of the}} <b>LEED</b> for Homes Rating System, available in the USA, Canada and Sweden, is {{significantly different from the}} <b>LEED</b> NC rating system. <b>LEED</b> for Homes projects are low rise residential and are required to work with either an American Provider Organization or a Canadian Provider Organization and a Green Rater. A Provider Organization helps the project through the process while overseeing the Green Raters. Green Raters are individuals that conduct the two mandatory <b>LEED</b> for Homes site inspections; the Thermal Bypass Inspection and the Final Inspection. Although <b>LEED</b> for Homes is typically viewed by the construction industry as a simpler rating system, especially when compared to <b>LEED</b> NC, <b>LEED</b> NC does not require an on-site inspection. The Provider and the Green Rater do not certify the project, but rather assist in the certification process.|$|R
