5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by <b>longshore</b> drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to <b>longshore</b> drift.|$|E
5000|$|Within this union, Aboriginal longshoremen {{received}} {{the right to}} a casualized workplace where they could freely pursue other economic ventures alongside <b>longshoring.</b> This sensibility persisted into the late 1930s, 1940s, and even the early 1950s. In 1953, strict rules were finally implemented based on seniority and leave-of-absence membership conditions. In the words of one Aboriginal longshoreman who decided to specialize in <b>longshoring</b> in 1953, [...] "It was murder at first give up fishing. But now we've got no squawks. I wanted to live here in town and it was getting too hard to make any money fishing."According to waterfront scholar Stuart Jamieson, Aboriginal involvement in <b>longshoring</b> declined after 1945, with the numbers dropping to twenty-five workers in 1954. In 1963, thirty-three Aboriginal workers were engaged in <b>longshoring.</b>|$|R

5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a <b>longshore</b> current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the <b>longshore</b> current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{coastline}} suffers {{the highest}} rate of coastal erosion in Europe: 2 metres a year on average or 2million tonnes of material a year. Some of this is transported by <b>longshore</b> drift with about 3% of material being deposited at Spurn Head spit, to the south. The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing concern in the area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been carrying out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951. The Holderness area drains mostly into the Humber and the eponymous River Hull drains the area north of Hull.|$|E
5|$|The Point {{was formed}} by <b>longshore</b> drift and this {{movement}} continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from {{the air of a}} series of hooks along {{the south side of the}} spit. Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit, and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E

The International <b>Longshore</b> and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E

25|$|This {{sediment}} then {{enters the}} coastal system and is transported by <b>longshore</b> drift. A {{good example of}} the sediment budget and <b>longshore</b> drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long shore transport.

25|$|<b>Longshore</b> {{drift of}} {{sediment}} {{is important for}} distributing sediment along the coast, and {{is considered one of}} the most important mechanisms. The <b>longshore</b> drift of sediment can be considered both a source and a sink due to the fact that in some case it can add sediment to a coastline but in others transport sediment away from a coastline. An example of both extremes of <b>longshore</b> drift can be found on the Canterbury coastline in New Zealand, either side of Banks Peninsular. Both the Waimakariri River in the north and the Canterbury Bight in the south of the Banks Peninsula provide large amounts of sediment respectively. The difference is the sediment supplied by the Waimakariri River is a source for the coast's New Brighton spit due to the reversal of southern currents transporting sediment to the south. In contrast the Canterbury Bight has a combination of high energy environments and strong southern <b>longshore</b> currents that transport large amounts of sediment north, which can be classified as a sink, putting a deficit to the coasts sedimentary budget. As a result, there is erosion of the Canterbury Bight and a predominantly balanced New Brighton Spit.|$|E

5000|$|Roine states, [...] "lumber <b>longshoring</b> was a {{difficult}} and often dangerous form of work, but it offered slightly higher wages than did general labour in a sawmill and provided {{the opportunity to work}} intermittently and pursue other activities when so desired". Lumber <b>longshoring</b> consisted of handling raw, unprocessed logs and milled lumber into the holds of ships. In the early days of <b>longshoring,</b> this entailed transporting logs by hand into sailing ships by maneuvering them through portholes or the stern, or by sliding them down [...] "a series of ramps to the ship's hold." [...] Milled lumber was loaded into a sling and lifted by cable with a steam-powered engine into the ship holds. The engines for these lift systems were called [...] "donkeys" [...] and were positioned on either docks or barges. According to dock worker Ray Mason, who began working on the waterfront in 1913,And at that time they had donkey engines on scows barges. The ships had stern ports and everything was hauled in with the donkey through or over the stern. Of course, at that time the Indians from the North Shore Burrard Inlet did all that work.By the 1920s, steam-powered vessels had almost entirely replaced sailing ships, leading to increased mechanization; deck-mounted winches and derricks or cranes were used to move the lumber. While repetitive and physically demanding, <b>longshoring</b> lumber was a skilled profession that saw men develop specialized positions within each work gang. Knowing how to maneuver lumber on and off a ship required significant know-how. For example, in the words of famed Tsleil-Waututh longshoreman, chief, Hollywood celebrity, and Native rights activist Dan George:Some of the timber were ninety feet long—so big that when the ship finally got to England, they didn't know how to handle the cargo, and we had to send men over to unload. Mostly I loaded forty-foot lengths. They could be loaded one at a time, so a five-masted schooner might take anywhere from three to six months to load.Edward Nahanee, a longshoreman and resident of the Squamish Reserve at Mission (Ustlawn), stated: When I was running side I used to watch the load coming down the hatch. There might be six or eight timbers in the load and I would size it up as soon as it landed I would know where each timber was going.The specialized ability to fit lumber into a ship was a role that many Aboriginals gained respect for, while also reinforcing a causal notion of race as a determinant of skill for certain tasks. According to historian Rolf Knight, the role of racialization in dock work was a factor in the prominence of Aboriginal men performing lumber longshoring: [...] "loading lumber was one of the more strenuous kinds of <b>longshoring,</b> so that employers attempted to maintain competition between racially distinct crews and that a reluctance seems to have developed among employers to hire Indians to handle non-lumber cargo". Forty-five-year veteran waterfront worker Sam Engler stated that white longshoremen were given preference for the best above-deck jobs, saying [...] "Indians used to call us white brothers and we were getting the choice jobs". In response to these pressures, the use by Aboriginal workers of the Squamish language helped establish camaraderie, while also enabling them to subvert authority by being able to keep their conversations socially encrypted from the oversight of white employers and colleagues.|$|R
25|$|The ILA faced competition, {{particularly}} from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which {{had a number of}} members on the West Coast, where many workers moved into <b>longshoring</b> from other centers of IWW strength, such as the lumber and mining industries, and in Philadelphia, where the IWW remained a force after the prosecution and conviction of many of its leaders in 1919 largely destroyed the organization.
