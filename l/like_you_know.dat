500|$|... "Let's Get It On" [...] {{features}} soulful, passionate lead vocals and multi-tracked background singing, both by Gaye. It has a 1950s-styled {{melody and}} begins with three wah-wah guitar notes and centers on simple chord changes, while its arrangements are centered on an eccentric rhythm pattern. Its signature guitar line {{is played by}} session musician Don Peake. Music journalist Jon Landau dubs the song [...] "a classic Motown single, endlessly repeatable and always enjoyable". The song is reprised on the fourth track, [...] "Keep Gettin' It On". It expands on the title track's sensual theme with political overtones: [...] "won't you rather make love, children / as opposed to war, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you should." ...|$|E
500|$|Bangalter and Homem-Christo have {{credited}} {{many sources}} that influenced their musical style. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English {{as a second}} language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics. The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin'. Bangalter explained: [...] "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{everybody wants to be}} in a band." [...] They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that [...] "put everything together" [...] in terms of genre".|$|E
500|$|Markley and Lloyd {{did not get}} on, {{which led}} to the latter leaving the group and Morgan joining full-time. According to Lloyd, Markley became {{increasingly}} overbearing on the WCPAEB's creative output, and [...] "he started to believe that he was <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the real deal, as opposed to the guy who doesn't sing and doesn't really have any musical thoughts and stuff like that. He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it". Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and Mike Curb such as October Country, the Smoke, St. John Green, and the Fire Escape.|$|E

500|$|Stewart himself {{says that}} he does not {{perceive}} his show as cynical. [...] "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," [...] he says. [...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live. [...] "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> media people, no offense." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1952, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} John Wayne {{again in}} Ford's romantic comedy-drama film, The Quiet Man. Shot {{on location in}} Cong, County Mayo, Ireland, O'Hara cited the film to be her [...] "personal favourite of all the pictures I have made. It is the one I am most proud of, and I {{tend to be very}} protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her." [...] Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O'Hara was disconcerted with Ford's harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing. Though Ford generally treated her very well, on one occasion when filming a cart scene in which the wind in her eyes made it difficult to see, Ford yelled [...] "Open your damn eyes" [...] and O'Hara flipped, responding with [...] "What would a bald-headed son of a bitch <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about hair lashing across his eyeballs".|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

500|$|Boulter {{starred in}} two films in 2008, Daylight Robbery by filmmaker Paris Leonti, and Donkey Punch {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn. Boulter portrayed a character named [...] "Sean" [...] in Donkey Punch, who tags along with character [...] "Josh" [...] as the [...] "quiet brother ... who hits {{it off with}} Tammi". Boulter guest starred on a two-part episode arc [...] "Wounds" [...] in May 2008 of the television series Waking the Dead as character [...] "Jimmy Dearden". He appeared on the television series Survivors as [...] "Neil" [...] in November 2008. He had a recurring role in ten episodes of the television series Casualty in 2010, as [...] "Kieron Fletcher". He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence to stand there and look <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E
500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't <b>like?</b> <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
2500|$|Becker and Fagen met in 1967 at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. As Fagen {{passed by}} a café, The Red Balloon, he heard Becker {{practicing}} the electric guitar. In an interview, Fagen recounted the experience: [...] "I hear this guy practicing, and it sounded very professional and contemporary. It sounded <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> like a black person, really." [...] He introduced himself to Becker and asked, [...] "Do {{you want to be}} in a band?"

2500|$|Initially, the {{character}} {{was not well}} received. She came off as too angry and bitchy to some viewers. [...] "At first, the audience rejected her character because, well, she was mean to our hero (Lucas)," [...] said Schwann. [...] "And she's pretty and popular." [...] Burton stated, [...] "She was catching a lot of flack. , 'Oh, she's this cheerleader. She's <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> this cute little girl. She wants to be all hard and angry.'" [...] Schwann decided to soften {{the character}} a little, which included having her bond with character Haley James, Lucas's best friend, and she eventually caught on with the audience. [...] " [...] our challenge, because she [...] the moral center of the show," [...] said Schwahn.|$|E
2500|$|Following Weinberg's exit, O'Brien {{sought to}} revamp the show's title theme song. In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, O'Brien expressed his desire {{to create a new}} introduction from the previous Late Night and Tonight compositions, which were used for O'Brien's entire 17-year relationship with NBC, and ultimately unveil a new signature sound for the show. The new theme song was co-written by bandleader Jimmy Vivino, and O'Brien himself. Despite no obvious copyright issues to continue using the previous theme, which was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie, O'Brien stated of the transition to a new composition, [...] "it just felt like {{the right thing to do}} [...] There's this feeling of, 'Let's try and build something new.' I came out to that theme for seventeen years and it does feel <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what? Let's try some new stuff. Let's try and change it up." [...] However, the closing theme from his previous NBC shows was retained in a slightly altered form.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the future}} of Savatage, {{frontman}} Jon Oliva explained, [...] "As far as that goes, the whole Wacken thing came up, and I was, <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what?

He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's just wait until the winter tour is over and then you and me we're going to sit down in January and discuss what we're going to do.'" [...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years.

2500|$|Usher {{commented that}} while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, [...] "I {{had the chance to}} ramp up my success, where this has {{happened}} to Bieber abruptly". As a result, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coach him on handling fame and his public image. After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's [...] "swagger coach", created a [...] "streetwise look" [...] for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, [...] "Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite rappers." [...] In 2013, Bieber said that he was [...] "very influenced by black culture", but he neither thought [...] "of it as black or white" [...] nor tried to [...] "act or pose in a certain way". To him, it was [...] "a lifestyle—like a suaveness or a [...] ". Wax statues of him with his hairstyle from that of his earlier career are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in Amsterdam, London, and New York City.|$|E
2500|$|The band (minus drummer William Goldsmith) {{relocated}} to Hollywood's Grandmaster Recorders in February 1997, described by Mendel as [...] "a small studio that sometimes moonlighted as a porn set, and looked the part." [...] For {{a period of}} four weeks, the band re-recorded most of the album with Grohl performing the drum tracks. It started with only [...] "Monkey Wrench" [...] as Grohl and Norton felt the drums needed more work, but eventually Goldsmith's drums remained on only two tracks, [...] "Doll" [...] and [...] "Up in Arms". According to Grohl, Goldsmith's drumming had good moments, but his performances mostly did not fit what Grohl had conceived for the drum track, so the frontman decided to redo them himself. Goldsmith even asked if he should go to Los Angeles, but Grohl dismissed this by saying he was only performing overdubs. Once Mendel told Goldsmith the situation, Grohl said that despite replacing Goldsmith's tracks, he still wanted him as a bandmember, but the disgruntled drummer {{decided to leave the}} Foo Fighters instead. Speaking about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl in 2011 said, [...] "There were a lot of reasons it didn't work out... {{but there was also a}} part of me that was <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet."
