5|$|Kershaw pitched 18 innings {{during his}} second trip to Jacksonville (two starts and one seven inning relief appearance), winning two games. During this stretch, he allowed only two earned runs, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> ERA to 1.91. He was {{recalled}} on July 22.|$|E
5|$|Risk is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E

5|$|He {{soon began}} to falter, giving up four earned runs in four innings against the Cubs on May22 and losing {{consecutive}} starts against New York and Pittsburgh. Then in a start against Cincinnati, he surrendered 15hits and seven earned runs; his ERA had now risen to 3.29. He had regained his form {{over the course of}} the months of July and August, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> ERA to 2.69after his game on September8. He lost much of his effectiveness later, however, allowing 14hits and 10earned runs against Boston on September10, and three more runs against Brooklyn in five relief innings on September 13. After a short one-inning appearance on September25, he started the game on October3 against the Giants. He gave up five earned runs in five innings pitched and received the loss. It was his last major league appearance. In his one season with Philadelphia, he pitched in 28games, and had a 6–8record. His final career record was 63-76, with a 3.09ERA and 547strikeouts in 1,207innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The new park had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate beneficiary of the change, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award. It {{would be the only}} time in his career he earned this distinction.|$|E
5|$|Nine power-ups each supply Mario with {{a special}} costume that grants him {{temporary}} abilities. For example, special mushrooms bestow the player with a Bee, Boo, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would be otherwise inaccessible, yet <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> mobility. The recurring Fire Flower allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the newly introduced Ice Flower allows Mario to create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he walks on. The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that he touches, {{as well as being}} able to run faster.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} the {{imported}} ice varied according {{to the amount of}} economic competition; in Havana, Tudor's ice sold for 25 cents ($3.70 in 2010 terms) per pound, while in Georgia it reached only six to eight cents ($0.90–$1.20 in 2010 terms). Where Tudor had a strong market share, he would respond to competition from passing traders by <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> prices considerably, selling his ice at the unprofitable rate of one cent ($0.20) per pound (0.5kg); at this price, competitors would typically be unable to sell their own stock at a profit: they would either be driven into debt or if they declined to sell, their ice would melt away in the heat. Tudor, relying on his local storage depots, could then increase his prices once again. By the middle of the 1820s, around 3,000 tons (3 million kg) of ice was being shipped from Boston annually, two thirds by Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad {{announced}} a comeback on March 2, 2004. On October 2, 2004, he fought against Ricardo Mayorga, in Madison Square Garden. Early {{in the first}} round Mayorga was on the offensive connecting several combinations, later in the round Trinidad connected some punches to his opponent's face. Mayorga reacted defiantly while <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> defense, which Trinidad used to continue the offensive during the closing seconds. In the second round he continued connecting with combinations to Mayorga's face which caused him to bleed from his nose; the round concluded with both fighters exchanging punches. In the third round Mayorga attempted to counter with punches to the body but did not do significant damage to his opponent, however later in the round one of these punches made Trinidad lose his balance and touch the floor with one glove which the referee counted as a knockdown. In the fourth round both boxers traded hard combinations. In the fifth Trinidad displayed control of the offense's tempo injuring Mayorga and opening a cut under one of his eyes. This pattern continued in the sixth and seventh round, and the cut on Mayorga's face began to swell. In the eight round Trinidad scored several knockdowns, Mayorga continued after two knockdowns, but lost by technical knockout following a third knockdown.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{arrived in}} Fukuoka having been chosen by {{broadcaster}} TV Asahi as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4×100m freestyle relay being held after the 400m freestyle {{on the first}} night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy {{when he reached the}} 200m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93s behind at the final turn, a final 50m burst in 24.36s saw him cut a further 0.42s from his world record. The relay saw him dive in fractionally ahead of American Jason Lezak after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87s. In the 800m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> world record by over two seconds. The 200m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1min 44.06s in the process, prompting van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft. Thorpe's winning streak was interrupted in the 100m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4×200m freestyle relay. Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians more than six seconds in arrears. Having overtaken Klim as Australia's leading 100m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4×100m medley relay team on 28 July. After Matt Welsh, Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs, Thorpe's change left him half a body length behind the new 100m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5m. This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships, and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200–400–800 treble. His performances formed the basis for Australia's gold medal win over the United States 13–9. It was also {{the first time since the}} 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet. Thorpe's achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics, which he played down.|$|E

25|$|Redick set {{a record}} for the most {{consecutive}} free throws made in the ACC with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003 and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012 by Scott Wood from NC State. Redick entered his final post-season {{with a chance to}} go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724).|$|E
25|$|Maygar {{worked as}} a grazier at Ruffy near Euroa, while {{continuing}} {{to serve in the}} 8th Light Horse, Victorian Mounted Rifles, and was promoted to captain in 1905. In July 1912 he transferred to the 16th (Indi) Light Horse Regiment. Following the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> age by four years in order to do so. Appointed as a captain in the 4th Light Horse Regiment on 20 August 1914, he sailed for Egypt in October. He later fought at Gallipoli, and was promoted to major. On 17 October 1915 he was given temporary command of the 8th Light Horse Regiment, with his promotion to lieutenant colonel being confirmed in December. During the evacuation he commanded a small party of forty men, with instructions to hold the trenches at all costs until early morning, in order to allow the successful embarkation of the remainder of the force.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{started in}} the Subway Series for the third {{straight}} season, losing to the Mets on August 2 by giving up seven runs (six earned) in 6⅓ innings. It would be his final loss of 2016, as Tanaka would finish the season strong and end the year by winning seven consecutive decisions in his last ten starts. Tanaka faced Iwakuma again on August 24, throwing seven shutout innings as Tanaka received the win and Iwakuma received the loss again in their second meeting. On September 10, Tanaka struck out a season-high 10 batters in 7⅓ innings against the Tampa Bay Rays. In his next start, Tanaka pitched seven innings of one-run baseball against the Boston Red Sox, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> ERA to 2.97, the best in the American League. After a win against the Rays on September 21 in which he allowed four home runs, Tanaka was diagnosed with a flexor mass strain and was shut down for five days. After the strain healed, it was announced that Tanaka would not pitch in his final scheduled start of the season as the Yankees were already eliminated from postseason contention and the team felt it was not necessary to risk Tanaka's health in a meaningless game. In the second half of 2016, Tanaka pitched to an 8-2 record and a 2.83 ERA in 13 games, throwing 82⅔ innings and striking out 72.|$|E

25|$|Returning {{home for}} their final home {{series of the}} regular season, the Blue Jays battled the Red Sox for 3 games. Marcus Stroman made his first home start in 2015, holding the Red Sox to 1 run over 7 innings in the first game, which Toronto won 6–1. The win gave Toronto a 4-game lead in their division, however they would give that game back the {{following}} day, losing 7–6 to Boston, coupled with the Yankees defeating the Mets. The Blue Jays led the game 4–2, heading into the ninth inning, however Roberto Osuna and Aaron Sanchez would combine to give up 5 runs to the Red Sox. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth, Jose Bautista hit a 2-run home run, however the comeback would fall short. The Blue Jays would lose another game off their division lead in the rubber match, losing 4–3 to Boston after committing 3 errors. Following their series loss to Boston, the Blue Jays faced the Yankees for the final time in the 2015 regular season. Toronto would take the first game, 4–2, after another quality start from David Price. Losing 3–2 in the ninth inning of the second game, Dioner Navarro hit a solo home run to tie the game. The Blue Jays would load the bases later in the inning, but were unable to score the winning run. In the top of the tenth, the Yankees scored 3 runs off a home run by Greg Bird, and the Blue Jays would go on to lose the game 6–4. In the final game, Toronto and New York battled to a scoreless tie through the first 5 innings. In the bottom of the sixth, Kevin Pillar broke the tie with an RBI single, and the Blue Jays took a 1–0 lead. In the seventh, Russell Martin hit a 3-run home run to lead Toronto to a 4–0 victory. Marcus Stroman earned his third win in as many starts, pitching 7 shutout innings against the Yankees and <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> ERA to 1.89. Toronto's last 3 regular season home games would be played against the Rays. R.A. Dickey started {{the first game of the}} series and earned his 100th career win, 5–3 over Tampa Bay. The win also clinched a postseason berth for the Blue Jays, their first since the 1993 season. The second game featured a match between former Rays ace David Price and current ace Chris Archer, who was mentored by Price early in his career. Though many had thought the game would be a pitcher's duel, the two combined to allow 14 runs through the first 4 innings, with Toronto eventually coming out on top, 10–8. The Blue Jays would complete the sweep, winning the final game of the series 5–4 thanks to Josh Donaldson's franchise record third walk-off home run of the season.|$|E

500|$|With the Phillies, Diekman {{began as}} a {{starting}} pitcher and progressed through a few levels of the Phillies' farm system {{in his first two}} years as a starter before adjusting his mechanics and <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> arm slot to throw sidearm out of the bullpen as a relief pitcher. The adjustment worked and helped him move through the remaining levels of the Phillies' farm system. In 2012, Diekman made his major league debut. Over the next two seasons, he split time between the major league Phillies and their Triple-A (AAA) affiliate, the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs, though while he was with the major league team, he was considered one of the [...] "lone bright spots" [...] in both 2012 and 2013.

500|$|Hansen's {{first game}} of the 1953 season {{resulted}} in his first loss; in a 14–12 contest against the Pirates, he allowed four runs—one earned—in the fifth frame, the only inning he pitched. His next appearance resulted in his first save of the year, coming against Pittsburgh on April 25, and he pitched in his final April game three days later against St. Louis. Hansen's first appearance in May came against the newly relocated Milwaukee Braves, late of Boston, when he allowed a walk and two hits, one a home run, in a single inning. He threw a scoreless frame against Brooklyn on May 10, and a perfect [...] on May 12 to earn his second save. He allowed two runs against Milwaukee on May 18, but both were unearned, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> ERA to a season-low 2.25; three runs in his next appearance, however, raised his average to its highest point since the year's first game. His last game in May was against Pittsburgh: [...] of an inning with one unearned run allowed.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, O'Brien {{captured}} the breaststroke double at the Australian Championships, setting personal bests in both events, {{and was a}} member of the New South Wales team that won the medley relay. His performances earned him selection for an overseas tour to Europe with the Australian team, competing in the Soviet Union, Germany and England before visiting Japan and Hong Kong. O'Brien defended his breaststroke double at the 1964 Australian Championships, <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> times to 1min 8.1s and 2min 32.6s for the 100metres (m) and 200m breaststroke respectively. He capped off his campaign as well as a third consecutive medley relay triumph for New South Wales. Within a year, he had reduced his times in the two events by more than 3%. As O'Brien was widely regarded as Australia's best breaststroker, he was selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
