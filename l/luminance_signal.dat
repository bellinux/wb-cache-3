In his system the output of the three camera tubes were re-combined to produce a single [...] "luminance" [...] value that was very similar to a monochrome signal and could be broadcast on the existing VHF frequencies. The color information was encoded in a separate [...] "chrominance" [...] signal, consisting of two separate signals, the original blue signal minus the luminance (B'–Y'), and red-luma (R'–Y'). These signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency; a monochrome set would tune in only the <b>luminance</b> <b>signal</b> on the VHF band, while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and chrominance on two different frequencies, and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original RGB signal. The downside to this approach is that it required a major boost in bandwidth use, something the FCC was interested in avoiding.|$|E

The successful implementation of an efficient and accurate technique for assessing equiluminance corroborates further the main findings.

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the extent to which colour (and <b>luminance)</b> <b>signals</b> contribute towards the visuomotor localization of targets. To do so we exploited the movement-related illusory displacement a small stationary window undergoes when it has a continuously moving carrier grating behind it. We used drifting (1. 0 - 4. 2 Hz) red/green-modulated isoluminant gratings or yellow/black luminance-modulated gratings as carriers, each curtailed in space by a stationary, two-dimensional window. After each trial, the perceived location of the window was recorded with reference to an on-screen ruler (perceptual task) or the on-screen touch of a ballistic pointing movement made without visual feedback (visuomotor task). Our results showed that the perceptual displacement measures were similar for each stimulus type and weakly dependent on stimulus drift rate. However, while the visuomotor displacement measures were similar for each stimulus type at low drift rates (4 Hz). We show that the latter cannot be attributed to differences in perceived speed between stimulus types. We assume, therefore, that our visuomotor localization judgements were more susceptible to the (carrier) motion of luminance patterns than colour patterns. We suggest that, far from being detrimental, this susceptibility may indicate the operation of mechanisms designed to counter the temporal asynchrony between perceptual experiences and the physical changes in the environment that give rise to them. We propose that perceptual localisation is equally supported by both colour and <b>luminance</b> <b>signals</b> but that visuomotor localisation is predominantly supported by <b>luminance</b> <b>signals.</b> We discuss the neural pathways that may be involved with visuomotor localization. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA global dot-motion {{stimulus}} {{was employed}} {{in order to}} investigate the interaction between <b>luminance</b> and chromatic <b>signals</b> in motion processing. Thresholds are determined by measuring the minimum number of dots which need to move in a coherent fashion {{in a field of}} randomly moving dots in order for the observers to be able to determine the direction of coherent motion. We found that: (1) observers could not track an achromatic signal-dot which changes its luminance polarity between frame transitions. The addition of a consistent chromatic signal allowed observers to track such a dot when the dot contained low- (8 %) luminance contrast but this ability was impaired as the luminance contrast was increased; (2) the addition of chromatic contrast to a dot which contained consistent low-luminance contrast could result in threshold elevation. For fixed contrast chromatic and <b>luminance</b> <b>signals,</b> the presence and degree of threshold elevation depended upon the spatiotemporal properties of the dot motion; (3) the ability of observers to extract a global-motion signal carried by a group of dots of one colour was impaired by the addition of a number of additional-noise dots of a different colour. These results are interpreted as indicating that: (1) the motion-selective cells that are sensitive to chromatic signals are also sensitive to luminance signals; (2) the combined chromatic and luminance and purely luminance motion cells are pooled to form a single pathway prior to global-motion extraction; and (3) the negative interaction observed between the chromatic and <b>luminance</b> <b>signals</b> is likely to be due to the differences in the processing speeds of the combined luminance and chromatic and the purely luminance sensitive motion cells.

40|$|The {{visual system}} {{processes}} objects embedded in complex scenes that vary in both luminance and colour. In such scenes, colour {{contributes to the}} segmentation of objects from backgrounds, but does it also affect perceptual organisation of object contours which are already defined by <b>luminance</b> <b>signals,</b> or are these processes unaffected by colour’s presence? We investigated if <b>luminance</b> and chromatic <b>signals</b> comparably sustain processing of objects embedded in backgrounds, by varying contrast along the luminance dimension and along the two cone-opponent colour directions. In the first experiment thresholds for object/non-object discrimination of Gaborised shapes were obtained in the presence and absence of background clutter. Contrast of the component Gabors was modulated along single colour/luminance dimensions or co-modulated along multiple dimensions simultaneously. Background clutter elevated discrimination thresholds only for combined S-(L[*]+[*]M) and L[*]+[*]M signals. The second experiment replicated and extended this finding by demonstrating that the effect was dependent {{on the presence of}} relatively high S-(L[*]+[*]M) contrast.

5000|$|In December 1953 the FCC {{unanimously}} approved what is {{now called}} the NTSC color television standard (later defined as RS-170a). The compatible color standard retained full backward compatibility with existing black-and-white television sets. Color information was added to the black-and-white image by introducing a color subcarrier of precisely 315/88 MHz (usually described as 3.579545 MHz or 3.58 MHz). The precise frequency was chosen so that horizontal line-rate modulation components of the chrominance signal would fall exactly in between the horizontal line-rate modulation components of the <b>luminance</b> <b>signal,</b> thereby enabling the chrominance signal to be filtered out of the <b>luminance</b> <b>signal</b> with minor degradation of the <b>luminance</b> <b>signal.</b> Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits at the time the color standard was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz. [...] The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz = 9/572 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by existing television receivers.|$|E
50|$|The {{physics of}} the CRT require that a finite time {{interval}} be allowed for the spot {{to move back to}} the start of the next line (horizontal retrace) or the start of the screen (vertical retrace). The timing of the <b>luminance</b> <b>signal</b> must allow for this.|$|E
50|$|Black & white TV systems predate colour, and so {{subsequent}} analogue colour broadcast {{systems have}} been designed with backwards-compatibility in mind (known as a compatible colour system). Thus, the chrominance (colour) signal is typically 'shoe-horned' into the same channel as the <b>luminance</b> (brightness) <b>signal,</b> modulated on a fixed frequency, known as the colour subcarrier. Black and white televisions do not decode this extra colour information in the subcarrier, using only the luminance to provide a monochrome picture. However, due to limited bandwidth in the video channel, the chrominance and <b>luminance</b> <b>signals</b> bleed into each other considerably, resulting in the colour information showing up visibly as Chroma Crawl, or Chroma dots on black & white TV sets. This is normally considered a nuisance in analogue broadcasting. However, since telerecordings were made from black & white TV screens and technicians at the time often decided not to apply a filter to remove this interference, these patterns are retained even in the existing monochrome film prints and theoretically contain the original colour information. (Occasionally the colour information was filtered out using a notch filter and is lost.) The idea to recover this information was originally suggested by BBC researcher James Insell.|$|R

Here we quantify the dominance of luminance information in blur detection and examine a number of potential causes.
