Toward this aim the feedback controller for rejecting perturbation and disturbance is designed by using μ synthesis optimization technique and the feedforward compensator for compensating time lag of dynamic system is established based on the basic idea of zero phase error tracking. To validate the proposed control strategy, simulations and experiments are implemented, and show that the resulting system is highly robust against model perturbation and possesses excellent capability of suppressing the <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> and improving the tracking performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostics}} of malfunctions {{that can}} cause catastrophic failures {{has to be made}} in early stage in the industrial environment. Often flexible couplings are employed in industrial rotating machines when gearboxes and heavy thermal gradients are present. The hot and cold alignment of these couplings can be very different. Severe misalignments can generate cracks in the stub shafts, which can propagate in operating condition. Owing to the flexural flexibility of the <b>load</b> <b>coupling,</b> the shaft vibrations may be not noticeably affected by some typical symptoms that usually point out the presence of a crack, like twice per revolution harmonics in the vibration spectrum. Anyhow, suitable diagnostic strategies can detect clear fault symptoms, while model-based methods can confirm the occurrence of the shaft bow induced by the progressive yielding of a <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> due to a crack. This paper shows as a model-based diagnostic methodology would have allowed a crack in a <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> of a gas turbine to be identified before a serious failure happened by means of the shaft vibration analysis under operating conditions and rated speed. Finally, the vibrations caused by the shaft bow due to the propagation of a crack in the stub shaft of the coupling have been simulated using suitable equivalent excitations, the magnitude and phase of which have been estimated by means of a model-based identification method...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{unloading}} a depressed heart were assessed {{in terms of}} optimal coupling, between the ventricle and arterial system. To assess the effects of preload on ventricular <b>load</b> <b>coupling,</b> preload was reduced with a lower body negative pressure of − 20 mm Hg. Nitroprusside {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of afterload on the coupling under the condition that preload reduction was comparable to that with lower body negative pressure. In 13 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 32 ± 3 %, mean ± SE), direct arterial pressure was simultaneously recorded with the left ventricular echocardiogram as the pressure was elevated by phenytephrine. Left ventricular contractile properties were defined by the slope (Ees) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation. The effective arterial elastance (Ea) was expressed by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relation. Left ventricular external work, end-systolic potential energy and work efficiency, defined as external work per pressure volume area (external work + potential energy), were determined. Baseline ventricular <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> in these patients was characterized by an increase in the ratio of arterial elastance to ventricular elastance (Ea/Ees) (1. 96 ± 0. 31). This ratio decreased significantly, to 1. 45 ± 0. 22, with nitroprusside, and increased to 2. 37 ± 0. 34 with lower body negative pressure. Therefore, end-systolic potential energy was decreased by nitroprusside but was unaltered by lower body negative pressure while external work was comparably decreased by both manipulations, indicating that work efficiency was significantly augmented with nitroprusside but declined with lower body negative pressure. It is concluded that reduction in afterload rather than in preload {{plays an important role in}} restoring optimal ventricular <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> in patients with heart failure...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problems of minimizing sum power and maximizing sum rate for multi-cell networks with <b>load</b> <b>coupling,</b> where coupling relation occurs among cells due to inter-cell interference. This coupling relation {{is characterized by the}} signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) coupling model with cell load vector and cell power vector as the variables. Due to the nonlinear SINR coupling model, the optimization problems for multi-cell networks with <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> is nonconvex. To solve these nonconvex problems, we first consider the optimization problems for single-cell networks. Through variable transformations, the optimization problems can be equivalently transformed into convex problems. By solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), the optimal solutions to power minimization and rate maximization problems can be obtained in closed form. Based on the theoretical findings of optimization problems for single-cell networks, we develop a distributed time allocation and power control algorithm with low complexity for sum power minimization in multi-cell networks. This algorithm is proved to be convergent and globally optimal by using the properties of standard interference function. For sum rate optimization in multi-cell networks, we also provide a distributed algorithm which yields suboptimal solution. Besides, the convergence for this distributed algorithm is proved. Numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings, showing the superiority of our solutions compared to the conventional solution of allocating uniform power for users in the same cell.

40|$|Recently, Cloud-based Radio Access Network (C-RAN) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a potential solution to reduce energy cost in cellular networks. C-RAN centralizes the baseband processing capabilities of Base Stations (BSs) in a cloud computing platform {{in the form of}} BaseBand Unit (BBU) pool. In C-RAN, power consumed by the traditional BS system is distributed as wireless transmission power of the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) and baseband processing power of the BBU pool. Different from previous work where wireless transmission power and baseband processing power are optimized individually and independently, this paper focuses on joint optimization of allocation for these two kinds of power and attempts to minimize the total power consumption subject to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from users in terms of data rates. First, we exploit the <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> model to express the coupling relations among power, load and user data rates. Based on the <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> mode, we formulate the joint power optimization problem in C-RAN over both wireless transmission power and baseband processing power. Second, we prove that operating at full load may not be optimal in minimizing the total power consumption in C-RAN. Finally, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the target problem. Simulations have been performed to validate our theoretical and algorithmic work. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing schemes (without joint power optimization) in terms of power consumption. Comment: This paper is written in 10 pages with 7 figures.

40|$|Due to {{relative}} ground movement, buried pipelines experience geotechnical loads. The imposed geotechnical loads may initiate pipeline deformations {{that affect}} system serviceability and integrity. Engineering guidelines (e. g., ALA, 2005; Honegger and Nyman, 2001) provide the technical framework to develop idealized structural models to analyze pipe‒soil interaction events and assess pipe mechanical response. The soil behavior is modeled using discrete springs {{that represent the}} geotechnical loads per unit pipe length developed during the interaction event. Soil forces are defined along three orthogonal directions (i. e., axial, lateral and vertical) to analyze the response of pipelines. Nonlinear load-displacement relationships of soil defined by a spring, is independent of neighboring spring elements. However, recent experimental and numerical studies demonstrate significant coupling effects during oblique (i. e., not along one of the orthogonal axes) pipe‒soil interaction events. In the present study, physical modeling using a geotechnical centrifuge was conducted to improve the current understanding of soil <b>load</b> <b>coupling</b> effects of buried pipes in loose and dense sand.
