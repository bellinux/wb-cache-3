Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.|$|E

He moved to Kensington High Street with a friend he'd met in Tuscany then went back to Edmonton {{for a period of time}} until At <b>Least</b> <b>for</b> <b>Now</b> was completed.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the various entropy methods that are very popular in EEG time series {{analysis}} [1, 6, 7] like Sample Entropy (SampEn) [8], Lempel–Ziv complexity [9], auto-mutual information, Shannon’s entropy, and other approximate entropies are most similar according to Fulcher et al. [5] to the approximate entropy algorithm (ApEn) proposed by Pincus [10]. Unfortunately, current entropy measures are mostly unable to quantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as determine if the variation arises from a random process [11]. Since a high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, and a low score indicates a high degree of regularity [11], it would be better to use them, at <b>least</b> just, <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> only <b>for</b> comparisons between different conditions (e.g., resting vs. task) or systems (e.g., young vs. old) as was suggested in [12].|$|R

5000|$|San Vito was {{the subject}} of {{extensive}} emigration during the 20th century, first to the Americas, later towards northern Europe (especially Germany) and to northwestern Italy, but today the town has become a destination for immigrants from outside the European Union. A phenomenon that, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> a decade <b>now,</b> seems to settle into the territory is that of immigration by families from northern Europe, especially English and Irish people. These new arrivals usually consist of pensioners, not coming to work, who buy villas in the countryside of San Vito and enjoy the pleasant temperatures all year. This phenomenon, relatively recent in Apulia, is known as [...] "Salentoshire", a playful neologism along the lines of [...] "Chiantishire", which refers to the consolidated British tourism in Tuscany.|$|R
40|$|During the {{sovereign}} debt crisis some EU member states 'stepped outside' the EU legal order and institutional framework and instead resorted to {{public international law}} when concluding international agreements. This paper examines the reasons behind such moves, {{as well as their}} legal and institutional consequences. At several moments during {{the sovereign}} debt crisis of 2010 - 2012, Member State governments of the European Union concluded international agreements between themselves: the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the Fiscal Compact were all agreed in this manner. In each of those cases, a group of EU member states ‘stepped outside’ the EU legal order and the Union’s institutional framework, and instead resorted to instruments of public international law for organising their cooperation. This paper examines the reasons why this turn to international law occurred, and also the legal and institutional consequences of these moves away from EU law. The paper argues that we are not witnessing, at <b>least</b> not <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> an ‘intergovernmental plot’ designed to exclude the supranational institutions of the EU, but rather argues that contingent and plausible reasons explain the use of international law in each case, and that the damage to the constitutional integrity of the European Union is rather limited...|$|R
