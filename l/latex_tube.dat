The observed phenomena are analysed {{by means of a}} quasi-one-dimensional model, solved by the method of characteristics, taking into account the influence of nonlinearities, wall shear stress, viscoelastic wall properties and wave reflections. The theoretical computations are well confirmed by the experimental results. The pressure jump, induced by the valve closing, appeared to be slightly affected by nonlinearities. The decrease of the pressure jump while propagating upstream and the gradual pressure increase that follows the pressure jump are caused by the effect of wall shear stress. The local change in compliance generates the expected wave reflections and has a strong influence on the rise-time of the wave front.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to explore}} the {{hydrodynamic}} mechanisms involved in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure. Design: an experimental model of calf venous pump was constructed with collapsible tubes and valves. Material: the model consisted of a conduit and a pump with an intervening competent valve. Another valve that could allow reflux into the pump was mounted above the pump. Methods: conduit pressure and recovery times were monitored under conditions of different degrees of ejection fraction and reflux into the pump. Model variables included using poorly compliant tubes for the pump, the conduit and for both the pump and conduit. Results: the <b>latex</b> <b>tube</b> exhibited a non-linear volume–pressure relationship and a bi-modal regimen of compliance. This bestowed pressure-buffering properties. Ambulatory venous hypertension resulted when reflux beyond buffering capacity occurred. Substituting less compliant PTFE for latex at the pump had a relatively minor effect on post-ejection pressure and recovery times. Using PTFE at the conduit had a profound but divergent effect on both of these parameters. Conduit capacitance reduction had a similar effect. Conclusion: conduit elastance {{plays a significant role}} in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure in this experimental model. The hydrodynamic principles illustrated by the model may enhance our understanding of the human calf venous pump...|$|E

The <b>latex</b> <b>tube</b> was imaged using an Ultrasonix RP 500 and a novelimaging sequence was used to interleave two ultrasound frames, enabling ashort and variable (0. 3 - 39 ms) interframe time separation (δt).

40|$|In the ocean, {{natural and}} {{artificial}} processes generate clouds of bubbles which scatter and attenuate sound. Measurements {{have shown that}} at the individual bubble resonance frequency, sound propagation in this medium is highly attenuated and dispersive. Theory to explain this behavior exists in the literature, and is adequate away from resonance. However, due to excessive attenuation near resonance, little experimental data exists for comparison. An impedance tube was developed specifically for exploring this regime. Using the instrument, unique phase speed and attenuation measurements were made for void fractions ranging from 6. 2 × 10 ^− 5 to 2. 7 × 10 ^− 3 and bubble sizes centered around 0. 62 mm in radius. Improved measurement speed, accuracy and precision is possible with the new instrument, and both instantaneous and time-averaged measurements were obtained.

40|$|For {{my senior}} design project, I {{designed}} and built a device that will dilate the human esophagus for patients suffering {{from a variety of}} medical conditions. One current technique, Mercury bougienage, uses a tapered rubber rod filled with Mercury. The Mercury falls because of gravity, inducing an outward pressure on the esophagus. Two main problems with this procedure are the large longitudinal forces involved and the dependence upon the "feel" of the physician in applying the force. As a result, there is 'an uncertain risk of tissue perforation under this treatment. Other procedures have met with limited success and are difficult to apply to narrow or tortuous strictures. My design, developed with Carr Everbach, involves the use of a three-dimensional braid that expands radially when compressed and becomes narrow when stretched. Using a screw with left and right-handed threads, two sleeves were constructed so that they could slide up and down the screw. The sleeves are attached to each end of the braid. To test the device, an apparatus was built that applies an internal pressure to a <b>latex</b> <b>tube,</b> causing it to expand. The expansion was measured with a column of water and the pressure was recorded with a pressure transducer. Preliminary mechanical tests indicate that the device will exert forces necessary for esophageal dilation.

Routine complete physical examinations were performed on all persons in the sample. Screening procedures utilized in all subjects included: completion of a questionnaire and performance of `rheumatoid factor' tests. When indicated by results of clinical and laboratory examinations, PA roentogenograms of the hands and wrists were obtained. A rheumatologist (ID) reviewed the medical records of all individuals in whom there was evidence to suspect rheumatoid arthritis. 1303 of individual patients whose earlier examinations indicated the need, were recalled for clarification, confirmation and classification of their disease. The time of onset of disease was also established.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic procedures have improved public health. Colonoscopy, for example, is a screening procedure to diagnose and treat colorectal cancer. The conventional colonoscopy is an {{efficient way to}} prevent colorectal cancer; however, the uncomfortable nature of conventional colonoscopy discourages potential patients from compliance with recommended diagnostic guidelines. The overall goal of this work is to minimize the invasiveness of traditional colonoscopy. Our locomotion approach takes advantage of longitudinal expansion of a <b>latex</b> <b>tube</b> to propel the robot’s tip along the colon. In the preliminary ex-vivo experiments, the robot successfully advanced 1. 5 meters inside an excised curvilinear porcine colon with average speed of 28 mm/sec, and was capable of traversing bends ranging from 30 to 90 degrees. The robot creates less than 6 N of normal force at its tip when it is pressurized to 90 kPa. This maximum force generates pressure of 44. 17 mmHg at the tip, which is significantly lower than safe intraluminal human colonic pressure of 80 mmHg. The robot design inherently prevents loop formation in the colon, which is recognized as the main cause of post-procedural pain in patients. ^ Single-port laparoscopic (SPL) surgery is another recent advancement in medicine. SPL is performed through a single incision, offering greater benefit than traditional laparoscopy. Despite the potential advantages of SPL, it presents challenges for a surgeon, such as reduced workspace. In robotic single-port access surgeries, robot size is crucial due to the limited space. Thus, a robot may be designed to be underactuated. Suturing, in contrast, is a complicated task and requires full actuation. This study aims to overcome this shortcoming by implementing an optimization-based algorithm for autonomous suturing for an underactuated robot. The proposed algorithm approximates the ideal suturing trajectory by slightly reorienting the needle while minimizing the deviation of the needle with respect to ideal suturing. The deviation of the path taken by a custom robot with respect to the ideal trajectory varies depending on the suturing start location within the workspace as well as the needle size. The maximum deviation (dmax) was 9. 8 ± 6. 45 mm and the values ranged from 3. 86 (mm) to 29. 26 (mm). The optimization-based algorithm maximized the accuracy of a four-DOF robot to perform a path-constrained trajectory. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{propose a}} new method for the {{assessment}} of the fluidodynamic behaviour of angiographic contrast agents. The method enables measurement of the spatial distribution and time dependence of the contrast agent along a pseudo-vessel on images obtained with an X-ray image intensifier. Material and methods. A particular phantom was devised consisting of a plexiglas box with an insert into which a <b>latex</b> <b>tube</b> with a 0. 4 cm in diameter was placed in order to simulate the tortuous flow of a blood vessel. The box, which is filled with water to simulate the thickness of a normal patient, is connected to an injection and pumping system which serve to keep the contrast agent flowing in the pseudo-vessel tube. The pseudo-vessel tube was filled with plain water in one case and with saline solution in another case to assess their different dilution capabilities. The phantom and the flow of contrast agent were imaged with a conventional X-ray image intensifier system and the images were stored in digital format during 35 second acquisitions at a speed of 4 frames per second; for any frame it is possible to measure the mathematical contrast in any position in the image. Further, a diagram showing the time dependence of the spatial distribution of the mathematical contrast is proposed. The X axis shows the spatial distribution of the mathematical contrast, whereas the Y axis shows its temporal variation with a gray level proportional to the mathematical contrast value. By building an horizontal profile of this diagram one can obtain the spatial distribution at a fixed time, while by building a vertical profile one can obtain the temporal variation at a fixed point. Several different contrast agents were so tested. Results. The proposed method allows different fluidodynamic behaviour patterns of contrast agents and flowing media to be shown. Owing to the different chemical characteristics of water and saline solution these media have different dilution capabilities (higher for water) and this is well demonstrated by the diagram profiles obtained for each. The system has also allowed the detection of a particular behaviour of some contrast agents, whose spatial distribution was non uniform even in the last frames, thus showing a tendency to maintain their bolus-nature over time. An interesting feature which can be noticed in all the temporal profiles is the presence of a "prebolus", i. e. the contrast is higher {{at the very beginning of}} the flow, then decreases and after some time starts to increase again. Though the initial contrast value obviously depends on the iodine concentration employed, the method shows the contrast variation as a function of time is different for different contrast agents. Conclusions. The method and the equipment proposed provide a good description of the fluidodynamic behaviour of different contrast agents, but do not constitute a reference method for testing haemodynamic behaviour which, "in vivo", is obviously affected by several other chemical and metabolic factors. However, the method allows evaluation of the contrast agents from a physical and fluidodynamic point of view, showing that the iodine content is not the only feature affecting their behaviour.

The high speed CCD camera and digital image processing system were used to measure the 3 D shape of the inflated cylindrical tube. The localized bulge of a cylindrical tube with closed ends forms when the internal pressure reaches a critical value Pcr. As more air is filled into the tube, the pressure drops but the radius at the centre of the bulge will increase until it reaches a maximum value r max. With continued inflation, the pressure stays at a constant value Pp. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the critical and propagation pressures in the tubes and the profile outside when the shells under axial tension and internal pressure were inflating. We focus on the influence of the axial tension on the critical pressure. In this paper the problem is explored through experimental efforts. A series of experiments were conducted on commercially available natural rubber <b>latex</b> <b>tubes</b> involving different geometries and initial axial tensions, which were regarded as isotropic, homogeneous, incompressible and hyper-elastic materials...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the genera of the tribe Moreae with urticaceous stamens, viz. Broussonetia, Madura s. l. (including Cardiogyne, Chlorophora, and Cudrania), Malaisia, Milicia, Morus, Olmedia, Pachytrophe, Plecospermum, Sloetiopsis, Streblus s. l. (including Paratrophis, Phyllochlamys, Pseudostreblus, and Sloetia), and Trophis s. l. (including Calpidochlamys and Maillardia), is {{described}} in detail. Separate descriptions have been made for sections and/or subgenera to facilitate the discussion about the generic delimitations made by several taxonomists. The following generic combinations previously proposed by taxonomists are supported by wood anatomical features: Broussonetia + Allaeanthus: Maclura + Chlorophora + Cardiogyne + Cudrania + Plecospermum. The segregation of the African species of Chlorophora in a separate genus Milicia is supported by wood anatomical evidence. The broad genus concept of Streblus and Trophis is not supported by wood anatomy. Several sections of these genera should be reinstated as genera. The correlations between wood anatomy, latitude, habit and habitat are discussed as far as allowed by the material studied. Characters useful for the delimitation of the genera {{proved to be the}} size of the intervascular pits, the parenchyma distribution, and the lengths of fibres and vessel elements. Rhombic crystals, vitreous silica and radial <b>latex</b> <b>tubes</b> usually are useful additional characters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — It is well {{accepted}} that wave speed {{is one of}} the key factors describing wave propagation in arteries [1]. Local wave speed is directly related to the mechanical properties of the arterial wall [2] and is widely used to determine the arterial distensibility [3]. Several methods have been proposed for determining wave speed in arteries, such as foot-to-foot and PU-loop methods. In this paper, we suggest a new method for the determination of wave speed and wall distensibility, using noninvasive measurements. The theoretical foundation of this method is based on the 1 -D conservation of mass and momentum equations of flow in flexible tubes. We simultaneously measured pressure, diameter and velocity at the same site, sequentially along silicon and <b>latex</b> <b>tubes</b> which are 1 m in length and of different diameters. We compared the results of the new method, ln(D) U-loop, with those determined by the PU-loop method. Wave speeds determined by both methods are comparable, although wave speeds determined by the new technique are slightly smaller than those determined by PU-loop method. We also compared distensibility calculated by the new method with those calculated using the traditional method (D t), D t=dP/AdA, where A and dA are the cross sectional area and its change respectively, and dP is the change in pressure. The results of both methods are in agreement. We conclude that the new technique has the advantage of using only noninvasive parameters which is of clinical relevance. A I...|$|R
