5|$|On September 4, 1980, {{the newly}} proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iran {{replaced}} the Red <b>Lion</b> <b>and</b> Sun with the Red Crescent, consistent with most other Muslim nations.

5|$|The {{use of the}} <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> sun symbol in a flag {{is first}} attested in a {{miniature}} painting illustrating a copy of Shahnameh Shams al-Din Kashani, an epic on Mongol conquest, dated 1423.

The pole is tipped with a crescent moon. By {{the time of the}} Safavids (1501–1722), and the subsequent unification of Iran as a single state, the <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> sun had become a familiar sign, appearing on copper coins, on banners, and on works of art. The <b>Lion</b> <b>and</b> Sun motif was also used on banners of the Mughals of India, notably those of Shah Jahan.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} the leopard. However, DNA evidence is inconclusive and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the <b>lion</b> <b>and</b> the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E

She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. <b>Lion</b> <b>and</b> Princess Royal, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. When the High Seas Fleet sailed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 to be interned, Lion was among the escorting ships.
