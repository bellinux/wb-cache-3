40|$|Abstract- The paper {{describes}} a soft computing agent approach to <b>remote</b> <b>learning,</b> which {{is applied to}} disabled people suffering from dyslexia. Dyslexia is defined as learning disability by four psychologically obtained factors that present grade of learning deficiency. They are preliminary provided for better understanding and formalization of <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> process applied to disable people. The paper discusses selection of appropriate groups for definition of individual <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> purposes. Soft computing agents are used to perform two tasks: optimal partitioning of distributed data bases in accordance with a grade of disability, and coordination in distributed environment for remote group definition. The first task is realized via two-level hierarchical fuzzy system for optimization of dyslectic parameters. The second is achieved by means of mobile intelligent agents for transmission, coordination, activation, and receiving decisions from/to <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> nodes. As a final decision the node soliciting optimal group choice obtains information for the group distribution over the whole system.

40|$|Abstract. Bidirectional {{recurrent}} neural network(BRNN) is a noncausal {{system that}} captures both {{upstream and downstream}} information for protein secondary structure prediction. Due {{to the problem of}} vanishing gradients, the BRNN can not <b>learn</b> <b>remote</b> information efficiently. To limit this problem, we propose segmented memory recurrent neural network(SMRNN) and use SMRNNs to replace the standard RNNs in BRNN. The resulting architecture is called bidirectional segmented-memory recurrent neural network(BSMRNN). Our experiment with BSMRNN for protein secondary structure prediction on the RS 126 set indicates improvement in the prediction accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Remote</b> <b>learning</b> {{has been}} an {{increasingly}} growing field {{in the last two}} decades. The Internet development, as well as the increase in PC's capabilities and bandwidth capacity, has made <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> through the internet a convenient learning preference, leading to a variety of new interfaces and methods. In this work, we consider a <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> interface, developed in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Laboratory, and evaluate the contribution of different interface components to the overall performance and learning ability of end users. The evaluated components are the control method of the robotic arm and the use of a three-dimensional simulation tool before and during the execution of a robotic task. An experiment is designed and executed, comparing alternative interface designs for <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> of robotic operation. A Teleoperation task was given to 120 engineering students through five semesters. The number of steps required for completing the task, the number of errors during the execution and the improvement rate during the execution were measured and analyzed. The results provide guidelines for a better design of an interface for <b>remote</b> <b>learning</b> of robotic operation. The main contribution of this paper is in the introduction of a new teaching tool for laboratories and the supplied guidelines for an efficient design of such tools...|$|R

40|$|This work aims {{to develop}} a smart LED {{lighting}} system, which is remotely controlled by Android apps via handheld devices, e. g., smartphones, tablets, and so forth. The status of energy use is reflected by readings displayed on a handheld device, and it is treated as a criterion in the lighting mode design of a system. A multimeter, a wireless light dimmer, an IR <b>learning</b> <b>remote</b> module, etc. are connected to a server by means of RS 232 / 485 and a human computer interface on a touch screen. The wireless data communication is designed to operate {{in compliance with the}} ZigBee standard, and signal processing on sensed data is made through a self adaptive weighted data fusion algorithm. A low variation in data fusion together with a high stability is experimentally demonstrated in this work. The wireless light dimmer as well as the IR <b>learning</b> <b>remote</b> module can be instructed directly by command given on the human computer interface, and the reading on a multimeter can be displayed thereon via the server. This proposed smart LED lighting system can be remotely controlled and self learning mode can be enabled by a single handheld device via WiFi transmission.

40|$|Spikes are an {{important}} part of information transmission between neurons in the biological brain. Biological evidence shows that information is carried in the timing of individual action potentials, rather than only the firing rate. Spiking neural networks are devised to capture more biological characteristics of the brain to construct more powerful intelligent systems. In this paper, we extend our newly proposed supervised learning algorithm called DL-ReSuMe (Delay <b>learning</b> <b>Remote</b> Supervised Method) to train multiple neurons to classify spatiotemporal spiking patterns. In this method, several neurons instead of a single neuron are trained to perform the classification task. The simulation results show that a population of neurons has significantly higher processing ability compared to a single neuron. It is also shown that the performance of Multi-DL-ReSuMe (Multiple DL-ReSuMe) is increased when the number of desired spikes is increased in the desired spike trains to an appropriate number...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Practical {{sessions}} are {{the backbone of}} qualification in engineering education. It leads {{to a better understanding}} and allows mastering scientific concepts and theories. The lack of the availability of practical sessions at many universities and institutions owing to the cost and the unavailability of instructors the most of the time caused a significant decline in experimentation in engineering education over the last decades. Recently, with the progress of computer-based <b>learning,</b> <b>remote</b> laboratories have been proven to be the best alternative to the traditional ones, regarding to its low cost and ubiquity. Some universities have already started to deploy remote labs in their practical sessions. This contribution compiles diverse experiences based on the deployment of the remote laboratory, Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR), on the practices of undergraduate engineering grades at various universities within the VISIR community. It aims to show the impact of its usage on engineering education concerning the assessments of students and teachers as well...|$|E
40|$|Many {{practices}} {{aimed at}} cultivating multicultural competence in educational and organizational settings (e. g., exchange programs, diversity education in college, diversity management at work) assume that multicultural experience fosters creativity. In line with this assumption, the research {{reported in this}} article is the first to empirically demonstrate that exposure to multiple cultures in and of itself can enhance creativity. Overall, the authors found that extensiveness of multicultural experiences was positively related to both creative performance (insight <b>learning,</b> <b>remote</b> association, and idea generation) and creativity-supporting cognitive processes (retrieval of unconventional knowledge, recruitment of ideas from unfamiliar cultures for creative idea expansion). Furthermore, their studies showed that the serendipitous creative benefits resulting from multicultural experiences may depend {{on the extent to which}} individuals open themselves to foreign cultures, and that creativity is facilitated in contexts that deemphasize the need for firm answers or existential concerns.
