500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{extremely}} {{pleased with the}} call back to the teapot and Jim's note from [...] "Christmas Party".

6000|$|... "You'd better <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> your offer is, and lave my sisther alone. It doesn't do {{to bring}} every old woman's story in, when we're talking business; so, if you plaze, we won't {{calculate}} on Feemy's marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless I am entirely mistaken, madam, {{the end of}} the {{proceedings}} in your house is at hand. You will damage your own interests by interfering. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we are about at last. Let the end come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, 'tis their {{advantage}} over the pampered and idle. Look at the heavens, man, and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> thou thinkest of their appearance. Is there the stuff in thy Winkelried to ride out a storm like this {{we may have to}} encounter?" ...|$|E

40|$|Editor’s note: We {{kick off}} the new {{academic}} year with thanks to Ron Mason, CCSN’s Art Director, and colleagues for an updated masthead and with continued gratitude for the unseen and unsung heroes in Printing Services and the Mail Center who have ensured a timely, quality product during the past ten years. This issue focuses on information that we hope will help all adult educators in Nevada plan for 2004 - 2005. It includes a list of key providers of support services, updates on Nevada’s literacy Web site, a framework for digesting research, and findings from {{a recent study of}} the immigrant population. Nevada Connections is worthwhile only if it connects(!) and is useful [...] please consider it your publication and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what’s</b> helpful, what’s not, and what you’d like to see in the future! —Sharyn Yanoshak...|$|R
60|$|Now, Mary, dear, go at once, and {{see what}} you can find out. The {{direction}} on the doctor's letter may be his home; and if it isn't, there may be people there who can tell you where it is. So go at once, and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> directly <b>what</b> luck you have had, for there is no time to be lost; and if you saw the young gentleman, you would pity him as much as we do.|$|R
50|$|Karl Rohnke {{assumed the}} Director's {{position}} after Bob left. Karl {{had been with}} PA since its start {{and in many ways}} was the most known staff member. As an author of the PA text, Cowstails and Cobras, Karl brought to the many readers of that book a real hands-on understanding of the techniques, methods, and spirit necessary to implement the Physical Education curriculum started at Hamilton-Wenham.Karl's creative abilities guided the evolution of the Ropes Course elements and the games, stunts, and initiatives that were the core of the curriculum. Karl's ability to play and have obvious fun in a workshop was invaluable modeling for the teachers and staff being trained. Karl enjoyed using these strengths and continued as Director to construct courses, lead workshops, and write up new curriculum ideas. Karl was also decisive in <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he did not like about his new role; thinking about budgets, organizational issues, and paperwork hassles. He and I agreed about a year after I started that l would assume the Director's role, and he would concentrate on what he did best, which was writing, researching new activities and ropes course elements, and leading workshops.|$|R

'Yes, Harry, it will; {{it will do}} the {{greatest}} good; whom else can I get to see him? who else can find out and <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> really is required of us, {{what we ought to}} do? I would do it myself, but I could not understand it; and he would never trust us sufficiently to tell me all the truth.' ...|$|E

The man you gave your message to had just brought it in. You should have <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> boat you were sailing by. But I mustn't keep you talking. You have just time to change your things." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{original}} oldest {{part of the}} Iliad, says Mr. Leaf, [...] "the gods show themselves just so much as to <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> are the powers which control mankind from heaven.... Their interference is such as becomes the rulers of the world, not partisans in the battle." [...] [Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, vol. ii. pp. xii., xiii.] It is the later poets of the Iliad, in Mr. Leaf's view, who introduce the meddlesome, undignified, and extremely unsportsmanlike gods. The original early poet of the Iliad had the nobler religious conceptions.|$|E

Have just returned back to camp from a 7 -day furlough. Am still somewhat weary from the long train ride, but never too weary to hear from Bryant College. The Bryant Service Club is sure doing a wonderful job + I appreciate the cigarettes you sent me for X-mas. Wish I could put into words my feeling of appreciation. I’m sure many of our boys have for higher moral because a Bryant Service Club exists. All I can say is keep up the swell work. We soldiers sure appreciate it [...] especially the letters <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> goes on at Bryant. Nick Coracci’s words go for me also. I note that some of our faculty is now serving Uncle Sam, that the courses have been changed somewhat to fit in with our war effort. Things sure do change. I enjoyed reading your letter + hope to hear again from you all very soon. As ever, Corp. Laurence Italiano P. S. Am now in the Finance Section. Payroll is our biggest job + worry.

25|$|This October 31st, {{bars and}} {{restaurants}} in the Castro will be open for business. However, {{as was the case}} last year the streets will not be closed to traffic. As in every other community in the City, there will be zero tolerance for behavior which doesn’t respect the celebrated diversity of our communities. And again like last year, there will be zero tolerance for individuals and businesses that do not obey alcohol consumption and distribution regulations. The Home For Halloween website will help promote your events so please <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> about <b>what</b> you have planned in your community.|$|R
40|$|The {{idea for}} this special {{commentary}} forum emerged {{out of a}} conversation with a number of friends and colleagues concerning {{the question of whether or}} not we were, as scholars of International Relations (IR) and International Political Economy (IPE), at all equipped to teach our students about the significance of the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movements. During this conversation, the thought emerged that OWS might be taken as a kind of cue for us to check in and think about the relevancy of our work, and our relationships with the world of political activism. In becoming career academics, we had all been guided by the hope that we were doing something good for the world. As wequickly learned, however, this was not an easy or straightforward proposition – academia has its way of <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> sort of things we can and can't do if we want to be secure in our positions. As we followed the news about OWS over various networks and,where possible, ventured out to the General Assemblies – from Berlin to Dublin to New York to Columbus, OH – we felt a sense of embarrassment. For while we were busy pursuing our careers, out on the streets there were people – often including our students– who were risking so much to express their indignation [...] ...|$|R
