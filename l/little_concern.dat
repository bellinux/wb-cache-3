5|$|After {{securing}} {{control over}} the Commonwealth, Báthory {{had a chance to}} devote himself to strengthening his authority, in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski, who would soon become one of the king's most trusted advisers. Báthory reorganised the judiciary by formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, it was of <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> to Báthory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the piechota wybraniecka, an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed to modernize the Commonwealth army, reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in the Commonwealth, transforming a prior Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, {{while at the same time}} being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was Lord of Penmynydd and {{a soldier}} {{in the service of the}} English crown. He joined King Edward II of England for his {{invasion}} of Scotland in 1314 as part of the First War of Scottish Independence, which included service at the Battle of Bannockburn in June of that year. In 1316, a rebellion took place in Glamorgan under the leadership of Llywelyn Bren, at the same time Edward was campaigning in Scotland. Despite this there was <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> that it would spread to North Wales, with the royal officials instead concerned with the threat of invasion from Ireland. Some 1,500 troops were summoned from the area to support the King, and among those leading those troops were Iorweth ap Gruffudd, Gruffudd Llwyd and his cousin Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. After these troops, under the command of Gruffudd Llwyd, moved to Chester, they were dismissed on 4 August 1316 to return to North Wales in order to protect the area from the Irish threat.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> in the 1950s when inflation was stable, {{but by the}} mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E

25|$|Phosphate rocks contain {{high levels}} of fluoride. Consequently, the {{widespread}} use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils. Also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the Gutian period, or how long it endured. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' {{administration}} showed <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely, and soon brought about famine and rocketing grain prices. The Sumerian king Ur-Nammu (2112–2095 BC) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.|$|E

25|$|Though still {{a matter}} for debate, the {{indemnity}} deal has complicated the question of ultimate blame. For decades the Government and Department of Education were to blame for lack of oversight, {{various parts of the}} Catholic Church refused to reform internal systems, the police generally ignored complaints, and the courts sent small children to the institutions with <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for their rights. The 2002 deal has appeared in hindsight to be a well-intentioned but unsatisfactory attempt at a quick fix. In May 2009 CORI agreed to contribute more to the envisaged higher compensation amounts.|$|E
25|$|Operational {{amplifiers}} {{can be used}} {{in construction}} of active filters, providing high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, reject and delay functions. The high input impedance and gain of an op-amp allow straightforward calculation of element values, allowing accurate implementation of any desired filter topology with <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for the loading effects of stages in the filter or of subsequent stages. However, the frequencies at which active filters can be implemented is limited; when the behavior of the amplifiers departs significantly from the ideal behavior assumed in elementary design of the filters, filter performance is degraded.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{chemical}} hypothesis first {{emerged in}} Classical Greece {{with the theory}} of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything {{is formed as a}} combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things). Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.|$|E

25|$|Support for the LRC was {{boosted by}} the 1901 Taff Vale Case, a dispute between strikers and a railway company {{that ended with}} the union being ordered to pay £23,000 damages for a strike. The {{judgement}} effectively made strikes illegal since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the Liberal Party {{in opposition to the}} Conservative's landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for the industrial proletariat and its problems.|$|E
25|$|Before this {{landmark}} case, pre-trial involuntary {{commitment of}} incompetent individuals often meant lengthy or even lifetime confinement in a maximum security institution with <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for treatment. This was true {{even though they}} were neither tried for or convicted of a crime. In this case, the Court for the first time put limits on the length of time an incompetent person may be confined. However, the Court offers only general guidelines and by 1994, twenty years after the case, 32 states still had not enacted periodic judicial review of incompetent detainees. Many states still allowed a detention period that exceeded that maximum sentence that person would have received if convicted.|$|E
25|$|On 3 May 1661, Huygens {{observed}} the planet Mercury transit over the Sun, using the telescope of instrument maker Richard Reeve in London, together with astronomer Thomas Streete and Reeve. Streete then debated the published {{record of the}} transit of Hevelius, a controversy mediated by Henry Oldenburg. Huygens passed to Hevelius a manuscript of Jeremiah Horrocks on the transit of Venus, 1639, which thereby was printed {{for the first time}} in 1662. In that year Huygens, who played the harpsichord, took an interest in music, and Simon Stevin's theories on it; he showed very <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> to publish his theories on consonance, some of which were lost for centuries. The Royal Society of London elected him a Fellow in 1663.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} African rulers such as King Lobengula; to form banks; to own, manage and grant or distribute land, and to raise a police force (the British South Africa Police). In return, the company agreed to develop the territory it controlled, to respect existing African laws, to allow free trade within its territory and to respect all religions. Rhodes and the white settlers attracted to the company's territory set their sights for ever more mineral rights and more territorial concessions from the African peoples, establishing their own governments, and introducing laws with <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> or respect for African laws. The BSAC {{was not able to}} generate enough profit to pay its shareholders dividends until after it lost direct administrative control over Rhodesia in 1923.|$|E
25|$|The {{inadequate}} {{control of}} tuberculosis {{can be linked}} to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total health expenditure fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with <b>little</b> <b>concern</b> for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds drug-resistant tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|In July 1982, {{after the}} Falklands War fiasco brought more {{moderate}} leadership {{to the military}} dictatorship, Cavallo was appointed president of the Central Bank. He inherited the country's most acute financial and economic crisis since 1930, and a particularly heinous Central Bank regulation painfully remembered as the Central Bank Circular 1050. Implemented in 1980 {{at the behest of}} conservative Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, the policy tied adjustable loan installments (nearly all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable interest basis) to the value of the US Dollar locally. Exchange rates were controlled at the time and therefore raised <b>little</b> <b>concern.</b> The next February, however, the peso was sharply devalued and continued to plummet for the rest of 1981 and into 1982. Mortgage and business borrowers saw their monthly installments increase over tenfold in just a year and many, including homeowners just months away from paying off their loans, unable to keep up, either lost their entire equity (see, negative amortization) or everything outright.|$|E
