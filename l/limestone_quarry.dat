5|$|In 1988, Han won the Best Entry Award {{from the}} Singapore National Theatre Trust for her {{participation}} in a show entitled Basics at the National Museum Art Gallery. She was awarded a scholarship for the Portland Sculpture Park on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England, by the Arts Council of Great Britain and the National Arts Council (NAC) in 1990. Together with the installation artist S. Chandrasekaran, she helped to transform an old <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry</b> into a sculpture park, creating a work called Flow through the Rocks. In 1993 she received sponsorship from the Singapore International Foundation to attend the International Painting and Sculpture Symposium in Gulbarga (Kalburgi) in Karnataka, India, and served on the NAC's Arts Resource Panel between 1993 and 1994.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry</b> at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E

5|$|Megalosaurus {{may have}} been the first dinosaur, apart from modern birds, to be {{described}} in the scientific literature. Part of a bone was recovered from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry,</b> Oxfordshire in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description and illustration in his Natural History of Oxfordshire in 1676. It was the first illustration of a dinosaur bone published. Plot correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the thighbone or femur of a large animal and he recognized that it was too large to belong to any species known to be living in England. He therefore at first concluded it to be the thighbone of a Roman war elephant and later that of a giant human, such as those mentioned in the Bible. The bone has since been lost, but the illustration is detailed enough that some have since identified it as that of Megalosaurus.|$|E

25|$|Mosasaurs (from Latin Mosa {{meaning the}} 'Meuse river', and Greek σαύρος sauros meaning 'lizard') are an extinct group of large marine {{reptiles}} containing 38 genera in total. Their first fossil remains {{were discovered in}} a <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry</b> at Maastricht on the Meuse in 1764. Mosasaurs probably evolved from an extinct group of aquatic lizards known as aigialosaurs in the Early Cretaceous. During the last 20 million years of the Cretaceous period (Turonian-Maastrichtian ages), with the extinction of the ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, mosasaurs became the dominant marine predators. They became extinct {{as a result of}} the K-Pg event at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The first publicized {{discovery}} of a partial fossil mosasaur skull in 1764 by quarry workers in a subterranean gallery of a <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry</b> in Mount Saint Peter, near the Dutch city of Maastricht, preceded any major dinosaur fossil discoveries, but remained little known. However, a second find of a partial skull drew the Age of Enlightenment's attention {{to the existence of}} fossilized animals that were different from any known living creatures. When the specimen was discovered between 1770 and 1774, Johann Leonard Hoffmann, a surgeon and fossil collector, corresponded about it with the most influential scientists of his day, making the fossil famous. The original owner, though, was Godding, a canon of Maastricht cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Cement-making and {{the mining}} of {{limestone}} and gypsum for Portland Cement are major exports of the area. Charlevoix's Medusa Cement Plant was bought by Cemex in the 1990s.

Besser invented concrete block in 1904 and founded the Besser Block Co. in Alpena after making the concrete block making machine). USG Corporation, also known as United States Gypsum Corporation, operates several quarries, including one at Alabaster, and one in Rogers City.

25|$|For {{many years}} Bardsey Island formed {{part of the}} Newborough Estate, and between 1870 and 1875 the island's farms were rebuilt; a small <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry</b> was opened, and a lime kiln constructed. Carreg and Plas Bach are {{separate}} buildings, but the remaining eight were built as semi-detached houses, each pair with outbuildings set around a shared yard. The buildings are Grade II listed and, in 2008, Cadw approved a grant of £15,000 to cover {{the first phase of}} repairs. Only one of the original croglofft cottages, Carreg Bach, survives. Given the choice of a harbour or a new church, in 1875 the islanders asked the estate to provide a place of worship; a Methodist chapel was built.|$|E
25|$|After a {{sustained}} search across the country, in 1959 the society's attention {{was drawn to}} the then derelict <b>limestone</b> <b>quarry</b> at Crich in Derbyshire, from which members of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society were recovering track from Stephenson's mineral railway for their pioneering preservation project in Wales. After a tour of the quarry, members of the society agreed to lease – and later purchase – part of the site and buildings. Over the years, by the efforts of the society members, a representative collection of tramcars was brought together and restored, tramway equipment was acquired, a working tramway was constructed and depots and workshops were built. Recognising that tramcars did not operate in limestone quarries, the society agreed in 1967 to create around the tramway the kind of streetscape through which the trams had run and thus the concept of the Crich Tramway Village was born. Members then turned their attention to collecting items of street furniture and even complete buildings, which were then adapted to house the Museum's collections of books, photographs and archives.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 50, Shore {{moved to}} Carmel, then a small art colony and resort, {{following}} in the footsteps of Weston, who had moved their shortly before. The natural beauty of Carmel provided Shore with ample painting inspiration. During this period she exhibited locally at the Carmel Art Association, the Legion of Honor, and the de Young Museum. She also had shows in New York and Paris. Despite these shows, Shore struggled financially during the Depression and slipped into relative obscurity, just as Weston began to achieve fame. Like many artists during this time, Shore relied on government commissions for income. In 1936 she received a commission for six murals from the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts. These murals, like many WPA commissions, focus on scenes of industry and work. Shore painted four lunettes for the Santa Cruz Post Office: Fishing Industry, <b>Limestone</b> <b>Quarry</b> Industry, Artichoke industry, and Brussel Sprouts Industry. She painted Artichoke Pickers in the Old Customhouse in Monterey and Monterey Bay 1880-1910 in the Monterey Post Office. These murals are her last prominent works.|$|E
