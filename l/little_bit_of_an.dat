500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E

Both Francis and Geary {{were part of the}} supercouple pairing of Luke and Laura on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. When {{questioned}} by show host Oprah Winfrey if Francis would ever reprise the role of Laura Spencer, she revealed: [...] "I would like her to be funny and have a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agenda that might look a little bit vengeful, but it really isn’t. I think she’d have a plan. If {{there is a way to}} go forward with Laura and make her into what I'd like her to be now, then perhaps I would do it. There is nothing in me that is willing to play a victim anymore. I’m sort of done with the wounded dove in my life." ...|$|E

The −10 is {{to compete}} against the Airbus A350-900, and offer better economics than the A350 on shorter routes, according to Boeing. Steven Udvar-Hazy said [...] "If it's identically configured, the -10 has a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> edge on the -900", but smaller than Boeing's estimate of 10 percent.

She said that [...] "Murder" [...] "isn't serious, {{based on a true story}} or a threat.... It's a metaphor about a girl who can get away with murder because of who she is" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "Rule Breaker" [...] was an attempt to [...] "capture that badass feeling you get sometimes after watching a movie like True Romance. You think you can take on the world and you want to color outside the lines and get a tattoo or mouth off to someone way bigger than you." [...] She called [...] "Never Dream Alone" [...] "a sweet emotional song that has been stripped down to piano, strings and vocals" [...] and {{said that it was}} her favorite from the album. Regarding [...] "Hot Stuff", Simpson has said that it [...] "is meant to be a fun song.... A lot of things on the record are laughing at situations, poking fun at things. With that, when you go somewhere and girls give you the mean eye. You're like, 'oh, wow– this is crazy.' 'Hot Stuff' makes fun of that. That song is meant to be a good time." [...] According to Simpson, [...] "Bittersweet World" [...] is [...] "about people coming together and not judging each other". Billboard described [...] "Boys" [...] as [...] "The Cardigans' 'Lovefool' atop a Chic rhythm", while People called it [...] "the best Kylie Minogue song that Kylie never did". One review described her delivery on the song as [...] "alternately silly and sensual". [...] "Ragdoll" [...] was described by Billboard as having [...] "a 'Beat It' vibe"; Rolling Stone called it [...] "reggae-bopping" [...] and said that it [...] "swipes Gwen Stefani's formula", while the Houston Chronicle said that it [...] "features Casio-esque keyboard tinkling and driving guitars". Rolling Stone noted [...] "What I've Become" [...] as an [...] "excellent coming-of-age anthem" [...] and [...] "a paparazzi kiss-off". People praised [...] "Rule Breaker" [...] as [...] "deliciously bratty and catchy", and Billboard, in its album review, called it a [...] "Pat Benatar-like fist-pumper". [...] "No Time for Tears" [...] was described by Entertainment Weekly as a [...] "melancholy ballad". The Houston Chronicle said that [...] "Bittersweet World" [...] had [...] "the snap-and-wink of a showtune". Billboards album review characterized [...] "Murder" [...] as having a [...] "dark, hypnotic groove". In December 2008, Rolling Stone magazine named [...] "Rule Breaker" [...] as one of the 100 Best Singles of the year.|$|E

60|$|September 13th.--The {{weather was}} very {{uncertain}} {{through the last}} week, and yesterday morning, too, was misty and sunless; notwithstanding which we took the rail for Kenilworth before eleven. The distance from Leamington is less than five miles, and at the Kenilworth station we found a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> omnibus, into which we packed ourselves, together with two ladies, one of whom, at least, was an American. I begin to agree partly with the English, {{that we are not}} a people of elegant manners. At all events there is sometimes a bare, hard, meagre sort of deportment, especially in our women, that has not its parallel elsewhere. But perhaps what sets off this kind of behavior, and brings it into alto relievo, is the fact of such uncultivated persons travelling abroad, and going to see sights that would not be interesting except to people of some education and refinement.|$|E
60|$|And {{you should}} have seen the bright eyes, and heard the sensual accents! They {{recalled}} their doings with devout gusto and a sort of rational pride. Schoolboys, after their first drunkenness, are not more boastful; a cock does not plume himself with a more unmingled satisfaction as he paces forth among his harem; and yet these were grown men, and by no means short of wit. It was hard to suppose they were very eager about the Second Coming: it seemed as if some elementary notions of temperance for the men and seemliness for the women would have gone nearer the mark. And yet, as it seemed to me typical of much that is evil in Scotland, Maybole is also typical of much that is best. Some of the factories, which have taken the place of weaving in the town's economy, were originally founded and are still possessed by self-made men of the sterling, stout old breed--fellows who made some <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invention, borrowed some little pocketful of capital, and then, step by step, in courage, thrift, and industry, fought their way upward to an assured position.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the gentle}} reader, my kindest friend and closest confidant, deigns to desire it, I can impart to him my own {{experience}} as a public speaker quite as indifferently as if it concerned another person. Indeed, it does concern another, or a mere spectral phenomenon, for it was not I, in my proper and natural self, that sat there at table or subsequently rose to speak. At the moment, then, if the choice had been offered me whether the Mayor should let off a speech at my head or a pistol, I should unhesitatingly have taken the latter alternative. I had really nothing to say, not an idea in my head, nor, which {{was a great deal}} worse, any flowing words or embroidered sentences in which to dress out that empty Nothing, and give it a cunning aspect of intelligence, such as might last the poor vacuity the little time it had to live. But time pressed; the Mayor brought his remarks, affectionately eulogistic of the United States and highly complimentary to their distinguished representative at that table, to a close, amid a vast deal of cheering; and the band struck up [...] "Hail Columbia," [...] I believe, though it might have been [...] "Old Hundred," [...] or [...] "God save the Queen" [...] over again, for anything that I should have known or cared. When the music ceased, there was an intensely disagreeable instant, during which I seemed to rend away and fling off the habit of a lifetime, and rose, still void of ideas, but with preternatural composure, to make a speech. The guests rattled on the table, and cried, [...] "Hear!" [...] most vociferously, as if now, at length, in this foolish and idly garrulous world, had come the long-expected moment when one golden word was to be spoken; and in that imminent crisis, I caught a glimpse of a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effusion of international sentiment, which it might, and must, and should do to utter.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some people's {{ideas of}} economy seem to run simply {{in the line}} of eating. Their flour is of an extra brand, their meat the first cut; the delicacies of every season, in their dearest stages, come home to their table with an apologetic smile,--'It was scandalously dear, my love, but I thought we must just treat ourselves.' And yet these people cannot afford to buy books, and {{pictures}} they regard as an unthought-of extravagance. Trudging home with fifty dollars' worth of delicacies on his arm, Smith meets Jones, who is exulting with a bag of crackers under one arm and a choice <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oil painting under the other, which he thinks a bargain at fifty dollars. 'I can't afford to buy pictures,' Smith says to his spouse, 'and I don't know how Jones and his wife manage.' Jones and his wife will live on bread and milk for a month, and she will turn her best gown the third time, but they will have their picture, and they are happy. Jones's picture remains, and Smith's fifty dollars' worth of oysters and canned fruit to-morrow will be gone forever. Of all modes of spending money, the swallowing of expensive dainties brings the least return. There is one step lower than this,--the consuming of luxuries that are injurious to the health. If all the money spent on tobacco and liquors could be spent in books and pictures, I predict that nobody's health would be a whit less sound, and houses would be vastly more attractive. There is enough money spent in smoking, drinking, and over-eating to give every family in the community a good library, to hang everybody's parlor walls with lovely pictures, to set up in every house a conservatory which should bloom all winter with choice flowers, to furnish every dwelling with ample bathing and warming accommodations, even down to the dwellings of the poor; and in the millennium I believe this is the way things are to be.|$|E
