50|$|Covalent {{interactions}} {{are used to}} attach inorganic nanoparticles with various function group terminals to CNTs treated by acids. One typical example is amide bond. Because of the excellent biological compatibility of Au, they are so frequently used in biosensing, medical and other related fields. Au nanoparticles {{have been linked to}} acid treated CNTs by aminothiols, bifunctional thiols or thioether bonds. Hydrophilic metal oxides such as MnO2, MgO, TiO2 and Zr(SO4)2 can be directly attached to the carboxyl groups, averting the use and separation of <b>linking</b> <b>agent.</b> On the other hand, however, the {{interactions are}} relatively weak, and the distribution of the nanoparticles are not as uniform.|$|E
5000|$|In the arm-first (also {{known as}} the [...] "arm-in" [...] or {{convergent}} approach) method, monofunctional living polymers with known characteristics are used as precursors in the reaction. The active site {{at the end of}} their chain can be directly reacted with an appropriately reactive multifunctional polymer core (also known as a <b>linking</b> <b>agent)</b> to produce a star-shaped polymer. In this approach the resulting star-polymer consists of homogeneous chain groups. The arm-first synthesis route is arguably the most efficient synthesis of star-shaped polymers. This is because each step can be directly controlled and assessed; the arms and core can be isolated and characterized prior to a stoichiometric reaction, and the functionality of the final star-polymer can then be accurately and directly measured.|$|E
30|$|The cross <b>linking</b> <b>agents</b> {{adversely}} affect the physical properties. The adverse effect of cross <b>linking</b> <b>agents</b> {{is that they}} reduce elasticity and flexibility of cellulosic fibres after reacting with hydroxyl group of cellulose. The reduction in elasticity and flexibility of cellulosic fibres gives rise to poor abrasion resistance and tensile properties. Other disadvantages are: stiff handle, release of formaldehyde, poor light fastness, shade change after finishing and objectionable fish odour (Schindler and Hauser 2004).|$|R
30|$|To produce non-swelling, {{durable press}} or shrink {{resistance}} cellulose fabrics, {{the following two}} different chemical approaches have been used. The first approach is to block the pores of the fibres by incorporating polymeric finish. It inhibits the penetration of water. The second approach is using multifunctional cross <b>linking</b> <b>agents.</b> The multifunctional cross <b>linking</b> <b>agents</b> reacts with the hydroxyl groups of nearby cellulose molecules thereby hindering the swelling of the cellulose fibre (Shahin et al. 2009; Lacasse and Baumann 2004).|$|R

50|$|Chemoselective {{stepwise}} coupling between living polymers and a heterobifunctional <b>linking</b> <b>agent</b> is a versatile, facile, {{and efficient}} methodology for block copolymer synthesis. This protocol {{is based on}} the quantitative formation of the end-functionalized precursor in the first coupling step. The applicability range is becoming exceptionally wide upon transformation reactions, e.g., by tailoring the chain-termini reactivity via endcapping. This novel protocol considerably expands the limits of sequential monomer addition, rendering viable the construction of advanced and tailor-made materials via an effortless pathway.Moreover, this strategy, enables synthesis of linear block copolymer structures that are not accessible via sequential monomer addition. Even for common A-b-B structures, sequential block copolymerization gives access to well definedblock copolymers only if the crossover reaction rate constant is significantly higher than the rate constant of the homopolymerizationof the second monomer, i.e., kAA >> kBB.|$|E

Ca+ 2 cross linked beads showed sustained release of drug for about 8 hr while Al+ 3 cross linked beads shown sustained release of drug about 10 hrs. The entrapment efficiency was also lesser in case of Ca+ 2 cross linked beads. The alginate beads swelled and eventually disintegrated in phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8).

40|$|F-actin is {{the major}} {{constituent}} of the cell cytoskeleton. Inside living cells, the F-actin cytoskeleton can exist in different morphological states. The careful control of the cytoskeletal morphology is vital to many cellular processes, such as cell locomotion and cell division. One way to control the morphology is by changing the concentration of <b>linking</b> <b>agents,</b> such as actin binding proteins (ABP) or oppositely-charged multivalent ions. In vitro experiments have shown that F-actin self-assembles into networks or bundles {{in the presence of}} such <b>linking</b> <b>agents.</b> To understand this type of self-assembly process, we systematically study the complexation of F-actin by multivalent ions using computer simulation. Another way to control the morphology is by controlling the growth kinetics of F-actin using various regulatory proteins. To study this dynamical self-assembly, we focus on a particular set of regulatory process that is vital for cell motility called dendritic nucleation. We develop both analytic model and simulation model for the dendritic nucleation processes and we explain how motility can arise. ...|$|R

All the films were evaluated for thickness, folding endurance, and tensile strength. The thickness of all the films was uniform as the concentration of polymer was kept constant. The folding endurance suggested good flexibility of the films as propylene glycol was used as a plasticizer. The water vapour penetration suggested that films prepared without cross linker absorbs more moisture as compared to films containing cross <b>linking</b> <b>agent.</b> All the films subjected to tensile strength and in-vitro bio adhesion.
