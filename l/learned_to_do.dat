Somehow they really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a physical process.|$|E

This opinion has had much truth and fact to justify it, but it has been undergoing a marked transformation in the past decade. For men are coming to realize that, although no one can <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a thing by merely being told how it is done, such precious knowledge greatly facilitates his <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it when once he gets into practical work.

My only way to check unemployment {{was to go to}} work - it beat hunger quite a bit, even if the work is out of one's line. So I cooked, trapped, freighted, wrangled dudes, trained horses, lambed sheep - just anything there was to do. I <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> lots of things, but some of the things aren't of much use to me now - for example, how to put a six- or eight-horse team around a sharp bend. But some are real useful. What you learn from horses helps in dealing with humans. A horse is good for a boy or a man. It helps something inside of him. A man trained by a horse for many years is never quite the same afterward, and is better.|$|E
