2500|$|In June 2004, Valve Software {{announced}} {{in a press}} release that the FBI had arrested several people suspected {{of involvement in the}} source code <b>leak.</b> <b>Valve</b> claimed the game had been leaked by a German black-hat hacker named Axel [...] "Ago" [...] Gembe. After the leak, Gembe had contacted Newell through e-mail (also providing an unreleased document planning the E3 events). Newell kept corresponding with Gembe, and Gembe was led into believing that Valve wanted to employ him as an in-house security auditor. He was to be offered a flight to the USA and was to be arrested on arrival by the FBI. When the German government became aware of the plan, Gembe was arrested in Germany instead, and put on trial for the leak as well as other computer crimes in November 2006, such as the creation of Agobot, a highly successful trojan which harvested users' data.|$|E

Tests were conducted to gain a 'hands on' understanding of their operation, and evaluate the controllers and power supplies needed for their operation. The test chamber consisted of a 270 liter/sec ion pump, two ion gauges, a variable <b>leak</b> <b>valve</b> and a 8 -inch TSP chamber. The vacuum in the chamber was maintained at 10 {sup - 7 } TORR, during tests, by opening the variable <b>leak</b> <b>valve,</b> using dry N{sub 2 } as an inlet gas. This was done in order to achieve a pressure where changes in chamber pressure, due to pumping of TSP, could be observed. Pressure and filament current data were chart recorded.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to monitor valve {{condition}} monitoring by using acoustic emission technique. Two conditions were considered in this study which are good condition valve and <b>leak</b> <b>valve.</b> There are two objective of the study which is to detect acoustic emission parameter {{and to develop a}} classification method to monitor valve condition by using acoustic emission technique. The study is accomplished by analyzing the parameter hits and average rms. A hydraulic bench was used to provide water to the test rig. The first experiment is to monitor good valve condition. It is done by analyze the hits and rms collected for every rotation of the wheel handle. Then, the graph of hits plotted is compared between the graphs plotted by Hafizi (2008) to see the different characteristic of different valve. The second experiment is to monitor the <b>leak</b> <b>valve.</b> Two different valves were used in the second experiment which are gate valve and check valve. Sand and then screw was put in the valve as to make the valve leak. Then, the parameter hits and rms is measured to analyze the different between good condition valve and <b>leak</b> <b>valve.</b> The results show that there is acoustic emission activity occur when there is leak in the valve and the activity can be detected by using the acoustic emission sensor. It is also prove that the different leak will emit different acoustic emission energy...|$|E

40|$|Louvain-la-Neuve's ECRIS Octopus {{has been}} used intensively both by nuclear and atomic {{physicists}} since it became operational in September 1985. So much so that very little time was left for improvements. There have however been several developments worth mentioning: the 18 cm-bore octupolar structure {{has been replaced by}} a 24 cm-bore, 12 bars hexapole in order to increase the plasma volume while testing the effects of a lower multipole number with a larger bore. A recurrent water leak problem related to the plasma overheating of an o-ring has been solved by adding a water-cooled copper shield in the second stage. This problem pointed out some weakness in one of the magnet bars. A sapphire sealed variable <b>leak</b> <b>valve</b> has been installed on the second stage to run rare gaseous isotopes.

40|$|Gescribed are beam profile {{monitors}} {{designed for}} the proton accelerators of the HERA project, namely, the 7 GeV DESY III, the 40 GeV PETRA II and the 820 GeV HERA P machines. Utilizing residual gas ionization (as {{has been used in}} many proton accelerators [l- 7]), all profile monitors are of a similar basic design offering three main features: 1) "separated function " design, 2) optical sensing of the proton beam image, and 3) selectable modes of operation. The "separated function " feature allows the most critical components to be outside the vacuum. Optical sensing provides a wide field of view with good spatial resolution and allows multiple, simultaneousl but independent readout systems, such as a television camera, a linear array of photodiodes and an image dissector. Remotely selectable modes of use allow the beam profile to be derived from ionized electrons, ions, or both. The proton beam imaging component may be optionally operated with a magnetic field to increase the resolution. Sensitivity of the system can be increased by the use of an external image intensifier or by increasing the internal partial pressure of the monitor by a remotely controlled <b>leak</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The goal of {{this thesis}} study is to develop an {{activated}} reactive evaporation (ARE) system and to demonstrate its utility by fabricating-alternating current thin-film electroluminescent (ACTFEL) oxide phosphor devices. ARE entails evaporation in an activated gas. The main ARE system components are three thermal evaporation sources, a microwave power supply, an electron cyclotron resonance plasma (ECR) source, a substrate heater/controller, a film thickness monitor, and a <b>leak</b> <b>valve</b> for gas flow control. Ga₂ 0 ₃:Eu ACTFEL devices are fabricated using the ARE system. The maximum Ga₂O: deposition rate is approximately 2 nm/s. As-deposited films are transparent, insulating, and amorphous with an index of refraction of 1. 68 and an optical bandgap of 4. 25 - 4. 9 eV. Ga₂O₃ films are typically amorphous until annealed above 1000 °C in a furnace or by rapid thermal annealing. However, when hydrothermal annealing is employed, Ga₂O₃ films crystalize at temperatures as low as 450 °C. Electrical and optical characterization indicates that the Ga₂O₃:Eu ACTFEL devices have very little charge transfer and emit very dim, orange-red electroluminescence with an emission peak of about 615 nm...|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufactured}} components have {{a different}} metallurgic structure and {{are more prone to}} fatigue cracks than conventionally produced metals. In earlier papers, an effective Structural Health Monitoring solution was presented to detect fatigue cracks in additive manufactured components. Small subsurface capillaries are embedded in the structure and pressurized (vacuum or overpressure). A crack that initiated at the component’s surface will propagate towards the capillary and finally breach it. One capillary suffices to inspect a large area of the component, which makes it interesting to locate the crack {{on the basis of the}} pressure measurements. Negative pressure waves (NPW) arise from the abrupt encounter of high pressure fluid with low pressure fluid and can serve as a basis to locate the crack. A test set-up with a controllable <b>leak</b> <b>valve</b> was built to investigate the feasibility of using NPW to localize a leak in closed tubes with small lengths. Reflections are expected to occur at the ends of the tube, possibly limiting the localization accuracy. In this paper, the results of the tests on the test set-up are reported. It will be shown that the crack could be localized with high accuracy (millimeter accuracy) which proves the concept of crack localization on basis of NPW in a closed tube of small length...|$|E
30|$|To {{understand}} this discrepancy, {{one has to}} consider that the ions are laser cooled during the reaction. Thus, part of the Ca + ions are in electronically excited states from where they can react with different rates than from the ground state [9, 15, 16, 36]. To determine the ground-state reaction rate, we repeated the experiment by blocking the 397 nm laser during the reaction to only have Ca + ions in the electronic ground state. To stop the reaction, we closed the <b>leak</b> <b>valve</b> and unblocked the 397 nm laser again to recrystallize the Coulomb crystal prior to its ejection into the TOF spectrometer. From this experiment, we determined a second order rate constant for the reaction of Ca + with N 2 O of 5.49 (32)· 10 − 11 cm 3 s− 1 which agrees with the value reported by Spears and Fehsenfeld [33] but is a factor of 2.4 to 2.9 lower than the values reported by Plane et al. and Lavrov et al. [32, 34]. It should be emphasized, however, {{that because of the}} slight temperature dependence of this reaction and the non-thermal conditions prevailing in our experiment (the ions are not in thermal equilibrium because of their micromotion [6]), the comparison of our rate constant with the room-temperature values from the literature can only be approximate.|$|E
