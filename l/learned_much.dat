5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock {{enrolled}} in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed {{playing the role of}} a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those with}} whom Vaughan Williams became {{friendly}} at Cambridge were the philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the musician Hugh Allen. He felt intellectually overshadowed by some of his companions, but he <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> from them and formed lifelong friendships with several. Among the women with whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher, the daughter of Herbert Fisher, {{an old friend of}} the Vaughan Williams family. She and Vaughan Williams grew close, and in June 1897, after he had left Cambridge, they became engaged to be married.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|While {{considering}} {{the character of}} Chang, absent since The Blue Lotus, Hergé thought of his artistic Chinese friend Zhang Chongren, whom {{he had not seen}} since the days of their friendship over twenty years earlier. Hergé and Zhang used to spend every Sunday together, during which Hergé <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> about Chinese culture for his work on The Blue Lotus. Later, Zhang moved back to his homeland and Hergé lost contact with his friend after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. Hergé felt Chang and Tintin must be reunited, just as he hoped to see his friend again some day.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2010, Patti Smith {{received}} an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute, along with architect Daniel Libeskind, MoMA director Glenn Lowry, former NYC Landmarks Commissioner Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and director Steven Soderbergh. Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and sang/played two songs accompanied by long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 {{when she moved}} to New York City (Brooklyn), {{she would never have}} been accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends (including Mapplethorpe) were students at Pratt and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar Ray {{died when}} Satyajit was barely three, {{and the family}} survived on Suprabha Ray's meager income. Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School, Calcutta, and {{completed}} his BA in economics at Presidency College, Calcutta then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, though his interest was always in fine arts. In 1940, his mother insisted that he study at the Visva-Bharati University at Santiniketan, founded by Rabindranath Tagore. Ray was reluctant due to his love of Calcutta, and the low opinion of the intellectual life at Santiniketan His mother's persuasion and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to try. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. He later admitted that he <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> from the famous painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee. Later he produced a documentary film, The Inner Eye, about Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta stimulated his admiration for Indian art.|$|E
40|$|Every {{writer is}} a reader, every reader a writer" says Jay Rosen. This {{statement}} strongly suggests {{the relationship between}} reading and writing. Reading and writing are interdependent. There {{is a kind of}} symbiosis between them. Reading and writing are personal and social activities and are driven by a need to communicate. Reading and writing are reciprocal processes. Writers can <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> about writing by reading, likewise, readers can <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> about reading by writing...|$|R

5|$|The {{next time}} he took arms was in 1623, when his brother Paweł {{received}} a nomination as a rotmistrz of light (cossack) cavalry of the regular army (wojsko kwarciane), and recruited some of his siblings, including Stefan, into his unit. They served under hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski in the campaigns against the Tatars in 1624 (participating {{in the battle of}} Martynów). In 1625 they took part in the quelling of a Cossack Zhmaylo Uprising. He fought later against Gustavus Adolphus (1626–1629) (part of the Polish–Swedish War). His light cavalry was used in reconnaissance, diversion, and raiding the enemy territory. In 1627 Stefan, serving in his brother's chorągiew, was promoted to chorąży. On 6–7 August that year he participated in the battle of Tczew, where Gustavus Adolphus was nearly killed. During those years, he <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> from observing a mastery of military arts, hetman Koniecpolski, who often commanded the Polish army in which he served, and from Poland's Swedish opponents, and earlier from the Cossacks and Tatars they fought.|$|E
5|$|When {{seeking to}} explain this change in the {{complexity}} and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the Crusades. It seemed that the Crusaders had <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture. There were legends {{such as that of}} Lalys– an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castles in the south of the country– and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. In the mid-20thcentury this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, {{and in the case of}} James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwards, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096–1099), rather than nearly 100years later. Remains of Roman structures in Western Europe were still standing in many places, some of which had flanking round-towers and entrances between two flanking towers.|$|E

25|$|Eöl, the Dark Elf, was a Sinda and lord of {{the forest}} of Nan Elmoth, a fief, {{north-east}} of Doriath. Even before he encountered the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains in Eriador, he had close relationships with other Dwarves, whom he met (and <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> forging skills from) along his travel through Middle-earth. When he entered the lands of Beleriand, the Sindar from Doriath recognised Eöl's kinship, and accepted him fairly quickly among the high court of Menegroth, due to his skills.|$|E

On {{the last day of}} the 2004 World Championships, Christiansen set a long-term goal of qualifying for the 2014 Winter Olympics. In 2008, Christiansen entered the Norwegian College of Elite Sport in Geilo.|$|E
25|$|Both in his {{lifetime}} and afterwards, Parry's reputation and critical standing have varied. His academic duties were considerable, and prevented him from devoting all his energies to composition, but some contemporaries such as Charles Villiers Stanford rated him as the finest English composer since Henry Purcell; others, such as Frederick Delius, did not. Parry's influence on later composers, by contrast, is widely recognised. Edward Elgar <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> of his craft from Parry's articles in Grove's Dictionary, and among those who studied under Parry at the Royal College were Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Frank Bridge and John Ireland.|$|E
25|$|As the Istari were Maiar, {{each one}} served a Vala in some way. Saruman was the servant and helper of Aulë, and so <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> {{in the art}} of craftsmanship, mechanics, and metal-working, as was seen in the later Third Age. Gandalf was the servant of Manwë or Varda, but was a lover of the Gardens of Lórien, and so knew much of the hopes and dreams of Men and Elves. Radagast, servant of Yavanna, loved the things of nature, both Kelvar and Olvar. As each of these Istari learned from their Vala, so they acted in Middle-earth.|$|E

Van Gaal saw that his number two had the promise {{to be more than}} a skilled assistant. He let Mourinho develop his own independent coaching style and entrusted him with the coaching duties of Barcelona B. Van Gaal also let Mourinho take charge of the first team (acting as Mourinho's assistant himself) for certain trophies, like the Copa Catalunya, which Mourinho won in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E
25|$|Crisp {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} to Griffith for several years and <b>learned</b> <b>much</b> during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was Little Country Mouse, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out a dozen or more films in a single year at this time. Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably The Navigator (1924) with Buster Keaton and Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
