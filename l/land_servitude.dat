6000|$|Starting on the {{assumption}} that society is at present in a state of flux, Mr. Ghent sees it rapidly crystallizing into a status which can best be described as something in the nature of a benevolent feudalism. He laughs to scorn any immediate realization of the Marxian dream, while Tolstoyan utopias and Kropotkinian communistic unions of shop and farm are too wild to merit consideration. The coming status which Mr. Ghent depicts is a class domination by the capitalists. Labor will take its definite place as a dependent class, living in a condition of machine servitude fairly analogous to the <b>land</b> <b>servitude</b> of the Middle Ages. That is to say, labor will be bound to the machine, though less harshly, in fashion somewhat similar to that in which the earlier serf was bound to the soil. As he says, [...] "Bondage to the land was the basis of villeinage in the old regime; bondage to the job will be the basis of villeinage in the new." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1546, {{the pastor}} and the “church jurymen” (actually parochial assistants) at Breitenbach yielded their <b>land</b> <b>servitude</b> and income sources at Dunzweiler, {{which they had}} bought from Gentersberg and for which their church no longer had any use, for a yearly beneﬁt of ﬁve Gulden, in perpetuity, to Duke Wolfgang and his heirs. The Peace of Westphalia, a series of peace {{treaties}} signed between May and October 1648 in Osnabrück and Münster, which brought the Thirty Years' War to an end, guaranteed the free practice of religion, and in the late 17th century, this law was also operative in Breitenbach, where {{it is likely that}} once again Lutherans, and certain that Catholics were among the newcomers who came to settle in the village. For a time, the various denominations within the duchy were being promoted at the same time by three authorities, Calvinism by Friederike Charlotte, who had then taken over the governmental dealings, Lutheranism by the Swedes, whose kings never laid eyes on their Zweibrücken holdings, and Catholicism by the French occupational forces. If it seemed an unlikely thing to happen that many newcomers settled in Breitenbach and also that a Catholic parish was once again founded in 1687, then without a doubt, these events could be traced back to French initiatives. Forthwith, French names began cropping up in the Catholic church books, as if to underscore this development. After 1687, the church was held by a simultaneum, and both Protestant and Catholic services were held there. This old church was thoroughly renovated in the Baroque style between 1783 and 1787 to plans by Zweibrücken master builder Friedrich Wahl, whose work preserved, at least fundamentally, the quire tower. The Catholic parish, to which for a time the Catholics of Höchen, Fürth im Ostertal, Dörrenbach, Dunzweiler and Lautenbach also belonged, built its own church about the turn of the 20th century in the Gothic Revival style. The simultaneum thereby came to an end, and the mediaeval church once more served only the Protestants. Today, the Evangelical parish of Breitenbach with a branch at Höchen belongs to the Evangelical deaconry of Homburg of the Pfälzische Landeskirche (“Palatine State Church”), and the Catholic parish of Breitenbach belongs to the Catholic deaconry of Homburg of the Diocese of Trier.|$|E
40|$|The present diploma thesis {{studies the}} topic of <b>landed</b> <b>servitude,</b> which {{represents}} one of the forms of restriction of real estate ownership rights. <b>Landed</b> <b>servitudes</b> form part of the real property rights, in particular of the rights in rem to another person's property. This legal institute dates back to Roman law when, like today, it represented a restriction of real estate ownership rights of one property in benefit of a better use of another property. The base of the <b>landed</b> <b>servitudes</b> is twofold: first, there is real estate for whose benefit the servitude is established (the dominant land) and a real estate burdened by an easment for another property (the servient <b>land).</b> Second, the <b>servitudes</b> limit the property rights of one real estate (the servient land) {{for the benefit of the}} owner of the other property (of the dominant land). The institute of servitude is compared between two legislations: Czech, covered by law nž 89 / 2012, and French, contained in the Frech civil code, Code civil.

40|$|Washington {{courts are}} free to enforce publicland use servitudes. Of the {{elements}} required for a servitude to run with the land, form, notice, and touch and concern on the burden side do not bar running. Only the touch and concern element applied on the benefit side is a potential bar. Washington conceivably could allow public <b>land</b> use <b>servitudes</b> to run with the land by following the minority position of not requiring touch and concern on the benefit side. A less stringent theory, however, is available to enforce public <b>land</b> use <b>servitudes.</b> Washington has not adopted a rule that public servitudes are always in gross when government does not directly own benefited land. Therefore, the courts {{are free to}} require touch and concern on the benefit side while recognizing that the requirement is met when the promise benefits land, regardless of ownership. Based on their past record, Washington courts probably will enforce public <b>land</b> use <b>servitudes.</b> The courts have recognized and responded {{to the need for}} land use control to manage growth and development in the state, thereby furthering both public zoning and private subdivision regulation. Accordingly, to be consistent, the courts must enforce public <b>land</b> use <b>servitudes...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1378, Hugh's {{father died}} abruptly, and in 1379, {{he began his}} own career. When he was about 16, he became an esquire to John of Gaunt. He served Gaunt for about 12 years, and {{switched}} his services to the English Queen, Anne of Bohemia. They became very close, and Anne granted him numerous plots of <b>land</b> for his <b>servitude</b> and good nature, which boosted his social standing among the English nobility. Hugh again switched his services, this time to his cousin, Richard II. Hugh soon became the bearer of numerous titles, like Constable of Leed's Castle (1393-1399), and Keeper of her Forest of Gillingham in 1399.|$|R
5000|$|The Guardia Civil {{was also}} given the {{political}} task of restoring and maintain <b>land</b> ownership and <b>servitude</b> among the peasantry of Spain by the king, who desired {{to stop the}} spread of anti-monarchist movements inspired by the French revolution. The end of the First Carlist War had left the Spanish landscape scarred by the destruction of civil war, and the government was forced to take drastic action to suppress spontaneous revolts by a restive peasantry. Based on the model of light infantry used by Napoleon in his European campaigns, the Guardia Civil was transformed into a paramilitary force of high mobility that could be deployed irrespective of inhospitable conditions, able to patrol and pacify large areas of the countryside. Its members, called 'guardias', maintain to this day a basic patrol unit formed by two agents, usually called a [...] "pareja" [...] (a pair), in which one of the 'guardias' will initiate the intervention while the second 'guardia' serves as a backup to the first.|$|R
5|$|The 12th century {{also saw}} a concerted attempt to curtail the {{remaining}} rights of unfree peasant workers and to set out their labour rents more explicitly {{in the form of}} the English Common Law. This process resulted in the Magna Carta explicitly authorising feudal landowners to settle law cases concerning feudal labour and fines through their own manorial courts rather than through the royal courts. These class relationships between lords and unfree peasants had complex economic implications. Peasant workers resented being unfree, but having continuing access to agricultural land was also important. Under those rare circumstances where peasants were offered a choice between freedom but no <b>land,</b> and continued <b>servitude,</b> not all chose freedom and a minority chose to remain in <b>servitude</b> on the <b>land.</b> Lords benefited economically from their control of the manorial courts and dominating the courts made it easier to manipulate land ownership and rights in their own favour when land became in particularly short supply at the end of this period. Many of the labour duties lords could compel from the local peasant communities became less useful over the period. Duties were fixed by custom, inflexible and understandably resented by the workers involved. As a result, by the end of the 13th century the productivity of such forced labour was significantly lower than that of free labour employed to do the same task. A number of lords responded by seeking to commute the duties of unfree peasants to cash alternatives, with the aim of hiring labour instead.|$|R
500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to <b>land</b> known as <b>servitudes,</b> such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|R

But, on account of the multitude which has sprung from this man and woman in the five thousand years since the world was created, it was necessary that some men should go one way and some another, and that they should be divided into many kingdoms and provinces, for in one alone they could not be sustained.:Of all these nations God our Lord gave charge to one man, called St. Peter, that he should be Lord and Superior of all the men in the world, that all should obey him, and that he should be the head of the whole Human Race, wherever men should live, and under whatever law, sect, or belief they should be; and he gave him the world for his kingdom and jurisdiction. :And he commanded him to place his seat in Rome, as the spot most fitting to rule the world from; but also he permitted him to have his seat in any other part of the world, and to judge and govern all Christians, Moors, Jews, Gentiles, and all other Sects. This man was called Pope, as if to say, Admirable Great Father and Governor of men. The men who lived in that time obeyed that St. Peter, and took him for Lord, King, and Superior of the universe; so also they have regarded the others who after him have been elected to the pontificate, and so has it been continued even till now, and will continue till the end of the world.:One of these Pontiffs, who succeeded that St. Peter as Lord of the world, in the dignity and seat which I have before mentioned, made donation of these isles and Tierra-firme to the aforesaid King and Queen and to their successors, our lords, with all that there are in these territories, as is contained in certain writings which passed upon the subject as aforesaid, which you can see if you wish.:So their Highnesses are kings and lords of these islands and land of Tierra-firme by virtue of this donation: and some islands, and indeed almost all those to whom this has been notified, have received and served their Highnesses, as lords and kings, in the way that subjects ought to do, with good will, without any resistance, immediately, without delay, when they were informed of the aforesaid facts. And also they received and obeyed the priests whom their Highnesses sent to preach to them and to teach them our Holy Faith; and all these, of their own free will, without any reward or condition, have become Christians, and are so, and their Highnesses have joyfully and benignantly received them, and also have commanded them to be treated as their subjects and vassals; and you too are held and obliged to do the same. Wherefore, as best we can, we ask and require you that you consider what we have said to you, and that you take the time that shall be necessary to understand and deliberate upon it, and that you acknowledge the Church as the Ruler and Superior of the whole world, and the high priest called Pope, and in his name the King and Queen Doña Juana our lords, in his place, as superiors and lords and kings of these islands and this Tierra-firme by virtue of the said donation, and that you consent and give place that these religious fathers should declare and preach to you the aforesaid.:If you do so, you will do well, and that which you are obliged to do to their Highnesses, and we in their name shall receive you in all love and charity, and shall leave you, your wives, and your children, and your <b>lands,</b> free without <b>servitude,</b> that you may do with them and with yourselves freely that which you like and think best, and they shall not compel you to turn Christians, unless you yourselves, when informed of the truth, should wish to be converted to our Holy Catholic Faith, as almost all the inhabitants {{of the rest of the}} islands have done. And, besides this, their Highnesses award you many privileges and exemptions and will grant you many benefits.:But, if you do not do this, and maliciously make delay in it, I certify to you that, with the help of God, we shall powerfully enter into your country, and shall make war against you in all ways and manners that we can, and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of their Highnesses; we shall take you and your wives and your children, and shall make slaves of them, and as such shall sell and dispose of them as their Highnesses may command; and we shall take away your goods, and shall do you all the mischief and damage that we can, as to vassals who do not obey, and refuse to receive their lord, and resist and contradict him; and we protest that the deaths and losses which shall accrue from this are your fault, and not that of their Highnesses, or ours, nor of these cavaliers who come with us. And that we have said this to you and made this Requisition, we request the notary here present to give us his testimony in writing, and we ask the rest who are present that they should be witnesses of this Requisition." ...|$|R
