5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It felt like I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although the flight was very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E
2500|$|The above work, on tanka, is {{an example}} of Shiki's {{expanded}} focus during the last few years of his life. He died four years after taking up tanka as a topic. Bedsore and morphine-addled, {{little more than a year}} before his death Shiki began writing sickbed diaries. These three are Bokujū Itteki or [...] "A Drop of Ink" [...] (1901), Gyōga Manroku or [...] "Stray Notes While <b>Lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Back" [...] (1901–1902), and Byōshō Rokushaku or [...] "A Sixfoot Sickbed" [...] (1902).|$|E
60|$|They're back. Dan is <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed. I'll try {{and tell}} you his story as near as I can, in his own words.|$|E
50|$|I <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed at midnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hem! ... hem! ..." [...] stammered Master Skyffington, [...] "I ... that is ... hem ... I left Canterbury {{this morning}} and was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way to Dover ... hem ... this <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way, ma'am ... and ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2. A shrivelled, lifeless, vacant form, [...] 5 It <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{abandoned}} breast, And mocks {{the heart}} which yet is warm, With cold and silent rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "It came to me--I never sought it. If I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> death-bed, I could swear, with a safe conscience, I never sought it.|$|E
60|$|When {{consciousness}} {{returned to}} me I found myself <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{back on the}} deck of a vessel, surrounded and propped up by pillows; and Jack Brown sitting beside me reading a book.|$|E
6000|$|When my {{consciousness}} returned, I found myself <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back beside our camp-fire, {{with my head}} resting on Peterkin's knee; and the first sound I heard was his pleasant voice, as he said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Mosada. Go not. Go not. Go not. For night comes fast; {{look down}} <b>on</b> me, <b>my</b> love, And see how thick the dew <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face. I never knew a night so dew-bedrowned.|$|R
6000|$|... "For you, perhaps," [...] she answered, [...] "because you {{are young}} and because you are ambitious. But for me who <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back all day long, think of the glory of this!" ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not wish}} to take money from her after all the kind {{treatment}} I had received, and so allowed the purse to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> open hand where she had placed it.|$|R
60|$|I {{found them}} in a little sunken dell by a tiny rivulet. <b>Lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> belly in the long grass above, I looked down upon them with a black hatred of jealousy in my heart.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening when}} I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed outside the cave, I heard {{the tale of}} Anscombe and Heda. Up {{to a certain point}} he told it, then she went on with the story.|$|E
6000|$|He {{pointed to}} the peak, saying, [...] "I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back by the tarn, when my lady eagle came sailing overhead, so low that I could see this poor little thing, and hear it bleat." ...|$|E
60|$|Wife.--No, my dear, and I {{hope you}} will not; however, you shall not say I will not do every thing I can to prevent it; and, if it <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side, you are safe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let me <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back," [...] he said, terrified. [...] "No, I won't," [...] said Lilly. Aaron frowned curiously on his nurse. [...] "Mind {{you don't}} let me," [...] he said, {{exacting}} and really terrified.|$|R
25|$|I <b>lie</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pillow in tears.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} silence. I was still left in the darkness; feeling nothing, hearing nothing. Even the {{consciousness}} that I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed deserted me. I {{had no idea that}} I was in the bedroom; I had no knowledge of where I was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but my father, or rather, I believe, my brother, intimated that I {{should be}} welcome only if I had laid aside a certain foolish fancy, and as <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back had not conduced to that end, I could only say I would stay where I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Love {{makes us}} hypocrites, I fear, my Ferdinand; for, a moment before, I was so wearied that I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sofa quite wretched. And then, when I saw him, I pretended that I {{had not been}} out, and was just {{thinking}} of a stroll. Oh, my Ferdinand! will you pardon me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He bid {{me bring}} with me what most I held dear, Or {{a month from}} that time should I <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bier, And I'd sooner resign this false {{fluttering}} breath, [...] 15 Than my Agnes should dread either danger or death, ...|$|R
60|$|Under these {{discouraging}} circumstances I am, however, {{bound to}} proceed from {{a sense of}} duty. This Note is a thing promised. In less than a minute's time by a few incautious words I entered into a bond which has <b>lain</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart heavily ever since.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rise, Don Luis, {{and lose}} {{not a moment}} to relieve the loaded heart of the Genoese--I might almost say, to relieve ours, also; for, Daughter-Marchioness, since this holy {{enterprise}} hath broken <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mind with a sudden and almost miraculous light, it seemeth that a mountain must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> breast until the Señor Christoval shall learn the truth!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{look forward}} a little while, and I don't know what great aid {{may come to}} me. When Richard turns his eyes upon me then, there may be {{something}} <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> breast more eloquent than I have been, with greater power than mine to show him his true course and win him back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly, {{as you do}} the picture-book. Well, there I was lying, Miss Baker, with {{my little}} eyes wide open. It is {{astonishing}} how much babies see, though people never calculate on their having eyes at all. I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back, staring at the mantelpiece, on which my mother had left her key-basket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless my soul!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} again under his breath. All that {{afternoon}} {{he wore a}} dreamy, contemplative appearance which in him was a mark of perplexity. After dinner I went into my stateroom as if I meant to take some rest. There we two bent our dark heads over a half-unrolled chart <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed.|$|E
60|$|However, I {{was glad}} of any light at all, {{down in that}} gloomy hole, where we burrowed like rabbits in a warren; {{and it was the}} happiest time I had, when all my messmates were asleep, and I could <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back, during a forenoon watch below, and read in {{comparative}} quiet and seclusion.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the long}} nights I cannot sleep,:And solitary I <b>lie</b> {{prostrate}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pillow, tossing and turning.|$|R
5000|$|Helias's poetry {{includes}} two collections in Breton, Ar men du (1974, The Black Stone) and An tremen-buhez (1979, The Pastime). An important theme {{in his work}} is his devotion to the Breton language and its power. One of his lines translates as [...] "Breton speaker that I am, <b>my</b> heritage <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> tongue, it shall never be yours".|$|R
60|$|I {{was more}} {{affected}} {{than you can}} easily believe, {{by the sight of}} your gift <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dressing-table {{on the morning of the}} new year. To be remembered in a friend's heart when it is sore is a touching thing; and that and the remembrance of the dead quite overpowered me, the one being inseparable from the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{can tell}} you, Will," [...] said Amyas, [...] "I am not troubled with fear of ghosts; but when I {{cut off the}} Frenchman's head, I said to myself, 'If that braggart had been slandering me instead of her gracious majesty, I should expect to see that head <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pillow every time I went to bed at night.'" ...|$|E
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} I was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{bed in the}} cabin. Elfie was playing with the green flag, and Mary was sitting by me with my hand in hers. One long look of love passed silently from her eyes to mine--from mine to hers. In that look the kindred spirits were united; The Two Destinies were fulfilled.|$|E
60|$|No! I <b>lie</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed, and I {{discover}} {{that there is}} no rest for me that night.|$|R
60|$|I can see now his rather pallid face, and the {{unfamiliar}} sombre fire {{that had come}} into his eyes. I see him very vividly to-night. I sit recalling his words, his tones, and last evening's Westminster Gazette still <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sofa, containing the notice of his death. At lunch to-day the club was busy with his death. We talked of nothing else.|$|R
60|$|We {{women have}} {{something}} of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked. I felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me, {{as though it were}} that of a baby that some day may <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.|$|R
