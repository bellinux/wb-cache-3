5000|$|For Internet services, {{server-side}} <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> {{is usually}} a software program that is listening on the port where external clients connect to access services. The <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> forwards requests {{to one of the}} [...] "backend" [...] servers, which usually replies to the <b>load</b> <b>balancer.</b> This allows the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel's network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.|$|R

50|$|Numerous {{scheduling}} algorithms, {{also called}} load-balancing methods, {{are used by}} <b>load</b> <b>balancers</b> to determine which back-end server to send a request to.Simple algorithms include random choice or round robin. More sophisticated <b>load</b> <b>balancers</b> may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Load</b> <b>balancer</b> {{forwards}} packets to {{web servers}} according to different workloads on servers.

[...] Client-side <b>Load</b> <b>Balancer</b> (CLB) solve this problem by using a scalable cloud storage service.CLB allows clients to choose back-end web servers for dynamic content although it delivers static content.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an {{implementation of}} a <b>Load</b> <b>balancer</b> in a cluster of SIP servers which supports instant messages. The implementation uses TLWL algorithm which provides significantly better response time by distributing requests across the cluster more evenly, thus minimizing occupancy and the corresponding amount of time a particular request waits behind others for service. Resulting in this algorithm improves throughput and response-time of servers. <b>Load</b> <b>balancer</b> maintains sessions in which requests corresponding to the same session are sent by the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> to the same server. <b>Load</b> <b>balancer</b> improves both throughput and response time versus a single node while exposing a single interface to external clients. ...|$|R
30|$|By {{virtual path}} we mean a path {{from a source}} to a {{destination}} endpoint in an SFC.

That SFC has two virtual paths: one from A to the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> then B, and another one from A to the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> then C.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Load Balancing is play import role in cloud {{computing}} related to performance. Cloud computing efficiency and performance depend of <b>Load</b> <b>Balancer.</b> Two type of <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> used in {{cloud computing}} first is static <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> in which number of recourse, cloudlet, VM, and datacenter are fixed, Second is dynamic <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> in which number of recourse, cloudlet, VM, and datacenter are changed at run time. There are many loads balancing algorithm such as FCFS, Round Robin and Priority based. In This paper we used combination of Round Robin and Shortest job First algorithm. This combination improves efficiency {{and performance of}} load balancing in cloud computing environment. We implement proposed algorithm {{with the help of}} CloudSim 3. 0 under VM scheduling policies...|$|R
30|$|For what {{concerns}} {{the use of}} UDP or TCP for exchanging SIP messages, the best solution is to use UDP between the MBS clients and the SIP <b>load</b> <b>balancer,</b> so as to minimize the overhead on the wireless interface, and to use TCP for all other exchanges, that is between the ASN-GW and the SIP <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> and between the SIP <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> and the MSLEE instances (see Figure 13). In this way, {{it is possible to}} maximize the achievable throughput and to control the system latency.|$|R

30|$|In {{the studies}} {{considered}} in the previous section, the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> is installed and managed transparently by the cloud provider.

40|$|In {{information}} systems, it {{is critical}} to reduce the total electrical power consumption of computers and networks in order to realize the digital ecosystems and the green IT technologies. The extended power consumption laxity-based (EPCLB) algorithm is proposed to select a server in a set of servers so as to not only satisfy deadline constraint but also reduce the total power consumption of servers in general applications. However, each time a <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> receives a new request, the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> has to collect status of each server and calculate the estimated power consumption for the request in the EPCLB algorithm. Hence, the computation and communication overhead to estimate the power consumption is large on the <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> if the number of clients is increased. In addition, the status of each server might be changed during the estimation process. Then, it is difficult to correctly estimate the power consumption. In this paper, we newly propose an algorithm to select a server in a set of servers so that the total power consumption of servers and the overhead of a <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> can be reduced. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of the power consumption of servers and the overhead of a <b>load</b> <b>balancer</b> compared with the EPCLB and traditional round-robin (RR) algorithms. ...|$|R
