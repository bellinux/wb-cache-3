It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the <b>leaking</b> <b>cylinder.</b> He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only {{a foot or two}} above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.|$|E

Leg pressure data are currently collected on state-of-the-art longwall shields, but typically are not analyzed to evaluate shield performance. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Shield Hydraulics Inspection and Evaluation of Leg Data (SHIELD) program is a Visual Basic software system that is designed to analyze leg pressure data and identify shields that are not performing to rated specifications. The program analysis is configured to detect the following conditions: (1) loss of leg pressure, (2) imbalance in leg pressure, (3) low set pressure, (4) low yield pressure, and (5) full extension of the bottom stage. Other performance assessment measures include the percentage of the support capacity utilized (ratio of peak load to yield load), the percent of time that a shield operates at yield load, the ratio of the set load to the yield load, and the amount of support capacity that is lost due to <b>leaking</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Historical record keeping will allow the user to select a particular shield and review the performance record as developed by the program for that shield.

This slightly radioactive, but chemically active, material {{is contained in}} more than 46, 000 steel storage cylinders that are located at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Paducah, Kentucky; and Portsmouth, Ohio. Some of the cylinders are more than 40 years old, and approximately 17, 500 are considered problem cylinders because their physical integrity is questionable. These cylinders require an annual visual inspection. The remainder of the 46, 000 -plus cylinders must be visually inspected every four years. Currently, the cylinder inspection program is extremely labor intensive. Because these inspections are accomplished visually, {{they may not be}} effective in the early detection of <b>leaking</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The inspection program requires approximately 12 [...] 14 full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees.

Presentation of the problems A key indicator of measuring and evaluating the quality of hydraulic cylinders is its leakage rate, and design departments, manufacturers and users have been obsessed with the leakage of hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulic cylinder’s leakage, not only reduces its volumetric efficiency, increases power loss, and even affects the normal functioning of the hydraulic cylinder and even the machine[1, 2].

50|$|If {{the gasket}} fails, {{a variety of}} {{problems}} can occur, from compression loss (leading to power reduction, or a rough engine), to exhaust gases being forced into the cooling system, leading to the engine overheating and increased engine wear due to the motor oil being mixed with antifreeze. Coolant can <b>leak</b> into the <b>cylinders,</b> causing the exhaust to issue steam and the catalytic converter to be damaged. If a very large amount of coolant does this, hydrolock can occur, causing extensive engine damage. Sometimes, all that may happen when a head gasket is blown is excessive steam erupting from the tailpipe; yet the engine may act and drive like normal, until all the coolant is gone and the engine overheats. In other occurrences compression leaks into small spaces between the gasket, and either the cylinder head or engine block traps air that is then released when the engine is turned off. The air then escapes into the coolant and creates air pockets. Sometimes these air pockets can get trapped in the engine's coolant thermostat, causing it to stay closed and cause further overheating, thereby creating still more voids between the gasket and the engine. Air pockets can also cause the engine to expel coolant into the overflow or expansion tank, thereby {{reducing the amount of}} coolant the engine has available to stay cool.|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{is attached to}} the engine block by numerous bolts or studs. It has several functions. The {{cylinder head}} seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons; it contains short ducts (the ports) for intake and exhaust and the associated intake valves that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape. However, 2-stroke crankcase scavenged engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves; the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead. The cylinder head also holds the spark plug in the case of spark ignition engines and the injector for engines that use direct injection. All CI engines use fuel injection, usually direct injection but some engines instead use indirect injection. SI engines can use a carburetor or fuel injection as port injection or direct injection. Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but some have 2. A head gasket prevents the gas from <b>leaking</b> between the <b>cylinder</b> head and the engine block. The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several camshafts and springs—or in some engines—a desmodromic mechanism that uses no springs. The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a rocker arm, again, either directly or through a pushrod.|$|R

A list of requirements is used to design a wrist mechanism, after which the prototype is tested to validate the design compared to the requirements. This is done with a test setup where, among others, torque and position of the mechanism are measured. A hydraulic vane cylinder is chosen as the rotation mechanism for both degrees of freedom, but only one degree of freedom is fabricated and tested as a proof of concept. The vane <b>cylinder</b> <b>leaked</b> and could not muster any significant torque. This leaking is probably caused by scratches in the surface of the cylinder wall.

To make a diagnosis of combustion chamber tightness, only such parameters were selected which are characterized by high information value and are closely connected with its defined structure. For this reason such connections are unmistakable, which results in making the right diagnosis of combustion chamber tightness of piston engines. Special attention was paid to the fact, what consequences, combustion chamber leakage, can cause to the piston engine performance. The most dangerous for the engine efficiency is the leakage of combustion chamber. The leakage of combustion chamber brings about the change of such engine parameters as pressure of suction, pressure of final compression and burning and the change of exhaust gases composition, which effect on the engine power and on fuel consumption. Condition of piston rings and their influence on gas pressure in combustion chamber has also been characterized. Pressure of gases taking place in engine cylinder and their connection with leakage of combustion chamber have also been described.
