25|$|The {{era of the}} <b>longshoreman,</b> {{captured}} in the classic film On the Waterfront, faded by the 1970s {{as much of the}} waterfront became obsolete due to changing transportation patterns. The nation's first facility for container shipping, which became the prototype, opened in 1958. Expanded intermodal freight transport systems and the Interstate Highway System effected a shift to new terminals at Newark Bay. Since the 1980s, sections of waterfront in the traditional harbor have been being redeveloped to include public access to the water's edge, with the creation of linear park greenways such as Hudson River Park, Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, and Brooklyn Bridge Park.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Carbone is {{the central}} {{character}} in A View from the Bridge and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist.

500|$|The city {{planned to}} remove the {{fountain}} in 1960 due to disrepair. However, Mayor Terry Schrunk instructed the parks bureau to begin a restoration after Francis J. Murnane, a local <b>longshoreman</b> and advocate for historic preservation, appealed its removal. Much of its original decoration was absent, so replicas of existing pieces were constructed {{at a cost of}} $450. The restoration cost around $1,775, including assembly and installation. Despite its restoration, the fountain was no longer functional. Its condition was deemed [...] "treatment urgent" [...] by the Smithsonian Institution's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in February 1994. Since then, the fountain's plumbing has been restored. According to Smithsonian, the fountain is administered by the City of Portland's Metropolitan Arts Commission.|$|E
500|$|Each {{season of}} The Wire {{introduces}} a different {{institution in the}} city of Baltimore and its relationship to law enforcement, while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is [...] "really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a <b>longshoreman,</b> a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{record for}} the next 33 fights fell to 11–20–2. With his family in poverty during the Great Depression, Braddock {{had to give up}} boxing for a little while and worked as a <b>longshoreman.</b> [...] Due to {{frequent}} injuries to his right hand, Braddock compensated by using his left hand during his <b>longshoreman</b> work, and it gradually became stronger than his right. He always remembered the humiliation of having to accept government relief money, but was inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement, a Christian social justice organization founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 to help the homeless and hungry. After his boxing comeback, Braddock returned the welfare money he had received and made frequent donations to various Catholic Worker Houses, including feeding homeless guests with his family.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} that some Tanith survived the loss of their homeworld simply because they were not on the planet when it came under attack. A Tanith <b>longshoreman</b> featured briefly in Titanicus (also by Abnett), and drunkenly accused the Orestes PDF of being [...] "fething amateurs". He was promptly attacked and presumably killed by the husband of a woman serving in the Orestes PDF.|$|E
2500|$|Either loading or {{unloading}} {{break bulk}} cargo on and off ships typically took several days. [...] It was strenuous and somewhat dangerous work. [...] Losses from damage and theft were high. The work was erratic and most <b>longshoreman</b> {{had a lot of}} unpaid idle time. [...] Sorting and keeping track of {{break bulk cargo}} was also time consuming, and holding it in warehouses tied up capital.|$|E

2500|$|Act 1 – In {{the opening}} speech Alfieri {{describes}} the violent {{history of the}} small Brooklyn community of Red Hook and {{tells us that the}} second-generation Sicilians are now more civilized, more American, and are prepared to [...] "settle for half" [...] (half measures) and let the law handle their disputes.

2500|$|After {{the repeal}} of Prohibition, many of the {{organized}} crime elements moved into other rackets, such as illegal gambling and union shakedowns. The postwar era was characterized by a flourishing waterfront, and <b>longshoreman</b> work was plentiful. By {{the end of the}} 1950s, however, the implementation of containerized shipping led to the decline of the West Side piers and many longshoremen found themselves out of work. In addition, construction of the Lincoln Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel access roads, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal and ramps destroyed much of Hell's Kitchen south of 41st Street.- ...|$|E
2500|$|The Communist Party {{had also}} {{been active in the}} area in the late 1920s, seeking to {{organize}} all categories of maritime workers into a single union, the Maritime Workers Industrial Union (MWIU), as part of the drive during the Third Period to create revolutionary unions. The MWIU never made much headway on the West Coast, but it did attract a number of former IWW members and foreign-born militants. Harry Bridges, an Australian-born sailor who became a <b>longshoreman</b> after coming to the United States, would be accused over and over for his acknowledged Communist party membership.|$|E
2500|$|Houston annexed Kingwood in 1996, adding about [...] to {{the city}} limits. During that year, Thomas Phillips, a retired <b>longshoreman</b> and Bordersville resident, joined with representatives of Kingwood and sued the City of Houston in federal court arguing that the city could not legally annex areas {{if it did not}} provide certain {{services}} to some of its existing areas, including Bordersville which never had city water. Imad F. Abdullah, the President of Landmark Architects Inc., criticized the residents who fought annexation in his 1996 editorial in the Houston Business Journal, arguing that a [...] "not in my backyard" [...] mentality in particular communities overall negatively affects the entire metropolitan area.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1903, Brady left New York {{apparently}} [...] "disgusted" [...] {{with what}} he viewed as continual police harassment and stayed in New Jersey for the following two months.

During the festivities, local <b>longshoreman</b> George Stewart kicked a can [...] "full of mixed ale" [...] from Brady's hands as a practical joke. A fight then occurred {{between the two men}} and eventually led to their arrest for disorderly conduct. Once in custody, Stewart made a formal charge against Brady for assault.

2500|$|The events took {{a violent}} turn that afternoon, as {{hostilities}} resumed {{outside of the}} ILA strike kitchen. Eyewitness accounts differ on the exact events that transpired next. According to some witnesses, a group of strikers first surrounded a police car and attempted to tip it over, prompting the police to fire shotguns in the air, and then revolvers at the crowd. [...] Other eyewitness accounts claim that police officers started shooting {{in the direction of}} the strikers, provoking strikers to defend themselves. Policemen fired a shotgun into the crowd, striking three men in intersection of Steuart and Mission streets. One of the men, Howard Sperry, a striking <b>longshoreman,</b> later died of his wounds. Another man, Charles Olsen, was also shot but later recovered from his wounds. A third man, Nick Bordoise - a Greek by birth (originally named Nick Counderakis) who was an out of work [...] member of the cook's union volunteering at the ILA strike kitchen—was shot but managed to make his way around the corner onto Spear Street, where he was found several hours later.
