40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} effect of chronic {{exposure}} to welding fumes on pulmonary function by a direct estimate of fumes accumulated in the lungs. METHODS: The strength of the residual magnetic field of externally magnetised lungs (LMF) was used as an estimate of fumes accumulated in the lungs. The results of forced spirometry manoeuvres obtained in 143 of 153 male welders in the original sample were cross sectionally evaluated according to LMF. Seven conventional forced spirogram indices and two time domain spirogram indices were used as pulmonary function indices, and height squared proportional correction was performed when necessary. RESULTS: The distribution of <b>LMF</b> <b>values</b> was considerably skewed towards positive. There was a weak but significant positive relation between age and log transformed LMF. Obstructive pulmonary function indices correlated well with LMF. After adjustment for age and smoking, however, a significant association with LMF was only found with percentage rate of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 %) divided by forced vital capacity (FVC) and mu, and average component of assumed time constant distribution of lung peripheral units. Neither FVC nor vital capacity (VC), as indices of restrictive disorders, showed a significant association with LMF. Based on the results of multiple regression analyses, a 0. 6 % decrease in FEV 1 % and 0. 039 unit increase in mu were expected for each doubling of LMF. CONCLUSION: Obstructive changes in pulmonary function were found to be related to level of cumulative exposure to welding fume in male Japanese arc welders after controlling for age and smoking, assuming that LMF adequately reflects accumulation of welding fumes in the lungs...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{systematic}} errors in liver methylene fraction (LMF) resulting from fat-fat interference effects with dual- and triple-echo gradient-recalled-echo Dual/Triple GRE) sequences and {{to test the}} robustness of these sequences after iron overloading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty type- 2 diabetic patients underwent LMF measurement by 3. 0 T ¹H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (corrected for T 1 and T 2 decays) as the reference standard and liver fat fraction (%Fat) measurement by four Dual/Triple GRE sequences with 20 ° and 60 ° flip angle (α), corrected for T 1 recovery. The same four sequences were repeated in eight patients after ferumoxide injection. Corrections for systematic errors were determined from the linear regressions (spectroscopy <b>LMF</b> <b>values</b> over Dual/Triple GRE %Fat values). Robustness was tested using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Fat-fat interference effects produced a ∼ 10 % relative systematic error and T 2 * decay produced a 1. 9 %- 4. 2 % absolute systematic error in LMF. When comparing before and after ferumoxide, dual-echo imaging with α = 20 ° and α = 60 °, even when corrected, showed absolute differences of 7. 23 % [2. 81 %- 10. 25 %] (P = 0. 0117) and 5. 65 % [1. 89 %- 8. 216. 8 %] (P = 0. 0117), respectively; compared to only 1. 17 % [0. 08 %- 2. 83 %] (P = 0. 0251) and 1. 15 % [0. 37 %- 2. 73 %] (P = 0. 2626) with triple-echo imaging and α = 20 ° and α = 60 °, respectively. CONCLUSION: Triple-echo imaging with α = 60 ° corrected for both T 1 recovery and fat-fat interference effects is robust after superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) administration and can reliably quantify LMF...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the neoclassical}} version, the {{objective}} of the LMF is to maximize not total profit, but rather income per worker. But such a scenario implies [...] "perverse" [...] behavior, such as laying off workers when output price rises so as to divide increased profits among fewer members. Evidence supporting such behavior is lacking however; a review of the empirical economics literature is found in Bonin, Jones, and Putterman. But alternative behavioral models have been proposed.

40|$|A {{low melting}} {{fraction}} of milk fat (LMF), with a dropping point (MDP) of 16. 7 °C, was encapsulated by freeze-drying emulsions formulated with trehalose or its blends with 30 wt% lactose or sucrose as hydrophilic phase, {{and with a}} mixed of 50 wt% of the palmitic sucrose esters (SE) β- 170 and β- 1670 as emulsifiers. Trehalose or trehalose/sucrose matrices were very efficient to encapsulate <b>LMF</b> (retention <b>values</b> were 82. 8 %± 3. 2 % and 90. 5 %± 3. 7 %, dry basis, respectively), whereas trehalose/lactose showed a significant decline in initial retention (42. 5 %± 2. 5 %, dry basis). The role of emulsion stability, water content, physical state of the matrix, and particle size distribution on LMF loss was investigated by following retention of LMF with time for the powders stored at water activities (aw) of 0. 11, 0. 33, 0. 44, 0. 54, and 0. 76. Trehalose emulsion was the most stable. However, encapsulation efficiency was higher for the trehalose/sucrose blend. Despite the high initial degree of crystallization, retention with time for the trehalose matrix was very high at all aw. The trehalose/lactose blend had a low efficiency to encapsulate LMF, especially at aw of 0. 54 and 0. 76. Retention {{was determined by the}} counteracting effects of all these factors and was more closely related to structural changes of the encapsulating matrix than to the physical state (amorphous or crystalline) of it...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare (+/-) -r- 7,t- 8 -dihydroxy-t- 9, 10 -oxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (anti-BPDE) -DNA adduct levels in groups of humans {{subjected}} to various levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) (benzo[a]pyrene) exposure. An HPLC/fluorescence method was applied to detect specifically anti-BPDE-DNA adducts in mononuclear white blood cells [lymphocyte plus monocyte fraction (LMF) ] from humans exposed to PAHs. A total of 130 subjects comprised the sample population: 26 psoriatic patients (3 days after clinical coal tar treatment of the skin), 15 coke oven workers, 19 chimney sweeps, 36 aluminium anode plant workers and 34 non-occupationally PAH-exposed subjects (controls). PAH exposure was assessed in each group by means of the urinary excretion of 1 -pyrenol (mean group levels: 1. 2, 0. 7, 0. 3, 65. 0 and 0. 1 micromol/mol creatinine in coke oven workers, chimney sweeps, aluminium plant anode workers, psoriatic patients and non-occupationally PAH-exposed subjects, respectively). HPLC/fluorescence analysis of BPDE-DNA adducts showed that the percentage of subjects with adduct levels exceeding the 95 percentile control subject value (8. 9 adducts/ 10 (8) nucleotides) was significantly high in coke oven workers (46. 7 %) and chimney sweeps (21. 0 %) (chi 2 test, P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively) but not in aluminium plant workers (11. 1 %) and psoriatic patients (0 %). The increase in BPDE-DNA adduct levels in <b>LMF</b> (Ln <b>values)</b> was significantly related to chronic inhalatory and high PAH exposure (linear multiple regression analysis, F = 6. 37, P < 0. 01; t = 4. 2, P < 0. 001). Skin acute (or short-term) and high PAH exposure, charcoal-grilled meat consumption and smoking habit did not seem to influence BPDE-DNA adduct formation in LMF...|$|R
