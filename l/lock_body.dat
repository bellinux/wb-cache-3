50|$|As the {{opponent}} shoots in {{and grabs a}} double leg take-down, the defender goes over the shoulders and arms and <b>locks</b> his/her opponents <b>body.</b> The defender, while still holding the <b>body</b> <b>lock</b> tightly, then drops his/her weight down and backwards and uses the leverage from the <b>body</b> <b>lock</b> to fling {{the opponent}} behind the defender onto the opponents backside in one fluid motion. You can maintain the <b>body</b> <b>lock</b> {{all the way through}} to achieve a mount position.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary {{with the}} Scandinavian padlock, were the [...] "cast heart" [...] locks, so called {{because of their}} shape. A {{significantly}} stronger lock than the smokehouse and much more resistant to corrosion than the Scandinavian, the hearts had a <b>lock</b> <b>body</b> sand cast from brass or bronze and a more secure lever mechanism. Heart locks had two prominent characteristics: one was a spring-loaded cover that pivoted over the keyhole to keep dirt and insects out of the lock that was called a [...] "drop". The other was a point formed {{at the bottom of}} the lock so a chain could be attached to the <b>lock</b> <b>body</b> to prevent the lock from getting lost or stolen. Cast heart locks were very popular with railroads for locking switches and cars because of their economical cost and excellent ability to open reliably in dirty, moist, and frozen environments.|$|E
5000|$|Before co-founding {{the company}} in 1921, Harry Soref had been a {{traveling}} locksmith in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, had invented a lock for protecting military equipment, and had founded the [...] "Master Key" [...] company for making master skeleton keys. In 1919, Soref then invented a padlock design that used laminated steel layers to economically produce an exceptionally strong <b>lock</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|Around the 1870s, lock makers {{realized}} they could successfully package the same locking mechanism found in cast heart locks {{into a more}} economical steel or brass shell {{instead of having to}} cast a thick metal body. These lock shells were stamped out of flat metal stock, filled with lever tumblers, and then riveted together. Although more fragile than the cast hearts, these locks were attractive because they cost less. In 1908, Adams & Westlake patented a stamped & riveted switch lock that was so economical that many railroads stopped using the popular cast hearts and went with this new stamped shell <b>lock</b> <b>body</b> design. Many lock manufacturers made this very popular style of lock.|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{door knob}} has a bolt or spindle running through it that sits just above a cylinder, {{to which the}} spindle is connected. Turning the knob pulls the cylinder {{in the direction of}} the turn. The end of the cylinder is the [...] "latch bolt" [...] (more simply known as the [...] "latch"), which protrudes into a space carved out of the door frame, and which prevents the door from being opened if the knob is not turned. A spring or similar mechanism causes the latch to return to its protruding state whenever the knob is not being turned. escutcheon plates are the keyhole covers, usually circular, through which keys pass to enter the <b>lock</b> <b>body.</b> If the door handles have a square or rectangular plate on which the handle is mounted this is called the backplate. The backplate can be plain (for use with latches), pierced for keyholes (for use with locks), or pierced and fitted with turn knobs and releases (for use with bathroom locks). The plate on the front edge of the lock where the latch bolt protrudes is called the faceplate.|$|E

He was given a minimum tariff of 30 years by the judge, later extended to a whole life tariff by the Home Secretary. A European Court of Human Rights ruling later removed the right of politicians to reset sentence tariffs, and so Duffy's stay in prison was reverted to the original 30 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{change in}} {{rotation}} rate necessary to tidally <b>lock</b> a <b>body</b> B {{to a larger}} body A {{is caused by the}} torque applied by A's gravity on bulges it has induced on B by tidal forces.|$|R
50|$|Tidal locking (also called {{gravitational}} locking {{or captured}} rotation) occurs when, {{over the course}} of an orbit, there is no net transfer of angular momentum between an astronomical body and its gravitational partner. This state can result from the gravitational gradient (tidal force) between two co-orbiting bodies, acting over a sufficiently long period of time. In the case where the orbital eccentricity is exactly zero, tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner, an effect known as synchronous rotation. For example, {{the same side of the}} Moon always faces the Earth, although there is some libration because the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular. A tidally <b>locked</b> <b>body</b> in synchronous rotation takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner.|$|R

In these protests, {{dozens of people}} physically <b>locked</b> their <b>bodies</b> to trees, bulldozers, and desks using specially created lock boxes (metal tubes reinforced with rebar) through which protesters threaded their arms, or using bicycle U-locks in order to lock their necks to other objects.In 1997, {{as part of the}} ongoing HeadWaters Redwoods protests, activists locked themselves to a redwood stump which was carried into California Congressman Frank Riggs' office.|$|R
5000|$|The athlete {{passes to}} the back of his {{opponent}}, secures a regular waist lock, lifts and throws/ drops the opponent backwards and sideways. As a result of these moves, the opponent would tend to land on his side or face down. The athlete can follow the opponent to the ground and place himself on his back, where he could strike him or choke him from behind while holding him in the [...] "grapevine" [...] <b>body</b> <b>lock</b> (see above), stretching him face down on the ground. This technique is described by the Roman poet Statius in his account of a match between the hero Tydeus of Thebes and an opponent in the Thebaid.
