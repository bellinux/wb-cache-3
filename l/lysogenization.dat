50|$|As stated before, upon infection, phage P2 can enterinto either lytic or {{lysogenic}} cycle. The lytic/lysogenic decision upon infectiondepends {{on which}} promoter takes command, the lysogenic promoter Pc or the promoter Pe that controlled genes responsible for lytic cycle. Pc and Pe are located face-to-face, andthey are mutually exclusive. The Pe promotor directs transcription of the Coxprotein that represses the Pc promoter and thereby prevents <b>lysogenization,</b> andthe Pc promoter directs the C repressor transcription which down regulates Pe. Thus, which promotor takes command isthought to be {{a consequence of}} the relative concentrations of the Cox proteinand the C repressor. If the balance between the C repressor and Cox proteins isshifted towards C repressor after infection, then the phage will enter the lysogeniclifecycle as the Pe promoter will be turned off and vice versa.|$|E

Whereas considerable <b>lysogenization</b> occurs {{in the presence of}} either system alone, <b>lysogenization</b> is absolutely prevented in the absence of both systems. Neither system is, however, required for efficient <b>lysogenization</b> when the host bears an hfl- mutation.

In addition, under non-permissive conditions, these mutants fail to lysogenize and show dominant integration-negative phenotypes.

40|$|Transduction of a methicillin-resistance {{determinant}} (mec) in Staphylococcus aureus RN 450 {{was dependent}} on its prior <b>lysogenization</b> with an appropriate temperate phage.

Elimination of prophage from RN 450 abrogated its effectiveness as a transductional recipient of mec. Elimination of prophage from a methicillin-resistant transductant of RN 450 reduced resistance to undetectable levels in six of seven phage-eliminated strains. In four of these a variable number of clones again became phenotypically resistant after <b>lysogenization</b> alone or <b>lysogenization</b> combined with reintroduction of a penicillinase plasmid.

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{processes}} leading to <b>lysogenization</b> of cells of Escherichia coli or Shigella dysenteriae by phage P 2 have been studied with the following results. Treatment of infected cells with chloromycetin, amino acid analogues, or 5 -OH-uridine, or starvation for a required amino acid, all increase the frequency of <b>lysogenization,</b> whereas treatment with cyanide, azide, dinitrophenol, or pretreatment with ultraviolet light have no effect. Treatment of infected cells with proflavine also increases the frequency of <b>lysogenization,</b> and chloromycetin and proflavine are most effective in this respect when added about halfway through the latent period. It is suggested that the primary action of these substances is to block processes, beginning about that time, {{that lead to the}} maturation of the phage.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{bacterial}} cells may use their temperate viruses as biological weapons. For instance, a few bacterial cells among a population of lysogenic cells could release the virus and kill susceptible non-lysogenic competitors, while their clone mates would be immune. Because viruses replicate inside their victims upon infection, this process would amplify their number in the arena. Sometimes, however, temperate viruses spare recipient cells from death by establishing themselves in a dormant state inside cells. This phenomenon is called <b>lysogenization</b> and, for some viruses such as the l virus, the probability of <b>lysogenization</b> increases with the multiplicity of infection. Therefore, the amplification of viruses leads to conflicting predictions about the efficacy of temperate viruses as biological weapons: amplification can increase the relative advantage of clone mates of lysogens but also the likelihood of saving susceptible cells from death, because the probability of <b>lysogenization</b> is higher. To test the usefulness of viruses as biological weapons, we performed competition experiments between lysogenic Escherichia coli cells carrying the l virus and susceptible l-free E. coli cells, either in a structured or unstructured habitat. In structured and sometimes in unstructured habitats, the l virus qualitatively behaved as a ‘‘replicating toxin’’. However, such toxic effect of l viruses ceased after a few days of competition. This was {{due to the fact that}} many of initially susceptible cells became lysogenic. Massive <b>lysogenization</b> of susceptible cells occurred precisely under the conditions where the amplification of the virus was substantial. From then on, these cells and their descendant...|$|E

This intermediate structure can be formed {{in the absence of}} Mu A or B function.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{outcomes of}} infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage Mu include lytic growth, lysogen formation, nonlysogenic surviving cells, and perhaps simple {{killing of the}} host. The influence of various parameters, including host himA and himD mutations, on lysogeny and cell survival is described. Mu does not grow lytically in or kill him bacteria but can lysogenize such hosts. Mu c+ lysogenizes about 8 % of him+ bacteria infected at low multiplicity at 37 degrees C. The frequency of lysogens per infected him+ cell diminishes with increasing multiplicity of infection or with increasing temperature over the range from 30 to 42 degrees C. In him bacteria, the Mu <b>lysogenization</b> frequency increases from about 7 % at low multiplicity of infection to approach a maximum where most but not all cells are lysogens at high multiplicity of infection. <b>Lysogenization</b> of him hosts by an assay phage marked with antibiotic resistance is enhanced by infection with unmarked auxiliary phage. This helping effect is possible for at least 1 h, suggesting that Mu infection results in formation of a stable intermediate. Mu immunity is not required for <b>lysogenization</b> of him hosts.

40|$|Six {{of seven}} hfl {{mutations}} of Escherichia coli K 12, characterized by high frequencies of <b>lysogenization</b> by phage lambda and λcIII mutants, are {{shown to be}} tightly linked to, but not within, the purA locus. All six hfl mutations are recessive to wild type in hfl+/hfl merodiploids and all lie in a single complementation group, located just counterclockwise from the purA locus. All six mutations confer a slightly increased resistance to penicillin and rifamycin and a slightly increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Some cases of intragenic complementation and intragenic recombination were observed.

40|$|The cII {{gene product}} of {{bacteriophage}} λ is unstable and {{required for the}} establishment of <b>lysogenization.</b> Its intracellular amount is important for the decision between lytic growth and <b>lysogenization.</b> Two genetic loci of Escherichia coli are crucial for these commitments of infecting λ genome. One of them, hflA encodes the HflKC membrane protein complex, which has been believed to be a protease degrading the cII protein. However, both its absence and overproduction stabilized cII in vivo and the proposed serine protease-like sequence motif in HflC was dispensable for the <b>lysogenization</b> control. Moreover, the HflKC protein was found to reside on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane. In contrast, the other host gene, ftsH (hflB) encoding an integral membrane ATPase/protease, is positively required for degradation of cII, since loss of its function stabilized cII and its overexpression accelerated the cII degradation. In vitro, purified FtsH catalyzed ATP-dependent proteolysis of cII and HflKC antagonized the FtsH action. These results, together with our previous finding that FtsH and HflKC form a complex, suggest that FtsH is the cII degrading protease and HflKC is a modulator of the FtsH function. We propose that this transmembrane modulation differentiates the FtsH actions to different substrate proteins such as the membrane-bound SecY protein and the cytosolic cII protein. This study necessitates a revision of the prevailing view about the host control over λ lysogenic decision...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of catalase, cystinase, and deoxyribonuclease activity to toxinogeny in Corynebacterium diphtheriae was examined.

Phages carrying these mutations were analyzed for their ability to lysogenize and to transpose in nonpermissive hosts. One Aam mutation, Aam 7110, known to retain the capacity to support <b>lysogenization</b> of a sup 0 host (M. M. Howe, K. J. O'Day, and D. W.

Four Ats mutations which map at different positions in the gene were able to catalyze <b>lysogenization</b> but not phage growth at the nonpermissive temperature. Phages carrying mutations located at different positions in the Mu B gene (which encodes a product necessary for efficient integration and lytic replication) were all able to lysogenize at the same frequency.

40|$|Recombination-deficient (Rec-) mutants of Salmonella typhimurium {{were used}} to study special {{transduction}} by phage P 22 {{in the absence of}} the usual background of general transduction. Rec- strains could not be transduced for any marker with a lysate arising by infection. When the same strains were infected with a lysate obtained by induction, low but significant levels of transduction were observed for the pro A and pro B loci (located to one side of the prophage attachment site), but not for pro C (located to the other side of the attachment site), leu, or thy. Integration-deficient (int) phage lysates were unable to transduce the pro A and pro B loci in Rec- cells unless int+ helper phage were present. These results suggest that although Rec- cells cannot undergo general transduction, special transduction (by <b>lysogenization)</b> for the pro A and pro B loci is found. A mixture of int- and int+ phage were unable to transduce the pro C locus despite the large number of pro C-transducing particles present in an int lysate. The inability of the int+ phage genomes to promote successful <b>lysogenization</b> of pro C-transducing particles in Rec- cells may indicate a requirement for a structural element near the left prophage end for integration of phage P 22. Alternatively, the deletion of c 2, the structural gene for P 22 repressor, from most pro C-transducing particles may prevent successful <b>lysogenization</b> by these particles.

40|$|HK 022, a {{temperate}} coliphage {{related to}} lambda, forms lysogens by inserting its DNA into the bacterial chromosome through site-specific recombination. The Escherichia coli Fis and phage Xis proteins promote excision of HK 022 DNA from the bacterial chromosome. These two proteins also act during <b>lysogenization</b> {{to prevent a}} prophage rearrangement: lysogens formed {{in the absence of}} either Fis or Xis frequently carried a prophage that had suffered a site-specific internal DNA inversion. The inversion is a product of recombination between the phage attachment site and a secondary attachment site located within the HK 022 left operon. In the absence of both Fis and Xis, the majority of lysogens carried a prophage with an inversion. Inversion occurs during <b>lysogenization</b> {{at about the same time}} as prophage insertion but is rare during lytic phage growth. Phages carrying the inverted segment are viable but have a defect in <b>lysogenization,</b> and we therefore suggest that prevention of this rearrangement is an important biological role of Xis and Fis for HK 022. Although Fis and Xis are known to promote excision of lambda prophage, they had no detectable effect on lambda recombination at secondary attachment sites. HK 022 cIts lysogens that were blocked in excisive recombination because of mutation in fis or xis typically produced high yields of phage after thermal induction, regardless of whether they carried an inverted prophage. The usual requirement for prophage excision was bypassed in these lysogens because they carried two or more prophages inserted in tandem at the bacterial attachment site; in such lysogens, viable phage particles can be formed by in situ packaging of unexcised chromosomes...|$|E
