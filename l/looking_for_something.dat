The idea came {{to him in a}} time when Dutch total football was Europe's finest and Dutch football clubs were living their golden era (especially Ajax). Witkamp was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> new to definitely decide which was the best team in Europe and also to further test Ajax's legendary team, led by their star player Johan Cruyff. It was then proposed that the winner of the European Cup would face the winner of the European Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

25|$|Some educated parties {{note that}} the USL v. BSDi case had shown that the Unix {{copyrights}} are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed patent infringement, as according to the US Patent and Trademark Office database, no AT or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX trademark was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} {{system is not}} located in the Pippin's onboard storage, and is instead located on the CD-ROMs {{for each of the}} Pippin's software releases. Apple could thus upgrade the {{operating system}} without having to sell new hardware to the consumer. However, because of this, once Pippin software releases ended, it became impossible to upgrade to a later operating system, or install extensions and such. The system automatically reboots whenever the CD-ROM eject button is pushed, so a user can not load the system software off one CD-ROM, and then insert another CD-ROM. Apple intended for the Pippin platform to be an appliance, and encouraged consumers to purchase a fully featured Macintosh system if they were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> upgradable. Bandai never upgraded its system software beyond the 7.5.2 version. Hardware enthusiasts have been able to run system software as late as Mac OS 8.0, but this can only be done on a system utilizing a developer ROM-BIOS.|$|E

[...] "Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude."

According to the review by Cheat Code Central, [...] "just about every aspect of Darkwatch is cool.

[...] John Scalzo of Gaming Target wrote that [...] "for anyone <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>something</b> a little different out of their FPS experience, Darkwatch is that game." [...] The reviewer in GamePro wrote that Darkwatch [...] "mixes its Western Roots with gothic horror and steampunk aesthetics, and the results are uniquely engaging," [...] adding that if some the game's [...] "cooler" [...] concepts [...] "had been explored further, lengthening the game in the process, Darkwatch could've rivaled the best of the genre."

Mulder and Scully arrive shortly thereafter; Mulder examines the bullets embedded in the wall and finds that they, too, crumble into dust when compressed.
