5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|Taxation of {{imported}} goods, tax rate varied over the Song dynasty, from 10% to {{as high as}} 40%; however, {{during the reign of}} Emperor Shenzong (1048–1085), the tax rate for imports was <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> 6.67%. The tax was goods in kind, not money.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006 Krka {{was damaged}} during an {{overhaul}} at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> the sea, the winch of the syncrolift {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Major {{repair work}} was done in 2003 and 2006, when the Victorian {{drainage}} culvert was replaced and the track <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> allow access for larger passenger and freight stock {{at a cost of}} £10million. The 16 closed airshafts were deteriorating and had to be re-capped. In 2003 the excavated material from the works was recycled to shore up the railway embankment near Castley.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G2V star, with G2 {{indicating}} {{its surface}} temperature of approximately 5,778K (5,505°C, 9,941°F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence star. The average luminance of the Sun is about 1.88gigacandela per square metre, but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> about 1.44Gcd/m2. However, the luminance is not constant across the disk of the Sun (limb darkening).|$|E

The number of teams was <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> 12; the top six teams did not get a bye and played five preliminary round games. Sweden won the gold medal over Finland and the Czech Republic won the bronze medal. Three months later, Sweden won the 2006 World Championships and became the first team to win the Olympic and World Championship gold in the same year.|$|E
5|$|At the war's end in 1945, Ull {{only had}} {{fourteen}} members. Its average member age was <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> 65 {{years after the}} admission of five new members in 1946 and 1947. The post-war period also saw the admission to SK Ull of men from more professional groups. One of the new members, Erik Plahte, would serve as chairman from 1951 to 1973, when he backed down {{at the age of}} 84. Another of the new post-war members, Jakob Vaage, took over. He was then aged 68. By 1953, all the club's elected positions were held by post-war members. Three of the older members, some with experience dating to the 1880s, were admitted as honorary members, the first honorary members in SK Ull since 1889.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E

5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} {{platforms}} were extended to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface platforms was <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> enable ground level access to Portcullis House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression this fee was <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> $100 and {{eventually}} $75. All royalties {{went to the}} Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when Walter Karig, who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, tried to claim rights with the Library of Congress in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> half-staff.|$|E

5|$|In April 1960, Roosevelt was {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, and she died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side on November 7, 1962, {{at the age of}} 78. Her daughter Anna took care of Roosevelt when she was terminally ill in 1962. President John F. Kennedy ordered all United States flags <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> half-staff throughout the world on November 8 in tribute to Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
5|$|Light {{wind shear}} and {{favorable}} ocean temperatures led to steady intensification of the storm, and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on August 31. Minimum pressure <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that would do so during the season.|$|E

5|$|Mystery of the Emblem began {{development}} in 1992 during {{the production of}} Fire Emblem Gaiden. The staff from previous entries, including series creator Shouzou Kaga and composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, returned to their respective roles. While originally conceived as two separate projects, the team eventually merged the proposed remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light with the original story content of Mystery of the Emblem. The gameplay, which had veered away from the first game's tactical RPG routes in Gaiden, returned to its more traditional stance. The difficulty was <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> encourage new players to try the series.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E
5|$|On August3, the National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico issued {{hurricane}} warnings for {{the northern}} Leeward Islands and a hurricane watch for the Virgin Islands. Later that day, the watch was expanded to include Puerto Rico. By August4, the hurricane warnings were <b>lowered</b> <b>to</b> gale warnings and the watch was discontinued as Arlene weakened to a tropical storm. Later that day, all warnings were canceled since the storm had further weakened to a tropical depression. On August8, after Arlene regenerated, residents in Bermuda were advised to not venture offshore on any vessel and rush all hurricane preparations to completion.|$|E
