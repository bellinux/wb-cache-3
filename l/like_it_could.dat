25|$|Red Bull Racing {{returned}} {{to have a}} great season in 2010, thanks to their hiring of designer Adrian Newey in 2007. They won the Constructors' Championship in the penultimate round in Brazil, and Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the championship in the final round of the 2010 season at Abu Dhabi. Mercedes GP (formerly Brawn GP) had a much less successful and winless season than 2009 with their two new drivers – seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher who {{returned to}} Formula One, but was regularly beaten by fellow German, Nico Rosberg. McLaren and Ferrari had better seasons in 2010, finishing second and third in the constructors, respectively. The Drivers' Championship was very closely fought, with six men leading the championship at one point, in the joint longest ever (nineteen-race) season. For most of the season, the title looked <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have gone to either Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel or Mark Webber, or either McLaren's Lewis Hamilton or reigning World Champion Jenson Button (also at McLaren). But, the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso clawed back 47-points after the British Grand Prix, to be leading the Drivers' Championship with two races left. A record four drivers were still in contention for the title going into the final round in Abu Dhabi. They were Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton (placing in that order in number of points before the race). They did not finish that way though, with Vettel winning the race and the title when the others finished too far down the field. Vettel became the youngest ever World Champion {{in the history of the}} sport.|$|E

Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love".

It is composed in the key of B minor with Michele's vocal range spanning from the low-note of A3 to the high-note of E5. The song features the chord progression of BmGDA6. Brian Voerding of AOL Radio Blog said the song was [...] "a lonesome piano ballad backed by rich orchestration, best filed under 'classic diva tune.'" [...] Voerding also said that Michele's [...] "clean voice bites under and glides above timeless lyrics of self-doubt over love recently lost."

500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time".

[...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D.

[...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes {{a little something to}} Gwen Stefani," [...] as well as the album's [...] "deluxe ditties".

Writing for AllMusic, Andy Kellman referred to Syro as [...] "one of James' most inviting and enjoyable releases" [...] {{and said the}} album is [...] "decked in accents and melodies that are lively even at their most distressed" [...] in his four-out-of-five-star review. Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound commented on the album's wide range of genres, including glitch, chillwave, techno, acid jazz and jungle, and said Syro [...] "peaks as Aphex Twin's most accessible album since his ambient works", ultimately giving the album a B+ rating. Pitchfork highlighted Syro {{as part of the}} publication's [...] "Best New Music"; editor Mark Richardson rated the album 8.7out of 10, writing that Syro [...] "has few extremes, no hyper-intense splatter-breaks or satanic 'Come to Daddy' vocals or rushes of noise.

500|$|At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane {{announced}} that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer Kara Vallow confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. A month after the announcement, Kevin Reilly, President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: [...] "Of all the issues, [...] {{is the one that}} seems to be the most of a hot button. Particularly at that moment in time, the economy was really struggling and there were a lot of very tough conversations going on with clients." [...] Reilly said that [...] "the advertisers know what they’re getting" [...] with Family Guy, and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but [...] "this one felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> cause trouble, and it was just not worth it." [...] Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on BBC Three in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station. Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Fox stated that there were no plans to air it on their network. Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Family Guy was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since The Flintstones in 1961.

500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is an uptempo song, {{composed}} with pop, soul, R, gospel, dance-pop and rhythmic adult contemporary influences and stylings. By early August, Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff; the [...] "sad and balld-y" [...] "Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)" [...] and the [...] "Gospel-tinged and religious" [...] "Jesus Born on This Day". The {{third and final}} original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a [...] "Phil Spector, old rock 'n roll, sixties-sounding Christmas song". Critics have noted the song's 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s influences which, in conjunction with Carey's voice and its simple melody, heralded its recipe for success. In discussing the song's chord progression and stylistic approaches, Slates Adam Ragusea hailed the song as [...] "the only Christmas song written in the last half-century worthy of inclusion in the Great American Songbook." [...] The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski attributes the song's enduring appeal to its ambiguity {{in being able to}} pin it down as belonging to a specific era. The song begins with a [...] "sparking" [...] bit of percussion [...] "that resembles an antique music box or a whimsical snow globe." [...] After Carey's a cappella style vocal introduction, the song introduces other seasonal percussive signifiers including; celebratory church-like bells, cheerful sleigh bells, and [...] "an underlying rhythmic beat that sounds like the loping pace of a horse or reindeer. These sounds echo religious and secular musical touchstones, without veering blatantly too much in either direction, and give the song an upbeat, joyous tone." [...] In an interview in 1994, Carey described the song as [...] "fun", and continued: [...] "It's very traditional, old-fashioned Christmas. It's very retro, kind of '60s." [...] Afanasieff went further in breaking down the song's musical elements: [...] "A lush bed of keyboards, reminiscent of a small-scale Wall of Sound, cushions the song's cheery rhythms, while a soulful vocal chorus adds robust oohs, tension-creating counter-melodies, and festive harmonies. Most notably, however, the song's jaunty piano chords and melody keep the song merrily bouncing along." [...] Critics noted the song a tad reminiscent of the works of Judy Garland and Nat King Cole, while also describing it as hearkening back to [...] "'60s and '70s Motown covers of prewar Christmas classics, such as The Jackson 5's [...] Stevie Wonder". Slates Ragusea conceded that [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You" [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been written in the '40s and locked in a Brill Building safe." ...|$|E
