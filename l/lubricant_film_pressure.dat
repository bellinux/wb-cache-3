Relative motion between {{grinding}} wheel and workpiece makes the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> formed by grinding fluid in the grinding area increase, consequently, dynamic pressure lubrication forms. The grinding fluid flow field mathematical model in smooth grinding area is established based on lubrication theory.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with dimple textures, surface roughness is a texture at the micro-scale, essentially which will influence the load-bearing capacity of lubricant film. The numerical simulation {{was carried out}} to investigate the influence of surface roughness on friction property of textured surface. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> <b>pressure</b> was obtained using the method of computational fluid dynamics according to geometric model of round dimple, and the renormalization-group k–ε turbulent model was adopted in the computation. The numerical simulation results {{suggest that there is}} an optimum dimensionless surface roughness, and near this value, the maximum load-bearing capacity can be achieved. The load-bearing capacity is determined by the surface texture, the surface roughness, and the interaction between them. To get information of friction coefficient, the experiments were conducted. This experiment was used to evaluate the simulation. The experimental results show that for the frequency of 4 and 6 [*]Hz, friction coefficient decreases at first and then increases with decreasing surface roughness, which indicates that there exists the optimum region of surface roughness leading to the best friction reduction effect, and it becomes larger when area fractions increase from 2 % to 10 %. The experimental results agree well with the simulation results...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{comparison}} with other working procedures of hollow parts, indirect extrusion is characterized by high precision and productivity. Efficiency of the process imposed intense theoretical and experimental research over the years, resulting in widening the range of products manufactured [2, 4 – 6, 16]. To exploit these advantages, {{it is necessary to}} continue studying the issues arising from this process. Thus, the flow of the material can be unsatisfactory due to the strong friction arising between it and the working parts of the die, friction caused by the breakdown of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> at high <b>pressure</b> and temperature conditions existing during processing. Also, the forces and pressures that occur at high indirect extrusion worse than energy parameters of the process and considerably reduces tooling durability [1, 3, 8, 9, 17].

The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper presents the results of numerical prediction of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness and <b>pressure</b> distribution in concentrated counterformal point contact under isothermal conditions. The operating conditions, which include load and speed of entraining motion, promote the formation of ultra-thin films; these are formed under the combined action of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), the surface contact force of solvation and molecular interactions due to the presence of Van der Waals forces. A numerical solution has been carried out, using the low-relaxation Newton-Raphson iteration technique, applied to the convergence of the hydrodynamic pressure. The paper shows that the effect of surface forces become significant as the elastic film (i. e. the gap) is reduced to a few nanometres. The numerical predictions have been shown to conform well to the numerical work and experimental findings of other research workers...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} ElastoHydroDynamic (EHD) theory {{assumes a}} Newtonian lubricant and an isothermal operating regime. In reality, lubricating oils do not behave as perfect Newtonian fluids. Moreover, in most operating conditions of an engineering system, especially at high speeds, thermal effects {{are important and}} temperature {{can no longer be}} considered as constant throughout the system. This is one reason why {{there has always been a}} gap between numerical results and experimental data. This paper aims to show that this gap can be reduced by taking into consideration the heat generation that takes place in the contact and using appropriate rheological models. For this, a unique thermal ElastoHydrodynamic lubrication model is developed for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian <b>lubricants.</b> <b>Pressure,</b> <b>film</b> thickness and traction results are then compared to their equivalent isothermal results and experimental data.

The thickness of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> has {{a significant impact on}} the efficiency of the piston pump yet it still remains an uncertainty.

40|$|Being {{particularly}} critical components, the serviceability {{of rolling}} element bearings is usually {{essential for the}} machines operation. They {{have been the subject}} of research for more than a 100 years. The work of this manuscript investigates two aspects of rolling element bearings. Firstly, the dynamic behaviour of a rolling element bearing is analysed. The study emphasises the influence of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> on the bearing dynamics. Secondly, the lifetime of the bearing is analysed. The study discusses the influence of external dynamic loads on the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> formation and wear of the raceway surfaces. The bearing dynamics and lifetime are experimentally analysed using an innovative and versatile test rig. The first contribution of the current work consists of the development of this test rig. The test rig is designed and constructed in-house and characterised by three unique features. Firstly, the test rig allows easy adjustment to test different types and sizes of rolling element bearings. The test bearing is mounted in a modular structure consisting of an auxiliary shaft and an intermediate sleeve. Secondly, the test rig allows applying a multi-axial static and dynamic load on the test bearing. The bearing load is controlled in both the radial and axial direction and has a static and dynamic component in both directions. Thirdly, the test rig allows simultaneous measurement of the bearing motion, the bearing dynamics and the behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film.</b> Relations between the different measurements can be derived experimentally. The radial, axial and tilt motion are measured free from disturbances of the surrounding structure. The bearing dynamics are identified in a frequency range below the resonances of the surrounding structures flexible modes. The behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> is analysed based on the electrical resistance through the bearing. In the current study, a single row deep groove ball bearing is used as a test bearing. The bearing motion, the behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> and cage slip are analysed for different operational conditions of the bearing. The three properties are derived using techniques which can be applied in most rotating machinery: measurement of the radial bearing displacement and the electrical resistance through the bearing. Clear trends w. r. t. the bearing load, temperature and speed are obtained. Clean analysis of the bearing motion and cage slip further proves precise operation of the test rig. The electrical resistance reveals the formation of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> during a run-up of the bearing speed. Estimation of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness based on the electrical resistance is validated using an analytical model. Exploring the possibilities to easily and accurately identify the properties is the second contribution of this work. Accurate knowledge on the bearing dynamic properties is essential during the design of many rotating machinery. They determine the machines critical speeds, the forces acting on the different components, etc. This work investigatestwo dynamic properties of the test bearing: the radial stiffness and damping in the direction of the static load. Variation of the bearing temperature reveals the influence of the lubricants viscosity on the identified stiffness and damping. Variation of the bearing speed reveals the influence of the film formation on the identified stiffness and damping. In the literature, no experimental measurements showing the relations between the behaviour of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> and the dynamic properties are reported. Revealing these relations is the third contribution of the current study. The results help to evaluate the significance of modelling the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> when numerically analysing the vibrations of a bearing system. Precise prediction of the lifetime of rolling element bearings is a crucial step towards a reliable design of many rotating machines. For bearings subjected to highly varying loads, a strong reduction of the actual bearing lifetime w. r. t. the classically calculated bearing lifetime is observed. This work investigates the effect of external dynamic loads on the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> formation and surface wear of the test bearing. When introducing a radial or axial excitation on the bearing, the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness follows the imposed variations of the load. An increase of metallic contact or breakdown of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> is not detected. Under axial excitation, sliding motion between asperities of the contacting surfaces in the bearing does occur. Accelerated lifetime tests under high axial dynamic load reveal polishing of the raceway honing structure. This polishing is clearly observed on SEM images of the inner raceway after a test duration of only 0. 5 % of the calculated L 10 life. Analysis of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> behaviour under dynamic load is not described in the current literature and is considered to be the fourth contribution of this work. Finally, the study promotes further research to analyse surface wear due to external dynamic loads. status: publishe...|$|R

Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness along the line of action of gear tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|R

40|$|The {{contact between}} the piston ring and {{cylinder}} liner {{is the most important}} sealing interface in an automotive engine. Understanding the contact interactions and <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> formation at this interface is crucial for the development of fuel-efficient and low emission engines. This article outlines the development of an ultrasonic approach to enable non-invasive measurement of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>film</b> thickness formed between piston and cylinder wall of a fired engine.
