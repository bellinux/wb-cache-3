5000|$|Attacks {{can be done}} by {{a player}} ramming their vehicle into their oppositions vehicle, {{shooting}} at their opponents vehicle with vehicle-mounted artillery or using their aerial vehicle (the Thunder Chopper) to attack. As play progresses along the game board, it is constantly extended by using the back portion of the board; the Rear Board. Indeed, a way in which a player can beat an opponent is by getting all of his cars and chopper onto the forward-most game board (<b>Lead</b> <b>Board)</b> faster than his opponents vehicles. If a player is lagging too far behind and is still on the rear-most game board section (Rear Board) by the time another player has {{reached the end of the}} <b>Lead</b> <b>Board,</b> any vehicles on that portion of board are permanently removed from the game; this suggests that the car was [...] "outrun". An exception to this rule applies only to the Thunder Chopper, it can stay in play as long as a player has at least one running car remaining.|$|E

5000|$|The CVUSD Board {{itself has}} also faced {{criticism}} for multiple years for having public prayers, Bible readings, and Christian proselytizing during its public meetings. The majority of Board members {{are members of}} either Calvary Chapel Chino Hills or other similar Christian conservative congregations in the district, and most regularly tout their religious beliefs during Board discussions. Despite numerous letters of complaint from various individuals and groups, the Board has either ignored these complaints or officially rejected to change their practices. The administration actively solicits local Christian pastors to <b>lead</b> <b>Board</b> invocations, and the Board regularly presents recognition awards to religious leaders who provide [...] "support and prayers for the Chino Valley Unified School District".|$|E

5000|$|The company {{wanted a}} more {{impressive}} name than Mineral City for its resort, so Colonel Stehlin and his wife, Elizabeth (née Morton), {{went to the}} library in St. Augustine to research various possibilities for a new name. Since Florida had been under Spanish rule at one time, they looked on an old map and found the name Pontevedra on the Atlantic coast of Spain at approximately the same latitude as Mineral City. The Galician name of the town was derived from a Roman bridge ("ponte vetera" [...] or [...] "old bridge") that spanned the nearby Lérez River centuries earlier. Colonel Stehlin submitted the name to the National <b>Lead</b> <b>board</b> for approval and Mineral City became Ponte Vedra.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedMBA Professional ReportStudies {{performed by the}} GAO (1997), Dowling and Feck (1999), and Culkin (2004) suggest that the services, the Government, and the taxpayer may {{be better served by}} consolidating the efforts of the separate Civil Augmentation Programs (CAPs) into one, joint program. This study examines five potential efficiency areas-Planning, Capabilities Provided, Financial Processes, Command and Control, and Ease of Use-using Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) to determine the potential cost savings and streamlining that might exist under a Joint Civil Augmentation Program (JCAP). The results show that significant cost savings will be realized by a JCAP, particularly in the area of Planning. Beyond monetary benefits, having one program standardizes and streamlines Planning, Financial Processes, and Command and Control functions. Standardization and streamlining ultimately increase Ease of Use. Finally, having a single logistics support program eliminates duplicative capabilities, processes, and program management and administration offices while simultaneously bridging existing capability gaps (thus ensuring all military services have access to the full range of support functions). The study examines three courses of action-Do Nothing, Create a CAP Executive <b>Lead</b> <b>Board</b> (CELB), or Create a JCAP. The examination details the advantages, disadvantages, and cultural barriers/implications of each alternative. The recommendation is to establish a formal JCAP as soon as practicable...|$|E

40|$|There is {{continued}} {{concern in}} Australia over the low representation {{of women on}} corporate boards. A range of strategies have been proposed to address a perceived need to provide training for ‘board ready’ women. One program is the provision of scholarships to complete a recognised company director’s program. Underlying this approach is an implied assumption that undertaking a company director’s course will <b>lead</b> to <b>board</b> appointments. This paper presents findings from interviews with six of ten women who won scholarships to undertake the course. Contrary to expectations, completion of the course did not <b>lead</b> to <b>board</b> seeking behaviour for most study participants.
