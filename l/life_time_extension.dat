Knowledge is the nuclear energy industry’s most valuable asset and resource, without which the industry cannot operate safely and economically. Nuclear knowledge {{is also very}} complex, expensive to acquire and maintain, and easily lost. States, suppliers, and operating organizations that deploy nuclear technology are responsible for ensuring that the associated nuclear knowledge is maintained and accessible. In the organizational context, nuclear knowledge management supports the organization's business processes, and involves applying knowledge management practices. These may be applied at any stage of a nuclear facility's life cycle: research and development, design and engineering, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, refurbishment and <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension,</b> waste management, and decommissioning. Nuclear knowledge management issues and priorities are often unique to the particular circumstances of individual Member States and their nuclear industry organizations. Nuclear knowledge management practices enhance and support traditional business functions and goals such as human resource management, training, planning, operations, maintenance, projects, innovation, performance and risk management, information management, process management, organizational learning and information technology support. A nuclear knowledge management strategy, with clearly defined objectives, provides a framework for establishing principles, policy, priorities and plans to apply knowledge management practices in the workplace.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally {{eco-design}} {{has been}} steered by an implicit hierarchy of preferences {{with respect to}} the end-of-life options for products of which the total life cycle impact is to be minimized. In this context, <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> is typically preferred over disassembly for reuse of components, which in its turn is preferred over material recycling. However, this priority hierarchy is often too simplistic to accept it as a general applicable guideline: both ecological and economic considerations can make <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> and/or the reuse of components non-favourable strategies in cases where product performance and resource efficiency may evolve rapidly as result of continuous innovation. Furthermore, where ecological indicators might confirm the suitability of a <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> strategy at component level, economic constraints often make such scenarios infeasible. De facto today few disassembly activities prove to be economically viable. However, the emergence of new technologies and business strategies could indicate a reversal of the trend to abandon the higher priority end-of-life treatment methods for manufactured goods. Based on extensive, case study driven research, successful business models were revealed that improve the economic viability of systematic product reuse, refurbishment or disassembly in function of component reuse. Where material recycling proves to be the only realistic scenario, newly emerging self-disassembly techniques could help to improve the feasibility of pure material fraction separation before shredding is applied. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Thermal fatigue is a {{significant}} long-term degradation mechanism in nuclear power plants. In particular, as operating plants become older and <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> activities are initiated, operators and regulators need screening criteria to exclude risks of thermal fatigue and methods to determine significant fatigue relevance. In general, the common thermal fatigue issues are well understood and controlled by plant instrumentation at fatigue susceptible locations.

Therefore, in this study thermal fatigue evaluation of piping system Tee-connections is performed using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. From the thermal hydraulic analysis, the temperature distributions are determined and their results are applied to the structural model of the piping system to determine the thermal stress. Using the rain-flow method the fatigue analysis is performed to generate fatigue usage factors.

Assuming that each feature represents a sensor in the wireless sensor network, various data sets with multiple features are considered to show that feature ranking and selection could play a key role for the energy management. We have examined Isolet, ionosphere and forest cover type datasets from the UCI repository to emulate the wireless sensor network scenario. From our simulation results, we show {{that it is possible to}} achieve two important objectives using the proposed scheme: (1) Increase the lifetime of the wireless sensor network, by using optimal number of sensors, and (2) Manage sensor failures with optimal number of sensors without compromising the accuracy.

40|$|Maximum {{power point}} {{tracking}} (MPPT) is commonly {{being used in}} solar-photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems to maximise solar energy extraction. In this paper it is proposed to operate the solar-PV system at the suboptimal MPPT to manage power balance in a remote area power supply (RAPS) system. This is performed based on three different operating modes: 1) Frequency control mode; 2) Active power control mode; 3) MPPT control mode. The operating modes are decided based on the load level and the operating mode of the diesel generator (i. e. synchronous condenser mode or generator mode). This power management strategy balances the generation and load demand that requires transition between the three operating modes without using the dummy load. The proposed strategy is capable of extending the diesel generator life time and improves the operating efficiency of the diesel generator. Simulation studies are carried out to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} suboptimal MPPT control strategy in a PV-Diesel RAPS system, and have shown that the proposed strategy can seamlessly maintain power balance in the RAPS system while maintaining the voltage and frequency within stipulated limits. Substantial cost savings can also be achieved in long run due to the <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> and efficiency improvement of the diesel generator...|$|E

Cracks influence the rate of chloride penetration, but the frequency and width distributions of cracks indicate that cracks are not likely to shorten the overall service life of most bridge decks in Virginia. Altogether, 141 drilled cores, 102 mm (4 inches) in diameter, were employed in this study.

Specimens were tested after processing and systematic pre-ageing, respectively. The LCF tests were interrupted after defined number of cycles, and the specimens were investigated by microscopic and microanalytic methods for characterizing the effect of systematic pre-ageing on crack initiation and propagation. The microstructural evolution due to ageing only has been systematically investigated on separate specimens {{in order to achieve}} information on interaction between fatigue and ageing. Main observations were (1) due to pre-aging a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer formed on the coating surface, and at the interface between substrate and coating a diffusion zone with intermetallic phases evolved, (2) fatigue cracks were initiated at the oxidized surface, predominantly at rumpling instabilities of the TGO, and (3) crack propagation was influenced by the spatial distribution and morphology of intermetallic phases in the diffusion zone between coating and substrate.

40|$|Acoustic fatigue is {{the result}} of high {{frequency}} lateral vibration of an aircraft panel due to time varying pressure waves caused by engine and/or aerodynamic effects. For example, acoustically induced cracks have been recorded in the lower external surface of the nacelle skin of the F/A- 18 aircraft and aft fuselage. In the case of the inlet nacelle overall sound pressure levels of the order of 172 dB have been recorded. Attempts to repair these cracks by applying standard methods of bonded repair developed for in-plane loads were made. However, the cracks continued to grow at a similar rate. While the repair of cracked aircraft structures subjected to in-plane loads using bonded repairs has resulted in considerable aircraft <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> and hence cost savings, the use of bonded patches to repair panels with acoustically induced cracks (acoustic fatigue) is only recent. In this report a generic design procedure is presented for the repair of panels containing acoustically induced cracks using constrained layer damping (CLD). The application of bonded repairs to acoustically-induced cracks requires analytical tools that take into account high frequency out-of-plane vibration. The analytical tools described in the report will enable the rapid design of effective repairs using closed form solutions. A potential outcome for this study could be application to the repair of the batch 11 F/A- 18 aircraft which suffer from acoustic fatigue cracking on the aft fuselage.

Therefore, increasing accuracy in understanding and predicting two-phase flows across the tube bundle is required. Nonetheless, {{due to the}} device complexity (around 6000 tubes), industrial computational tools are based on porous medium concept, which means solid obstacles are homogenized inside a homogenization cell. Consequently, studies describe the flow in the subchannel scale, and predictive models are either founded on two-fluid approach (balance equations for both phase) or homogeneous model (mixture balance equations). However, current trend turns towards CFD tools in open medium {{to go beyond the}} limits of the component scale for a finer description of the flow.

Experimentally, void fraction and interfacial velocity inside a central subchannel are measured by bi-optical probes. Numerical simulation is performed with the NEPTUNE_CFD module for open medium. It offers advanced physical models (two-fluid model in the present case combined with interfacial area transport and turbulence). Then, in order to assess the information feedback from CFD analysis (at local scale) to industrial softwares (at component scale), an analysis of predicted kinematic disequilibrium at both scales, local scale (computed with two-fluid model in open medium) and subchannel scale (computed with homogeneous model in porous medium) is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power plant}} (NPP) {{operators}} have several basic long-term liabilities. Such liabilities include storage, treatment {{and disposal of}} radioactive waste generated at the operators’ NPP, storage and management of nuclear fuel irradiated in the reactor of the operator’s NPP (“spent fuel”), disposal of the spent fuel (SF) or residues resulting from spent fuel reprocessing. Last but not least, the operator is liable for decommissioning its nuclear facilities. If the operator considers extending the life time of its NPP or if {{the construction of a}} new NPP is being evaluated by an investor, an integral part of the economic evaluation must be a comprehensive assessment of future incremental costs related to the above-mentioned long-term liabilities. An economic evaluation performed by standard methods (usually NPV, alternatively real options) leads to a decision either to proceed with the project or to shelve it. If the investor decides to go ahead with the project there can be an immediate impact on nuclear liabilities. The impact is not the same for all operator liabilities. Depending on the valid legislation and the nature of the liability, in some cases the extent of the liability must be immediately recalculated when a decision is made to proceed with the project, and the annual accrual of accumulated reserves / funds must be adjusted. In other cases, the change in liability is linked to the generation of additional radioactive waste or spent fuel. In the Czech Republic, responsibility for each of the nuclear liabilities is defined, as is the form in which the financial means are to be accumulated.

Removing the surface discontinuities after a certain number of load cycles generally leads to a <b>life</b> <b>time</b> <b>extension</b> of the component.
