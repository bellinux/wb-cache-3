5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and <b>latitude</b> or celestial longitude and <b>latitude,</b> {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. <b>Latitude</b> is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° <b>latitude.</b> For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when the angular velocity varies with <b>latitude.</b> Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing <b>latitude.</b> However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993. The first such star, other than the Sun, to have its {{differential rotation}} mapped in detail is AB Doradus.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on <b>latitude</b> and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing <b>latitude</b> on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E

5|$|Although at {{an unusual}} <b>latitude,</b> the storm {{maintained}} this intensity {{for over a}} day before weakening to a tropical storm. During the afternoon of August13, the small system re-intensified into a hurricane. Reconnaissance reported that gale-force winds extended no more than 100mi (155km) from the storm's eye. Shortly thereafter, the system further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 105mph (160km/h). Weather maps at the time depicted the storm as having a minimum pressure of 987mbar (hPa). By August14, the storm began to weaken once more, gradually becoming a tropical storm on August15.

5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} <b>latitude</b> the Andean Dry Diagonal {{crosses the}} Andes. At this <b>latitude,</b> {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E

40|$|We {{retrieved}} global distributions {{and optical}} properties of stratospheric aerosols on Jupiter from ground-based NIR spectra and multiple-phase-angle images from Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). A high-latitude haze layer {{is located at}} ∼ 10 – 20 mbar, {{higher than in the}} middle and low <b>latitudes</b> (∼ 50 mbar). Compact sub-micron particles are mainly located in the low <b>latitudes</b> between 40 °S and 25 °N with the particle radius between 0. 2 and 0. 5 μm. The rest of the stratosphere is covered by the particles known as fractal aggregates. In the nominal case with the imaginary part of the UV refractive index 0. 02, the fractal aggregates are composed of about a thousand 10 -nm-size monomers. The column density of the aerosols at pressure less than 100 mbar ranges from ∼ 10 ^ 7 cm^(− 2) at low <b>latitudes</b> to ∼ 10 ^ 9 cm^(− 2) at high <b>latitudes.</b> The mass loading of aerosols in the stratosphere is ∼ 10 ^(− 6) g cm^(− 2) at low <b>latitudes</b> to ∼ 10 ^(− 4) g cm^(− 2) in the high <b>latitudes.</b> Multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the imaginary part of the refractive index are discussed. The stratospheric haze optical depths increase from ∼ 0. 03 at low <b>latitudes</b> to about a few at high <b>latitudes</b> in the UV wavelength (∼ 0. 26 μm), and from ∼ 0. 03 at low <b>latitudes</b> to ∼ 0. 1 at high <b>latitudes</b> in the NIR wavelength (∼ 0. 9 μm) ...|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{completed}} the largest loop ever observed over the Atlantic Ocean, spanning approximately 5degrees <b>latitude</b> by 8degrees longitude. The storm {{is currently the}} ninth longest-lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean (lasting 19.75days), and is also the second longest-lived Atlantic storm during August (the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco). Also, Alberto is the third farthest-travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500miles), only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie, being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high <b>latitude,</b> up to 53˚N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.|$|E
5|$|On May 15, 2014, {{the journal}} Nature {{published}} a peer-reviewed submission from October 2013 by James P. Kossin, Kerry A. Emanuel, and Gabriel A. Vecchi {{that suggests that}} a poleward migration exists for the paths of maximum intensity of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The focus of the report is on the <b>latitude</b> at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity. Their data indicates that during the past thirty years, the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres {{at a rate of}} approximately 60km per decade, amounting to approximately one degree of <b>latitude</b> per decade.|$|E
5|$|Other storms were {{individually}} unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category5 intensity, {{but neither}} caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto {{had no effect}} on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high <b>latitude.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another climate-related {{hypothesis}} is the climate harshness hypothesis, which states the latitudinal diversity gradient may exist simply because fewer species can physiologically tolerate conditions at higher <b>latitudes</b> than at low <b>latitudes</b> because higher <b>latitudes</b> are often colder and drier than tropical <b>latitudes.</b> Currie et al. (2004) found fault with this hypothesis by stating that, {{although it is}} clear that climatic tolerance can limit species distributions, it appears that species are often absent from areas whose climate they can tolerate.|$|R

5|$|The Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is an {{area between}} 14–28° {{southern}} <b>latitude</b> where volcanic activity dates to the Eocene. Ignimbritic activity has occurred over the whole area, particularly north of 25° southern <b>latitude</b> where the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is situated. Ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate shoshonite. The more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content. With {{the exception of the}} Luingo caldera and Cerro Galán, most volcanism south of 25° southern <b>latitude</b> is of low volume. After a phase of pyroclastic activity in the Antofalla area during the Eocene, a number of volcanoes formed from calc-alkaline magmas during the Miocene. Changes in subduction geometry including the removal of continental crust from the boundary 8-3 mya have caused a thickening of the crust as well as an eastward shift of the volcanic front. Huaynaputina volcano in Peru is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and had a major eruption in 1600.|$|E
