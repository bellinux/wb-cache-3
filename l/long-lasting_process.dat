40|$|Direct field {{observations}} of fine-scaled biological processes and interactions of the benthic community of corals and associated reef organisms (e. g., feeding, reproduction, mutualistic or agonistic behavior, behavioral responses to changing abiotic factors) usually involve a disturbing intervention. Modern digital camcorders (without inflexible land-or ship-based cable connection) {{such as the}} GoPro camera enable undisturbed and unmanned, stationary close-up observations. Such observations, however, are also very time-limited (~ 3 h) and full 24 h-recordings throughout day and night, including nocturnal observations without artificial daylight illumination, are not possible.

This system includes nocturnal close-up observations with miniature infrared (IR) -sensitive cameras and separate high-power IR-LEDs. Integrating this easy-to-set up and portable remote-sensing equipment into coral reef research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of fine-scaled biotic processes on coral reefs.

40|$|Abstract: The {{designing}} of IT {{support for}} the management of inter-organizational service processes inherits the full complexity of aspects dealt with in approaches altering, automating, and supporting these processes in general – and it needs to go beyond. As customer concerns, especially in <b>long-lasting</b> <b>processes,</b> may change over time, support has to provide flexible service, adjustments among different providers, and opportunities to care for the customer. With Serviceflow Management (SFM) we argue in favor of putting these service-related aspects in the center of modeling, design and architectures. Its conceptual distinction between the serviceflow (as the portion of the process where the customer’s concern is evaluated and cared for) and background processes enables SFM (1) to guide providers as well as designers to focus on service design and delivery, (2) to provide support for serviceflows with enhanced flexibility and service configuration, and (3) to suggest the design of service points where service workers and customers “meet”. Thus the original workflow metaphor, which directs the design of process support from a mass production point of view, is questioned and replaced by a more suitable concept, which considers social and quality aspects in service delivery. Instance-based XML process representations, generic components and architectures for their exchange {{as well as for the}} provision of service tasks are presented and discussed, exemplified by an e-health process...|$|R

This article gives {{the example of}} the Netherlands and shows that this European country strives to optimize the well-being of its population in terms of health, income, and labor participation. The Dutch population is among the youngest in an ageing Europe and will continue to grow for the time being. Population density is high, making space a critical issue. Many people would prefer a less populated country. Fertility is more or less stable at below-replacement levels without indications for major change. Women have their children at relatively advanced ages. The decline of the youngest population has more or less run its course, while the main thrust of population ageing is yet to come. No specific demographic targets have been set, or changed, in view of the emerging population decline, although a stationary population is viewed as most desirable. Policies will remain accommodative rather than directive. Lifelong education is promoted, female labor force participation has increased substantially over the past few decades, popularizing the one-and-a-half-income family (father working full-time, mother working part-time). However, concerns over late parenthood are increasing. Due to labor force commitments and the lack of child care facilities many young adults postpone having their babies. Family policies aim at making family and labor market careers more compatible. 1...|$|R
40|$|In a study among Finnish metal {{industry}} employees (n = 748) mental strain was {{measured at the}} beginning {{and at the end of}} a 5 -year follow-up. Life event data for the follow-up period were gathered retrospectively through a questionnaire and a later interview. Mental strain was substantially higher among blue-collar than white-collar workers. In contrast, no differences in the occurrence or in the rating of life events was observed between these groups. Self-rated undesirable events were associated with high levels and desirable events with low levels of mental strain. Similar associations were observed in three objectively defined live events, viz. divorce, promotion in the job and change in housing conditions. Life events were, however, also related with the mental strain measured prior to the life events. Both the self-rated and objectively defined desirable events had usually a favourable impact on mental well-being, whereas undesirable events in most cases slightly increased mental strain. The differences in mental strain between occupational status groups seem to be caused by differences in the life processes rather than life events. Furthermore, many life events, e. g. divorce, are actually only discrete moments in <b>long-lasting</b> <b>processes,</b> which have an impact on mental well-being.

40|$|The 1 /f-noise is {{considered}} {{which has no}} relation to <b>long-lasting</b> <b>processes</b> but originates from the same dynamical mechanisms as what {{are responsible for the}} loss of memory, fast relaxation and usual shot noise. The universal long-range statistics of memoryless random flows of events and of related Brownian motion is analysed whose peculiarity is close connection between spectral properties and non-Gaussian probabilistic properties both determined by only short-range characteristic time scales. The exact relations between equilibrium and non-equilibrium 1 /f-noise in thermodynamical systems are presented. The existence of long-living higher-order correlations and flicker noise in the Kac's ring model is demonstrated. It is shown that conventional Boltzmannian gas kinetics losses 1 /f-noise because incorrectly takes into account the conservation of particles and probabilities in collision events. The correctly performed translation of BBGKY hierarchy into kinetical language, under Boltzmann-Grad limit, results in infinite chain of kinetical equations which describe probability distributions on the hypersurfaces corresponding to encounters and collisions of particles. These equations can be reduced to Boltzmann's equation only in the limit of spatially uniform gas, but generally forbid the molecular chaos. If being applied to Brownian motion of gas particles, the theory yields 1 /f fluctuations of self-diffusivity and mobility. This is example of Hamiltonian dynamics which produces 1 /f-noise without any slow processes and long life-times. Comment: 41 pages, 0 figures, LaTeX(RevTex...|$|R

To identify {{the mechanism of}} these <b>long-lasting</b> <b>processes,</b> we checked the density of mu opioid receptors, receptor-G-protein coupling and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) cascade. In morphine-sensitized animals mu opioid receptor autoradiography revealed {{a significant increase in}} the caudate putamen (30 % versus controls), nucleus accumbens shell (16 %), prefrontal and frontal cortex (26 %), medial thalamus (43 %), hypothalamus (200 %) and central gray (89 %). Concerning morphine's activation of G proteins in the brain, investigated in the guanylyl 5 '-[gamma-(35) S]thio]triphosphate ([(35) S]GTPgammaS) binding assay, a significant increase in net [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding was seen in the caudate putamen (39 %) and hypothalamus (27 %). In the caudate putamen this was due to an increase in the amount of activated G proteins, and in the hypothalamus to a greater affinity of G proteins for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The main second messenger system linked to the opioid receptor is the cAMP pathway. In the striatum basal cAMP levels were significantly elevated in sensitized animals (70 % versus controls) and [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5) -ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in control (30 %) but not in sensitized rats. In the hypothalamus no significant changes were observed in basal cAMP levels and DAMGO inhibition.

30|$|The {{discussed}} studies {{provide evidence}} that the determinants of planned retirement and retirement expectations are manifold and interrelated. Generally speaking, planning for retirement is a complex and <b>long-lasting</b> <b>process</b> and is often subject to adjustments over time, be it due to changes in national pension regulations, changes in health or altered financial conditions (Montalto et al. 2000). Despite the complexity of this particular topic, however, retirement expectations of individuals are solid and comply with actual retirement outcomes. Accordingly, several empirical studies (e.g., Bernheim 1987; Benitez-Silva and Dwyer 2005; Disney and Tanner 1999) have shown that expected dates of retirement are relatively accurate. Thus, analyzing planned retirement rather than actual retirement can provide important insights into the retirement timing process.|$|E

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) and subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. Following the initial insult, patients may deteriorate due to secondary brain damage. The underlying molecular and cellular cascades incorporate {{components of the}} innate immune system. There are different approaches to assess and monitor cerebral inflammation in the neuro intensive care unit. The aim of this narrative review is to describe techniques to monitor inflammatory activity in patients with TBI and SAH in the acute setting. The analysis of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in compartments of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), including the cerebrospinal fluid and the extracellular fluid, represent the most common approaches to monitor surrogate markers of cerebral inflammatory activity. Each of these compartments has a distinct biology that reflects local processes and the cross-talk between systemic and CNS inflammation. Cytokines have been correlated to outcomes as well as ongoing, secondary injury progression. Alongside the dynamic, focal assay of humoral mediators, imaging, through positron emission tomography, can provide a global in vivo measurement of inflammatory cell activity, which reveals <b>long-lasting</b> <b>processes</b> following the initial injury. Compared to the innate immune system activated acutely after brain injury, the adaptive immune system is likely to play a greater role in the chronic phase as evidenced by T-cell-mediated autoreactivity toward brain-specific proteins. The most difficult aspect of assessing neuroinflammation is to determine whether the processes monitored are harmful or beneficial to the brain as accumulating data indicate a dual role for these inflammatory cascades following injury. In summary, the inflammatory component of the complex injury cascade following brain injury may be monitored using different modalities. Using a multimodal monitoring approach can potentially aid in the development of therapeutics targeting different aspects of the inflammatory cascade and improve the outcome following TBI and SAH...|$|R
