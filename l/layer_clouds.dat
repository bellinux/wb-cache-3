40|$|The {{relationship}} between cloud and aerosol properties was investigated over two 4 ° × 4 ° adjacent {{regions in the}} south (R 1) and in the north (R 2) in eastern China. The CloudSat/CALIPSO data were used to extract the cloud and aerosol profiles properties. The mean value of cloud occurrence probability (COP) was {{the highest in the}} mixed <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> (− 40 °C~ 0 °C) and the lowest in the warm <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> (> 0 °C). The atmospheric humidity was more statistically relevant to COP in the warm <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> than aerosol condition. The differences in COP between the two regions in the mixed <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> and ice <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> (<− 40 °C) had good correlations with those in the aerosol extinction coefficient.

40|$|Our need to {{reconcile}} models and measurements in an efficient manner {{that allows for}} the operational retrieval of particle sizes for a two <b>layer</b> <b>cloud</b> led us {{to develop a new}} method for calculating the Green's functions for radiative transfer. The method uses the fact that doubling/adding codes can be easily used to calculate internal radiation fields at arbitrarily high resolution. We have also determined that the adjoint downwelling and upwelling vector radiation fields are simply related to the usual downwelling and upwelling vector radiation fields so that the entire Green's function can be determined from a single calculation. The Green's functions have then been used to calculate the particle sizes in a two <b>layer</b> <b>cloud</b> that are consistent with both the reflectance and polarization measurements. This approach may be of use in other applications where adjoint calculations are used, particularly if multiangle measurements are being analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Satellite {{measurements}} {{have the}} advantage of being able to sample meteorological variables in regions that have little measurement systems. Many instruments have been created to help observe the atmosphere for both research and weather prediction. One of the first successful satellite missions for weather radar observations was the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS). This instrument paved the way for more weather satellite systems that utilize the visible, infrared and microwave radiation spectrum. Current remote sensing instruments that can help detect planetary boundary layer phenomenon include the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua as well as CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) aboard CALIPSO. While MODIS and many other satellites are passive remote sensors, active remote sensors such as CALIPSO provide greater accuracy for height retrievals. Satellite measurements have been used to determine the dynamical conditions that produce planetary boundary <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> and the climatological regions of where these clouds occur.|$|E
5000|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to change the distribution and type of clouds. [...] Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so exert a warming effect; seen from above, clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space, and so exert a cooling effect. Cloud representations vary among global climate models, and small changes in cloud cover have a large impact on the climate. Differences in planetary boundary layer cloud modeling schemes can lead to large differences in derived values of climate sensitivity. A model that decreases boundary <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> in response to global warming has a climate sensitivity twice that of a model {{that does not include}} this feedback. However, satellite data show that cloud optical thickness actually increases with increasing temperature. Whether the net effect is warming or cooling depends on details such as the type and altitude of the cloud; details that are difficult to represent in climate models.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inversion}} layer {{is crucial to}} the formation of the marine stratus that produce June Gloom. Compression and warming of air sinking out of the North Pacific High-pressure system (which is strongest during the summer) meets with the rising, cooling air from the sea surface, producing a very stable layer of air that caps the cool air from rising any further. The strength of this subsidence inversion affects the strength of the marine layer, and {{how long it will take}} the clouds to dissipate. Additionally, the cool ocean water of the California Current, which flows out of the cold Gulf of Alaska, enhances the contrast between the cool air below the {{inversion layer}} and the warm air above it. A stronger inversion layer - one with a greater difference in temperature between the air above and the air below - often results in more and deeper marine <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> that persist longer into the day. Upwelling of colder-than-normal ocean water, associated with a La Niña, can strengthen this effect even more.|$|E

40|$|A {{regional}} model {{is used to}} study the radiative effect of boundary <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> over the southeast Pacific on large-scale atmosphere circulation during August–October 1999. With the standard settings, the model simulates reasonably well the large-scale circulation over the eastern Pacific, precipitation in the intertropi-cal convergence zone (ITCZ) north of the equator, and marine boundary layer stratocumulus clouds to the south. In a sensitivity experiment with the radiative effect of liquid clouds south of the equator over the eastern Pacific artificially removed, boundary <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> south of the equator almost disappear and precipitation in the ITCZ is reduced by 15 %– 20 %, indicating that the stratocumulus clouds over the southeast Pacific have both local and cross-equatorial effects. Examination {{of the differences between}} the control and sensitivity experiments indicates that clouds exert a net diabatic cooling in the inversion layer. In response to this cloud-induced cooling, an in situ anomalous high pressure system develops in the boundary layer and an anomalous shallow meridional circulation develops in the lower troposphere over the equatorial eastern Pacific. At the lower branch of this shallow circulation, anomalous boundary layer southerlies blow from the boundary layer high toward the northern ITCZ where the air ascends. An anomalous returning flow (northerly) just above the cloud layer closes the shallow circulation. This low-level anomalous shallow circulation enhances the subsidence over the southeast Pacific above the cloud layer, helping to maintain boundary <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> and temperature inversion there. Meanwhile, the strengthened cross-equatorial flow near the surface enhances moisture convergence and convection in the ITCZ north of the equator. This in turn strengthens the local, deep Hadley circulation and hence the large-scale subsidence and boundary <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> over the southeast Pacific. This positive feedback there-fore enhances the interhemispheric climate asymmetry over the tropical eastern Pacific. 1...|$|E

40|$|Mixed-phase <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> are radiatively {{important}} and their correct representation in numerical {{models of the}} atmosphere is needed for both weather forecasts and climate prediction. In particular, midlevel mixed-phase <b>layer</b> <b>clouds</b> (altocumulus) are often poorly predicted. Here the representation of altocumulus cloud in five operational models and the ERA-Interim reanalysis is evaluated using ground-based remote sensors. All models are found to underestimate the supercooled liquid water content by at least a factor of 2. The models with the most sophisticated microphysics (separate prognostic variables for liquid and ice) had least supercooled liquid of all models, though they could simulate the correct liquid-over-ice structure of individual clouds. To investigate {{the reasons for the}} lack of predicted supercooled liquid water, a single-column model (EMPIRE) was developed incorporating the relevant physical processes for altocumulus cloud. The supercooled liquid water was found to be the most sensitive to factors that significantly affect the glaciation rate, including aspects of the ice microphysics formulation, as well as the model vertical resolution. Using observations to improve the ice particle size distribution formulation and the parametrization of ice cloud fraction also lead to a significant increase in supercooled liquid water in the simulated clouds. The study highlights the main parameterized processes that need careful attention in large-scale models in order to adequately represent the liquid phase in mixed-phase <b>layer</b> <b>clouds.</b> In Part 2, the reason for the sensitivity to vertical resolution is investigated and a new parameterization for models with coarse vertical resolution is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} gain {{understanding}} of what processes influence the cloud fraction of altocumulus clouds. Our starting point is a cloud system observed on 25 June 1996 during the CLEX- 1 field experiment. This two-layered system comprised a partly cloudy cu-muliform layer located about 500 meters below an over-cast stratiform <b>layer.</b> This <b>cloud</b> system was docu-mented with aircraft data and simulated in three di-mensions with high resolution using the COAMPS-LES model. Given observed initial atmospheric profiles, the model successfully simulates the qualitative structure of the layered system, although the modeled cumuliform <b>layer</b> has less <b>cloud</b> fraction, liquid water, and turbu-lence than the observations. Next, sensitivity studies were performed using the COAMPS-LES model. These gave evidence that par-tial cloudiness in our simulations is caused primarily by conditional instability and the consequent vertical mo-tions of air parcels within the layer. This mechanism {{is complicated by the}} presence of radiative heating and cooling. When the lower <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> is heated radiatively throughout its entire depth, it becomes conditionally unstable and partly cloudy. This is true even if the layer is initially overcast and abso-lutely stable, and even if the radiative heating rates are small. However, the entire lower layer heats only if there is an upper <b>cloud</b> <b>layer</b> above. If the upper layer is re-moved, then the lower <b>layer</b> <b>cloud</b> top cools strongly to space, and the lower layer remains overcast. Through this radiative effect, {{the presence or absence of}} an up-per <b>layer</b> influences the <b>cloud</b> fraction of a lower layer, even though the two layers are spatially separated and have little dynamical interaction. 1...|$|R
