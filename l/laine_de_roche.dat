50|$|Everett <b>de</b> <b>Roche</b> {{originally}} did a 400-page {{first draft}} {{in which the}} central character, Gregory Wolfe, was a priest. When the producers sent the script to the US, they were worried that this would make the film hard to market in Catholic countries so it was changed. The script was given to some American writers to work on but Wincer was {{not happy with the}} changes. As <b>de</b> <b>Roche</b> was not available, Wincer went over the script with Russell Hagg although he later said he would have preferred it if <b>de</b> <b>Roche</b> had done the job.|$|R
50|$|While {{making the}} film Patrick Richard Franklin gave Everett <b>De</b> <b>Roche</b> {{a copy of}} Rear Window {{as an example of}} how he wanted the script typed. <b>De</b> <b>Roche</b> loved the content of the script and {{expressed}} his desire to write a film with a similar plot but set on a moving vehicle. He developed the idea with Franklin in Fiji, where the latter was co-producing The Blue Lagoon (1980). <b>De</b> <b>Roche</b> wrote the first draft of Road Games over a period of 8 days in a hotel, with Franklin visiting periodically during breaks in the production of Blue Lagoon.|$|R

50|$|Franklin {{returned}} to Australia in the 1970s, when the country's film industry was experiencing a resurgence. He directed four episodes of the Australian police drama Homicide before directing the bawdy 1975 sex comedy feature The True Story of Eskimo Nell and the 1976 soft-core pornography feature Fantasm. Franklin's next film was the cult horror movie Patrick (1978), written by Everett <b>De</b> <b>Roche,</b> {{about a man}} in a coma who uses telekinesis to create murder and mayhem in a hospital. Franklin gave <b>De</b> <b>Roche</b> a copy of the screenplay of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1958), and <b>De</b> <b>Roche</b> suggested a movie with the plot of Rear Window taking place in a moving vehicle. The result was Roadgames (1981), directed by Franklin from a screenplay by <b>De</b> <b>Roche.</b> Filmed and set in Australia, and starring American actors Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis (the latter whom Franklin met whilst visiting his one-time USC classmate John Carpenter on the set of The Fog), Roadgames was the most expensive Australian movie ever made {{at the time of its}} release in 1981.|$|R

50|$|Ginnane had {{originally}} intended {{to make a film}} after Patrick called Centrefold, based on a script by Chris Fitchett, and raised money for it.

Ginnane then commissioned Everett <b>de</b> <b>Roche</b> to write a new screenplay. Wincer says he and <b>de</b> <b>Roche</b> re-wrote it in three weeks, and the film took eleven weeks from the first day of shooting until sitting down with the release print.|$|R
