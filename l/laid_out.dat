5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E
