Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred too <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and {{the front page of}} the 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian action {{prompted}} {{an intervention}} {{from the federal}} Yugoslav government. Borisav Jović, the Serbian representative on the collective Presidency of Yugoslavia, supported a request by Yugoslav Defence Minister Veljko Kadijević to send the JNA to the scene. The first ten JNA tanks arrived in Pakrac <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of 1 March and took positions {{in various parts of}} the town; most of them were stationed near the town hospital. The next afternoon, an additional JNA unit led by Colonel Milan Čeleketić arrived in Pakrac, taking positions close to the Croatian special police. Čeleketić was acting on the orders of Major General Jevrem Cokić, commander of the 32nd (Varaždin) Corps. Cokić authorised deployment of three companies of the armoured battalion of the 265th Mechanised Brigade based in Bjelovar.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, Croatian forces {{managed to}} interdict radio {{communications}} between the 32nd Mechanised Brigade artillery and its artillery observers, {{and set up}} their own transmitter to direct JNA artillery fire against the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks. This deception was designed to deceive Davidović into thinking that the ZNG had much greater firepower than it did. The plan worked and when ZNG troops entered the barracks compound that day, the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment (four officers and 196 soldiers) surrendered. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of 19 September, Croatian police and elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 104th Brigade secured the Varaždinbreg weapons storage facility located in the village of Banjšćina near Varaždin, after its JNA commander surrendered the facility and its garrison of 60 without resistance. The capture of JNA weapons greatly improved the Croatian position in negotiations when trying to convince JNA commanding officers of the 32nd Corps to surrender.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Nebi Samuel has officially been {{identified}} by the British as beginning on 17 November and finishing on 24 November 1917. But until 21 November infantry from the 75th Division was still continuing its advance towards Bireh. On that day, as the infantry division turned north east cutting {{across the front of}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division, their progress was blocked at Biddu by Ottoman forces entrenched on the height of Nebi Samuel, dominating Jerusalem and its defences. This hill, the traditional site of the tomb of the Prophet Samuel, was taken <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> by the 234th Brigade, 75th Division, after fierce fighting. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had taken the more difficult line, while the 75th Division was directed to the south western approaches. Several counterattacks by Ottoman forces during the following days failed. In close fighting, Ottoman soldiers strongly counterattacked, reaching the gates of the mosque before Gurkha infantry fought them off. Fevzi's Seventh Army had fought Allenby's two infantry divisions to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Shiloh, {{also known}} as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, was a major battle in the Western Theater of the American Civil War, fought April 6–7, 1862, in southwestern Tennessee. A Union force known as the Army of the Tennessee under Major General Ulysses S. Grant had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee on the west bank of that river, where the Confederate Army of Mississippi, under General Albert Sidney Johnston and second-in-command P. G. T. Beauregard, {{launched}} a surprise attack on Grant's army from its base in Corinth, Mississippi. Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting; Beauregard, who thus succeeded to command of the army, decided against pressing the attack <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> Overnight Grant was reinforced by one of his own divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from another Union army under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. This allowed them to launch an unexpected counterattack the next morning which completely reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day.|$|E
5|$|The French {{high command}} {{had not been}} idle during the {{destruction}} of their invasion force, and had prepared and despatched a second squadron of four frigates under Commodore Daniel Savary. This force was initially ordered to support Bompart, but was later tasked with escorting the squadron's survivors back to France. On 27 October, Savary learnt {{of the destruction of}} both Bompart's squadron and the Irish rebellion from sympathetic locals at Killala, and turned immediately south, hoping to avoid a similar fate. However, on 28 October, he was spotted by a three-ship squadron under Captain Sir James Saumarez, which included two ships of the line. Saumarez immediately gave chase, and the squadrons exchanged long-distance cannon fire throughout the day. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> Saumarez's flagship HMS Caesar lost its foretopmast in strong winds, and command passed to Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Bt., in HMS Terrible.|$|E

2500|$|To mate, M. mexicanus winged queens {{and males}} emerge from an {{existing}} colony and swarm in nuptial flights. These flights occur <b>in</b> <b>late</b> July <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> typically {{at about the}} same time of day when the colony workers begin foraging. The flights usually occur the day after a rain. A normal nuptial flight lasts about an hour and half. After the flight, unmated queens and males return to the nest. The fact that some queens and males return from these flights unmated suggests that aerial union is difficult. [...] The mated queens lose their wings, and the mated males die.|$|R
2500|$|When the R-2800 was {{introduced}} in 1939, it was capable of producing , for a specific power value of 0.71hp/in³ (32.6kW/L).

5|$|Counter-attacks by the 4th Guards Division, {{reinforced}} by {{a battalion of}} the 220th Division, forced the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade back to the start line. On the right flank, one unit of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered {{a large number of}} shellfire casualties, while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire as it neared its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> and a salient was created in the 4th Canadian Division line. On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful. An additional attack planned for 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking a slagheap called Green Crassier and the mine complex at Fosse St. Louis. The attack was repulsed, with the majority of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In September 1991, the {{government}} changed the {{policy for the}} military's procurement of air transport from 1 April 1992. This involved that the transport of 200,000 people annually would be transferred to scheduled services, resulting in Norway Airlines losing the opportunity to extend its engagement with the military. The route from Oslo to London was introduced on 3 October, at first with four weekly services, increasing to nine from 23 October. The three partner airlines launched their alliance as the TransNordic Group and would use a bowler hat as their common symbol. However, the routes arrived so <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> that the last flights from Fornebu to Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger and Tromsø had all departed. After five months the airline had achieved a 55-percent cabin factor on the London route. The ministry rejected in December 1991 the airline's application for flying to Stockholm and Copenhagen. By December the British airline Dan-Air had also established itself on the Oslo–London route. To meet the price competition, SAS launched discounted business class tickets. In the course of twelve months from late 1991 to late 1992, the capacity between Oslo and London doubled, as also Norsk Air introduced a service from Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} Shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E
