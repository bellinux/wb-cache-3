2500|$|Several {{minutes after}} the first tornado dissipated, a second larger funnel touched down North of Edwardsville, Kansas. It {{initially}} produced light damage (F0 to F1); however, 2 homes were almost destroyed near I-435, indicating F3 damage. The tornado rapidly intensified and grew to nearly 500 yards in diameter as it passed through Northern Kansas City, Kansas, and a few well constructed homes were leveled near 91st and Leavenworth Road. NWS rated {{this portion of the}} track F4. The only two fatalities attributed to the storm occurred here. To the northeast persistent F2 and F3 damage was observed through 84th street. In the vicinity of 79th Street and Cernech additional F4 damage was produced. Several structures were demolished, and metal power poles engineered to withstand 200mph winds were tossed to the ground. The tornado then crossed the Missouri River into Platte County, Missouri. The path width decreased and high end F1 damage was observed {{for the remainder of the}} tornado's track. It dissipated just to the south of Gladstone, after having traveled for 22 miles. [...] Wyandotte county also had $15.5 million in damage, with 69 buildings destroyed, and 390 suffering damage. <b>Leavenworth</b> <b>county</b> had 9 homes destroyed, 8 with major damage and 17 with minor damage.

40|$|Three {{species of}} shrews {{of the genus}} Blarina inhabit the central and eastern U. S. —B. brevicauda, B. hylophaga, and B. carolinensis. These shrews are quite similar morphologically, and prior to 1972 they were {{considered}} a single species (B. brevi-cauda). Genoways and Choate (1972) and Genoways et al. (1972) separated B. brevi-cauda into two species (B. brevicauda and B. carolinensis) by elevating B. brevicauda carolinensis. Later, George et al. (1981, 1982) split B. carolinensis into two species (B. caroli-nensis and B. hylophaga) based on karyotypic and morpholologic data. They described the distribution of B. brevicauda as extend-ing south to Platte, Randolph, and Ralls counties of Missouri (George et al. 1982), with a broad area of sympatry with B. hy-lophaga occurring across southern Iowa and northern Missouri. Thompson et al. (2011) examined this purported area of sympatry (using karyotypic and nuclear DNA mark-ers) {{and found that the}} two species occurred parapatrically rather than sympatrically. Within their study area, B. hylophaga was found to occur in two counties of southern Iowa (Fremont and Page) and three counties of northern Missouri (Atchison, Holt, and Nodoway). Since shrews from the southern-most extent of their study area (Platte, Clay, and Ray counties) were identified as B. brevi-cauda, the southern limit of the range of B. brevicauda must be south of those counties. Additionally, Webster et al. (2011) extended the distribution of B. brevicauda into north-eastern Kansas (based on morphologic data) where it is considered disjunct, occurring in the valleys of the Kaw River and its tributar-ies in Douglas, Jefferson, and <b>Leavenworth</b> <b>counties.</b> Pfau et al. (2011) used mitochondrial DNA sequences to discover that B. brevi-cauda actually occurs as far south as north...|$|R

40|$|Citation: Christensen, Frederic Waldemar. Detailed {{stratigraphy}} of Kansas coals. A {{review of}} Erasmus Haworth's report on Kansas coals, 1898. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1900. Introduction: The Kansas coals occur in various shales and all positions, from the Cherokee shales {{at the base}} to the Osage shales, 2000 feet above. The order and position of the strata {{is shown in the}} generalized section figure. The Cherokee shales produce greater quantities of coal than any other shale beds in the whole Coal Measures. From these shales, are obtained the coals of Cherokee and Crawford Counties and nearly all of Labette and <b>Leavenworth</b> <b>Counties.</b> Borings, as of wells, show that the Cherokee shales extend over a considerable area west, and the probability is that coal can be found anywhere under the eastern fifty or seventy five miles of the state. The Labette shales, first in order above the Cherokee shales, contain considerable bituminous matter, but no good bed coal. Above this, we have the Pleasanton shales, which contain large quantities of coal, especially in the lower Pleasanton shales. They probably rank next to the Cherokee shales. The Thayer shales carry a considerable amount of coal, especially in the vicinity of Thayer. The Lane shales, next in importance, have no coal as far as is known. Above this are the Lawrence shales, which produce coal enough to be of commercial importance. In Atchison, Jefferson, Douglas, and Franklin counties, coal is mined from these shales. Above the Lawrence shales, the shale beds contain little or no coal, until the Osage shales are reached. The average thickness of this formation is about 200 feet. It extends across the state, from the north to the south. It is rich in coal, and is extensively mined at Burlingame, Osage City, Carbondale, and Scranton. The quantity and quality varies considerably in different sections...|$|R

Research completed at the Department of GeologyTwo siliciclastic-filled (sandstone and shale) paleocaves in the Mississippian (Osagean) Burlington-Keokuk Limestone are exposed in roadcuts in Dade County, Missouri. These caves formed in pre-Atokan time as suggested by their shale and/or sandstone fill, which contains Late Atokan spore and pollen fossil assemblages. These flora, and sedimentologic analysis, suggest that the cave-fill deposits were derived from Late Atokan terrestrial deposits (McLouth Formation) and not Desmoinesian age rocks (Krebs Group) that are exposed nearby.

40|$|General Description: A stout perennial, 2 - 4 feet fall, {{with a heavy}} rootstock. The stem is hollow. The {{lower leaves}} are {{approximately}} 4 inches broad and are divided into 3 - 5 main lobes, each further dissected. The upper leaves are linear and entire or linearly lobed. The diagnostic features include dense yellow hairs on the upper stem and flower cluster and yellowish to purple petals, and purplish sepals that are predominantly streaked with yellow. The long spur of the flowers is generally reddish-purple, although some are pale greenish-yellow. The fruits are to inch long and the chocolate-colored seeds are about c inch long. Identification Tips: Delphinium viridescens {{is one of a}} group of tall Delphinium species that occur in the Wenatchee Mountains. D. viridescens most closely resembles D. multiplex, but may be distinguished using the following characters: D. viridescens is typically 3 - 5 ft. tall; sepals are iridescent purplish-yellow or greenish-yellow; and in some instances, the degree of basal and cauline leaf dissection has been observed to be greater in D. viridescens, although immature specimens of D. viridescens and D. multiplex cannot readily be distinguished on this character. Phenology: Peak anthesis occurs during mid-summer (July). Fruits mature and begin dispersal by late September. Range: Local endemic of the Wenatchee Mountains of WA, in the Eastern Cascades physiographic province. The known range of D. viridescens extends from near <b>Leavenworth,</b> Chelan <b>County</b> southward to the Liberty area in Kittitas County. © 1964 University of Washington Press.
