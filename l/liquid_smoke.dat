50|$|The {{application}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> to food {{has grown to}} encompass {{a wide variety of}} methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> is for the purpose of replacing direct smoking of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of smoke, <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright’s <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of solutions of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of <b>liquid</b> <b>smoke</b> for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous smoke solutions is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into oil, spray drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.|$|E

40|$|Trends in suicide {{mortality}} among Brazilian {{adults and}} elderly, 1980 – 2006 OBJECTIVE: To describe mortality from suicide in Brazil, {{with emphasis on}} the older adult population. METHODS: Temporal analysis and trend analysis by polynomial regression were conducted on suicide in the population above 10 years old in Brazil and the State of Rio de Janeiro (Southeastern Brazil) from 1980 - 2006. The data were extracted from the Mortality Information System, and the rates calculated by gender and age per 100, 000 inhabitants, considering the resident population provided by DATASUS. For the period between 1980 and 1995, the ninth revision of International Statistical Classifi cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems was used, and for 1996 to 2006, the tenth revision. RESULTS: Suicide rates signifi cantly increased in Brazil and in Rio de Janeiro (respectively reaching 5. 7 and 3. 1 deaths per 100, 000 inhabitants in 2006). The change {{was caused by the}} increase in suicides among the male population at all ages. The increase occurred especially among men over 60 years. In Rio de Janeiro, the increase was not statistically signifi cant among men, while there was a decrease among women. The principal means utilized for suicide by men were hanging, suffocation, strangulation and fi rearms. For women, death by hanging also ranks fi rst, followed by ingestion of solids or <b>liquids,</b> <b>smoke</b> or fi re, and jumping from heights. The high rate of suicide by unspecifi ed means reveals problems with data quality. CONCLUSIONS: Suicides are important events in the male population, especially among older men over time.
