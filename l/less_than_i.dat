25|$|One way to {{represent}} permutations of n is by an integer N with 0nbsp&≤nbsp&Nnbsp&<nbsp&n!, provided convenient methods {{are given to}} convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when n is small enough that N can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&12, and for 64-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers d'n, d'n−1, …, d2, d1, where d'i is a non-negative integer <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>i</b> (one may omit d1, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express N in the factorial number system, {{which is just a}} particular mixed radix representation, where for numbers up to n! the bases for successive digits are n, , …, 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a Lehmer code or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.|$|E
500|$|Although Bond's {{life as a}} {{performer}} in the theatre had ended at age 44, she occasionally gave charity concerts thereafter. [...] Unlike Bond's first marriage, her second was a happy one. Initially reluctant to leave London, Bond reported, [...] "We entertained a good deal, and gave hunt lunches and shooting parties of our own, so my time was well filled up, and I missed London <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could have believed." [...] She founded and directed the Newark Amateur Dramatic Society, an amateur dramatic club, whose performances supported local charities. [...] The couple also often visited London and did some travelling abroad.|$|E

On March 31, 2006, he scored his 691st NHL career goal, passing Mario Lemieux for eighth place all-time. Yzerman's humility was evident in an interview regarding his achievement after the game when he was quoted saying, [...] "I don't really know the significance. If anything, it shows how good [...] is; he played almost five years <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did." [...] He scored his final NHL goal, the 692nd of his career, on April 3, 2006, {{in a game against}} Calgary.|$|E

2500|$|Blanchett {{has spoken}} about {{feminism}} and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 {{that she was}} concerned that [...] "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" [...] was threatening women's role in society. She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: [...] "Honestly, I think about my appearance <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did ten years ago. People talk about {{the golden age of}} Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{went into}} the 2015 World Championships in Athletics as the {{favourite}} to win, having achieved higher scores than rival Jessica Ennis-Hill since Hill's return from pregnancy. Despite this, Hill won by 115pts with a season's best 6,669. Theisen-Eaton was disappointed with her silver medal saying [...] "I'm disappointed. I went in as the favourite and I didn't compete how I had to to win gold. And that was my own fault. So I am disappointed with it, {{but there are some}} lessons that I have learned from it that hopefully I can take into next year...I mean, I scored 250 points <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> already have this year, and had I just done the same thing I had done already previously this year, it would have got me a gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the midst}} of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, [...] "I will {{probably}} be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation." [...] According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. [...] "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position {{at the center of the}} Continent." [...] Heilbrunn believes that the adage, [...] "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" [...] has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.|$|E
