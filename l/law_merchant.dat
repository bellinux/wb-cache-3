Section I {{makes the case}} that a distinct set of <b>merchant</b> <b>laws</b> appeared because the character of medieval <b>law</b> forced <b>merchants</b> to acquire special legal protections. Section II develops the argument that merchant custom functioned within a framework of non-customary police power so fundamental that the customs potentially would not have succeeded in regulating commerce absent this assistance.

The conclusion asks what impact this alternative description of the historical <b>merchant</b> <b>law</b> might have on current thinking about commercial law...|$|R
6000|$|One day, as I was {{on shore}} {{refreshing}} myself, there {{comes to me}} an Englishman, who was gunner's mate on board an English East India ship, riding up the river {{near the city of}} Cambodia. Sir, said he, you may wonder at my business, having never seen me in your life; but tho' I am a stranger, I have something to tell you that very nearly concerns you: & indeed it is the imminent danger you are in has moved me to give you this timely notice. [...] "Danger!" [...] said I, [...] "what danger? I know of none, except my ship being leaky, for which I design to have her run aground to-morrow morning" [...] I hope you will be better employed when you shall hear what I have to say to you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen leagues up this river; about three leagues on this side of it, there lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would you venture here without considering what strength you have to engage them? I knew not what he meant by this discourse, and turning short upon him, [...] "Sir," [...] said I, [...] "I know no reason I have to be afraid either of any Dutch or English ships. I am no interloper, and what business have they with me?" [...] Well, Sir, said the man, if you do think yourselves secure, all as I can say, you must take your chance; however, I am very sorry you are so deaf to good advice; but I assure you; if you do not put to sea immediately, you will be attacked by five long-boats full of men, hanged yourself for a pirate, if you are taken, and the particulars examined afterwards. I thought, Sir, added he, I might have met a better reception for such a singular piece of service. [...] "Sir," [...] said I, [...] "I was never ungrateful to any man; but pray explain yourself and I'll go on board this minute, whether the leak be stopped or no." [...] Why, Sir, said he, to be short, because time is precious, the matter is this: You know well enough that you was with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain was murdered by the Malayans, with three of his sailors; and that either you, or some who were on board you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned pirates at sea. Now, Sir, this is the sum of what I had to say: and I can positively assure you, that if you are taken, you will be executed without much ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be sensible what little <b>law</b> <b>merchant</b> ships show to pirates, whenever they fall into their hands.|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on <b>Law</b> <b>Merchant,</b> the Britannica Encyclopedia states: The <b>law</b> <b>merchant</b> was {{developed}} in the early 11th century in order to protect foreign merchants not under the jurisdiction and protection of the local law. Foreign traders often were subject to confiscations and other types of harassment if one of their countrymen had defaulted in a business transaction. A kind of law was also needed by which the traders themselves could negotiate contracts, partnerships, trademarks, and various aspects of buying and selling. The <b>law</b> <b>merchant</b> gradually spread as the traders went from place to place. Their courts, set up by the merchants themselves at trade fairs or in cities, administered a law that was uniform throughout Europe, regardless of differences in national laws and languages. It was based primarily on Roman law, although there were some Germanic influences; it formed the basis for modern commercial law.|$|E

5000|$|Milgrom made early {{contributions}} to the growing literature applying game theoretic models {{to our understanding of}} the evolution of the legal institutions of the market economy. Milgrom, Douglass North and Barry Weingast (1990) presents a repeated game model that shows the role for a formal institution that serves as a repository of judgments about contract behavior to coordinate a multilateral reputation mechanism. Milgrom and his co-authors argued that this model sheds light on the development of the <b>Law</b> <b>Merchant,</b> an institution of late medieval trade in Europe, whereby merchants looked to the judgments of the <b>Law</b> <b>Merchant</b> to decide what counted as [...] "cheating." [...] In their model, merchants query the <b>Law</b> <b>Merchant</b> to determine whether a potential trading partner has cheated on prior contracts, triggering the application of punishment by other merchants. The incentive to punish in this model arises from the structure of the repeated game, assumed to be a prisoners' dilemma, where cheating is the dominant strategy and the only incentive not to cheat is because future partners can learn of this and cheating a cheater is not punishable; this makes the equilibrium sub-game perfect. Understanding the merchants' incentives to create an institution to support decentralized contract enforcement like this helps to overcome the tendency in the law and economics and positive political theory literatures to assume that the role of law is exclusively attributable to the capacity to take advantage of centralized enforcement mechanisms such as state courts and police power.

50|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England, which {{introduced}} Norman legal concepts into medieval England, the English King's powerful judges developed {{a body of}} precedent that became the common law. In particular, Henry II instituted legal reforms and developed a system of royal courts administered by {{a small number of}} judges who lived in Westminster and traveled throughout the kingdom. Henry II also instituted the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, which allowed for jury trials and reduced the number of trials by combat. Louis IX of France also undertook major legal reforms and, inspired by ecclesiastical court procedure, extended Canon-law evidence and inquisitorial-trial systems to the royal courts. Also, judges no longer moved on circuits becoming fixed to their jurisdictions, and jurors were nominated by parties to the legal dispute rather than by the sheriff. In addition, by the 10th century, the <b>Law</b> <b>Merchant,</b> first founded on Scandinavian trade customs, then solidified by the Hanseatic League, took shape so that merchants could trade using familiar standards, rather than the many splintered types of local law.

50|$|Maritime {{insurance}} was {{the earliest}} well-developed kind of insurance, with {{origins in the}} Greek and Roman maritime loan.

Modern marine insurance law originated in the Lex mercatoria (<b>law</b> <b>merchant).</b> In 1601, a specialized chamber of assurance separate from the other Courts was established in England. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a centre for trade was increasing demand for marine insurance.

5000|$|Since 1189, English law {{has been}} {{described}} as a common law rather than a civil law system; in other words, no major codification of the law has taken place and judicial precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. This may be a legacy of the Norman conquest of England, when a number of legal concepts and institutions from Norman law were introduced to England. In the early centuries of English common law, the justices and judges were responsible for adapting the system of writs to meet everyday needs, applying a mixture of precedent and common sense to build up a body of internally consistent law. An example is the <b>Law</b> <b>Merchant</b> derived from the [...] "Pie-Powder" [...] Courts, named from a corruption of the French pieds-poudrés ("dusty feet") implying ad hoc marketplace courts.
