2500|$|The {{release of}} a new {{television}} series, , prompted a further revision in the depiction of Klingon culture, though Gene Roddenberry had wanted to avoid re-appearances of races from the old series. Set a century later than the original series, the USS Enterprise-D featured a Klingon crewmember, Worf. Makeup artist Michael Westmore needed a consistent reference to base the Klingon look on, as each individual Klingon had distinct head ridges. He found what he was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> book of dinosaurs: observing dinosaur vertebrae laid out flat, Westmore cut the designs in half and modified them to suit each Klingon. Westmore designed his Klingons' beards to be Elizabethan, combining prehistoric and aristocratic elements to give audiences a feeling of depth from the appearance. Over time, Westmore and the other makeup artists designed different sizes of prosthetic headpieces which could be quickly applied and modified to save time; the amount of preparation to turn an actor into a Klingon decreased from around three hours to one. While important characters had custom headpieces, background actors used pre-made masks with minor touchup around the eyes and mouth. The Next Generation effects artist Dan Curry used his martial arts experience to create a flowing fighting style for the race. When the episode [...] "" [...] called for a special Klingon blade, Curry drew on Far East influences to develop a weapon known as the batleth. Curry, a collector of weapons, was annoyed by fictional weaponry {{that was designed to}} [...] "look cool" [...] but could not be handled practically. Curry combined elements of the Himalayan kukri, Chinese axes and fighting crescents to create a two-handed, curved weapon that has since been widely used in the franchise.|$|E
2500|$|A Ring of Endless Light (1980, [...] ) is set {{during the}} summer {{following}} the events of The Young Unicorns, and again employs Vicky Austin as protagonist and first person narrator. In a summer full of death and impending death, Vicky rekindles her romantic relationship with Zach, somewhat unwillingly goes {{on a date with}} Leo Rodney, is encouraged in her writing by her grandfather Eaton, who is dying, and conducts experiments in dolphin communication with Adam Eddington. Vicky again struggles with her identity and now begins to question the point of life. Her questions are fueled by Zachary's dark moods and ideas, Leo's stable and innocent ones, and theology she learns from her grandfather. Adam supports her search for truth and eventually helps her find the answers she seeks. Vicky also faces problems within her friendships. While she would like to support Zach, she does not approve of his reckless behavior and dark mindset. Before the death of his father, Vicky assumed that Leo was [...] "a slob". Over the summer, she finds he is kind, gentle and naive but lacks the spark she is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> boyfriend. Adam instantly catches her attention as he is handsome, passionate, honest, kind and everything else she is looking for. But as she becomes close to him, he pulls away and treats her like a child. Vicky eventually breaks through his barriers in order to become friends with him again. Vicky also struggles with Suzy, her younger sister. Throughout the series, Vicky has always been slightly jealous of Suzy's beauty and intelligence, but now is also concerned about Suzy's relationship with Jacky Rodney, Leo's younger brother. Her problems with Suzy are never fully solved. In the course of her work with Adam, she discovers a talent for telepathy, a way of communing with others that is called kything in L'Engle's Time Quintet. After coping with the deaths of a family friend, and Leo and Jacky's father, Commander Rodney, a baby dolphin, and with her grandfather's physical and mental decline, Vicky has a mental breakdown after a child dies in her arms while waiting at the hospital for her sick grandfather. Vicky believes these events are all indicating that Zachary was right and that life is hopeless, painful and pointless. [...] She is roused from near-catatonia by Adam and the dolphins. As she is saved from despair, she realizes the joy and the light in life, outweighs that darkness. She also realizes that when we focus on the darkness, it can overpower us. Joined in their passion for life and joy, it appears that Adam and Vicky begin a strong and close romantic relationship. In a television movie adaptation of this novel, which aired on Disney Channel in 2003, Vicky was played by actress Mischa Barton.|$|E

Cytherea lingered till the very last, reluctant to follow, and looking alternately at the boat and the valley behind.
