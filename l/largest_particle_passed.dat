40|$|Two-dimensional image {{modeling}} of binary and ternary mixed porous media {{was used to}} study the effect of porosity and tortuosity on effective diffusion coefficient and permeability were separated. Different volume fractions of <b>large</b> and small <b>particles</b> in the mixtures as well as different particle size ratio were investigated. The following results were obtained: 1). The porosity changes with variation of the volume fraction of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> in the mixture. The function of the porosity vs. volume fraction of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> <b>passes</b> through a minimum. 2). The dependence of tortuosity on the volume fraction of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> has a maximum, which does not coincide with the minimum value of the porosity. 3). The introduction in the binary mixture of a third fraction of particles with a much smaller diameter led to a dramatic decrease of porosity. For a volume fraction of smaller particles as low as 0. 05 - 0. 1 in the total volume of particles the porosity was 20 - 30 % of the corresponding mono-sized porous media. This deviation increased {{with the increase in}} the particle size ratio. 4). This analysis shows that the characterization of a mixed bed must take in account other properties besides particle size. Different beds with the same equivalent particle diameter can have different porosity or tortuosity. 5). The ratio Ð/T, a term included both in the permeability and effective diffusivity expressions, also passes through a minimum. Therefore, a change in the volume fraction of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> in the binary mixture may give rise to a 70 % decrease in the effective diffusivity of the porous medium an up to 85 % decrease for ternary mixtures. This effect is more significant in the case of permeability. Junta Nacional de Investigação Científica e Tecnológica (JNICT).

40|$|Transport {{of solid}} {{particles}} in a slit virtual impactor has been analyzed using visualization techniques. Particle trajectories were observed using laser-induced fluorescence of monodisperse particles seeded {{in the virtual}} impactor flow. It was observed from these trajectories that for smaller inertia particles essentially followed the flow streamlines, whereas higher inertia particles tend to deflect from their initial streamlines. These transport characteristics {{were used to determine}} particle collection efficiency curves, and the percentage of defect particle transmission, particles transmitted to the major flow that are well beyond the experimentally determined 50 % cutoff. Defect percentages were found to be in good agreement with those based on a local stokes number approach, an analytical model using a converging flow velocity profile. It was hypothesized that these defects occur by virtue of <b>larger</b> <b>particles</b> <b>passing</b> through the near wall flow region and consequently transported to the major flow. The trajectories of such defect occurrences clearly show that these particles originated in the near wall region. Performance at higher mass loadings was evaluated using a background dust matrix generated by a turntable aerosol generator. At high mass loadings, clogging of the slit led to the deterioration of the impactor's performance. The time taken to clog the silt was estimated by modeling the slit edge as a single filter fiber of rectangular cross section with the primary mechanism of filtration being interception and was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. Elimination of defect transmission and clogging would be possible by the provision of a sheath airflow, which ensures that the near wall regions are free of particles...|$|R

While the hindgut is proportionally larger in the koala than in other herbivores, only 10% of the animal's energy is obtained from fermentation. Since the koala gains a low amount of energy from its diet, its metabolic rate is half that of a typical mammal, although this can vary between seasons and sexes. The koala conserves water by passing relatively dry faecal pellets high in undigested fibre, and by storing water in the caecum.|$|R

We determined the mean retention time (MRT) of different sized <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> (10 and 20 mm) in three banteng (Bos javanicus) on two forage only diets, grass and grass hay.

40|$|Grain {{segregation}} occurs {{under various}} conditions, such as vibration, shear and mixing. In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is {{triggered by the}} percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving), and <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the upward migration of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which remains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or numerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small particles facilitates the upward movement of <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> We found that in <b>large</b> <b>particles,</b> the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides with the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and the connectivity of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> is much higher when they are squeezed through small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids hinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes rotation and empowers more <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> {{to reach the top}} layer, implying that the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors.
