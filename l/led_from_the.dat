5|$|Having {{arrived in}} Melbourne, O'Halloran was rested, along with Rose and Henricks, in the heats of the relay. Devitt, Chapman, Graham Hamilton and Garretty {{finished}} third in their heat behind Great Britain and the Soviet Union, and qualified fifth-fastest behind Japan and the United States. Australia <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start and reached {{the midpoint of the}} race with a lead of 4.5s. Hamilton swam a very slow third leg of 2min 15.4s and conceded 8.8s to the British.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{a letter}} {{published}} in the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch by William F. Kummer, {{who worked as a}} director under John Mitchell, revealed another piece of the secret: a candle inside the cabinet. A series of tubes <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other candelabra in the area where the game was played.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start, {{preventing}} Fernando Alonso from overtaking at turn one. Alonso ran wide allowing Nick Heidfeld {{to overtake}} him {{and move into}} second place. Alonso damaged his car {{in the process and}} subsequently ran off the track at turn one a further three times during the race. Jenson Button had a gearbox problem {{at the start of the}} race and was unable to select first gear causing him stall on the grid. Christijan Albers started from pit lane. The first accident of the race involved Scott Speed who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' Williams and went into the hairpin with a broken suspension.|$|E
5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones brought from the priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{enclosure}} ran the processional path, which <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> temple entrance {{through the main}} gate in {{the enclosure}} wall. The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} League Cup {{in the third}} round and were drawn at home to Rotherham United. Wenger handed midfielder Cesc Fàbregas his debut at 16 years and 177 days; as of 2016 is still the {{youngest}} player to turn out for the club. Arsenal <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 11th minute through an Aliadière goal, but conceded an equaliser late on which forced extra time. Rotherham goalkeeper Mike Pollitt was sent off for handling the ball outside his penalty area; his substitute Gary Montgomery denied Wiltord from scoring the winner. As there were no further goals, the match was decided on penalties which Arsenal won 9–8 in the shootout. Fellow divisional opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers were defeated 5–1 by Arsenal in the fourth round; Vieira, absent through injury in September and October, made his first team return and played the full match.|$|E

5|$|Australia played its inaugural Test against New Zealand in Wellington, a {{match that}} was {{retrospectively}} given Test status. The uncertain {{status of the}} tour saw the players wearing blazers that were labelled ABC (Australian Board of Control), rather than the Australian coat of arms. Brown <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front, topping the tour aggregates and averages, with 443 runs at 73.83 in five matches. In the opening tour match against Auckland, Brown elected to bat and opened with 68 as Australia amassed 579 and took victory by an innings and 180 runs. This {{was followed by a}} match against Canterbury in Christchurch, in which Brown top-scored with 137. This laid the foundation for a total of 8/415 and another innings victory. Brown made his second consecutive century in the third match against Otago at Carisbrook in Dunedin, again top-scoring with 106 in an eight-wicket victory. Brown made 34 in the final tour match as Australia defeated Wellington in another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Calshot Castle was {{designed}} to protect the Solent, a body of water that <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet decided to build to improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure, but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|First class mourners {{entered through}} the {{driveway}} under {{the office building}} which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The driveway ran past mortuaries and storerooms to the lifts and stairs to the platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to racing against horses {{of his own}} age, starting the 8/15 favourite of a field of ten runners for the six-furlong Middle Park Plate at Newmarket. As the field neared the finish, Orme was travelling the best, {{and as soon as}} Barrett let him go, he immediately took the lead. El Diablo tried to close, but could not get to Orme, with the latter winning easily by a couple of lengths, Gantlet being a neck back from El Diablo in third. Orme then started in the Dewhurst Plate, but his presence deterred many owners from entering and he faced only two rivals. He started as the 6/100 favourite, with El Diablo at 20/1 and Hatfield at 50/1. Orme <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start, and with two furlongs to run he began to stride away. El Diablo tried to close, but Orme won by three-quarters of a length from him and was never extended. Hatfield finished well behind Orme and El Diablo in third place. Orme's final race of the season came on 30 October in the Home-bred Foal Post Stakes over five furlongs and 140 yards at Newmarket. He started as the 3/100 favourite and faced three rivals. Orme lead throughout the race and won easily by two lengths from Esmond, with Lucellum a further three lengths back in third place.|$|E
5|$|In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men {{he brought}} into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, {{including}} five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents. Frederick required his generals {{to set an example}} of courage and leadership: they <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two standards. On the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E

5|$|Li Shimin's {{plan was}} successful: apart from skirmishes {{between the two}} armies' cavalry, the two armies {{maintained}} their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began {{to show signs of}} thirst and weariness. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack. When he saw that the demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley, but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines, breaking their battle order. Awaiting this opportunity, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin always <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front—accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black-clad, black-armoured horsemen—as indeed did most of the contemporary Chinese military leaders, who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example, rather than stay in the rear and co-ordinate their army.|$|E
5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit. Nevertheless, his directness and socially confident nature singled him out for command. His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike. He is said to have tended to see everything and everyone in black and white.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase <b>led</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E
