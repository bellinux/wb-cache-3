5000|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growth in {{academic}} and policy discussions around product <b>lifetimes.</b> For example, discussion of product <b>lifetimes</b> {{are an integral part of}} the European Commission's action plan for the circular economy.

40|$|Product <b>lifetimes</b> are a {{relevant}} {{topic of discussion}} towards establishing a circular economy, particularly {{in terms of the}} reduction of environmental impacts by improving product longevity. Various researchers have developed models to estimate actual <b>lifetimes</b> and have reported case studies for some product categories (e. g. electrical and electronic equipment, and vehicles). However, actual <b>lifetimes</b> may not necessarily meet consumers' expectations. Therefore, an integration of the two perspectives—actual and expected product lifetimes—should prove helpful in optimizing product <b>lifetimes.</b> We proposed different definitions of expected product <b>lifetimes</b> from the consumer perspective and then investigated consumer expectations of the product <b>lifetimes</b> of consumer durables according to these definitions. Several types of EEE were examined as case studies, and questionnaire surveys were conducted. We found that exp ected <b>lifetimes</b> varied according to the definition used. Expected product life-times should be measured by using clearly defined terms to analyse the gaps between actual product <b>lifetimes</b> and consumer expectations...|$|R

40|$|The longest spin <b>lifetimes</b> in bulk n-GaAs exceed 100 ns for doping {{concentrations}} {{near the}} metal-insulator transition (J. M. Kikkawa, D. D. Awschalom, Phys. Rev.

Spin <b>lifetimes</b> vary by three {{orders of magnitude}} {{as a function of}} energy when occupying donor and conduction band states. The longest spin <b>lifetimes</b> (> 100 ns) are assigned to delocalized donor band states, while conduction band states exhibit shorter spin <b>lifetimes.</b> The occupation of localized donor band states is identified by short spin <b>lifetimes</b> (~ 300 ps) and a distinct Overhauser shift due to dynamic nuclear polarization.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} temporal networks often influence the dynamical processes that occur on these networks, e. g., bursty interaction patterns {{have been shown}} to slow down epidemics. In this paper, we investigate the effect of link <b>lifetimes</b> on the spread of history-dependent epidemics. We formulate an analytically tractable activity-driven temporal network model that explicitly incorporates link <b>lifetimes.</b> For Markovian link <b>lifetimes,</b> we use mean-field analysis for computing the epidemic threshold, while the effect of non-Markovian link <b>lifetimes</b> is studied using simulations. Furthermore, we also study the effect of negative correlation between the number of links spawned by an individual and the <b>lifetimes</b> of those links. Such negative correlations may arise due to the finite cognitive capacity of the individuals. Our investigations reveal that heavy-tailed link <b>lifetimes</b> slow down the epidemic, while negative correlations can reduce epidemic prevalence. We believe that our results help shed light on the role of link <b>lifetimes</b> in modulating diffusion processes on temporal networks...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a masked system, {{which consists of}} several components. Due to cost and diagnostic constraints, the component mean <b>lifetimes</b> might not be exactly known. We {{consider a}} system where if one of components fails, the whole system fails and suppose that the <b>lifetimes</b> of components have exponential distributions. Since the exponential distribution has a large variance, {{it is hard to}} find the component mean <b>lifetimes.</b> We propose an estimation method, which will generally find the component mean <b>lifetimes.</b> The results of a Monte Carlo simulation study are presented to demonstrate the favorable estimation of the mean <b>lifetimes</b> of components using unclassified system life data. The estimation produced by our method is better than that produced by the K-means algorithm. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
