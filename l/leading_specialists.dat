5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of <b>leading</b> <b>specialists</b> in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E

500|$|Upon peaking in intensity, Otto {{had become}} fully {{embedded}} within the deep-layered flow to its southwest. Racing northeastward, the hurricane entered {{an area of}} progressively cooler waters and adverse upper atmospheric conditions, which eroded its cloud pattern and disrupted the circulation. With maximum winds dropping below 70mph (110km/h), Otto {{was reduced to a}} tropical storm late on October9. Convective activity came to a near halt due to relentless wind shear and a [...] lack of tropical moisture, <b>leading</b> <b>specialists</b> to conclude the storm was entering an extratropical transition. The next day, the cool dry air infiltrated the weak warm core, and Otto began to develop frontal banding features. With these characteristics, Otto became an extratropical cyclone on October10, and the NHC discontinued advisories on the storm. The post-tropical system decelerated near the Azores over the next week, where it eventually degenerated into a remnant low that recurved sharply southeastward, before completely dissipating west of Morocco on October18.|$|E
