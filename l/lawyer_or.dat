5|$|Hilary {{spent many}} years in a {{struggle}} with Battle Abbey, attempting to assert his right as bishop to oversee the abbey. He also clashed with Thomas Becket, then chancellor to King Henry II of England, later Archbishop of Canterbury; Hilary supported King Henry II's position in the conflict with Becket. Henry appointed Hilary a sheriff, and employed him as a judge in the royal courts. The papacy also used Hilary as a judge-delegate, to hear cases referred back to England. Known for supporting his clergy and as a canon <b>lawyer,</b> <b>or</b> someone trained in ecclesiastical law, Hilary worked to have Edward the Confessor, a former English king, canonised as a saint.|$|E

25|$|Each {{overseas}} territory {{has its own}} legal system independent of the United Kingdom. The legal system is generally based on English common law, with some distinctions for local circumstances. Each territory has its own attorney general, and court system. For the smaller territories, the UK may appoint a UK-based <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> judge to work on legal cases. This is particularly important for cases involving serious crimes {{and where it is}} impossible to find a jury who will not know the defendant in a small population island.|$|E

25|$|Wallach {{attended}} a girls' {{high school in}} Krefeld, and {{attended a}} Lyzeum in Dahlem after moving to Berlin. Unsatisfied {{with the level of}} education, she then continued to attend classes established by Helene Lange. She passed her Abitur (a final examination taken at the conclusion of secondary education) in September 1924. Wallach studied law at Berlin, Freiburg, Würzberg, and Bonn Universities and passed her First State Examination in January 1930 at Cologne University. She then passed her Second State Examination in 1933, but was not allowed to work as a <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> assessor following the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, twhichhat targeted Jews in civil service.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.|$|E
25|$|A fiduciary's duty {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when a <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> an agent, {{such as a}} real estate agent, represent more than one client, {{and the interests of}} those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|E

25|$|In {{trouble because}} {{he lacked the}} means to live decently, and because his lack of a {{university}} degree meant he could not become a <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> a professor, Rosetti sought a professional job relatively safe from the vicissitudes of politics. At the time, the Foreign Affairs Ministry formed one such oasis. He applied there, and in April 1898, when Sturdza was both Prime and Foreign Minister, he was hired as the archivist's assistant, again helped by Bianu. His other supporter was Gheorghe Văsescu, {{a friend of the}} PNL factional leader Ion I. C. Brătianu. Although this new job was low in the ministerial hierarchy, his fluent knowledge of several languages (itself a precondition for working in the ministry) and his penchant for historical exegesis helped Rosetti advance. Nevertheless, the promotions came with a humiliating slowness and, with a wife, three sons and a daughter to support, he found the salary insufficient. Although the Conservatives returned to power in 1899, their new leader was Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino—Rosetti's patron, Catargiu, died suddenly the same year, leaving him virtually without friends in the party.|$|E
25|$|As Gandhi {{embarked}} on the Dandi Salt March, Patel {{was arrested in}} the village of Ras and was put on trial without witnesses, with no <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> pressman allowed to attend. Patel's arrest and Gandhi's subsequent arrest caused the Salt Satyagraha to greatly intensify in Gujaratdistricts across Gujarat launched an anti-tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released. Once released, Patel served as interim Congress president, but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai. After the signing of the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachihere the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and human freedoms, and a vision of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened, and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness. Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother (Gandhi) and his younger brother (Patel). Despite having arguments with Gandhi, Patel respected his instincts and leadership. During imprisonment, the two discussed national and social issues, read Hindu epics, and cracked jokes. Gandhi also taught Patel Sanskrit. Gandhi's secretary, Mahadev Desai, kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel. When Gandhi {{embarked on}} a fast-unto-death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables, Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food. Patel was later moved to a jail in Nasik, and refused a British offer for a brief release to attend the cremation of his brother Vithalbhai, who had died in 1934. He was finally released in July of the same year.|$|E

500|$|Daniel Cowart is of English {{descent and}} {{was raised in}} Bells, Tennessee. He had a strong {{interest}} in computers and had no criminal record. Cowart attended Jackson Christian School until 2006, but did not graduate. [...] He was expelled from Jackson Christian after calling in a bomb threat. He applied for Jackson State Community College to study computers but, although his family believed he was indeed attending the school, he never provided documentation or pursued other steps to enroll there. Cowart moved to Texas in the spring of 2007 to live with friends he met on the Internet, but was unable to find work and returned to Bells to live with his grandparents a month later. Cowart worked at a Bells grocery store called the Bells Market Place for one year until May 2007 before moving to Texas for a brief time. Cowart worked and got along with several minority co-workers, who later expressed shock at his arrest. Mitchell Twitty, a black former co-worker, said of Cowart, [...] "He treated me like we were best friends. I never, ever heard him make a racist remark." [...] Twitty said Cowart tended to keep to himself and at times acted [...] "a little strange." [...] Other co-workers described him as hard-working and friendly, but said he did not have many friends. One family friend thought he was intelligent and full of potential: [...] "I always saw him as a doctor or <b>lawyer,</b> <b>or</b> even a senator.

Hayley Krischer of Salon agreed that Clair is [...] "everyone’s favorite" [...] and [...] "undoubtedly the best TV mom", despite being [...] "too calm, too gorgeous, too successful" [...] to be realistic. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Clair Huxtable was not only the perfect mom, but also a great role model as someone who never sacrificed either her career as a high-power <b>lawyer</b> <b>or</b> her family life." [...] Praising the character for transcending both racial and generational barriers, Patrice Evans of Jezebel described Clair as [...] "the perfect professional mom". The author went on to claim that while other famous television mothers such as June Cleaver, Carol Brady and Edith Bunker have gradually suffered a loss in [...] "potency" [...] over time, Clair instead remains a relevant maternal figure every television mother created since can only aspire to be like. As a [...] "family-balancing professional African American woman", Clair has had a profound influence on The Cosby Shows viewers. According to Susan Douglas, author of The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women, Clair was [...] "the first African American mother on television ... with whom white women identified and wanted to emulate." [...] US Weekly recognized Clair as [...] "one of TV's first working mothers", while NewNowNext's Brian Juergens credits the character with making the 1980s a [...] "boom time for great sitcom moms" [...] by [...] "breaking the mold in an essential way". SheKnows contributor Cynthia Boris recognized Clair as a mother television audiences had [...] "never seen before -- a beautiful, successful, working mom who was an African American" [...] and [...] "a positive role model ... every young woman could aspire to."
