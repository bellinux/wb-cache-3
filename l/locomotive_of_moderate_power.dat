This led {{to most of the}} Toton (Nottinghamshire)-Brent (London) coal trains being double-headed by 0-6-0 locomotives. It was realised that double heading was uneconomical so a Garratt locomotive was ordered from Beyer, Peacock and Company. However the LMS Derby design office insisted on the fitting of their standard axleboxes to the design. These axleboxes were barely adequate for the LMS Class 4F 0-6-0 locomotives, on which they frequently overheated, and were a major weakness on the LMS Garratts. They were also always heavy on coal and maintenance.|$|R

In particular, the weight of the train expected to be hauled was to be no {{more than three times the}} actual weight <b>of</b> the <b>locomotive.</b> Stephenson realised that whatever the size <b>of</b> previously successful <b>locomotives,</b> this new contest would favour a fast, light <b>locomotive</b> <b>of</b> only <b>moderate</b> hauling <b>power.</b>|$|R

40|$|The focused {{output of}} certain solid state lasers {{can be used}} to produce rapid surface heating and {{consequent}} vaporization in absorbing materials. For ordinary lasers it appears that the heating process can be adequately explained {{on the basis of a}} relatively simple classical thermodynamic treatment; however, for Q-switched lasers it is much more complicated.

The use of time of flight mass spectrometer to study vaporized material results in a useful analytical tool for study of sample composition and provides information about laser beam-surface interaction as well.

The chemical state of the surface was monitored in situ in real time in the plasma cell using multiple-internal-reflection infrared spectroscopy and ex situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. While plasma treatments <b>of</b> <b>moderate</b> <b>power</b> densities (0. 11 W/cm 3) lead to complete removal of the organic monolayer, using very-low power densities (10 mW cm 3) leads to selective oxidation of the organic chains with negligible etching of the monolayer and a very limited oxidation of the silicon surface. Successive formation of alcohol, ketone, and carboxyl functions is observed before reaching a quasi steady state on an hour time scale. Modelization of the plasma shows that the dominant reactive species at these low power densities is the singlet oxygen molecule (1 Δg). A molecular-scale reaction mechanism is proposed, and a simple kinetic model is derived. A major conclusion is that reaching a quasi steady state is attributable to the very low amount of atomic oxygen in the plasma and to the densification of the layer upon incorporation of oxygen-bearing groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{work was}} {{supported}} by the National Environment Research Council (grant NE/E 015255 / 1 to MGR and RKB) and the Academy of Finland (project 132619 to AH). We investigated the genetic architecture of courtship song and cuticular hydrocarbon traits in two phygenetically distinct populations of Drosophila montana. To study natural variation in these two important traits, we analysed within-population crosses among individuals sampled from the wild. Hence, the genetic variation analysed should represent that available for natural and sexual selection to act upon. In contrast to previous between-population crosses in this species, no major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected, perhaps because the between-population QTLs were due to fixed differences between the populations. Partitioning the trait variation to chromosomes suggested a broadly polygenic genetic architecture of within-population variation, although some chromosomes explained more variation in one population compared with the other. Studies of natural variation provide an important contrast to crosses between species or divergent lines, but our analysis highlights recent concerns that segregating variation within populations for important quantitative ecological traits may largely consist of small effect alleles, difficult to detect with studies <b>of</b> <b>moderate</b> <b>power.</b> PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
