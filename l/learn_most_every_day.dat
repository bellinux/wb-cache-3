Introduction Economists use multi-dimensional functions <b>most</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> in their research.

We argue that the study of “uncertain deduction” should directly ask people to assign probabilities to both premises and conclusions, and report an experiment using this method. We assess this reasoning by two Bayesian metrics: probabilistic validity and coherence according to probability theory. On both measures, participants perform above chance in conditional reasoning, but they do much better when statements are grouped as inferences, rather than evaluated in separate tasks...|$|R

40|$|In {{our daily}} life noise is almost {{constantly}} present. At {{the same time}} our need to communicate reliably has probably never been this great. Surrounding noise impairs our ability to communicate by speech and causes the users of a speech communication system to strain both their hearing and their voices. This licentiate thesis deals with speech enhancement for personal communication. A method for speech enhancement mainly aiming at <b>every</b> <b>day</b> communication situations is presented. The method boosts speech energy in a communication system, leaving background noise unaffected and it also tracks changes in background noise characteristics. Hence it is an adaptive speech enhancement algorithm. This is desirable since the noise characteristics of <b>most</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> noisy situations {{are more or less}} rapidly changing. Methods for facilitating personal communication in severely disturbed environments are also presented. Instead of placing the communication microphone in front of the mouth, the microphone is placed inside the external auditory canal of the user. A pair of ear-muffs equipped with an active noise cancelling (ANC) system are fitted onto the user's head. This setup, possibly combined with some speech enhancement method, enables the user to communicate even under the most extreme noise situations. The setup characteristics are examined and the resulting speech quality and intelligibility are evaluated using a speech recognizer based on Hidden Markov Models...|$|R

As recognition is being known worldwide as the greatest motivator and one of the greatest strengths of any organization are the people who work there, the necessity of implementing the new total rewards process becomes acute. Long-service employees provide the knowledge, experience, and attitudes that are responsible for much of digitalized societies success. In recognition of this, new total rewards are presented to eligible employees in celebration of their career milestones and to acknowledge their contribution to the company.

50|$|Though his {{intelligence}} in <b>most</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> things is severely lacking, {{he is an}} incredible swordsman, performing extremely well against both regular and supernatural foes {{in the heat of}} battle. He also often shows excellent skills of observation, intuition, and is a good judge of character, though sometimes it comes a bit late to be of any good. A rather notable example of his exceptional observational skills is that he apparently figured out Xellos was not human long before anyone else did. When questioned about why he never said anything sooner about it, Gourry further dumbfounded everyone when he stated he thought it was obvious. While Gourry may not be the smartest of characters, his ignorance is purposefully beneficial to helping the audience understand what is going on; hence making him a device for exposition. The other three main characters are well educated and have knowledge regarding the cosmology and history of the world which is assumed everyone in the world would know. Since Gourry, however, does not know or remember these facts, it forces the other three to verbalize these facts, which allows for the audience to learn what is assumed to be well known - even the author himself admitted to be making use of this fact. In the original novels, {{his intelligence}} is portrayed more as tactless and slightly out of-the-loop rather than idiotic, as the novels are written from Lina's point of view and thus she is able to explain situations through narration rather than having to resort to Gourry's supposed faulty memory.|$|R
