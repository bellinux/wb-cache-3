25|$|The Boeing AH-6 is {{a series}} of light {{helicopter}} gunships based on the MH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> and MD 500 family. Developed by Boeing Rotorcraft Systems, these include the Unmanned <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> (ULB) demonstrator, the A/MH-6X Mission Enhanced <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> (MELB), and the proposed AH-6I and AH-6S.|$|E
25|$|The {{unmanned}} K-MAX {{competed with}} the Boeing H-6U <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> for the Marine Corps unmanned lift/ISR capability. In April 2014, Marines at Quantico announced they successfully landed an unmanned K-MAX, {{as well as}} a <b>Little</b> <b>Bird,</b> autonomously using an iPad-like mini-tablet. The helicopters were equipped with Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) technology, which combines advanced algorithms with LIDAR and electro-optical/infrared sensors to enable a user to select a point to land the helicopter at an unprepared landing site. The Office of Naval Research selected Aurora Flight Sciences and the Unmanned <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> to complete development of the prototype AACUS system, but Lockheed continued to promote the K-MAX and develop autonomous cargo delivery systems.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{proposed}} the upgraded {{version of the}} MH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird,</b> the MH-6M Mission Enhanced <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> (MELB). Because the aircraft was already in service with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, it became the predictive favorite despite doubts that MD Helicopters Inc. (MDHI) could ramp up production to meet the contract's demands. To alleviate this concern, Boeing purchased the production rights for the design and served as the prime contractor.|$|E

25|$|The Unmanned <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> demonstrator, which Boeing {{built from}} a {{civilian}} MD 530F, first flew on September 8, 2004, and {{made its first}} autonomous flight (with safety pilot) on October 16, 2004.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, Boeing {{demonstrated}} the Unmanned <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> {{version of the}} AH-6 to the South Korean Army. The aircraft flew autonomously for 25minutes to demonstrate the unmanned system's capabilities that can be integrated into Army MD 500 Defender helicopters.|$|E
60|$|UNFORTUNATELY, just at {{this time}} a flock of <b>little</b> <b>birds</b> flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green {{caterpillars}} and spiders. There were several sorts of <b>little</b> <b>birds,</b> twittering different songs.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, the <b>little</b> <b>birds</b> sang east, and the <b>little</b> <b>birds</b> sang west-- [...] Toll slowly. [...] And I said in underbreath,--All {{our life}} {{is mixed with}} death, [...] And who knoweth which is best? ...|$|R

25|$|Boeing {{funded the}} {{development}} program itself; {{it intends to}} market the aircraft for both military and homeland security roles within the U.S. and internationally. The aircraft is estimated to cost US$2 million. The systems related to the unmanned flight capabilities have also been designed {{to be able to}} be installed in any other helicopter as well, including the Apache. An Unmanned <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> performed a fully autonomous flight in June 2010, including avoiding obstacles using LIDAR.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in December 2007 that a deal had been reached between the Iraqi government and Serbia {{for the sale of}} arms and other military equipment including 36 Lasta 95 basic trainers. It was speculated that Iraq might buy 50 Aérospatiale Gazelle attack helicopters from France. In July 2008, Iraq had formally requested an order for 24 light attack and reconnaissance helicopters. The aircraft would either be the U.S. Army's new ARH-70 helicopter or the MH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird.</b>|$|E
25|$|Garrincha {{was born}} in Pau Grande, a {{district}} of Magé, {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. His father was an alcoholic, drinking cachaça heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit. A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was as small as a <b>little</b> <b>bird</b> she started calling him Garrincha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird. The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Lange {{published}} her own {{collection of}} black-and-white pictures entitled 50 Photographs (powerHouse Books) {{with a special}} introduction by Patti Smith. An exhibition of her work, along {{with a series of}} her films, was presented at the oldest international museum of photography and film, the George Eastman House, after which Lange was presented with the first George Eastman House Honors Award in 2009. In 2010, she published a second collection of photographs, In Mexico. Most recently, she released a children's picture book called It's About a <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> (2013), while {{for the first time in}} Russia, she exhibited in Moscow's Multimedia Art Museum in 2014.|$|E
25|$|With {{the successes}} of the ULB, Boeing {{incorporated}} its technologies into an A/MH-6, designating it the A/MH-6X. On September 20, 2006, the first A/MH-6X lifted off on its maiden flight from Boeing Rotorcraft Systems' Mesa, Arizona facility with a pilot on board. While the ULB Demonstrator had a payload of 2,400pounds, the MELB has an additional 1,000pounds of payload capacity. The A/MH-6X {{is similar to the}} A/MH-6M, but includes a prototype glass cockpit and a number of upgrades to the electronics and avionics. The A/MH-6X is an optionally manned or unmanned aircraft which is a hybrid of the ULB demonstrator and the A/MH-6M mission-enhanced <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> which is used by US Army Special Operations Command.|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2009, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, {{a senior}} al-Qaeda leader in East Africa {{as well as}} a senior leader in Shabaab, al Qaeda's {{surrogate}} in Somalia, was killed by elements of U.S. Special Operations. According to a witness, at least two AH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> attack helicopters strafed a two-car convoy. Navy SEALs then seized the body of Nabhan and took two other wounded fighters captive. JSOC and the CIA had been trying to kill Nabhan for some time including back in January 2007, when an AC-130 Gunship was called in on one attempt. A U.S. intelligence source stated that CIA paramilitary teams are directly embedded with Ethiopian forces in Somalia, allowing for the tactical intelligence to launch these operations. Nabhan was wanted for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, as well as leading the cell behind the 2002 Mombasa attacks.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} {{began with}} an assault of strategic installations, such as the civilian Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a PDF garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. U.S. Navy SEALs destroyed Noriega's private jet and a Panamanian gunboat. A Panamanian ambush killed four SEALs and wounded nine. Other military command centers throughout the country were also attacked. The attack on the central headquarters of the PDF (referred to as La Comandancia) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. During the firefight at the Comandancia, the PDF downed two special operations helicopters and forced one MH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> to crash-land in the Panama Canal. The opening round of attacks in Panama City also included a special operations raid on the Carcel Modelo prison (known as Operation Acid Gambit) to free Kurt Muse, a US citizen convicted of espionage by Noriega.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterward, {{operations}} began {{from the}} barges, dubbed Mobile Sea Bases (MSBs). They {{were set up}} as naval special warfare task units (NSWTU) run by a SEAL commander and answering to the regional naval special warfare task group. Their mission was to stop Iranian forces from mining the Persian Gulf or otherwise attacking shipping. Each mobile sea base had two detachments of Mark III patrol boats, a SEAL platoon, an EOD detachment, Marines to provide security, army MH-6 and AH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> helicopter gunships and Black Hawk rescue birds, and air force combat controllers. Mobile Sea Base Hercules was manned by east coast naval special warfare units, including Patrol Boats 777 and 758 from Special Boat Unit 20 and Special Boat Unit 24. Mobile Sea Base Wimbrown 7 was manned by West Coast units, including Patrol Boats 753 and 757 from Special Boat Unit 13 and Patrol Boats 775 and 776 from Special Boat Unit 12.|$|E
25|$|Battlefield 2: Armored Fury is {{the second}} booster pack {{released}} for Battlefield 2 and was released on June 6, 2006. It added three new maps, {{as well as two}} new vehicle classes: attack jets for close air support and reconnaissance helicopters that operate as a mobile UAV. The booster pack has the USMC defending U.S. soil from invasions from the PLA and MEC. Operation Midnight Sun features the Chinese landing at the Alaskan port Valdez where they are trying to secure much needed fuel from the pipeline. Operation Road Rage is a MEC vs. USMC map, where the MEC are using US Highways to transport units to industrial areas. Operation Harvest sees the United States trying to stall the MEC en route to the capital from the northwest, being blocked in a Pennsylvania Dutch farm, while waiting for reinforcements. New vehicles include Attack or Close Air Support aircraft such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II, Su-39 and the Nanchang Q-5 as well as new light utility helicopters such as MH-6 <b>Little</b> <b>Bird,</b> EC-635 and the Z-11. As well as the addition of new helicopters and planes, DICE also added the Muscle Car and Semi Truck. However, the proposed AV-8B Harrier was cut from the add-on due to balancing issues.|$|E

500|$|As well as source {{information}} for Cheyenne military and social history, {{the book is}} a rich source of anecdotes. [...] One tale describes how Wooden Leg and <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> chase a fleeing Reno soldier. [...] Neither Indian was willing to shoot a fleeing man, as it [...] "seemed not brave" [...] to do so. [...] This did not prevent the soldier from shooting <b>Little</b> <b>Bird,</b> after which Wooden Leg clubbed the soldier off his horse. [...] Wooden Leg describes the screams of his mother when she is presented with a scalp as a present. In another story, Wooden Leg is sitting in the lodge with his friend, Noisy Walking, who is dying of his battle wounds. He wants to support his friend but doesn't know what to say. There are many other examples.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1850s {{to the early}} 1860s, Evans {{produced}} the blocks and printed for, among others, books illustrated by William Stephen Coleman including, Common Objects of the Sea Shore, Common Objects of the Country, Our Woodlands, Heaths, and Hedges, and British Butterflies. The printing process used up to 12colours and, as was his usual practice, a hand-press. During these years he also completed work on Foster's Bible Emblem Anniversary Book, and <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> Red and <b>Little</b> <b>Bird</b> Blue. In 1870, Evans printed In Fairyland, a Series of Pictures from the Elf-World, illustrated by James Doyle's brother Richard in which Doyle depicted fairies living [...] "among birds, snails, butterflies and beetles as large as themselves", and Evans produced his largest wood-engravings for the volume. The 36 illustrations contained within are [...] "often considered the masterpiece of Victorian illustration." [...] During the 1860s and 1870s, he was employing up to 30engravers.|$|E
