However, there is still an open debate about the predictability of clear aligner therapy, especially regarding complex tooth movements. While <b>levelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>aligning,</b> intrusion, <b>and</b> bodily distalisation of upper molars {{of no more than}} 1.5  mm were demonstrated to be predictable movements, rotations, extrusion, and torque movements are difficult to achieve with clear aligners [8 – 11].

Recently, Lombardo et al.

However, the books have never been studied and evaluated in depth yet. One important factor in assessing reading materials is readability. Readability determines whether a text is easy or difficult to understand and a balanced mix of both can promote learning and language development. Various researchers mentioned a multilevel framework of discourse that any language assessment on a text should take into account.

A strong software interface is needed to accept input from every brand of scanner to facilitate the selection of an anatomic structure visible in the medical images. Hence {{the purpose of this}} paper is to volumetrically evaluate root resorption during orthodontic treatment using MIMICS software and describe benefits of collaboration between two expertises. CBCT of 17 patients were taken pre-treatment (T 1) <b>and</b> post <b>levelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>aligning</b> (T 2) using KODAK 9000 machine. CBCT data were reconstructed with surface and volume rendering software (Mimics NV Belgium) and the volumetric images were modified to display the teeth from various orientations. Six anterior teeth were segmented and their roots isolated. Kruskal Wallis test was used to statistically evaluate root volume difference. The volume difference between two time intervals was statistically significant for all roots investigated (where significance value p < 0. 05). The distal and palatal surfaces of lateral incisor, buccal surface of central incisor and distal surface of canine were more affected. The proposed work is first of its kind to analyse technically root resorption without extraction of teeth which enables a new quality of information sharing, collaboratively solving problem and integration of two different fields...|$|R

Changes in track geometry result in track irregularity. For managing the mean value of track irregularity, Railway Maintenance Department in China uses track quality index (TQI) to quantify track irregularity of a unit track section. TQI is used for planning and scheduling railway track maintenance and guiding track maintenance work in China. Based {{on the characteristics of}} changes in TQI and in accordance with differential and integral principles, a novel track irregularity prediction technique has been developed in this article. This technique utilizes track waveform data generated by a track geometry car to build different track irregularity prediction models for each unit section and use different models to make predictions for TQIs of different unit sections along the railway track on each day in a future short-range period of time. In this article, the technique was applied to 25 sets of track waveforms generated for Beijing–Shanghai railway up-going track (Jing–Hu up-going track) administrated by Jinan Railway Bureau and errors in predicted TQI were analysed in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The error analysis results show that some maintenance works, such as temping, <b>levelling,</b> <b>and</b> <b>aligning</b> have significant influence on TQI predictions.

Given the current spending on these early childhood education programs, research should contribute to informing how to maximize the dollars spent on them.

Two-way analysis of variance and t-test were conducted to compare the generated moments between wires at low- and high-torque brackets separately. The maximum moment generated by the 0. 017 x 0. 025 inch stainless steel archwire in the 0. 018 inch brackets at + 15 degrees ranged from 14. 33 and 12. 95 Nmm for the high- and low-torque brackets, respectively.

Each model was mounted on the orthodontic measurement and simulation system and 10 0. 0175 x 0. 0175 TMA wires were used for each bracket type.

A 15 degrees buccal root torque (+ 15 degrees) and then a 15 degrees palatal root torque (- 15 degrees) were gradually applied to the right central incisor bracket. After each activation, the bracket returned to its initial position and the moments in the sagittal plane were recorded during these rotations of the bracket. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc multiple comparisons (Tukey test at 0. 05 error rate) was conducted to assess the effect on bracket type on the generated moments. The magnitude of maximum moment at + 15 degrees ranged 8. 8, 8. 2, 7. 1, and 5. 8 Nmm for the Incognito, STb, conventional Gemini, and the In-Ovation L brackets, respectively; similar values were recorded at - 15 degrees: 8. 6, 8. 1, 7. 0, and 5. 7 Nmm, respectively. The recorded differences of maximum moments were statistically significant, except between the Incognito and STb brackets. Additionally, the torque angles were evaluated at which the crown torque fell well below the minimum levels of 5. 0 Nmm, as well as the moment/torque ratio at the last part of the activation/deactivation curve, between 10 and 15 degrees.
