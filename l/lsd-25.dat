500|$|In August 1968 {{the unit}} created a [...] "Total Encounter Capsule", {{which was a}} windowless, soundproofed room, [...] wide and [...] long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat {{on the floor and}} a ceiling {{containing}} a one-way mirror. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide [...] "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions." [...] Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with <b>LSD-25.</b> The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.|$|E

50|$|N-Morpholinyllysergamide (LSM-775) is a {{derivative}} of ergine. It {{is reported to}} have some LSD-like effects at doses ranging from 75 to 700 micrograms and a shorter duration.

5000|$|Publisher's Weekly said of On the Bus, [...] "This book lacks only a {{bound-in}} tab of <b>LSD-25</b> {{to make it}} {{the real}} thing." [...] In 2012, the book was purchased by James Franco and is currently in development as a feature film.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{theories}} include food-poisoning {{caused by}} the toxic and psychoactive chemical products of ergot fungi, which grows commonly on grains in the wheat family (such as rye). Ergotamine is the main psychoactive product of ergot fungi, it is structurally related to the recreational drug lysergic acid diethylamide (<b>LSD-25),</b> and is the substance from which <b>LSD-25</b> was originally synthesized. The same fungus has also been implicated in other major historical anomalies, including the Salem witch trials. Waller speculates that the dancing was [...] "stress-induced psychosis" [...] on a mass level, since the region where the people danced was riddled with starvation and disease, and the inhabitants tended to be superstitious. Seven other cases of dancing plague were reported in the same region during the medieval era.|$|E
5000|$|The Acid Tests were {{a series}} of parties held by author Ken Kesey in the San Francisco Bay Area during the mid-1960s, {{centered}} entirely on the use of, and advocacy of, the psychedelic drug LSD, also known as [...] "acid". <b>LSD-25</b> had not been made illegal in California until October 6th,1966.|$|E
50|$|USS San Marcos (<b>LSD-25)</b> was a Casa Grande-class dock {{landing ship}} of the United States Navy, {{named for the}} Castillo de San Marcos, the oldest masonry fort still {{standing}} in the United States. In 1911, the second-class battleship Texas had also briefly borne the name San Marcos, perhaps for the town of San Marcos, Texas.|$|E
50|$|Psychedelics such as <b>LSD-25</b> and psilocybin-containing {{mushrooms}} demonstrate {{very rapid}} tachyphylaxis. In other words, {{one may be}} unable to 'trip' two days in a row. Some people are able to 'trip' by taking up to three times the dosage, yet some users {{may not be able to}} negate tachyphylaxis at all until a period of days has gone by.|$|E
50|$|Having {{read in a}} {{scientific}} journal about the then-obscure drug <b>LSD-25,</b> Hubbard felt {{this was something that}} he was destined to learn more about and to be involved with. Hubbard found a researcher who was conducting reported experiments on LSD with rats. He was able to obtain some LSD for himself. He believed in its utility for opening the human mind to deeper, broader vistas.|$|E
50|$|At the {{scientific}} investigation division, forensic chemist Ray Murray {{states that the}} drug is lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate, commonly known as <b>LSD-25,</b> that it was developed by a Swiss biochemist named Albert Hofmann, and it causes hallucinations, severe nausea along with aches and pains as well as anxiety and depression. Sergeant Friday states there are no laws to cover the use or sale of LSD.|$|E
50|$|Many {{psychedelic}} drugs (e.g. <b>LSD-25)</b> {{produce their}} effects by binding to the oligomerized complexes of the 5HT2A and mGlu2 receptors. Lisuride acts preferentially or {{exclusively on the}} non-heteromerized 5HT2A receptors, which are not capable of inducing psychedelic effects. Due to this, lisuride is capable of reducing the hallucinogenic effects of these drugs through competitive agonistic activity (producing {{the effect of a}} silent-agonist in the presence of these drugs).|$|E
50|$|The Temple of the True Inner Light is {{a temple}} in Manhattan which {{believes}} entheogens such as dipropyltryptamine, cannabis, <b>LSD-25,</b> mescaline, psilocybin, DMT {{and others to}} be the true flesh of God, and that all religions are based upon the psychedelic experience. They also have a non-profit charitable organization involved in building housing for low-income and street people, and in helping people to detox from alcohol, opiates, and cocaine.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{research}} {{focuses on}} mushrooms that may have hypoglycemic activity, anti-cancer activity, anti-pathogenic activity, and immune system-enhancing activity. Recent {{research has found that}} the oyster mushroom naturally contains the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, mushrooms produce large amounts of vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, and that certain fungi may be a future source of taxol. [...] To date, penicillin, lovastatin, ciclosporin, griseofulvin, cephalosporin, <b>LSD-25,</b> and statins are the most famous pharmaceuticals that have been isolated from the fifth kingdom of life.|$|E
50|$|LSD is {{virtually}} never laced with other chemicals, but other lysergamides such as ALD-52 are sometimes sold as <b>LSD-25.</b> DOB, DOI, and other closely related drugs are sometimes sold as LSD. Several other highly potent hallucinogens such as Bromo-DragonFLY or 25I-NBOMe {{can be found}} in the form of blotters. LSD is also tasteless in normal dosages, so detection is only possible after ingestion or reagent testing. For these reasons, it is not uncommon to find blotters sold as LSD completely devoid of psychoactive substances.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958, {{with the}} {{encouragement}} of Wilson and Heard, and with funding from the Eileen Garrett's Parapsychological Foundation, she helped to organize a group of intellectuals to explore clinical and spiritual potential of <b>LSD-25.</b> Between 1958 and 1960, the so-called [...] "Basic Group" [...] gathered {{on a regular basis}} to take <b>LSD-25</b> in an intimate but controlled setting. The sessions were held in private homes just outside New York City. A small dose of the drug (75 to 100 micrograms), which was at that time still legally available for research purposes, would be administered to a single subject by an attending physician, Dr. Robert Laidlaw, then chief psychiatrist at Roosevelt Hospital. In addition to the subject and the physician, several other members of the group would be present, both to offer support, take observational notes and occasionally to ask probing questions of the subject during their experience. The subject’s observations were compiled into written transcripts of the experience, and in most cases were accompanied by audio recordings. After the experience, subjects were asked to write a “subjective report” reflecting on their experiences. The transcripts and reports were distributed to the various members of the group. Participants in these experiments included Eugene Exman (religion editor for Harper & Brothers), Dr. Garma Chen Chi Chang (respected Buddhist scholar and Bollingen Fellow), and early civil rights activist Rachel Davis-Dubois.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{event was}} {{an episode of}} {{supposed}} xenoglossia. Supposedly, Dick's wife transcribed the sounds she heard him speak, and discovered that he was speaking Koine Greek—the common Greek dialect during the Hellenistic years (3rd century BC-4th century AD) and direct [...] "father" [...] of today's modern Greek language—which he had never studied. As Dick was to later discover, Koine Greek was originally used to write the New Testament and the Septuagint. However, {{this was not the}} first time Dick had claimed xenoglossia: a decade earlier, Dick insisted he was able to think, speak, and read fluent Koine Greek under the influence of Sandoz <b>LSD-25.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, the United States {{military}} investigated a {{wide range}} of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral, chemical incapacitating agents to include psychedelic indoles such as lysergic acid diethylamide (<b>LSD-25)</b> and the tetrahydrocannabinol derivative DMHP, certain tranquilizers, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was assigned the NATO code [...] "BZ" [...] and was weaponized beginning in the 1960s for possible battlefield use. (Although BZ figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 movie, Jacob's Ladder, as the compound responsible for hallucinations and violent deaths in a fictitious American battalion in Vietnam, this agent never saw operational use.) Destruction of American stockpiles of BZ began in 1988 and is now complete.|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} {{had been building}} a case against Tim Scully's partner in the Windsor lab, Nick Sand, since late 1971. In early 1973 Billy Hitchcock was threatened with 24 {{years in prison for}} tax evasion if he didn't help the government convict the prime movers of the LSD cartel. Billy provided evidence and testified against Tim Scully and Nick Sand and they were both indicted in April 1973. Scully's defense was that he was producing ALD-52, which was legal, and not the controlled substance <b>LSD-25.</b> Scully lost the case and was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1974. Scully's appeals ran out in late 1976, so he sold his stock in his company and began serving prison time in early 1977.|$|E
5000|$|LSD {{was first}} made by Albert Hofmann in Switzerland in 1938 from ergotamine, a {{chemical}} from the fungus ergot. The laboratory {{name for the}} compound was the acronym for the German [...] "Lyserg-säure-diäthylamid", followed by a sequential number: <b>LSD-25.</b> Hofmann discovered its psychedelic properties in 1943. LSD was introduced as a commercial medication under the trade-name Delysid for various psychiatric uses in 1947. In the 1950s, officials at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) thought the drug might be useful for mind control and chemical warfare and tested the drug on young servicemen and students, and others without their knowledge. The subsequent recreational use by youth culture in the Western world as part of 1960s counterculture resulted in its prohibition.|$|E
50|$|After {{returning}} from a visiting professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, Alpert accepted a tenure-track position at Harvard, where he worked with the Social Relations Department, the Psychology Department, the Graduate School of Education, and the Health Service, {{where he was a}} therapist. Perhaps most notable was the work he did with his close friend and associate Timothy Leary, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University. Both Alpert and Leary experimented with and devoted intensive research to the potentially therapeutic effects of hallucinogenic drugs such as psilocybin, <b>LSD-25,</b> and other psychedelic chemicals. They continued on to co-author a book entitled The Psychedelic Experience. Leary and Alpert were formally dismissed from the university in 1963. According to Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey, Leary was dismissed for leaving Cambridge and his classes without permission or notice, and Alpert for allegedly giving psilocybin to an undergraduate.|$|E
5000|$|As {{is typical}} for the band, the music {{contains}} {{an array of}} samples from horror films, television shows, and documentaries. The song [...] "Convulsion" [...] contains samples from the 1967 documentary <b>LSD-25</b> {{as well as from}} the Japanese erotic horror anime Legend of the Overfiend (the sound effects heard at the beginning of the song). [...] "Tormentor" [...] contains a line from the Bob Clark's 1987 film From the Hip. [...] "Natures Revenge" [...] samples the 1989 film Communion while [...] "Shore Lined Poison" [...] samples the 1967 film The Trip.

The song [...] "T.F.W.O." [...] features the line [...] "you have to fuck life" [...] from the 1973 horror film Flesh for Frankenstein and [...] "Reclamation" [...] contains samples from the 1988 horror film Hellbound: Hellraiser II and the 1978 animated adaptation of Watership Down.|$|E
5000|$|He {{made his}} first escape after a month at Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee, where he put <b>LSD-25</b> from the hospital’s {{pharmacy}} into the staff’s coffee. His plan was to slip out while the staff was under the drug's influence. Unfortunately, security was called {{as some of the}} staff were having various freak-outs from the LSD. The ward was locked down before he could make his move. During his first escape, he and a few other prisoners made a run for the wall. DeFriest got over the fence and hot-wired a car before authorities recaptured and sent him to Bay County Jail. During his time in prison, DeFriest attempted 13 escapes total with astonishing resourcefulness. He could replicate keys after memorizing their patterns, and make them out of anything available. He fashioned a zip gun out of a toothpaste tube. His cleverness led to seven successful escapes out of thirteen, but outraged the guards at every facility. The [...] "escape artist" [...] reputation that followed led to almost 40 years in harsh prison conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of Dark Star in 2001, Hayes toured {{with the}} Pet Shop Boys {{and worked as}} guitar tech/tour/production manager {{for the likes of}} My Bloody Valentine, Kula Shaker and David Cassidy. In 2007, Hayes began releasing archive releases of previously unreleased solo material (recording during and shortly after his time with Levitation) under the name of Mikrokosmos via Ingatia Recordings. A trio of releases, In The Heart Of The Home, The Seven Stars and final installment in 2014 Terra Familliar have been issued. In 2011, Hayes organised and compiled the tribute record Leader Of The Starry Skies in aid of Cardiacs frontman Tim Smith, who suffered two strokes in 2008 which left him paralysed down one side of his body and unable to speak. He also toured with a stage version of Macbeth in 2011 and 2012, produced by Platform 4 and described as [...] "a taut psychodrama that crackles with a wild electricity, brought alive by the sonic experiments of composer and guitarist Bic Hayes and sound designer Jules Bushel". More recently Hayes has been involved in several improvisational instrumental psychedelic bands in Brighton, including ZOFFF, Light Specific Data and <b>LSD-25</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 1968 {{the unit}} created a [...] "Total Encounter Capsule", {{which was a}} windowless, soundproofed room, 8 ft wide and 10 ft long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat {{on the floor and}} a ceiling {{containing}} a one-way mirror.

50|$|At age 16, Christian W. Staudinger {{left home}} {{and went to}} Erfurt, where he began his waiter-apprenticeship after his {{original}} career aspirations of the sailor in the merchant navy and, thereafter, the boatman on inland waters had been rejected by the Stasi. The people in GDR needed a permit from the state for their career aspirations. In Erfurt he fell into circles around Eberhard Häfner and others, which discussed passionate about politics and art, listened {{to the music of}} the so-called imperialist Staatsfeind and he came in contact with THC and <b>LSD-25.</b> He read Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego and Totem and Taboo by Sigmund Freud, which he had received from Eberhard Häfner. The new findings he tied into his examination paper for the final examination - then at least an affront. The teacher, Mrs. Richter, expressed her enthusiasm behind her hand, but could not vote because literature of the “State-enemy” had been cited. The day after his practical test, from which he made a parody and therefore he failed, Staudinger went to his escape from East Germany. To his desire to leave his beloved home, emerging and fast growing doubts about the integrity of the system have led. He had read the classics, but all that did not stand a comparison with reality. In addition, he wanted to become a skydiver. He was in the Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik, but in order to jump one had to be in the National People's Army or in the Stasi. The Stasi began to be interested in him and tried to recruit him as part of the OPK (operational checks on persons). He felt honored and loved those discussions with the Stasi officers who at home always encountered violent counter-arguments. But soon the Stasi was tired, wanted names that refused the artist and at the end stand the never-forgotten threat who received many former GDR-citizens in the same wording: “Either you are with us or against us. Join in and out you can be something. If not, you will croak on the machine!” Christian W. Staudinger 1971 in the age of 18 and together with a friend made on the way to Bulgaria in order to leave the country to Turkey. This way many so-called “Republic-refugees” had chosen, as Stefan Appelius, Professor of Political Science, has researched. Only the brother was informed, in order not to endanger the family. At the Veleka they failed to escape because the maps were false. They came to arrest and torure in the Bulgarian prisons. But he stayed alive, unlike other refugees. The Stasi in Bulgaria stationed brought him back to East Germany, he came into the Stasi prison Andreasstrasse in Erfurt in custody and was sentenced to one year and seven months for his attempt of illegal emigration and anti-state-propaganda, which he served in Cottbus. With the help of the two lawyers Vogel & Stange (one east, one west, and in that times famous in Germany) he came straight from prison to the Federal Republic of Germany. He by a tragic event, unlike many others in the GDR for political offenses convicted, came into possession of at least the copies of the indictment and judgment. The experiences of the flight are published in German as an audio book on YouTube, spoken by Erich Räuker. Shortly before his flight Christian W. Staudinger had fathered a child, of which he only heard in prison as it was already born. He managed to bring mother and child in the way of family reunification to West-Berlin. The West and the events of the recent past ruined everything he had believed, so that he tried to kill himself in 1974 with 250 sleeping pills. From the clinical death the doctors succeeded in his salvation. His brother, Ulrich Staudinger, later was sentenced to 4 years for reportedly subversive propaganda. Released earlier he jumped to death in West-Berlin-subway 1981.|$|E
