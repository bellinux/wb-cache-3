40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{behavioral}} response of fish to lights, studies have been conducted, mainly, on phototaxis-aided alluring, {{and the results are}} being applied widely to attracting fish. A constant light was used in most of these studies, however, the influence of the inconstant light on a fish school's behavior has hardly been examined, in spite of great concern about the effect of such stimulation. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify, from an ethological point of view, that an inconstant lighting condition, in which light goes on and off with a short cyclical time as an intermittent or flickering light,would give a different stimulation from that of a constant light to fish. The observations of the fish school's behavior in response to intermittent lights which have different blinking frequencies and contrast ratios between bright and dark light intensities and different wavelengths of lights were conducted. Then the difference between the fish school's behavior in response to the intermittent light under a state of dark adaptation and under light adaptation was examined by changing the background irradiances under these projected lights. In order to apply the obtained results to controlling the swimming behavior of a fish school, a prototype multiple beam projector was constructed and used to examine the barrier effect of a <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> made of projected beams, upon the behavior of fish. I Response of a School of Japanese Horse Mackerel to Intermittent Light 1) Method An outdoor concrete round tank 7 m in diameter and 1. 5 m in depth of Banda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Fisheries was used for the experiments. The tank was facilitated with a set of partitions extending outward from its center leaving a circular free passage 1. 3 m wide along the wall of the tank. The inside surface of the wall was coated with black paint. A light projector equipped with a light source, rotating shutter device and color filters was installed at a position 50 cm above the water level near the center of the tank. The free passage was illuminated diagonally from the light projector. The tank was covered with a lightproof roof and equipped with 8 miniature bulbs to regulate the background irradiances homogeneously. One-year-old Japanese horse mackerels, Trachurus japonicus, which had a striking phototaxis, were used for the experiments. Specimens were between l 7 to 20 cm in total length. Vivid and healthy horse mackerels were selected at the site of a stationary trap net, transported to the laboratory and used for the experiments within 24 - 36 hours, in order to use them as much as possible under their natural conditions. Care was taken based on confirmation by a preliminary experiment that, when the fish were released into the circular free passage, they had a good command of cruising for about two days after being caught, after which their behavior as a school fell into disorder. In the experiments, the projector was operated to give a constant light for 20 minutes and an intermittent light for 20 minutes, alternatively. Under such lighting conditions, the movements of the school were traced. Changes in schooling behavior were observed and characterized by the school's appearance times in the irradiated area. The irradiated area was located in the range of the fish's visual field in which a direct beam flux projected from the light source could be seen (the circular free passage was divided into 16 equal sections). The difference ratio (R) in appearance times was calculated from the data using the following equation: R=(1 - D/S) X 100 (%) where "S" stands for the number of appearance times in the irradiated area under a constant light and "D" for those under an intermittent light. The experiments were conducted only at night,in order to avoid artificial noises and lights around the tank. The same kind of experiments were repeatedly carried on, through different blinking frequencies and contrast ratios between bright and dark light intensities of intermittent light,and changing of wavelengths of projected lights and background irradiances. The experiments were carried on for a period from August to November each year,between 1983 and 1987. The total numbers of experiments and fish used for the study were 299 and 3, 900, respectively. The water temperature in the tank was maintained in a range of 20 - 25 ℃. 2) Typical mode of response There was a wide difference between the number of times the school appeared in the irradiated area under an intermittent light and under a constant light. That is, in the case of the constant light, the fish school approached the irradiated area, but the school avoide the intermittent light (the school did not approach the area at all when the intermittent light was projected). These results show that an intermittent light induces a high degree of aversion by the fish to lieht. 3) Response to different blinking frequencies of intermittent light The number of times the school appeared in the irradiated area under intermittent lights varied with blinking frequencies. A minimum number of appearance times was seen when blinking frequencies were in the range of 0. 62 - 1. 36 c/s, with the difference ratio being 92 - 98 %. When blinking frequencies were more or less than the aforementioned range, the number of times they appeared increased further. Thus, it was concluded that the school of fish showed the highest degree of aversion to the intermittent light when the blinking frequency range was within the range of 0. 62 - 1. 36 c/s. These frequencies correspond to l/ 37 - l/l 7 of the critical fusion frequency of the horse mackerel's eye, obtained by means of electroretinography. 4) Response to different contrast ratios of intermittent light The number of times the school appeared in the irradiated area under intermittent ligltts increased in comparison with a decreasing contrast ratio. In the case of the intermittent light having a contrast ratio of 60 : 1 or more when the background irradiance was kept at less than 0. 01 lx, the difference ratios showed more than 75 %; and in case of 2 : 1, it indicated 2 %. Consequently,it was found that the scool of fish showed a considerably high degree of aversion to the intermittent light when the contrast ratio was 60 : 1 or more, but the ratio at which the school did not show any aversion to light at all was 2 : 1. The value of the differential threshold of brightness and darkness of fish's eye has been considered to be in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 2. The fish's aversion to the intermittent light was seen when the contrast ratio was at least 300 times as much as the threshold value, but disappeared when it decreased to 10 times that value. 5) Response to different wavelengths of lights The number of times the school appeared in the irradiated area under intermittent lights varied with the wavetengths of the projected lights. The difference ratio was obtained by projecting blue and red lights through certain color filters in addition to the white light (the entire spectrum). 'Ihe difference ratio of the blue light was almost equal to that of the white light, and about twice as much as that for the red light, The underwater energy of the blue light was only 1 / 6 of that of the white light, and was about 2 / 5 of that of the red liglt. The results showed a good correlatian with the quantity of stimulation given to the eye, when the quantity was considered as the integrated value of energy which reached the eye multiplied by visual sensitivity. 6) Response to different background irradiances When the fish's dwelling environment became brighter, the state of the retina in the fish's eye changed from dark to light adaptation, and the number of appearance times into the irradiated area under intermittent lights began to increase. The difference ratios were over 94 % with background irradiances less than 0. 01 lx, 56 - 28 % with 0. 01 - 0. 02 lx, and 20 % wrth 0. 2 lx. The most prominent degree of aversion to the light was seen when background irradiance was less than 0. 01 lx, and it decreased with increasing background irradiance but a certain degree of aversion still remained up to an irradiance of 0. 02 lx and then, it disappeared when irradiance had reached 0. 2 lx. A physiological study discloses that the retina of horse mackerel commences its retinomotor response even if environmental irradiance is less than 0. 01 lx, and the state of the retina changes into light adaptation or fairly good approximation of light adaptation, under irradiances of 0. 01 to 0. 02 lx. Such a decrease of fish's aversion to light under irradiances of 0. 01 to 0. 02 lx was conceivable to be caused by the fish's eye changing from dark to light adaptation. The relation between fish's aversion to the intermittent light and the contrast ratio of the intermittent light under a state of dark adaptation and under light adaptation was compared. The limits of the contrast ratio, within which the school showed a high degree of aversion to light, were more than 60 : 1 under the state of dark adaptation, and 5, 000 : 1 under that of light adaptation. Furthermore, the limits of the contrast in which the school did not show any aversion to light at all were in the ratio 2 : 1 under the state of dark adaptation, and 500 : 1 under that of light adaptation. It was concluded, that the limits, within which the school showed aversion to the intermittent light under the circumstances of dark adaptation were different from such limits under light adaptation by 102. A physiological study discloses that when each eye of fish undergoes light adaptation, sensitivity to light by each retina is decreased by l 0 - 2 to 10 - 5 times. These physiological outcomes reasonably supported the results, which were induced from the present behavioral studies. The outcomes introduced above, showed that an inconstant lighting condition in which a light goes on and off with a short cyclic time gave a considerable high degree of fish's aversion to light (avoidance behavior), quite contrary to an attracting influence (gathering behavior). Moreover, it was found that degrees of fish's aversion to light vary not only with blinking frequencies and contrast ratios of intermittent light and wavelengths of light, but also with the state of dark/light adaptation of fish's eye. In addition, the limit within which the school showed aversion to the intermittent light were different from the limits obtained from the physiological studies, such as critical fusion frequency and the differental threshold of brightness and darkness. Acclimation to light is another subject to be checked, when behavior of fish school in response to lights is obseved. The experiment was undertaken to clarify the acclimational influence on the fish's aversion to intermittent light. There was almost no change in fish's appearance times, even after continuous projection of intermittent light for 4 hours. That is, an acclimation phenomenon was not detected. On the contrary, it is known that the alluring effect of a fish attracting lamp on a school of horse mackerel, mackerel, and sardine starts to decrease 2 - 3 hours after the operation. It was concluded that the occurrence of the acclimation phenomenon in the fish's aversion to intermittent light was far less than for the case of the alluring effect by continuous lights. 　Behavioral activation and inactivation can also be regarded as the general efｆects of light on the behavior of a fish school. Moving speeds of the fish school exposed to constant and intermittent lights were compared. The average moving speed under the constant light was about 20 cm/s, ｗhile the speed under the intermittent light was 14 cm/s. This means that the fish's moving speeds under the intermittent light was reduced by 30 % of its speed under the constant light. It seems that the slowing down of the fish's moving speeds can be considered as an indication of fish's aversion to the intermittent light. II Control of a fish school's behavior with a <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> made of a projected beam In order to apply the above-mentioned results to the control of a fish school's behavior, a multiple beam projector was constructed. 1) Multiple beam projeetor The multiple beam projector was designed to irradiate the 8 beams having an angle of 2 degrees to the optical axis, a diameter of 26 mm, and a maximum projecting irradiance of 2, 000 lx. Both the blinking frequency and the contrast ratio could be changed. A light from a halogen lamp was converted into intermittent lights by a rotating shutter disk (optical chopper). The wavelength of light longer than 750 nm was cut out with infared absorbing filter. The light was distributed to 8 optical fibers, and projected as 8 beams from the terminal lenses of each fiber. For the experiments, 8 beams having a blinking frequency of 1. 36 c/s were projected orthogonally and vertically to the circular free passage with 12 cm intervals, that is, by creating a <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> of light. Under such lightings, the movements of the school were traced. The same kind of experiment was repeatedly carried on, by irradiances of the beams being changed into 8 grades from 1, 235 to 0. 025 lx and background irradiances of 0. 1 lx and 0. 003 lx. 2) Response to the <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> made of light The <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> of light having irradiances of the beam over 0. 25 lx for dark adaptation (background irradiance, 0. 003 lx), and over 506 lx for light adaptation (background irradiance, 0. 1 lx) were confirmed to exert a prominent barrier effect on the swimming behavior of the school of fish. In other words, the obstruction effect of the net against the passage of a fish school occurred under a dark adaptation with the contrast ratio of the beam being more than 83 : 1 and under a light adaptation with the ratio being over 5, 060 : 1. In order to apply such an effect to practical fisheries, an estimation was made on the effective range of the <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> of light which could obstruct the passage of a fish school, using the coastal waters of Sagami Bay as an example. Results of the estimation indicated that a fish could find the <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> of light at a horizontal distance of 30 m, with the effective range of about 16 m, Factors were set as follows: underwater irradiance, less than 0. 01 |x; differential threshold of the fish's eye, 0. 05; and beam attenuation coefficient, 0. 5 m- 1. Vertical downward projection of beams with 2, 000 lx irradiance was used as the condition for the construction of the <b>leader</b> <b>net.</b> Consequently, satisfactory passage obstruction effect by the ieader net of light can be expected in practicai fisheries. Since it has been reported that underwater irradiance in the Sagami Bay was reduced by 10 - 3 even at a depth of 20 m from the surface, applcatbn of natural lghts to the <b>leader</b> <b>net</b> of light could be considered a support, by introducing the surface lights into the sea through optical fibers in the daytime. In addition, the behavior-controlling effect could be improved further by changing the direction and phase of the beam. This study made it clear through a series of experiments on Japanese horse mackerel, Trachurus japonicus, that an inconstant lighting conditoon can exert a remarkable influence on fish schooling behavior. Further development of the achievement will result in its broad applications to fisheries and culture fisheries in the future, such as in the alluring and controlling of the swimming behavior of a fish school...|$|E

Using these observations, I worked with the Virginia Aquarium to design an experiment to test the new leaders during the 2008 fishing season. The primary goal of this experiment is to determine whether the experimental leader will affect the catch of target fish species. From an analysis of dolphin strandings in Virginia from 1997 - 2004, I found that pound nets accounted for the greatest percentage (50 %) of all documented Human Interaction (HI) strandings. I also used geospatial analyses to examine the distribution of bottlenose dolphin strandings that may be associated with bycatch in pound nets. HI stranded dolphins were found significantly closer to the Virginia Beach pound nets than dolphins that stranded for another reason (No HI) or for an unknown cause (CBD). Together these analyses help to improve our understanding of interactions between bottlenose dolphins and the Virginia Beach pound net fishery, as well as the importance of community-based management efforts...|$|R

40|$|Rural {{residential}} development presents many economic, environmental, fiscal, {{social and political}} issues to rural places. This thesis examined development pattern and fiscal and social impact {{as they relate to}} residential, non-farm development outside of incorporated towns in the Loess Hills region in seven counties in western Iowa from 1995 through 1999. The first part of this work analyzed the physical pattern and county planning regulations of this development and resulting fiscal impacts. Development was found to have increased rapidly in some areas, with a slight majority of the development located on estate lots outside of subdivisions. Using an average costs method, the direct monetary costs and revenues to county governments associated with this new development were identified. In five of the seven counties the costs exceeded the revenue, but by less than the amount that costs of providing public services to all rural non-farm residences exceeded revenues from all rural non-farm residences. In the two metropolitan counties, revenues exceeded costs by a slight amount. Available capacities of existing infrastructure met much of the need of new development during this period.;Thus, the net fiscal cost may rise as physical development continues, but existing capacities are exhausted. A database from a 1994 survey of rural communities and surrounding areas was used to compare social aspects of rural, non-farm residents with in-town residents and new residents with long term residents. Two measures were used: community attachment and satisfaction with community. In this cross sectional analysis, rural, non-farm residents demonstrated less community attachment and satisfaction than in-town residents. People with more than ten years of residence exhibited more attachment and satisfaction than shorter-term residents. Residents in counties with the fastest rates of development reported less community attachment and satisfaction than residents in more slowly developing counties, although these relationships were not as strong. These findings present opportunities and challenges to local <b>leaders.</b> Although <b>net</b> fiscal costs for rural {{residential development}} are less than for urban residential development, future costs can be substantial, but can minimized by planning.

40|$|In {{the context}} of current {{economic}} and financial crisis a comparative analysis of the main indices {{of economic and social}} performance of the EU member states is necessary. In such line of argument, the authors propose, as novelty, an economic power-economic performance matrix as a methodological instrument for monitoring significant discontinuities {{in the development of the}} EU member states, able to provide consistent information about some of the threats against the EU economic sustainability. The core idea is to use integrating criteria able to reveal in a clear manner the results of the common efforts of governments, businesses and civil society aiming to improve the economic and social performance of the 27 EU countries.

She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the current}} times of {{increasing}} turbulence and uncertainty defining organisational life, executive leaders {{need to develop}} their ‘capability for uncertainty’, that is, their ability to engage with uncertainty in their context, while managing their experienced uncertainty. However, what constitutes a holistic capability for uncertainty is not clear. The {{purpose of the study}} was to propose a coaching framework and guidelines towards developing executive leaders’ capability for uncertainty, including recommendations for future research. This purpose was achieved through an integration of insights derived from making sense of (1) executive leaders’ lived experience of uncertainty and what capability for uncertainty they develop through their experience; and (2) executive coaches’ lived experience of assisting executives with uncertainty and their views on what constitutes a capability for uncertainty. A qualitative research approach was adopted, using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The research design was cross-sectional, multi-perspectival and retrospective, utilising a three-phased strategy, with data collected through semi-structured interviews. In Phase 1, six executive leaders were interviewed from two companies with different time periods of organisational uncertainty, resulting in integrated sample of twelve executives. Six executive coaches, with different training or educational backgrounds, and not in a coaching relationship with the executives in Phase 1, were interviewed in Phase 2. An integrative analysis in Phase 3 of the findings across Phase 1 (executive leaders) and Phase 2 (executive coaches) informed a proposed coaching framework towards developing executives’ capability for uncertainty. The executive leaders’ lived experience of uncertainty in both companies was found to be one of flux. Their felt uncertainty was a complex and dynamic phenomenon that comprised overlapping and inter-related types of personal uncertainty and challenges experienced in their <b>leader</b> role. The <b>net</b> effect was that the executive leaders’ felt uncertainty seemed to manifest primarily as issues of identity and decreased personal agency. A core aspect of the executives’ approach to managing their uncertainty was through sensemaking and identity construction. The valence and intensity of the executives’ felt uncertainty appeared to affect the quality of and approach to their sensemaking. The findings clarify the sensemaking and identity construction processes adopted, and the inter-relationship between them, thereby adding to the body of knowledge on executive uncertainty and how it is approached [...] .
