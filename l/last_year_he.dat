5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>He</b> got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new {{contract}} with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>He</b> finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of the past couple years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>He</b> disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E

25|$|Jonathon Porritt's {{call for}} the Green Party to select a single leader is flawed.

If they do not, he promises the books will be burned, and all will return to normal.|$|E
25|$|This {{resulted}} in being turned back again, {{putting him in}} the class of 1851. The year 1850 brought Smith close to failing again, just short of being deficient in Chemistry and accumulating 177 demerits; but in the end he managed to pass the year and became a Firstie, or first class cadet. In his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>he</b> accumulated the allowed 200 demerits, what made him the second worst cadet currently at the academy, and once again short of failing. But he didn't; his grades were all {{in the last quarter of}} his class, except engineering, and he graduated as 36th out of 42 graduates on July 1, 1851.|$|E

He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round. After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus {{received}} a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilken Bridge. Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a birdie, holing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).|$|E
25|$|At Northwestern Law School, Washington was {{the only}} black student in his class (there were six women in the class, one of them being Dawn Clark Netsch). As at Roosevelt, he entered school politics. In 1951, his <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>he</b> was elected {{treasurer}} of the Junior Bar Association (JBA). The election was largely symbolic, however, and Washington's attempts to give the JBA more authority at Northwestern were largely unsuccessful. On campus, Washington joined the Nu Beta Epsilon fraternity, largely because {{he and the other}} minorities which constituted the fraternity were blatantly excluded from the other fraternities on campus. Overall, Washington stayed away from the activism that defined his years at Roosevelt. During the evenings and weekends, he worked to supplement his GI Bill income. He received his J.D. in 1952.|$|E
500|$|Buck Flowers was in {{his first}} year on the team. He was a small back who had {{transferred}} from Davidson, where <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>he</b> starred in the game against Tech. Flowers had grown to weigh 150 pounds and was a backup until Heisman discovered his ability as an open-field runner on punt returns. [...] "Heisman's eyes bulged. And bulged again. On the first punt, Buck ran through the entire first team. Same thing again... and again. Heisman had uncovered one of the greatest broken-field runners." ...|$|E

500|$|On November 12, 2016, Valencia {{was traded}} to the Seattle Mariners in {{exchange}} for pitcher Paul Blackburn. General manager Jerry Dipoto said: [...] "What we see is primarily is shared time at first base with Dan Vogelbach, give a day off or DH day at third base for Kyle Seager, which is something we haven’t had the flexibility to do and (Valencia) can also go play either corner (outfield) spot. He’s a flexible corner piece that we see as an every day or near every day player, using him at a variety of different positions... <b>Last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>he</b> had 500-plus plate appearances. We envision a similar type of workload." ...|$|E
500|$|Bauer {{illustrated}} the 1913–15 editions, {{printed in the}} same three colors as previously. 1913 marked {{the peak of his}} performance in these books, and Bauer's illustrations from that edition are among the most reproduced of his works. In 1914, his illustrations started to be influenced by the Italian Renaissance. At that time Bauer wanted to stop illustrating the series, but was contractually obligated to illustrate one more edition. 1915 was the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>he</b> worked with trolls and gnomes; he said he [...] "was done with them and wanted to move on". The war in Europe had altered Bauer's vision of the world and he stated that he could no longer imagine it as a fairy tale.|$|E
500|$|On February 18, 2012, the Royals {{announced}} they had signed Hosmer to {{a one-year contract}} for the 2012 season. No financial terms of the deal were released. During spring training, Hosmer led all players with 29 RBIs and had a slugging percentage of [...]714. Discussing Hosmer's spring training, Royals Hall of Famer George Brett said, [...] "He's a baseball player... He acts like a baseball player. And boy, he's {{going to be a}} damn good one, too." [...] By opening day, the Kansas City media was hyping Hosmer as the [...] "face of the franchise", the city's [...] " [...] next future sports star", among other commentary after his performance <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>He</b> started at first base on opening day against the L.A. Angels, going 0-for-4.
