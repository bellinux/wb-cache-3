5|$|Six {{units were}} leased by CFL between 2000 and 2004. The Luxembourgian State Railways were {{in need of}} new diesel {{locomotives}} to overcome the three different electrification systems in use. Because of a three-year waiting time for new locomotives, CFL leased the Di6 units for freight trains between Esch-sur-Alzette, Bettembourg and Mertert. In November 2003, the locomotives were sold to Vossloh and given the designation DE 2700. Since 2006, the main <b>leaser</b> is the Veolia Verkehr-owned Nord-Ostsee-Bahn, which operates passenger trains in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Eight locomotives are used to haul six to ten-car passengers trains on the route between Hamburg and Sylt. In 2008, three locomotives returned to Norway, when Cargolink leased them for their new autorack freight operations. In 2009, NOB transferred its ninth unit to HSL Logistik.|$|E

2500|$|No {{matter what}} Shakespeare's {{personal}} religious beliefs might have been, at least outwardly {{he and his}} immediate family were conforming members of the established Church of England. When Shakespeare was young, his father, John Shakespeare, was elected to several municipal offices, serving as an alderman and culminating in a term as bailiff, the chief magistrate of the town council, all of which required being a church member in good standing, and he participated in whitewashing over the Catholic images in the chapel and taking down the rood screen. Shakespeare's birth {{and that of his}} siblings were entered into the church register, as were the births of his three children and the burials of his family members. His brother Edmund, who followed him to London as an actor and died there, was buried in St Saviour's in Southwark [...] "with a forenoone knell of the great bell", most likely paid for by the poet. As <b>leaser</b> of the parish tithes in Stratford, he was a lay rector of the church. He and his wife were buried in the church chancel, and a monument that included a half-figure bust of the poet was set into the north wall of the chancel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} analyze the social {{processes}} which enabled the ascension of slaves descendants as land owners in post-colonial contexts. The debate raised intends to discuss the relations that produce truth discourses, in which the old <b>leasers</b> (Cape Verde) and quilombolas (Brazil) do not easily constitute themselves as land owners. The state of emergency theories understand these phenomena of political oscillation as a peculiar way of safeguarding the public security in an arbitrary paradigm of government. Thus, we will present claims that show land insecurity in these two countries in the complex framework {{of the state of}} the emergency that mix ethnic and political elements. We will present two rural universes: São Salvador do Mundo (Cape Verde) and Canguçu (Brazil). The first one faced hard territorial struggles between morgados and <b>leasers,</b> undergoing the agrarian reform project and currently is under the owning of small proprietaries. The second one experienced various historical changes related to the south land issue, besides concentrating, in its territorial space, a large number of slave workers. Additionally, the two localities offer dense ethnographic materials to work the theoretical issue of "land-security"...|$|R

The depot was demolished in April 2009; since then a discount food and clothing store has been built on the site. Schinkel is a district rich in tradition, with developed residential and business infrastructure.

5000|$|The complex {{was thus}} {{initially}} a mixed-housing initiative earmarked for both high-income and low-income residents, including renters and <b>leasers.</b> However, the buildings' new owners converted the structures into subsidized housing {{to benefit from}} a 10% state subsidy in addition to regular rental revenue. According to Rapson, who designed the towers and still {{lived and worked in}} the neighborhood, they also did not take proper care of the buildings, which led to nicknames such as the [...] "Rainbow Sky Ghetto", [...] "Ghetto in the Sky", and the [...] "Crack Stacks".

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a utility-based and a regret-based model of consumer preferences for alternative fuel vehicles, {{based on a}} large-scale stated choice-experiment held among company car <b>leasers</b> in The Netherlands. Estimation and application of random utility maximization and random regret minimization discrete choice models shows that while the two models achieve almost identical fit with the data and differ only marginally in terms of predictive ability, they generate rather different choice probability-simulations and policy implications. The most eye-catching {{difference between the two}} models is that the random regret minimization model accommodates a compromise-effect, as it assigns relatively high choice probabilities to alternative fuel vehicles that perform reasonably well on each dimension instead of having a strong performance on some dimensions and a poor performance on others. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In 1922, a {{new company}} started mining. That company, the Lucky Boy Divide Mining Company, bought an area {{neighboring}} Athens. A few years later, the mines stopped producing ore, because the ore had become too rare. However, all {{the property of the}} Warrior Company was sold to J.J. McNeil, who reopened the mine in December 1931. The next year, the mine was bought by Warrior Consolidated Gold. The company was not successful and therefore the mine was auctioned by the sheriff in November 1933. L.B. Spencer and L.J. Smith bought it. The ore was brought to the Dayton Consolidated mill in Silver City, Nevada. <b>Leasers</b> were producing ore in Athens until 1939.
