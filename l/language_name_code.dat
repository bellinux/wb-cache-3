40|$|As {{the data}} {{for more and more}} {{languages}} is finding its way into digital form, with an increasing amount of this data being posted to the Web, it has become possible to collect language data from the Web and create large multilingual resources, covering hundreds or even thousands of languages. ODIN, the Online Database of INterlinear text (Lewis, 2006), is such a resource. It currently consists of nearly 200, 000 data points for over 1, 000 languages, {{the data for}} which was harvested from linguistic documents on the Web. We identify a number of issues with language identification for such broad-coverage resources including the lack of training data, ambiguous <b>language</b> <b>names,</b> incomplete <b>language</b> <b>code</b> sets, and incorrect uses of <b>language</b> <b>names</b> and <b>codes.</b> After providing a short overview of existing language code sets maintained by the linguistic community, we discuss what linguists and the linguistic community can do to make the process of language identification easier. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} macroscope has been {{exploited}} in several contexts [dR, f] to outline some methodologies aimed to describe the information of complex systems. The basic idea is that complex systems should be looked at as an integrated whole, rather than be described as an aggregate of standalone components. Following this approach, we introduce a Graphic <b>Language</b> <b>named</b> <b>CoDe</b> (Complexity Design) to describe visual representations which bring information according to the basic idea of a macroscope. The syntactic and semantic specification of CoDe is a framework for a methodology aimed to support visual representation of complex information. An extensible set of graphical patterns are the lexical elements of the language, which provides two families of operators: a first set of operators is supplied to compose basic patterns to form complex ones; {{a second set of}} operators allow the designer to specify the semantics of graphs by creating a logical link with the data they represent. Thus, the CoDe Graphic Language is suited to implement the features of such a methodology. CoDe is proposed as an interactive tool that support the designer of a visualization project in describing the complex system to be represented, by means of component abstraction and relation discovery, which is the basis for most decision processes. An application to graphic visualization realized by the research group DensityDesign at Politecnico di Milano - INDACO Department [dd] is provided. Some future applications to Data Mining and Datawarehouse are also outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{upcoming}} Reconfigurable Video Coding (RVC) standard from MPEG (ISO/IEC SC 29 WG 11) {{defines a}} library of coding tools to specify existing or new compressed video formats and decoders. The coding tool library has been written in a dataflow/actor-oriented <b>language</b> <b>named</b> CAL. Each <b>coding</b> tool can be represented with an extended finite state machine and the dependencies between the tools are described as dataflow graphs. This paper proposes an approach to derive a multiprocessor execution schedule for RVC systems that are comprised of CAL actors. In addition to proposing a scheduling approach for RVC, an extension to the well-known permutation flow shop scheduling problem that enables rapid run-time scheduling of RVC tasks is introduced.

40|$|MultiTree is an NFS-funded project {{collecting}} scholarly {{hypotheses about}} language relationships, and visualizing {{them on a}} web site {{in the form of}} trees or graphs. Two open online interfaces allow scholars, students, and the general public an easy access to search for language information or comparisons of competing hypotheses. One objective of the project was to facilitate research in historical linguistics. MultiTree has evolved to a much more powerful tool, {{it is not just a}} simple repository of scholarly information. In this paper we present the MultiTree interfaces and the impact of the project beyond the field of historical linguistics, including, among others, the use of standardized ISO language codes, and creating an interconnected database of <b>language</b> and dialect <b>names,</b> <b>codes,</b> publications, and authors. Further, we offer the dissemination of linguistic findings world-wide to both scholars and the general public, thus boosting the collaboration and accelerating the scientific exchange. We discuss also the ways MultiTree will develop beyond the time of the duration of the funding...|$|R

40|$|The Online Database of Interlinear Text (ODIN) 1 is a {{database}} of interlinear text “snippets”, harvested mostly from scholarly documents posted to the Web. Although large amounts of language data are posted to the Web as part of scholarly discourse, making the existing “e-Linguistic in-frastructure ” surprisingly rich, most linguistic data avail-able on the Web exists in legacy formats, is highly display-centric, and {{is often difficult to}} locate or interoperate over. ODIN seeks to leverage this existing infrastructure into a rich, searchable, and interoperable resource by converting readily available semi-structured data to content-centric, searchable formats. To do this, ODIN mines scholarly pa-pers and webpages for instances of linguistic data, focusing mostly on interlinear texts, extracts them, identifies source languages, and makes the instances available to search. Through ODIN’s standard search feature, users can locate data by <b>language</b> <b>name</b> or Ethnologue <b>code,</b> and display lists of data by document for languages of interest. The newer Advanced Search feature allows users to locate in-stances by grammatical markup that is used (e. g., NOM, ACC, ERG, PST, 3 SG), and by linguistic constructions (e. g., passives, conditionals, possessives, raising constructions, etc.). The latter are made possible through additional en-richment of discovered data using automated statistical tag-gers and parsers. 1 The ODIN Vision The Online Database of Interlinear Text (ODIN) is {{a database}} of interlinear text “snippets”, harvested mostly from scholarly documents posted to the Web.
