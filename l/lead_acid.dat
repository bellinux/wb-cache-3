25|$|The lead–acid battery was {{the first}} {{practical}} secondary (rechargeable) battery that could have its capacity replenished from an external source. The electrochemical reaction that produced current was (to a useful degree) reversible, allowing electrical energy and chemical energy to be interchanged as needed. Common <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries contain a mixture of acid and water, as well as lead plates. The most common mixture used today is 30% acid. One problem however is if left uncharged acid will crystallize within the lead plates of the battery rendering it useless. These batteries last an average of 3 years with daily use however it is not unheard of for a <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> battery to still be functional after 7–10 years. Lead-acid cells continue to be widely used in automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Batteries come in many {{shapes and}} sizes, from {{miniature}} cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to small, thin cells used in smartphones, to large <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries used in cars and trucks, {{and at the}} largest extreme, huge battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby or emergency power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>acid</b> {{cells can}} easily be {{manufactured}} at home, but a tedious charge/discharge cycle is needed to 'form' the plates. This is {{a process in which}} lead sulfate forms on the plates, and during charge is converted to lead dioxide (positive plate) and pure lead (negative plate). Repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface, increasing the surface area, increasing the current the cell can deliver.|$|E

25|$|Up to this point, all {{existing}} batteries {{would be}} permanently drained when all their chemical reactions were spent. In 1859, Gaston Planté invented the lead–acid battery, the first-ever battery {{that could be}} recharged by passing a reverse current through it. A <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> cell consists of a lead anode and a lead dioxide cathode immersed in sulfuric acid. Both electrodes react with the acid to produce lead sulfate, but the reaction at the lead anode releases electrons whilst the reaction at the lead dioxide consumes them, thus producing a current. These chemical reactions can be reversed by passing a reverse current through the battery, thereby recharging it.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{extremely}} important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry, like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and {{the detection of}} alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the established electrochemical technologies (like deep cycle <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries) {{there is also a}} wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial. Electrochemistry has also important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the determination of free acidity in olive oil.|$|E
500|$|There is an auxiliary, 12volt {{conventional}} <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> battery {{under the}} bonnet/hood for the accessories.

500|$|Located {{on a site}} {{originally}} {{occupied by}} a foreman's office when the land was used for quarrying, the new sawmill building was completed in 1899, providing electricity via two enclosed steam engines and pneumatic power across the estate. The engines were housed {{in what is now}} called the Engine Room, while the Lantern Room held multiple <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries. After opening, {{the decision was made to}} relocate the estate's entire sawmill to the building, to enable better access to electrical power. The steam engines were replaced by diesel generators, and [...] electricity was provided from the national grid post-WW2. In the 1960s, the sawmill was decommissioned and all wood sold to third party contractors to be converted into sawn wood products.|$|E

[...] A gasoline engine drove a generator that served to charge a <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> battery in parallel with the traction motors.

2500|$|Before Tesla had {{developed}} the Roadster's proprietary powertrain, they borrowed an AC Propulsion Tzero vehicle {{as a test}} mule and converted from <b>Lead</b> <b>Acid</b> AGM batteries to Lithium Ion cells which substantially increased the range, reduced weight, and boosted 0-60 performance. [...] Tesla then licensed AC Propulsion's EV Power System design and Reductive Charging patent which covers integration of the charging electronics with the inverter, thus reducing mass, complexity, and cost. However, Tesla was dissatisfied with how the motor and transmission worked in the chassis. Tesla then designed and built its own power electronics, motor, and other drivetrain components that incorporated this licensed technology from AC Propulsion. Given the extensive redevelopment of the vehicle, Tesla Motors no longer licenses any proprietary technology from AC Propulsion. The Roadster's powertrain is unique.|$|E
