5|$|Harbaugh made {{headlines}} {{prior to the}} season by claiming 2007 would be Carroll's <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> USC before departing to the NFL, drawing a terse rebuke from Carroll; Harbaugh later called the 2007Trojans {{one of the best}} teams in history at the Pac-10 Media Day, reiterating the position in the week before their game. However, there were no hard feelings between the coaches. The two kept in cordial phone contact and Carroll made light of Harbaugh's comments several times during the season.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 2012, Henry {{returned}} to Red Bulls {{to prepare for}} the 2012 season. His base salary of $5million ($5.6million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in the MLS—surpassing David Beckham, who had taken a salary cut for his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> the Los Angeles Galaxy. In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75million setting him behind Robbie Keane's $4million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35million compared to Keane's $4.33million.|$|E

5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her from city to city when the show toured.|$|E

25|$|In his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> the Pacers, Thomas {{guided the}} Pacers to a 48–34 {{record in the}} regular season and coached the Eastern Conference team at the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. As the third seed, the Pacers were {{eliminated}} {{in the first round of}} the playoffs by the sixth-seeded Boston Celtics. With blossoming talents such as Jermaine O'Neal, Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley, along with the veteran leadership of Reggie Miller, the perception existed that the Pacers' unfulfilled potential stemmed from Thomas' inexperience as a coach. In the offseason, Larry Bird returned to the Pacers as President of Basketball Operations, and his first act was to replace Thomas with Rick Carlisle.|$|E

Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region and its overall score was {{significantly lower than the}} regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba’s {{economic freedom}} remained stagnant {{near the bottom of the}} “repressed” category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.|$|E

25|$|Another {{championship}} game appearance and {{loss to the}} Lions followed in 1953, when Gibron was again named to the Pro Bowl and was selected to one sportswriter's first-team All-Pro list. The Browns came back in 1954 and 1955 to win championships against the Lions and Rams. Gibron {{was named to the}} Pro Bowl both of those years and was a first-team All-Pro in 1955. Gibron played part of the 1956 season for the Browns, but he suffered a leg injury and was cut in November to make room on the roster for rookie Don Goss. The Philadelphia Eagles signed him two weeks later to replace Norm Willey, who was out with a broken leg. The Eagles finished with losing records in both 1956 and 1957, Gibron's <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> the team.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the {{increasing}} engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres {{and the number of}} cylinders from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both rev and air-intake limiters to avoid the costs of re-engineering their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but early in the season it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>with</b> the V10 engines.|$|E
25|$|While Cochrane {{was honored}} in 2000, the {{ceremony}} honoring Cochrane and Kell {{did not include}} the retirement of Cochrane's number 3; the number 3 has not been retired for Dick McAuliffe or Alan Trammell either, although number 3 has only been issued three times since Trammell retired as a player after the 1996 season: to Trammell himself when he managed the Tigers from 2003 to 2005, Gary Sheffield (after Trammell approved of it from 2007 until he was released prior to the 2009 seasons). Sheffield had previously worn the numbers 1, 5, 10, and 11. Presently the number is being worn by Ian Kinsler, who was acquired after the 2013 season in a trade with the Texas Rangers for Prince Fielder. Similarly, the number 1 was last worn by Lou Whitaker in 1995, the year Whitaker retired as a player. It was not reissued again until 2013, when mid-season acquisition José Iglesias requested it. The number 47, last worn by Jack Morris, has also not been retired, but has not been issued since 1990, Morris' <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> the Tigers.|$|E
