50|$|The basic aim of {{steering}} is {{to ensure}} that the wheels are pointing in the desired directions. This is typically achieved by a series of <b>linkages,</b> <b>rods,</b> pivots and gears. One of the fundamental concepts is that of caster angle - each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel; this makes the steering tend to be self-centering towards the direction of travel.|$|R
50|$|Shifting {{to a full}} {{weekend of}} events, a Tour d’Elegance, similar to the Pebble Beach Tour d'Elegance and the Road Tour {{organized}} at the Amelia Island Concours was added in 2013. The inaugural event sold out in record time and featured 80 vehicles, including a 1908 Stanley Model K from the Owls Head Transportation Museum, although a broken <b>linkage</b> <b>rod</b> ended the tour early for the caretakers.|$|R
30|$|Since the dual-horsehead {{pumping units}} {{were used in}} 1996, its {{application}} results indicated that its energy-saving rate was about 20 – 30 % (Wang 2006; Chi et al. 2011). The dual-horsehead pump units were reformed with a flexibility reconfiguration, based on the conventional beam pumping units. Its back arm of walking beam was connected a horsehead having a variable radius of curvature. The walking beam connected the <b>linkage</b> <b>rod</b> with flexible drive rope. This variable length four-bar linkage could decrease the torque factor that could decrease the polished torque and avoided the negative torque, and the motor efficiency would be improved (Liu and Feng 2014).|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} actions used in pipe organs are tracker action, using {{mechanical}} <b>linkage</b> of <b>rods</b> and levers, and tubular-pneumatic action which utilizes a change of pressure within lead tubing which connects {{the key to the}} valve pneumatic.|$|R
50|$|Musgrave's {{solution}} was more complex: using two cylinders, additional connecting <b>rod</b> <b>linkages,</b> and geometry {{to avoid the}} problem.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically the 340 carried forward {{some of its}} predecessor’s {{advanced}} features. The four-speed {{gear box}} of the 326 reappeared in the 340: however, the cable linkage, which in use had proven damage prone, was replaced with a more robust <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|Steering was {{effected}} by a Burman worm and nut type steering gear, a four <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> system and two relay levers. [...] Despite {{all of the}} linkages involved, in practice the system was reasonably precise, and a CA actually handled better than the early Ford Transit thanks to the independent front suspension.|$|R
5000|$|... re-orienting the {{traverse}} gear box and handwheel shaft linkages {{so as to}} mount the traverse handwheel {{on the left side}} of the gun next to the sight. As the new transverse <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> went through a gap in the recoil cradle's elevation arc, the maximum elevation angle was limited to 18 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|The side-valve six-cylinder 1,988 cc engine {{delivered}} a maximum output of [...] at 3,400 rpm, which {{translated into a}} top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph). Power was transmitted via a three-speed manual transmission to the rear wheels, which were fixed to a rigid axle suspended from semi-elliptic leaf springs. The braking applied to all four wheels, mechanically controlled using <b>rod</b> <b>linkages.</b>|$|R
25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical <b>linkage</b> of <b>rods</b> and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an electrical cable and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in front of the stage, low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|R
2500|$|The third {{requirement}} {{is for a}} linkage between the [...] "machines" [...] (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early gears used an intricate and inherently fragile bell crank and push <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds {{than it had been}} designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection.|$|R
50|$|Clutch and gearbox {{were little}} changed, but {{the return of}} a floor mounted gear lever {{positioned}} between the front seats and connected to the gearbox with a <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> system was welcomed by the motoring press. The absence of synchromesh on the bottom forward speed nevertheless offered a reminder that under the surface this was becoming a somewhat aging design. Between the gearbox and the differential, the propeller shaft had now been separated into two parts with three couplings.|$|R

50|$|Upon Kurzenberger’s {{retirement}} in 1983 at age 65, he started {{work on his}} replica. Like Langhurst, Kurzenberger purchased a junked PT-19 fuselage, mainly to use its fixed landing gear but also to salvage any useable 4130 Chromalloy tubing and re-use the control <b>linkages</b> and <b>rod</b> ends which had stainless steel needle bearings and would give the replica Stuka’s flight controls a smoother feel. Kurzenberger also acquired a Lycoming GO-435 C model aero engine through a publication called Trade-A-Plane. It came complete with a three-blade constant speed propeller. Kurzenberger simplified some of the forms on his Stuka, especially around {{the nose of the}} plane, so it did not adhere as faithfully as Langhurst’s to the original Ju-87 dive-bomber’s lines. He also chose to omit the swastika emblems on the tail. In overall appearance, however, there was no mistaking what historical plane it represented.|$|R
5000|$|The side-valve six-cylinder 2,581 cc engine {{delivered}} a maximum output of [...] at 3,400 rpm which {{translated into a}} top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph). Power was transmitted to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission, the fourth speed being effectively an overdrive ratio of 1 : 0.76 while the more conventional “top” 1 : 1 ratio was achieved by selecting third gear. The wheels were fixed to a rigid axle suspended from semi-elliptic leaf springs. The braking applied to all four wheels, mechanically controlled using <b>rod</b> <b>linkages.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{carburetor}} basically {{consists of}} an open pipe through which the air passes into the inlet manifold of the engine. The pipe {{is in the form}} of a Venturi: it narrows in section and then widens again, causing the airflow to increase in speed in the narrowest part. Below the Venturi is a butterfly valve called the throttle valve — a rotating disc that can be turned end-on to the airflow, so as to hardly restrict the flow at all, or can be rotated so that it (almost) completely blocks the flow of air. This valve controls the flow of air through the carburetor throat and thus the quantity of air/fuel mixture the system will deliver, thereby regulating engine power and speed. The throttle is connected, usually through a cable or a mechanical <b>linkage</b> of <b>rods</b> and joints or rarely by pneumatic link, to the accelerator pedal on a car, a throttle level in an aircraft or the equivalent control on other vehicles or equipment.|$|R
40|$|Nine class A salt-dependent rod mutants were mapped on the Bacillus subtilis genome by PBS 1 -mediated transduction. They are {{distributed}} into two small <b>linkage</b> groups designated <b>rod</b> B and rod C; mutations in rod B are over 80 % cotransducible with pheA and different mutations in rod C are 12 to 21 % cotransducible with hisA. It is established that neither rod B nor rod C is linked by transformation {{to the other}} identified rod mutations present in 168 -ts- 200 B and 8332 glu−. It is hypothesized that salt-dependent mutations are due to enzyme alterations which are corrected by high salt concentrations...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 the Apache {{received}} a minor facelift, introducing proper CV joints, round Smiths gauges and a <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> for the gear shift. Originally, the ADO16 used rubber drive joints, a strip speedometer, and a remote extension gear lever. Also in 1973, the sporty TC model {{was added to}} the lineup. Power was up to [...] at 5,800 rpm, compared to [...] at 5,250 rpm for the 'cooking' versions. The TC also received Rostyle rims, vinyl roof, a rev counter, and a sporty steering wheel. All versions of the Apache and Victoria used the 1,275 cc version of BMC's venerable A-series four-cylinder, with a variety of outputs.|$|R
5000|$|Underneath the Maxi's {{practical}} and spacious bodyshell lay an all-new {{front wheel drive}} chassis, which was interlinked with an innovative five-speed manual transmission. The latter suffered from notorious problems with its control linkage, especially in early models which had a cable-operated linkage prone to cable stretch and other problems. These were noted by autotesters such as Vicar in Today's Driver (1969), who wrote: [...] "This is probably a good idea that just needs {{a little bit of}} working on." [...] The later <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> was less problematic. All models were prone to problems brought on by the [...] "cogs in the sump" [...] layout, whereby the gearbox and engine shared a common oil supply. The clutch oil seal was also prone to leakage.|$|R
5000|$|Eveslogite synonym is IMA2001-023 and its axial ratios are; a:b:c =0.5641:1:1.7768. Among {{its special}} {{characteristics}} {{is that its}} estimated radioactivity is barely detectable. The radioactivity test in regard to Eveslogite can be measured using GRapi=172.67 (Gamma Ray American Petroleum Institute Units). According to the research carried out by Krivovichev et al., the chemical composition of Eveslogite was determined through a wavelength-dispersion spectrometry, which encompasses the Cameca MS-46 microbe electron that was operating at 20kV. This strategy was adopted because of the traditional test of bond lengths and the bond-valence analysis, resulting in errors and therefore could not result in reliable information. Through {{the use of the}} wavelength dispersion spectrometry approach, other special feature of the Eveslogite were that, the rods {{in the structure of the}} Eveslogite are separated by walls that appears to be parallel and acts as the main <b>linkage</b> of the <b>rods</b> to the 3-dimensional structure of this mineral. This is a special feature to this mineral since other minerals that fall into this Astrophyllite group do not possess these walls in between their rods structure.|$|R
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical <b>rod</b> <b>linkage.</b> This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "steam dummy" [...] {{locomotive}} {{filled up}} with water at Glasgow Junction before it made the 9 mi journey pulling the coach up the Chester Escarpment, gaining 200 ft in elevation about every mile. The two component train on the spur went {{through a series of}} hills and valleys. It would wind its way over a trestle at Doyle Valley and eventually come to Mammoth Cave hotel and estate. The train carried at least a three-man crew that consisted of a train engineer to run the locomotive, a boiler man to stoke the engine, and a conductor to tend to the passengers. Many times there were up to seven employees to operate the railroad train. On rare occasions the train pulled additional cars besides the passenger coach. Most famous of the steam engine locomotives was number 4, which was called Hercules.The reason the small steam Baldwin locomotive was called a [...] "dummy" [...] was because it was boxed up to look like a passenger street car. The idea was to prevent the horses from being spooked when it came close to them. Most times horses are very sensitive to mechanical machines and loud noises. Its condensing engines operated without the noise of escaping steam. It covered the mechanics of the <b>rods,</b> <b>linkage,</b> pipes, bolts, rivets, and most of the moving parts.|$|R
5000|$|The Shelby Charger is a {{modified}} 1980s Dodge Charger. Carroll Shelby tuned the Dodge Omni-based Charger for Dodge from 1983 to 1987, with the resulting car sold as the Dodge Shelby Charger. When the Charger was discontinued, Shelby bought the last 1,000 and replaced the fuel intake and {{engine management system}} with the same high-performance one used in the 1986 Shelby GLHS. It has a blow-through long runner two-piece intake, modified turbocharger (reclocked with a different compressor cover), and is intercooled. This engine was rated at [...] and 175 ftlbf Nm of torque from 2400 rpm to 4800 rpm. This {{is similar to the}} Turbo II inline-four engine used in various Chrysler vehicles, but the Turbo II uses a forged crank, as opposed to a cast one, and a stronger Getrag A555 five-speed manual transmission is used in place of the A525. The GLHS still came equipped with the <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> a525 transmission, however. Shelby also changed the struts and shocks with Koni adjustable units, wheels from his own wheel company (Centurion 2s), and high performance Goodyear Eagle GT tires. His modifications prompted the federal government to declare the car a Shelby model. A Dodge badge appears nowhere on the car, unlike its five-door L-body sibling, the GLH Omni, which does have the Dodge nameplate. Shelby Chargers were built at Chrysler's Belvidere, Illinois, assembly plant, with the GLHS models in 1987 being built at the Whittier, California, plant of Carroll Shelby.|$|R
