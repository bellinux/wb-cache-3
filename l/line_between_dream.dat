5000|$|Throughout {{the novel}} Raoule {{demonstrates}} {{a willingness to}} always push things further and further in pursuit of an ideal experience that she realizes is impossible. In the end, she turns to illusion and artifice and the force of her own will, because natural reality is not compliant. [...] In this, she is joined by others in the Decadent Movement. In his Against Nature, Joris-Karl Huysmans suggested both that human creations are more beautiful than natural ones, and also the <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> reality and natural reality is simply waiting an act of human will. [...] Later, the Czech decdant Arthur Breisky would assert the priority of a beautiful illusion over reality. [...] That is {{the context in which}} Rachilde's Raoule completes her transformation of Jacques by supplanting him with something of her own making, based on him, but improved through her creativity.|$|E
40|$|The {{first time}} I {{came in contact}} with the works of Edgar Allan Poe must have been around 10 years ago through an audio-book at the library. I {{borrowed}} the book because of the terrifying picture of “The Black Cat” on the cover just to find that the stories on the tapes were far more terrifying than that picture. Since then I’ve read several lousy horror books and seen many awful horror movies. Usually, they just leave me asking myself why I make these lamentable decisions, and what it is that I am trying to obtain. I’ve started to realise that it’s probably the feeling of hearing those ghastly grim and ancient Poe stories for the first time that’s been my motive. In this essay I’m going to focus on the themes of madness and murder in Edgar Allan Poe’s work as these themes are present in many of his most powerful tales. It’s also a very significant part of his works as these are the stories that earned him his famously bad reputation. It can be argued that Poe himself purposely assisted in giving himself this reputation with the belief that it could make more people interested in his works and so increase the sales of his books. Even if this could have been the case, it’s hard to neglect that in Poe’s case it’s particularly easy to find a good number of parallels between the author and the art, and these parallels seem most obvious in his horror stories. The first chapter of this essay is therefore a short biography of Edgar Allan Poe’s life. In the second chapter I’m going to discuss the role of the dead girl that appears in several of Poe’s horror stories. In the third chapter I’m going to look at Poe’s murder stories and examine the impulses that lead to these hideous acts and in the fourth chapter I’m going to discuss Poe’s interest in blurring the <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> and reality in his works.

50|$|The serial was an {{adaptation}} of Catherine Storr's novel Marianne Dreams, and deals with a young girl, Marianne, whose drawings become the basis for dreams, and how the dividing <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>dreams</b> and reality blurs. The novel was later adapted into a 1988 film, Paperhouse.|$|R
5000|$|The Governor of Nanke [...] {{referred}} as [...] "The Governor of the Southern Tributary State” {{is a work}} that was regarded by the Chinese literary critic, Lu Xun, as a superior dream tale to [...] "The World Inside a Pillow". The story was written in a similar time frame (also during the Tang Dynasty) and follows a similar story method in which the mortal falls asleep and the <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> and reality are blurred.|$|R
50|$|Believers (Biriibaazu) is a Japanese seinen manga by Naoki Yamamoto and is {{his first}} weekly serial manga created entirely {{without the help of}} any assistants. Believers was first {{serialized}} in Weekly Big Comic Spirits between May and November 1999 and is published in two tankōbon by Shogakukan. The plot to Believers revolves around themes of sexual desire and the <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>dreams</b> and reality. While Believers contains many scenes of graphic sexuality, the sex and nudity is used intellectually and not merely as fan service.|$|R

Rei learns that her photography assistant, Miku Hinasaki, is also under the same curse. The <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> and reality blur when ghosts began appearing in Rei's house, and the bruise on her body {{continues to}} expand and form a snake-and-holly tattoo similar to the tattooed ghost who touched her.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} at the Venice Film Festival, Alper defines his style as “paranoia and dream versus reality.” Boyd van Hoeij in the Hollywood Reporter mirrors the director’s cinematic signature, writing “Some of these might be subjective point-of-view shots, or dreams, nightmares or hallucinations…since the film’s real world isn’t as clearly defined, with Istanbul really seeming {{to be in the}} grip of increasing chaos and paranoia…” Besides blurring the <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> and reality, Alper plays with color and texture, creating a sense of psychic claustrophobia, made all the more tangible by the sound work of conceptual Turkish musician Cevdet Erek.|$|R
2500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, the <b>line</b> <b>between</b> <b>dreams</b> {{and reality}} may be blurred {{even more in}} the service of the story. Dreams may be psychically invaded or manipulated (Dreamscape, 1984; the Nightmare on Elm Street films, 1984–2010; Inception, 2010) or even come literally true (as in The Lathe of Heaven, 1971). In Ursula K. Le Guin's book, The Lathe of Heaven (1971), the protagonist finds that his [...] "effective" [...] dreams can retroactively change reality. Peter Weir's 1977 Australian film The Last Wave makes a simple and straightforward postulate about the premonitory nature of dreams (from one of his Aboriginal characters) that [...] "...dreams are the shadow of something real". In Kyell Gold's novel Green Fairy from the Dangerous Spirits series, the protagonist, Sol, experiences the memories of a dancer who died 100 years before through Absinthe induced dreams and after each dream something from it materializes into his reality. Such stories play to audiences' experiences with their own dreams, which feel as real to them.|$|R

The hotel itself could be taken as a metaphor not only for the myth-making of Southern California, but for the myth-making that is the American Dream, because it is a fine <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the American <b>Dream,</b> and the American nightmare.|$|R
50|$|Supernatural {{and fantasy}} {{continued}} to be themes in slasher movies. The Slayer surely influenced Wes Craven's film by finding a woman dreaming of a boogeyman as her friends disappear, blurring the <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> the <b>dream</b> world and reality. Demons appeared in The Incubus, based on Ray Russell's novel about an evil creature raping and murdering women in a small town, while supernatural themes were also {{the driving force behind}} Blood Song and Don't Go To Sleep. The haunted house opus Superstition takes a formula established by The Amityville Horror (1979) and adds a body-count with gory deaths. The Halloween franchise had also ventured into the supernatural with the release of Halloween III: Season of the Witch, a stark departure from the stalk-and-slash plots of the first two films.|$|R
500|$|Asturias blurs the {{separation}} <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> and reality throughout , {{making it one}} of the novel's most prominent themes. Latin American writer and critic Ariel Dorfman notes that the mixing of dream and reality is partly a result of Asturias's frequent use of figurative language. This stylistic choice is reflected in the content of the story itself, which suggests that an important effect of dictatorial power is the blurring of dreams and reality. Dorfman also notes that the President is sustained by fear, which further blurs the distinction <b>between</b> reality and <b>dream.</b> This fear grants him the voluntary or involuntary support of others, enabling the President to exercise his mandates. Dorfman asserts that the President's use of fear elevates his mandates to legends. These legends are then able to [...] "impose itself upon reality because men live it fully in a way to make sense of their humanity". One example of this theme, elucidated by Eckart, is a series of scenes leading to the arrest of the lawyer Carvajal. When the President decides to blame Carvajal for the murder of Colonel Sonriente, it is clear that Carvajal is confounded by the charges. Moreover, despite being a lawyer, Carvajal is unable to defend himself during the sham trial with [...] "the members of the tribunal so drunk that they cannot hear him". As Eckart asserts, [...] "to be captured and tortured without ever knowing why is another horrible feature of a dictatorship. For the victim, reality unexpectedly becomes unreality, no longer comprehensible by a logical mind." [...] Therefore, the use of fear by a dictatorship blurs the <b>line</b> <b>between</b> reality and <b>dream</b> for the people being ruled.|$|R

In {{an article for}} Frame Publishers' online {{magazine}} frameweb.com, Carmel McNamara said these images: [...] "straddle a <b>line</b> <b>between</b> comforting and spooky". She frequently features the signature characters {{of a young boy}} and girl. In 2012, Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art held a solo exhibition of her work and noted that these stylised figures: [...] "seem to have been lifted from the pages of a mid-twentieth century children’s book and have traded the protective home of childhood nostalgia for a slightly more adventurous and unsettling world, somewhere <b>between</b> <b>dream</b> and reality".|$|R
