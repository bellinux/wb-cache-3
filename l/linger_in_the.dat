25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and {{may not even be}} noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, {{it is not unusual for}} a dust trail to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E

25|$|Concerns about The Barrier's {{instability}} due to volcanic, tectonic {{or heavy}} rainfall activity prompted {{the provincial government}} to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1980. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish rivers would be considerable, including major damage {{to the town of}} Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island. The landslide area {{is referred to as the}} Barrier Civil Defence Zone. Although landslides are unlikely to happen in the near future, warning signs are posted at the zone to make visitors aware of the potential danger and to minimize the chance of fatalities in the event of a slide. For safety reasons, BC Parks recommends visitors not to camp, stop or <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Barrier Civil Defence Zone.|$|E
25|$|Three {{recent studies}} by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic {{chemicals}} banned decades ago continue to <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs; dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE and dieldrin, and PBDEs. As {{a result of the}} study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen.

No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E
500|$|Chabon has {{provided}} several subtle hints throughout his work that the stories he tells {{take place in}} a shared fictional universe. One recurring character, who is mentioned in three of Chabon's books but never actually appears, is Eli Drinkwater, a fictional catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates who died abruptly after crashing his car on Mt. Nebo Road. The most detailed exposition of Drinkwater's life appears in Chabon's 1990 short story [...] "Smoke," [...] which is set at Drinkwater's funeral, and refers to him as [...] "a scholarly catcher, a redoubtable batsman, and a kind, affectionate person." [...] Drinkwater was again referred to (though not by name) in Chabon's 1995 novel Wonder Boys, in which narrator Grady Tripp explains that his sportswriter friend Happy Blackmore was hired [...] "to ghost the autobiography of a catcher, a rising star who played for Pittsburgh and hit the sort of home runs that <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> memory for years." ...|$|E

A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth." [...] The hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal. That area was developed by building atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, with buildings like the Waldorf Astoria utilizing [...] "air rights" [...] to the space above the tracks.

[...] Richard Roeper placed the film at number five on his list of [...] "40 movies that <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back chambers of my memory vault like a plate of cheese left behind a radiator in a fleabag hotel." [...] In 2001 the film received the [...] "Worst Picture" [...] award from the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association. James Franklin of McClatchy-Tribune News Service put the film as the worst of his [...] "summer blockbuster bombs" [...] list, giving it a rating of four stars for [...] "traumatic" [...] on his scale of how the films [...] "generate a perverse sense of nostalgia."

[...] Anderson cited Carey's performance as [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as [...] "disarming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closets of some impoverished inner-city lives." [...] Gleiberman described the film as being a movie [...] "that makes you think, 'There {{but for the grace}} of God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul" [...] and {{felt that the}} [...] "final scene of revelation" [...] between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers [...] "tearful, shaken, [...] dazed with pity and terror." [...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E

500|$|On 16 February the {{regiment}} started their move towards Bethlehem, arriving there the next day. Two {{days later the}} brigade started over the hills towards the River Jordan, marching overnight. The tracks forced them into single file, but by daylight they were at El Muntar. From there the terrain dropped [...] to the Jordan Valley. As soon as the brigade's vanguard appeared they were engaged by the Turkish defences. It was not until 07:00 that {{the regiment}} came into the open to assist the attack. The regiment was sent against a Turkish strong point at Hill 288, the 8th and 10th Squadrons leading with the 1st in reserve. The 10th Squadron had problems continuing their attack so the 1st was sent forward by a different route, and by noon the Turkish defenders were withdrawing to Nebi Musa. Here, using their artillery and machine-guns, the Turks held up the regiment's advance along a narrow defile until nightfall. The next morning the 10th Squadron were sent forward again, but the Turks had withdrawn during the night. At 05:30 on 21 February the regiment formed the brigade's vanguard as it started out again, reaching the Jordan Valley at 09:00. The regiment pushed ahead towards Jericho, leaving the 8th Squadron behind to repair the road they were using. Jericho was occupied by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, so the regiment deployed along the River Jordan, from the Dead Sea to a pontoon bridge at Ghoraniyeh, which was still held by the Turks. The next day was spent patrolling {{the vicinity of the}} river, and at 15:00 on 22 February the western side was declared clear of all Turkish forces. The brigade did not <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley, and at 18:00 the same day they started back to Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Lorna Bradbury of The Daily Telegraph {{called the}} novel [...] "a psychologically convincing {{picture of a}} man who, even in his many flirtatious moments, is teetering on the edge, and a {{brilliant}} account of the poet’s nervous breakdown." [...] Similarly, Joanna Briscoe of The Guardian said, [...] "by the final quarter, Dawson knows {{what she is doing}} with a tricky subject, and the novel comes into its own with explosive force. It is a daring experiment, and one whose mood, setting and eccentricities <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind." [...] Helen Dunmore of The Times called the narrative of the novel [...] "strong, satisfying and memorable". The Daily Mail called the novel [...] "an exceptional book even from the prize-winning Dawson; clever, moving, sexy and with a mesmerising feel for that magical, optimistic, but doomed time just before the Great War." [...] Vanessa Curtis of The Scotsman admired the novel for its much more satisfying portrayal of Brooke than his biographies and called it [...] "a seductive book, evocative and well paced, the tale split between Brooke and Nell, the two narrative voices strong, distinctive and consistent." [...] Alice Ryan called the novel [...] "a gripping and beautifully written book which deals not only with the history of Brooke and his alleged love child, but also with the wider history of the Fens, its places, people and traditions". The Oxford Times critic Phillipa Logan too gave praise to the novel, saying that Dawson [...] "exploits [...] ambiguities [...] to the full, creating a compelling, thoroughly plausible narrative that explores Brooke’s time as a student in Cambridge." [...] Simon Akam of The New Statesman liked the novel, noting that [...] "in her novel Dawson has [...] pulled off the risky gamble of reimagining history." [...] The New Zealand Listener said, [...] "The Great Lover is proof that its author is one of the finest practitioners of the literary historical novel and that this is her best novel yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that <b>linger</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it {{has the kind of}} warmth people are always saying they can hear on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized in the future as the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest pop, a reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E
