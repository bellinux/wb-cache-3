The time spent reconfiguring the structure <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is time lost in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> consumer goods. Those who plan capital investment must anticipate future trends in consumer demand if they are to avoid investing too much in some <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and too little in other <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|R

Marginal utility theory predicts that a {{relatively}} high rate of profit attracts further investment, but each additional unit <b>of</b> <b>production</b> will generally tend to be of less utility (and therefore less value) to the market, causing the overall rate of profit to fall absent any technological innovation increasing productivity. The commodity in question will lose its appeal to investors, who will then invest in other, newer <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> offering higher returns.|$|R

50|$|According to Kirzner (1973) and Lavoie (1985) {{entrepreneurs}} reap {{profits by}} supplying unfulfilled needs in all markets. Entrepreneurship therefore brings prices closer to marginal costs.

The activities of entrepreneurs make prices more accurate {{in terms of how}} they represent the marginal utility of consumers. Prices act as guides to the planning <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Those who plan production use prices to decide which <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> should be expanded or curtailed.|$|R
