5000|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in defining transformative <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it bleeds into the boundaries of concepts such as [...] "meaning making" [...] or [...] "critical thinking".|$|R
50|$|Experiential {{business}} <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> {{the process}} of learning and developing business skills through the medium of shared experience.

500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{day while}} Kate {{is in her}} office, she {{received}} a phone call from Professor Clarkville (another member of the English department). Clarkville explained to Kate that he has found Janet dead in the men's restroom. Immediately the question is [...] "Was Janet killed by a fellow professor"? Kate seemed skeptical of this idea because she knew that other than not being liked, no one had anything to gain from Janet's death. Kate decided that she is going to investigate this peculiar death. One of the first few pieces she <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Janet death was caused from cyanide and Janet's body was moved to the men's restroom after her death; but where and when she actually died is still a mystery to Kate and the police.|$|E

2500|$|Two extraterrestrials (played by Foley and McDonald) {{are on a}} {{spaceship}} orbiting the Earth. They have just abducted a redneck and {{are in the middle}} of inserting a probe into his anus. After a scream of pain from the victim, they erase his memory and send him back to Earth. They then proceed to have a coffee break, during which Foley's character begins pondering the point of what they do. [...] "We travel 250,000 light years across the universe, abduct humans, probe them anally, and release them." [...] McDonald's alien does not understand why the other is questioning the leadership of the [...] "Great Leader". Foley's alien goes on to say that in the 50 years they've been doing this, the only thing they've <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "one in 10 doesn't really seem to mind" [...] and that he suspects their [...] "Great Leader" [...] may be [...] "just some sort of twisted ass freak". Foley argues that they should at least probe political or religious leaders instead of [...] "any idiot in a pickup truck".|$|E

50|$|The {{weakness}} with rote <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it implies}} a passive reading or listening style.

30|$|Incremental {{learning}} [3] and ensemble <b>learning</b> [4] <b>are</b> {{two fundamental}} methods in learning from big stream data with concept drift. Incremental learning follows a machine learning paradigm where {{the learning process}} taking place whenever new examples emerge, and then adjusts to what has <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> from the new examples. While the ensemble learning employs multiple base learners and combines their predictions. The fundamental principle of dynamic ensemble <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> to dividing large data-stream into small data chunks and training classifiers on each data chunk independently. The most prominent difference of incremental learning from traditional machine <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> incremental <b>learning</b> does not assume {{the availability of a}} sufficient training set before the learning process, but the training example appears over time. Moreover, the biggest difference between incremental learning and ensemble <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ensemble <b>learning</b> may discard training data outdated but incremental learning may not.|$|R

50|$|These are beings {{far more}} {{powerful}} than gods (who are, {{from their point of}} view, only slightly more troublesome versions of human beings) who control the workings of the multiverse. There are eight of them, according to The Discworld Companion, and they are not worshipped on the Discworld, the general populace being unaware of their existence. They are only very ambiguously referred to in some of the Discworld religions and the most that Discworld scholars have <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> eight 'entities' exist.|$|E
50|$|Dialogic <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>learning</b> <b>that</b> {{takes place}} through dialogue.

50|$|The broader {{implications}} {{reached by}} Lave {{and others who}} specialize in situated <b>learning</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> beyond the argument <b>that</b> certain knowledge <b>is</b> necessary {{to be a member}} of society (a Durkheimian argument), knowledge learned in the context of a school is not reliably transferable to other contexts of practice.|$|R
30|$|Deep <b>learning</b> itself <b>is</b> {{a typical}} model of multi-granularity joint computation, {{and it could}} be {{expanded}} to a more general structure for multi-granularity joint computation (MGrJC). Major differences between MGrJC and deep <b>learning</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the input of deep <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> the finest-grained data when MGrJC takes an MGrR as its input, and a layer-wise learner of deep <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> usually a neural network when MGrJC intends to generalize it to any type of learning model.|$|R

Grunt work is what chiefs of staff do." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{excessively}} harsh {{treatment of}} Mr. Nosenko {{went beyond the}} bounds of propriety or good judgment. At my request, Mr. Hart has discussed this case with many senior officers to make certain that its history will not again be repeated. The other main lesson to be <b>learned</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> although counterintelligence analysis necessarily involves the making of hypotheses, we must at all times treat them as what they are, and not act on them until they have been objectively tested in an impartial manner.|$|E

30|$|Transfer learning: A major {{assumption}} in {{many traditional}} machine <b>learning</b> algorithms <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the training and}} test data are drawn from the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, with the data explosion from variety of sources, great heterogeneity of the collected data destroys the hypothesis. To tackle this issue, transfer <b>learning</b> has <b>been</b> proposed to allow the domains, tasks, and distributions to be different, which can extract knowledge from one or more source tasks and apply the knowledge to a target task [50, 51]. The advantage of transfer <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it can intelligently apply knowledge learned previously to solve new problems faster.|$|R
