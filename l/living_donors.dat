40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{clinical}} {{perspective on}} hepatic growth is limited. The {{goal of the}} present study was to compare hepatic hypertrophy and the kinetic growth rate(KGR) in patients after the ALPPS (Associating Liver Partition with Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy) procedure, portal vein embolization (PVE) and <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation. MethodsVolumetry and KGR of the future liver remnant (FLR) were compared from (15) patients undergoing ALPPS, (53) patients undergoing PVE, (90) recipients of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver grafts and (93) <b>donors</b> of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver grafts. ResultsThe degree of hypertrophy was significantly greater after ALPPS (84. 3 ± 7. 8 %) than after PVE (36. 0 ± 27. 2 %) (P < 0. 001). The KGR was also significantly greater for ALPPS [32. 7 ± 13. 6 cubic centimetres (cc) /day] (10. 8 ± 4. 5 %/day) compared with PVE (4. 4 ± 3. 2 cc/day) (0. 98 ± 0. 75 %/day) (P < 0. 001). The FLR of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors had the greatest degree of hypertrophy (107. 5 ± 39. 2 %) and was greater than after ALPPS (P = 0. 02), PVE (P < 0. 001) and in living donor‐recipient grafts (P < 0. 001). KGR (cc/day) was greater in FLR of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors compared with both ALPPS (P < 0. 001) and PVE (P < 0. 001). The KGR in patients undergoing ALPPS and <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation had a linear relationship with the size of FLR. ConclusionFLR hypertrophy and KGR were greater after ALPPS than PVE. However, the degree of hypertrophy after ALPPS is not unprecedented, as KGR in the FLR from <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors is equal to or greater than after ALPPS. The KGR of the FLR in patients after ALPPS and <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> donors correlates directly with the size of the FLR...|$|R

25|$|It is {{accepted}} that kidney transplantation {{is the preferred}} treatment for ADPKD patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Among American patients on the kidney transplant waiting list (as of December 2011), 7256 (8.4%) were listed due to cystic kidney disease and of the 16,055 renal transplants performed in 2011, 2057 (12.8%) were done for patients with cystic kidney disease, with 1,189 from deceased donors and 868 from <b>living</b> <b>donors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{and medical}} {{professionals}} {{have expressed concern}} about the implications of the short organ transplant wait times offered by Chinese hospitals. Specifically, they say these wait times are indicative of a pool of <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> whose organs can be removed on demand. This is because organs must be transplanted immediately after death, or must be taken from a living donor (kidneys must be transplanted within 24–48 hours; livers within 12 hours, and hearts within 8 hours).|$|E
25|$|In <b>living</b> <b>donors,</b> {{the donor}} remains alive and donates a {{renewable}} tissue, cell, or fluid (e.g., blood, skin), or donates an organ {{or part of}} an organ in which the remaining organ can regenerate or take on the workload {{of the rest of}} the organ (primarily single kidney donation, partial donation of liver, lung lobe, small bowel). Regenerative medicine may one day allow for laboratory-grown organs, using person's own cells via stem cells, or healthy cells extracted from the failing organs.|$|E
40|$|Renal {{transplantation}} {{is considered}} the gold standard therapy to treat patients with end-stage renal disease. Clinical studies showed better survival rates due to reducing comorbidities associated with dialysis treatment and {{a better quality of}} life in those patients compared to patients treated with lifelong dialysis. As a matter of fact there are too few organs available compared to patients in need of kidney transplantation. ABO incompatibility continues to pose significant barriers to further expansion of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation. Over the last two decades treatment modalities have improved to overcome these barriers and ABO-incompatible <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation has been performed. The introduction of new methods to overcome the ABO barrier including plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption demonstrates that the use of ABO incompatible organs should no longer be considered contraindications for renal transplantation. In the current review we summarize the development in ABO incompatible <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation utilizing innovative immunosuppressive protocols in combination with plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption. In summary, ABO incompatible <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation has become a clinically safe approach to treat chronic renal failure in experienced centres promising most of the advantages of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation...|$|R
40|$|ABO {{incompatible}} kidney transplantation (ABOi-KT) is {{an important}} approach for overcoming donor shortages. We evaluated the effect of ABOi-KT on <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> KT. Two nationwide transplantation databases were used. We evaluated the impact of ABOi-KT on overall <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> transplant activity and spousal donation as subgroup analysis. In addition, we compared the clinical outcome between ABOi-KT and ABO compatible KT (ABOc-KT) from spousal donor, and performed a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to define the risk factors affecting the allograft outcomes. The introduction of ABOi-KT increased overall <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> KT by 12. 2 % and its portion was increased from 0. 3 % to 21. 7 % during study period. The ABOi-KT in living unrelated KT was two times {{higher than that of}} <b>living</b> related <b>donor</b> KT (17. 8 vs. 9. 8 %). Spousal donor was a major portion of living unrelated KT (77. 6 %) and ABOi-KT increased spousal donation from 10 % to 31. 5 % in <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> KT. In addition, increasing rate ABOi-KT from spousal donor was 10 times higher than that of <b>living</b> related <b>donor.</b> The clinical outcome (incidence of acute rejection, allograft function, and allograft and patient survival rates) of ABOi-KT from spousal donor was comparable to that of ABOc-KT. Neither ABO incompatibility nor spousal donor was associated with acute rejection or allograft failure on multivariate analysis. ABOi-KT increased overall <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> KT, and ABOi-KT from spousal donor is rapidly increasing with favorable clinical outcomes...|$|R

25|$|As {{the rising}} {{success rate of}} transplants and modern {{immunosuppression}} make transplants more common, {{the need for more}} organs has become critical.

Additionally, there is substantive research into xenotransplantation, or transgenic organs; although these forms of transplant are not yet being used in humans, clinical trials involving the use of specific cell types have been conducted with promising results, such as using porcine islets of Langerhans to treat type1 diabetes. However, there are still many problems that would need to be solved before they would be feasible options in people requiring transplants.|$|E
25|$|Healthy {{humans have}} two kidneys, a {{redundancy}} that enables <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> (inter vivos) {{to give a}} kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among <b>living</b> <b>donors</b> postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure.

500|$|On 20 July 2006, Kilgour and Matas {{presented}} {{the findings of}} their two-month investigation as Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China. The report presented 33 strands of circumstantial evidence that Kilgour and Matas felt, {{in the absence of}} any disproof, cumulatively allowed the conclusion that [...] "the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centres and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. Their vital organs, including kidneys, livers, corneas and hearts, were seized involuntarily for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries.”. [...] The report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. Kilgour and Matas also presented material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from <b>living</b> <b>donors,</b> and transcripts of telephone interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs. The authors qualified their findings by noting the difficulties in verifying the alleged crimes, such as: [...] independent bodies were not allowed to investigate conditions in China, eyewitness evidence was difficult to obtain, official information about organ transplantation was often withheld, and Kilgour and Matas themselves were denied visas to go to China to investigate.|$|E

Since the first successful <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation, this surgical innovation has been well established in children and has significantly relieved the crisis of donor organ shortage for children. However, the extension of <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation to adult recipients is limited by the graft volume.

To develop novel effective treatments attenuating small-for-size liver graft injury during <b>living</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation, it is important to explore the precise mechanism of acute phase small-for-size graft damage. Recently, a number of clinical studies and animal experiments have been conducted to investigate the possible key issues on acute phase small-for-size liver graft injury, such as mechanical injury from shear stress, subsequent inflammatory responses, and imbalance of vasoregulatory factors.

[...] It is also the only country where organ trade is legal. The way their system works is, if a patient {{does not have a}} living relative or who are not assigned an organ from a deceased donor, apply to the nonprofit Dialysis and Transplant Patients Association (Datpa). The association establishes potential donors, those donors are assessed by transplant doctors who are not affiliated with the Datpa association. The government gives a compensation of $1,200 to the donors and aid them a year of limited health-insurance. Additionally, working through Datpa, kidney recipients pay donors between $2,300 and $4,500. Importantly, it is illegal for the medical and surgical teams involved or any ‘middleman’ to receive payment. Charity donations are made to those donors whose recipients are unable to pay.
