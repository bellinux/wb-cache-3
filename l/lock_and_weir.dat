5|$|Kelston <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir.</b> The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir,</b> Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated {{large parts of the}} town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir,</b> was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E

50|$|The <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs,</b> in effect, {{break the}} river up into 44 lakes or lock reaches. Each lock {{controls}} the reach above it and thus identifies it. Each reach {{has its own}} character and points of interest.|$|R
50|$|Otto Wagner was tasked by the Kommission für Verkehrsanlagen (Commission for Transport Facilities) in December 1896 {{with the}} design of the quays. In line with his plans, the 15-metre wide quays were built with sites for a fish market, a berth for {{passenger}} ships and loading bays for freight. Wager also designed the Nußdorf <b>and</b> Kaiserbadwehr <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> <b>and</b> the attached houses.|$|R

25|$|Boulter's Lock – <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> on the Thames River in England. A canoe/kayak flume is {{installed}} annually on the weir {{during the summer}} and there is a permanent fixed ramp in front of the third of the weir's six gates.|$|E
25|$|Downstream of Nottingham {{it passes}} Radcliffe on Trent, Stoke Bardolph and Burton Joyce before {{reaching}} Gunthorpe with its bridge, <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir.</b> The river now flows north-east below the Toot and Trent Hills before reaching Hazelford Ferry, Fiskerton and Farndon. To {{the north of}} Farndon, beside the Staythorpe Power Station the river splits, with one arm passing Averham and Kelham, and the other arm, which is navigable, being joined by the Devon before passing through the market town of Newark-on-Trent and beneath the town's castle walls. The two arms recombine at Crankley Point beyond the town, where the river turns due north to pass North Muskham and Holme to reach Cromwell Weir, below which the Trent becomes tidal.|$|E
50|$|Each of the Environment Agency's <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> is {{manned by}} a lock keeper, who {{normally}} {{lives in a}} house adjacent to the lock. The lock keeper's duties involve both operating the <b>lock,</b> <b>and</b> managing the river levels above the lock by adjusting the weir openings.|$|R
2500|$|Improvements to aid {{navigation}} {{began in}} 1635, {{and a series}} of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> made it possible to reach Stratford, and to within [...] of Warwick. The Upper Avon was tortuous and prone to flooding, and was abandoned as a means of navigation in 1877. The Lower Avon struggled on, and never really closed, although it was only navigable below Pershore by 1945. Restoration of the lower river as a navigable waterway began in 1950, and was completed in 1962. The upper river was a more daunting task, as most of the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> were no longer extant. Work began in 1965 on the construction of nine new <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> [...] of river, using mainly volunteer labour, and was completed in 1974 when it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.|$|R
25|$|Penton Hook Island is a mainly wooded former peninsular created into {{a series}} of three weir-divided islands in the River Thames in England in river {{modifications}} since 1815. It has the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> that are the divide between the Laleham Reach, above Chertsey <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Staines Reach, above Penton Hook Lock.|$|R
500|$|The {{navigation}} was {{not initially}} profitable, {{and the amount}} of money owing to the undertakers gradually rose to a peak of £19,659 by 1740. Toll receipts improved, and by 1757, the debts had been reduced to £9,809. In September 1757, merchants from Liverpool complained about the run-down state of the navigation to Liverpool Corporation, who offered to pay for a survey. The merchants then offered to take over the navigation, but the commissioners wanted to keep control of it, and paid £17,000 to the undertakers, which repaid the outstanding debt and bought the navigation rights. The deal was completed on 11 October 1758. The commissioners largely ignored the survey which had been carried out by Henry Berry, and decided to enlarge the locks to [...] wide. Work began on a new cut, <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> at Pickerings, but in 1759, the navigation was cut in half by the collapse of a salt pit at Northwich. The commissioners discovered that they could not sue for damages, as the provisions of the 1721 Act no longer covered {{the way in which they}} were operating, and so a second Act of Parliament was obtained on 22 May 1760. This changed the way in which the debts were managed, and gave the commissioners powers to sue and to appoint a management committee. It also stipulated that all locks should be [...] with a draught of , but the actual depth exceeded [...]|$|E
500|$|The route {{continues}} through a wooded valley, past {{the site of}} the Sprotborough Flash Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with the towpath forming part of the Trans Pennine Trail. Sprotborough <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are situated just before Sprotborough. Just below the lock on the north bank [...] are the remains of an engine house, built in the 1690s for Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough Hall. A water wheel pumped river water some [...] upwards to supply a fountain in the grounds of the hall, a swimming pool, and also provided a water supply for the village. The pump was powered by a water wheel which was removed in the 1970s. Soon the edge of Doncaster is reached, where amongst the railway marshalling yards, the River Don leaves the navigation for the final time, as does the towpath. The two weir streams flow either side of Doncaster prison, effectively forming an island on which the building sits. Doncaster Town Lock is situated close to Doncaster railway station, and between here and Long Sandall Lock, some of the changes which have occurred over the years can be visualised, with the river on the left and ox-bow lakes on the right, severed by the course of the Wheatley Cut. The final section to Bramwith is usually called the River Dun Navigation. At Bramwith, the waterway splits, with the New Junction Canal heading north-east for the Aire and Calder Navigation and Goole, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal heading east to the River Trent at Keadby. The River Don heads northwards too, turning to the east where the Dutch River starts at Newbridge. The original course to the River Aire can be traced across the fields, now little more than a drainage ditch crossed by an oversized Grade II listed bridge on the A1041 at East Cowick, and Vermuyden's embankments are closely followed by the A614 road after it has crossed the M18 motorway.|$|E
2500|$|The Richmond <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> complex {{was built}} between 1891 and 1894 by the Thames Conservancy to {{maintain}} a navigable depth of water upstream of Richmond. This then ensures that there is always at least a 1.72m depth {{of water in the}} River between Richmond and Teddington. In 1908 an Act transferred responsibility for the Thames from a point [...] below Teddington Lock to the Port of London Authority, and this included Richmond Lock.|$|E
50|$|After {{significant}} {{drought and}} low water flows in the Murray River around 2009-2010, the flood plains were under significant stress {{due to lack}} of water. As a response to this, additional regulators were installed to enable artificial floods across parts of the wetland to ensure the health of the trees by simulating the natural floods that would have occurred before the river was regulated by the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> <b>and</b> upstream dams.|$|R
500|$|Progress was slow, as only Richard Vernon of the {{original}} three undertakers was actively engaged on the project, {{and he could not}} reach agreement with the Commissioners. The stalemate was broken when Vernon died in 1726, and new undertakers were appointed. The work on the Weaver was completed by 1732, at a cost of £15,885. Eleven timber <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> had been constructed, but no work had been carried out on the Witton Brook. The river had been improved by dredging and the construction of a series of cuts, with <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> to manage the drop of around [...] over the [...] between Winsford and the River Mersey. Barges of up to 40 tons could reach Winsford, and boats called Weaver flats were the predominant vessels. These either sailed up the river, or were bow-hauled by teams of men.|$|R
25|$|The {{owners of}} land {{near to the}} river complained in 1722 that the new <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> caused them to lose income because their meadows were more often flooded. In 1793 thirty five vessels were trading from Malton, {{carrying}} corn downstream to the West Riding towns and returning upstream with coal. Virtually every village and hamlet near the tidal river had its own landing place.|$|R
2500|$|Some recent {{development}} has been very controversial for this and other reasons, including a long-running planning row lasting many years over the empty [...] "Jolly Boatman" [...] site opposite Hampton Court Palace which then began {{to be used by}} fly-tippers. The row over this site has been running since the 1990s when plans to redevelop East Molesey railway station and the adjacent site were first mooted. At various times national heritage organisations, historians of national significance, MPs and local residents and businesses have become involved resulting in extensive national press coverage. In 2006 a developer lodged formal plans with Elmbridge Council and a formal opposition group, Hampton Court Rescue Campaign was formed. The numerous twists and turns in a highly contentious battle have been extensively documented and included an appeal against Elmbridge Council by a developer in 2013 which resulted in costs being awarded against EBC. Total costs to the council were some £78,000. The site changed hands in 2015. A further large-scale riverside planning row has been running over the development of the so-called Walton Sports Hub which is sited on a former waste tip adjacent to the Thames. Elmbridge originally gave planning permission without requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment despite concerns of local residents and businesses on a range of issues including fears of toxins entering the Thames, only to be immediately overruled by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles. Objectors then mounted a legal challenge to the original application and a High Court Judge quashed the original planning application in January 2017 following a legal challenge. The following day the council passed a second planning application and this has been in consultation during 2017. The [...] "Surrey Advertiser" [...] called the project history [...] "marred in controversy" [...] in September 2017. Molesey Lock is the second <b>lock</b> (<b>and</b> <b>weir)</b> on the River Thames, and marks the furthest point upstream that the influence of the tides on the Thames (regulated by the Thames Barrier at Woolwich) may be registered. The lock is located within 100 metres of Hampton Court Bridge, designed by Edwardian Arts and Crafts architect Edwin Lutyens, styles reflected by contemporary properties in the town. [...] Other styles which are prevalent are 1960s red-brick semi-detached homes and Art Deco/Bauhaus.|$|E

5000|$|A second {{strengthened}} Act of Parliament in 1623 {{allowed for}} the appointment of eight commissioners of sewers. This was {{also known as the}} Oxford-Burcot Commission. It had the power to tax Oxford city and the University, to clean the river <b>and</b> to install <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs.</b> Iffley <b>Lock,</b> Sandford <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> a <b>lock</b> on the Swift Ditch near the present Abingdon Lock were built in 1631. However, its work was slow and costly and the first barge did not reach Oxford until 1635.|$|R
50|$|The Mayenne was navigable in {{its natural}} state up to Château-Gontier. Works were {{undertaken}} in the 16th century to make the river navigable upstream from here to Laval; royal decrees by François I in 1536 and 1537 authorised the necessary works, including flash locks. Economic expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries justified engineering with <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> not only to Laval but also upstream to Mayenne. This extension, with 20 <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs,</b> was built {{at the same time}} as about 40 flash locks were replaced by 25 <b>weirs</b> <b>and</b> <b>locks,</b> some in short lock-cuts, between 1853 et 1878. The river was used by barges carrying up to 130 tonnes, and the principal traffics were construction materials (wood and stone), coal from the mines of L'Huisserie, grain, fruit and vegetables. At this time it was planned to build a watershed canal north from Mayenne to the tidal river Orne at Caen, but the project was abandoned as railways became the preferred carrier of freight. The navigation was abandoned after World War II, but restored from the 1970s as a cruising waterway. The upstream section was completed in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Banrock Station is {{a largely}} viticultural {{property}} owned by, and producing wine for, Accolade Wines, the former Hardy Wine Company. The wetlands {{on the property}} had been permanently flooded since the early 20th century. In 1992 a program began to restore the natural hydrological regime of alternate wetting and drying cycles that the wetlands had before <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> were installed on the Murray, with the first major drying out taking place in 2007.|$|R

50|$|Marlow Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames {{in the town of}} Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England. The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773.|$|E
50|$|The Thames {{is highly}} tidal {{at this point}} and the {{intertidal}} range within the dock is substantial, with a rise and fall of four metres since the construction of a system of winter flow-regulating <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> on the River Thames culminating in Teddington <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> of the Thames Barrier. During tidal surges the water level has risen just above pavement level of adjacent buildings on Shad Thames and Mill Street. The rectangular inlet opens to the river 420 metres east of Tower Bridge.|$|R
5|$|A {{public house}} has been built on the island between Keynsham <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> the <b>weir.</b> The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|R
50|$|From {{the head}} of {{navigation}} at Cricklade {{to the start of}} the tidal section at Teddington Lock, the river is managed by the Environment Agency, which has the twin responsibilities of managing the flow of water to control flooding and provide navigable water depths and also regulating and promoting navigation on the river. As a result, all the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> on the river, except the semi-tidal Richmond <b>Lock,</b> are owned <b>and</b> operated by the Environment Agency. Richmond Lock is managed by the Port of London Authority.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are {{overlooked}} by {{the remains of}} the Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is the Jolly Sailor pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir.</b> The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 (probably by rival coal dealers) to stop the use of the river for transportation. The pub was built in 1726 for the bargees, when the navigation opened. The wooden fireplace has holes made by hot pokers which newly promoted captains of the barges.|$|E
50|$|Mapledurham Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames in England. The lock was first built in 1777 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners and the present lock dates from 1908.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{are easily}} reached {{by a short}} {{footpath}} from the free car park, {{which is at the}} end of Hurley High Street in the village of Hurley on the south bank of the river.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the river}} is already {{controlled}} by a system of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs,</b> including the Goolwa Barrages near the Murray Mouth, <b>and</b> <b>Lock</b> 1 at Blanchetown, 274 km from the Murray Mouth. The lowering of water levels in the lake system would severely impact on all who rely on the lakes and river for their livelihood. This would include irrigators, {{such as those in}} the Langhorne Creek wine region, farmers on the Narrung Peninsula and Point Sturt, and fisherpeople at Meningie and Clayton.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, {{the three}} Murray states - New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia - signed the River Murray Agreement which {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} storage reservoirs in the river's headwaters {{as well as at}} Lake Victoria near the South Australian border. Along the intervening stretch of the river a series of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> were built. These were originally proposed to support navigation even in times of low water, but riverborne transport was already declining due to improved highway and railway systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{stretch of}} river between the town of Staines, just {{to the west of}} London, and Yantlet Creek had been claimed by the City of London since 1197 under a charter of Richard the Lionheart. In 1771 the Thames Navigation Commission was {{established}} from a body created twenty years earlier to handle navigation on the river. Although the Commissioners were active in establishing <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> above Staines, they did not interfere with the jurisdiction of the City of London.|$|R
