50|$|The thyroid {{cartilage}} is {{the largest}} of the nine cartilages that make up the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton,</b> the cartilage structure in and around the trachea that contains the larynx. It does not completely encircle the larynx; only the cricoid cartilage does.|$|E
50|$|In adult humans, {{the larynx}} {{is found in}} the {{anterior}} neck {{at the level of the}} C3-C6 vertebrae. It connects the inferior part of the pharynx (hypopharynx) with the trachea. The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> consists of six cartilages: three single (epiglottic, thyroid and cricoid) and three paired (arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform). The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid. The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. Its interior can be divided in supraglottis, glottis and subglottis.|$|E
50|$|Most {{tetrapod}} species {{possess a}} larynx, but its structure is typically simpler than {{that found in}} mammals. The cartilages surrounding the larynx are apparently a remnant of the original gill arches in fish, and are a common feature, but not all are always present. For example, the thyroid cartilage is found only in mammals. Similarly, only mammals possess a true epiglottis, although a flap of non-cartilagenous mucosa is found in a similar position in many other groups. In modern amphibians, the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> is considerably reduced; frogs have only the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, while salamanders possess only the arytenoids.|$|E
40|$|Laryngeal cartilages {{were studied}} in 40 {{dissection}} room specimens of adult age groups ranging from 17 to 50 years {{in both the}} sexes. Various dimensions of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> were measured and statistical {{analysis of the data}} for male and female were evaluated separately. Conspicuous and highly significant differences of the dimensions between male and female laryngeal cartilages were observed. The incidence of the cuneiform cartilage and cartilago triticea was greater in the female than in the male...|$|E
40|$|The vocal ligaments insert at the {{anterior}} and posterior commissures of the larynx. These structures fulfil biomechanical functions, balancing the different elastic moduli of tendon, cartilage or bone and undergo age-related changes {{that may be}} responsible for voice changes with increasing age. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the insertion structures of the vocal ligaments by means of macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic methods and to draw conclusions from age-related structural changes on a functional basis. Investigations were carried out on the larynges of 22 males and 15 females (aged 1 – 95 y). In adolescence, the insertion zone of the vocal ligament tendon, a dense network of connective tissue rich in sulphated glycosaminoglycans at the thyroid cartilage, is characterised by a layer between tendon and cartilage comparable to fibrocartilage. The insertion zone lacks a perichondrium. Collagen fibrils of the vocal ligament tendon penetrate directly into the thyroid cartilage. In the insertion area, the chondrocytes are surrounded by collagen fibrils, which show positive reactivity to antibodies against type I and type III collagen. Sulphated glycosaminoglycans are integrated between the collagen fibrils. In the area of the posterior glottis, elastic cartilage rests like a cap on the hyaline base of the arytenoid cartilage. There is no distinctive border between the structures. With increasing age, ossification of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> occurs, involving hyaline cartilage at the posterior glottis and hyaline and fibrocartilage at {{the anterior}} commissure. At the same time, a loss of sulphated glycosaminoglycans is observed inside the vocal ligament tendon. Advanced ossification of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton,</b> particularly in the area of the commissures, an increasing loss of glycosaminoglycans in the vocal ligament tendon and changes in the elastic tissue reduce the elastic modulus between tendon, cartilage and bone, thus ‘stiffening’ the insertion zones, which could be one factor among others favouring voice changes with advancing age...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} soft tissue image quality of a mobile cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanner with an integrated flat-panel detector. STUDY DESIGN: Eight fresh human cadavers were used in this study. For evaluation of soft tissue visualization, CBCT data sets and corresponding computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets were acquired. Evaluation was performed with the help of 10 defined cervical anatomical structures. RESULTS: The statistical analysis of the scoring results of 3 examiners revealed the CBCT images to be of inferior quality regarding the visualization of most of the predefined structures. Visualization without a significant difference was found regarding the demarcation of the vertebral bodies and the pyramidal cartilages, the arteriosclerosis of the carotids (compared with CT), and the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> (compared with MRI). Regarding arteriosclerosis of the carotids compared with MRI, CBCT proved to be superior. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of a flat-panel detector improves soft tissue visualization using a mobile CBCT scanner...|$|E
40|$|The human larynx descends during infancy and {{the early}} {{juvenile}} periods, and this greatly contributes to the morphological foundations of speech development. This developmental phenomenon {{is believed to be}} unique to humans. This concept has formed a basis for paleoanthropological studies on the origin and evolution of human speech. We used magnetic resonance imaging to study the development of three living chimpanzees and found that their larynges also descend during infancy, as in human infants. This descent was completed primarily through the rapid descent of the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> relative to the hyoid, but it was not accompanied by the descent of the hyoid itself. The descent is possibly associated with developmental changes of the swallowing mechanism. Moreover, it contributes physically to an increased independence between the processes of phonation and articulation for vocalization. Thus, the descent of the larynx and the morphological foundations for speech production must have evolved in part during hominoid evolution, and not in a single shift during hominid evolution...|$|E
40|$|The ostrich hyobranchial {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} the centrally positioned paraglossalia and basiurohyale and paired caudo-lateral elements (horns), each consisting of the ceratobranchiale and epibranchiale. The paraglossalia lie within the tongue parenchyma and consist of paired, flat, caudo-laterally directed cartilages joined rostrally. The basiurohyale forms a single dorso-ventrally flattened unit composed of an octagonal-shaped body from which extend rostral (the rostral process) and caudal (the urohyale) projections. The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton</b> consists of cricoid, procricoid and paired arytenoid cartilages. The large ring-shaped cricoid cartilage displays a body and paired wings which articulate {{with each other and}} with the procricoid. The blunt, ossified, rostral projection of the cricoid and the scalloped nature of the arytenoid cartilages are unique to the ostrich. The procricoid is a single structure which links the paired arytenoids and wings of the cricoid. The hyobranchial apparatus is firmly attached to the tongue parenchyma and to the larynx and proximal trachea. In contrast to previous reports in this species, the horns of the hyobranchial apparatus are not related to the skull. Ossification of the body of the basihyale, the ceratobranchials and the rostral process and body of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx lends stability to these structures. University of Pretoria.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{evidence}} based guideline aims {{to facilitate}} proper management {{and to prevent}} diverging views concerning diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of carcinoma of the larynx between the major referral centers for head and neck cancer in The Netherlands. METHOD: A multidisciplinary committee was formed representing all medical and paramedical disciplines involved {{in the management of}} laryngeal cancer and all head and neck oncology centers in The Netherlands. This committee reviewed the literature and formulated statements and recommendations based on the level of evidence and consistency of the literature data. Where reliable literature data were not available, recommendations were based on expert opinion. RESULTS: Strict criteria have been proposed for the radiological diagnostic procedures {{as well as for the}} pathology report. For carcinoma in situ and severe dysplasia, microsurgery, preferably by laser, is proposed. For all other stages of invasive carcinoma, a full course of radiotherapy as a voice conserving therapy is the treatment of choice. Only in cases with massive tumor volumes with invasion through the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>skeleton,</b> primary surgery is inevitable. For rehabilitation and supportive care, minimal criteria are described. Due to the complexity of therapy and relative rarity of larynx carcinoma, all patients should be seen at least once in a dedicated head and neck clinic. CONCLUSION: This guideline for the management of larynx carcinoma was produced by a multidisciplinary national committee and based on scientific evidence wherever possible. This procedure of guideline development has created the optimal conditions for nationwide acceptance and implementation of the guideline...|$|E
