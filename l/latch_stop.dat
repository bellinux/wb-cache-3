50|$|As {{the card}} was being read and {{positioned}} for printing, a ‘mechanical bail’ driven by large steel cams would raise 60 geared ‘lifter bars’ which engaged 60 ‘racks’ which engaged 60 ‘intermediate gears’, which drove 60 ‘print wheels’. (You {{can see the}} maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The lifter bars were then lowered under spring tension by the ‘mechanical bail’ {{in time with the}} reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‘contact roll’ / ‘card brush’ / ‘wire contact relay’ circuitry, a ‘push rod’ would <b>latch</b> (<b>stop)</b> the individual ‘lifter bar’ on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the print wheel and facing 1 of 60 ‘print hammers’. An ‘alignment bail’ would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‘print wheels’ to perform vertical alignment.|$|E
40|$|Built-in safety {{mechanism}} for tractor-trailer "fifth-wheel" coupling keeps rig together in case kingpin failure. Modified coupling utilizes all standard components, such as two wear plates, kingpin, and kingpin latch. It is modified by adding semicircular lip to top wear plate, matching semicircular slot to bottom wear plate, and two <b>latching</b> <b>stop</b> mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|An {{elevator}} has brakes {{that are}} held off brake pads by {{the tension of}} the elevator cable. If the cable breaks, tension is lost and the brakes <b>latch</b> on, <b>stopping</b> the elevator from falling.|$|R
50|$|The STANAG {{magazine}} {{concept is}} only an interface, dimensional, and control (magazine <b>latch,</b> bolt <b>stop,</b> etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines {{to be made in}} various configurations and capacities. STANAG magazines come in 20, 30, and 40 round box magazines, as well as 60 and 100 round casket magazines, 90 round snail-drum magazines, and 100 round saddle-drum magazines.|$|R
5000|$|The STANAG {{magazine}} {{concept is}} only an interface, dimensional and controls (magazine <b>latch,</b> bolt <b>stop,</b> etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines {{to be made in}} various configurations and capacities. The standard capacities of STANAG-compatible magazines are 20 or 30 rounds of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. There are also 5-, 10-, 40- and 50-round box magazines, as well as 60- and 100-round casket magazines, 90-round snail-drum magazines, and 100-round drum magazines. [...] There has also been a 150-round drum magazine produced.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 30 carbineor cavalry rifle (...) is a {{modified}} version made 300 mm (11.8 in) shorter than the infantry model (the carbine's barrel measures 480 mm (18.9 in) against 790 mm (31.1 in) for the standard infantry issue). Intended to equip cavalry troops with a modern carbine. Differences other than the shorter barrel and stock from the standard infantry rifle is that it lacked a handguard over the barrel, rear sight ladder only went up to 1,500 meters (compared to the rifles 2,000 meters), front sight had protection guards on each side, slight changes to the bolt <b>stop</b> <b>latch</b> and the sling swivels were moved {{to the left side}} of the gun to prevent the bolt from digging into the cavalry trooper's back. The pre-production version lacked a bayonet.|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) cell {{converts}} sunrays into electrical energy, {{which has}} non-linear I-V characteristics. For extracting maximum power from photovoltaic (PV) array for varying environmental conditions, {{it is necessary}} to use MPPT tracker. The MPPT consists of DC-DC converter and MPPT algorithm, DC-DC converter is inserted between solar panel and load or battery. The task of MPPT tracker is to match input impedance of the converter and it is equals to the equivalent output impedance of the solar panel to achieve unique point (MPP) where maximum power extracted. The used TL 598 based DC-DC converter operates with defined MPPT algorithm. The DC-DC converter output power is controlled by varying its duty cycle to operating at knee voltage level. The novel algorithm is used for efficiently extracts the maximum output power from PV panel with the use of direct control method. The sensing of input voltage and current parameters, which are processed based on P&O algorithm. After finding of MPP, it <b>latched</b> and <b>stops</b> searching and only continuously monitors source voltage. When any change in environmental conditions, the MPPT algorithm again starts searching MPP unique point which is totally based on source voltage information. This approach gets a stable output power at MPP. The algorithm has developed for direct control of duty cycle for DC-DC converter based on TL 598. This is simple structure; obtain higher efficiency and reliability as compared to standard methods. The MPPT has capability to propose the technique which has been verified experimentally with a 75 -W solar panel for different insolation (incident solar radiation) level and under large signal insolation of level changes...|$|R
