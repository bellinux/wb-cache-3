5|$|Community Trolls, who {{may have}} at times {{included}} additional band members, performed in public at <b>least</b> <b>twice.</b> By sometime in 1984, however, Sweet began distancing himself from the Athens music scene, and in 1985 he got a record deal and moved to New York. While some people accused him of using his Athens music connections to get ahead and then desert the scene, R.E.M. did not hold any hard feelings towards him.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{subsequently}} formed Army of the Potomac {{had high}} morale and was extremely {{proud of their}} general, some even referring to McClellan as the saviour of Washington.

It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions.

They show, among other things, that if the frequency locations are unknown, then {{it is necessary to}} sample at <b>least</b> at <b>twice</b> the Nyquist criteria; in other words, you must pay at least a factor of 2 for not knowing the location of the spectrum. Note that minimum sampling requirements do not necessarily guarantee stability.|$|R
5|$|Through {{most of the}} Archean Eon, the Earth had a heat {{production}} at <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> that of the present, which caused tectonic processes to be more active. As a result, plates and continents were smaller. No broad blocks as old as 3Ga are found in Precambrian shields. Toward {{the end of the}} Archean, however, some of these blocks or terranes came together to form larger blocks welded together by greenstone belts.|$|E

There was a requirement that the buildings have sufficient windows and openings for ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Excavations {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{had begun}} by August1926, when several scenes were {{shot in a}} cave that had been {{excavated}} for the production on Karang Hill. Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen to stage directions. Afterwards they began rehearsing each scene at <b>least</b> <b>twice,</b> with Kartabrata standing behind the cameraman and giving directions.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} ten years of the society's existence, the {{organization}} grew in membership and held meetings at <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> a month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled {{beyond the confines of}} the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.|$|E

In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported. The organization has developed the Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001, which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.|$|R
5|$|The drama program {{stresses}} {{technique and}} performance; students must perform in public at <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> a year. There are three major dramatic productions each season, {{and high school}} students are required to compete in the English Speaking Union Shakespeare Contest. Advanced students audition for the Acting Ensemble Company, which provides a full season of performances in venues outside the school. The creative writing program focuses on writing as an art in journalism, script writing, poetry, and creative non-fiction. Students participate in writing competitions, internships, and develop portfolios to showcase their work.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval European clockmakers were Christian monks. Medieval {{religious institutions}} required clocks because they regulated daily prayer- and work-schedules strictly, using {{various types of}} time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination. When mechanical clocks came into use, they were often wound at <b>least</b> <b>twice</b> a day to ensure accuracy. Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device, such as by a falling weight or by rotating beater.|$|E

Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E
