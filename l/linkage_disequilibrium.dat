5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> overall.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
25|$|Population {{substructure}} {{also can}} be used to advantage in genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of geographically separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations. Genetic studies can use this admixture <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> to search for disease alleles with fewer markers than would be needed otherwise. Association studies also {{can take advantage of the}} contrasting experiences of racial or ethnic groups, including migrant groups, to search for interactions between particular alleles and environmental factors that might influence health.|$|E
25|$|Tay–Sachs {{disease was}} one of the first genetic {{disorders}} for which epidemiology was studied using molecular data.

25|$|If the {{population}} is panmixic, then Geospiza conirostris exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent sympatric speciation. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species' niche by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified {{in the absence of}} a detailed breeding program, but two loci with <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> is a possibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{testing of}} full mtDNA {{sequences}} is still somewhat controversial {{as it may}} reveal medical information. The field of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database Mitomap. The National Human Genome Research Institute operates the Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test.|$|E
25|$|No {{agreement}} using modern DNA: In 2016, a whole-genome {{study of}} wolves and dogs concluded that admixture had confounded {{the ability to}} make inferences about the place of dog domestication. Past studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that the analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.|$|E
25|$|Population genetic {{substructure}} {{also can}} aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers {{than is the}} case for other populations.

25|$|Exploring {{the immune}} system's HLA alleles, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that HLA-B*73 introgressed from Denisovans into modern humans in western Asia due to the distribution pattern and divergence of HLA-B*73 from other HLA alleles. In modern humans, HLA-B*73 is concentrated in western Asia, but it is rare or absent elsewhere. Even though HLA-B*73 is not present in the sequenced Denisovan genome, the study noted that it was associated to the Denisovan-derived HLA-C*15:05 from the <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> consistent with the estimated 98% of those modern humans who carried B*73 also carried C*15:05.|$|E
25|$|Although less parsimonious than recent gene flow, the {{observation}} {{may have been}} due to ancient population sub-structure in Africa, causing incomplete genetic homogenization within modern humans when Neanderthals diverged while early ancestors of Eurasians were still more closely related to Neanderthals than those of Africans to Neanderthals. On the basis of allele frequency spectrum, it was shown that the recent admixture model had the best fit to the results while the ancient population sub-structure model had no fit–demonstrating that the best model was a recent admixture event that was preceded by a bottleneck event among modern humans—thus confirming recent admixture as the most parsimonious and plausible explanation for the observed excess of genetic similarities between modern non-African humans and Neanderthals. On the basis of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> patterns, a recent admixture event is likewise confirmed by the data. From the extent of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> it was estimated that the last Neanderthal gene flow into early ancestors of Europeans occurred 47,000–65,000 years BP. In conjunction with archaeological and fossil evidence, the gene flow is thought likely to have occurred somewhere in Western Eurasia, possibly the Middle East. Through another approach—using one genome each of a Neanderthal, Eurasian, African, and chimpanzee (outgroup), and dividing it into non-recombining short sequence blocks—to estimate genome-wide maximum-likelihood under different models, an ancient population sub-structure in Africa was ruled out and a Neanderthal admixture event was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the above}} discussion, {{it has been}} assumed that the {{genotype}} probabilities at each locus are calculated independently; that is, the entire genotype is partitioned into independent genotypes at each locus, whose probabilities are calculated independently. However, due to <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> the genotypes of nearby loci are in general not independent. As a result, partitioning the overall genotype instead into a sequence of overlapping haplotypes allows these correlations to be modelled, resulting in more precise probability estimates through the incorporation of population-wide haplotype frequencies in the prior. The use of haplotypes to improve variant detection accuracy has been applied successfully, for instance in the 1000 Genomes Project.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s and {{the first}} several years of this millenium, {{microsatellites}} were the workhorse genetic markers for genome-wide scans to locate any gene responsible for a given phenotype or disease, using segregation observations across generations of a sampled pedigree. Although the rise of higher throughput and cost-effective single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platforms led to {{the era of the}} SNP for genome scans, microsatellites remain highly informative measures of genomic variation for linkage and association studies. Their continued advantage lies in their greater allelic diversity than biallelic SNPs, thus microsatellites can differentiate alleles within a SNP-defined <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> block of interest. Thus, microsatellites have successfully led to discoveries of type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2) and prostate cancer genes (the 8q21 region).|$|E
25|$|From three {{candidate}} {{regions with}} introgression found by searching for unusual patterns of variations (showing deep haplotype divergence, unusual patterns of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> and small basal clade size) in 61 non-coding regions from two hunter-gatherer groups (Biaka Pygmies and San who are significant for admixture) and one West African agricultural group (Mandinka {{who are not}} significant for admixture), it is concluded that roughly 2% of the genetic material found in these Sub-Saharan African populations was inserted into the human genome approximately 35,000 years ago from archaic hominins that {{broke away from the}} modern human lineage around 700,000 years ago. A survey for the introgressive haplotypes across many Sub-Saharan populations suggest that this admixture event happened with archaic hominins who once inhabited Central Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} of the core conserved region of the haplotype Cw5-B18 indicates that it likely originated in Africa. The DR3-DQ2 component is found at high frequencies in the Irish, but in strong <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> in the AH8.1 haplotype. Recent studies indicate that DR3-DQ2 in two branches of AH8.1 have a common origin in Africa at about 75,000 years ago; the frequency maximum of the haplotype is in the Côte d'Ivoire region and northwest portion of Central Africa. Taken together, A30-Cw5-B18-DR3-DQ2's origin among peoples with deep Eurasian ancestry is highly unlikely, and indicates that this haplotypes abundance in Sardinia is a likely consequence of a founder effect or positive selection and other genetic factors. There is a claimed shared ancestry between Sardinians and the Basque, however Sardinia is proximal to North Africa, and does not bear the Cw variant found in the Basque or Morocco, whereas the Basque most likely can attribute their variant A30::DQ2 to gene flow from northwest Morocco.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of genome wide {{association}} (GWA) and fine-resolution association mapping is {{a powerful}} method for establishing the inheritance of resistance to infections and other diseases. Two independent preliminary analyses of GWA association with severe falciparum malaria in Africans have been carried out, one by the Malariagen Consortium in a Gambian population and the other by Rolf Horstmann (Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg) and his colleagues on a Ghanaian population. In both cases the only signal of association reaching genome-wide significance was with the HBB locus encoding the β-chain of hemoglobin, which is abnormal in HbS. This {{does not imply that}} HbS is the only gene conferring innate resistance to falciparum malaria; there could be many such genes exerting more modest effects that are challenging to detect by GWA because of the low levels of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> in African populations. However the same GWA association in two populations is powerful evidence that the single gene conferring strongest innate resistance to falciparum malaria is that encoding HbS.|$|E
500|$|Genetic linkage {{occurs when}} the loci of two alleles are in close {{proximity}} on a chromosome. During the formation of gametes, recombination reshuffles the alleles. The chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles is inversely related to the distance between them. Selective sweeps occur when an allele becomes more common in a population {{as a result of}} positive selection. As the prevalence of one allele increases, closely linked alleles can also become more common by [...] "genetic hitchhiking", whether they are neutral or even slightly deleterious. A strong selective sweep results in a region of the genome where the positively selected haplotype (the allele and its neighbours) are in essence the only ones that exist in the population. Selective sweeps can be detected by measuring <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium,</b> or whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population. Since a selective sweep also results in selection of neighbouring alleles, the presence of a block of strong <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> might indicate a 'recent' selective sweep near the centre of the block.|$|E
2500|$|A30::DQ2 {{is unique}} in Europe for several reasons. The 1992 study found 6 haplotypes with very high <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> values for the Sardinian {{population}} with A30::DQ2 being the highest frequency of these 6 haplotypes. Moreover, A30-cw5-B18 has the highest maximum frequency for any haplotype in any people in Europe, at 15 percent, it exceeds the AH8.1 haplotype in Ireland by 4 percent. (However, class II typing in Western Ireland indicated AH8.1 might {{go as high as}} 15%).

2500|$|A. thaliana is a {{predominantly}} self-pollinating plant with an outcrossing rate estimated {{at less than}} 0.3%. [...] An analysis of the genome-wide pattern of <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> suggested that self-pollination evolved roughly a million years ago or more. [...] Meioses that lead to self-pollination are unlikely to produce significant beneficial genetic variability. [...] However, these meioses can provide the adaptive benefit of recombinational repair of DNA damages during formation of germ cells at each generation. [...] Such a benefit may have been sufficient to allow the long-term persistence of meioses even when followed by self-fertilization. A physical mechanism for self-pollination in A. thaliana is through pre-anthesis autogamy, such that fertilisation takes place largely before flower opening.|$|E

2500|$|Though the {{evolution}} of exaggerated male traits {{as a result of}} female mate choice was at one point controversial, the Diopsidae are now regarded as a classic example of animals that exhibit sexually selected traits. [...] One view maintains that male ornaments co-evolve with female preferences. [...] The selection of an ornamented mate causes genes that influence expression of the selected male trait and genes coding for female preference for this trait to be passed on to offspring [...] This process creates <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> between selected alleles, with the magnitude of resulting genetic correlations influencing evolutionary outcomes. [...] If the genetic correlation is high relative to the heritability of the male ornament, then a runaway process can occur leading to extreme sexually selected traits, such as the incredible eye spans observed in male stalk-eyed flies.

2500|$|His ever-expanding {{interests}} led {{him into}} plant population genetics, a field that he essentially founded. [...] His particular interest was in the population genetics of Inbreeding species, and included wild plants such as Collinsia, Avena barbata and Avena fatua. [...] His interest in inbreeding species probably stemmed from his interactions with Ledyard Stebbins, who was also at U.C. Davis, and had predicted that wild inbreeding plant populations should be devoid of genetic variation. As a plant breeder who had done selection on inbreeding species in cultivated plants, Allard {{knew that there was}} ample genetic variation within [...] "pure lines." [...] It is easy to see how he would have become intriqued with inbreeding wild species. And indeed starting in the early 1960s he worked with experimental populations of wheat, barley, and lima beans as well as the wild plants Collinsia, Avena barbata, and Avena fatua investigating a wide variety of issues important to the population genetics of inbreeding species.

2500|$|Neoteny {{is seen in}} domesticated animals such as {{dogs and}} mice. This is because there are more {{resources}} available, less competition for those resources, and with the lowered competition the animals expend less energy obtaining those resources. This allows them to mature and reproduce more quickly than their wild counterparts. The environment that domesticated animals are raised in determines whether or not neoteny is present in those animals. Evolutionary neoteny can arise in a species when those conditions occur, and a species becomes sexually mature ahead of its [...] "normal development". Another explanation for the neoteny in domesticated animals can be the selection for certain behavioral characteristics. Behavior is linked to genetics which therefore means that when a behavioral trait is selected for, a physical trait may also be selected for due to mechanisms like <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium.</b> Often, juvenile behaviors are selected for in order to more easily domesticate a species; aggressiveness in certain species comes with adulthood {{when there is a}} need to compete for resources. If there is no need for competition, then there is no need for aggression. Selecting for juvenile behavioral characteristics can lead to neoteny in physical characteristics because, for example, with the reduced need for behaviors like aggression there is no need for developed traits that would help in that area. Traits that may become neotenized due to decreased aggression may be a shorter muzzle and smaller general size among the domesticated individuals. Some common neotenous physical traits in domesticated animals (mainly dogs, pigs, ferrets, cats, and even foxes) include: floppy ears, changes in reproductive cycle, curly tails, piebald coloration, fewer or shortened vertebra, large eyes, rounded forehead, large ears, and shortened muzzle.|$|E

With this reference point, the <b>linkage</b> <b>disequilibrium</b> in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as [...] "matches signs of interbreeding or 'admixture' between Middle Eastern and European populations". Also, in their press release, Bray stated: [...] "We were surprised to find evidence that Ashkenazi Jews have higher heterozygosity than Europeans, contradicting the widely-held presumption that they have been a largely isolated group". The authors said that their calculations might have [...] "overestimated the level of admixture" [...] in case that the true Jewish ancestors were genetically closer to Southern Europeans than to Druze and Palestinian Arabs.
