5|$|Rawlinson {{was living}} in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe and had been working as a clerk for two-and-a-half years when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 19July 1938. He {{underwent}} flying instruction as an air cadet at No.1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, and was granted a short-service commission as a pilot officer on probation from 22June 1939. On 7July he was posted to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, which operated Hawker Demon biplane fighters out of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He spent much of the remainder of the year learning instrument flying on the <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer,</b> and undertaking a parachute training course.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound technicians, <b>link</b> <b>trainer</b> operators, parachute riggers, and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio technicians, and motor vehicle drivers. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, the largest USCG training station for men.|$|E
5|$|Clyde Fenton, {{known for}} his {{exploits}} as a flying doctor in the Northern Territory before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942. King was posted to command No.5 EFTS at Narromine, New South Wales, in December 1940. By this time No.3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots in the eight flying training courses it had run since its formation. One of its graduates was Nicky Barr, who become a fighter ace in the North African Campaign with twelve victories to his credit. No.3 EFTS began operating a ground-based <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> on 17February 1941. The school started flying the recently introduced CAC Wackett Trainer in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying the training program. From September to November 1941, a detachment of personnel from No.11 EFTS also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at Benalla had been inundated by heavy rain. No.3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1May.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} two courses each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|When No.1 BFTS {{formed at}} Uranquinty on 1December 1951, it had 377 staff, 37 Tiger Moths and 37 Wirraways, and {{came under the}} control of Headquarters Southern Area (Training Command from 1October 1953). The first pilots' course {{commenced}} on 1April 1952, and graduated on 1August. The first course of graduates from No.1 IFTS transferred in the same month. As well as RAAF pilots, No.1 BFTS trained students from the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm. In February 1953, a prototype CAC Winjeel, designed and manufactured in Australia, arrived at the school to undergo trials. From January 1956 to February 1957, the Winjeel gradually replaced both the Tiger Moth and the Wirraway as No.1 BFTS's training aircraft. As well as these aircraft, <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> instrument flying simulators were employed at the school. By November 1954, following the end of the Korean War, the RAAF's need for further aircrew to fulfill its international obligations had eased and {{the decision was made to}} combine the syllabus of No.1 IFTS with No.1 BFTS starting in January 1955, after which No.1 IFTS was disbanded.|$|E

There is also a Pilot Training Display including a computer flight simulator and a Learning Zone for visits from local schools.|$|E
25|$|Within the Air Corps itself, {{instrument}} {{training was}} upgraded, radio communications were greatly improved into a nationwide system that included navigation aids, and budget appropriations were increased. The Air Corps acquired {{the first six}} <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> flight simulators of a fleet that would ultimately number more than 10,000. The operation also demonstrated the complete obsolescence of open-cockpit aircraft in military operations, leading to increased development of modern types {{in the second half}} of the decade, most of which served successfully in World War II.|$|E
500|$|As of 30June 1940, {{only one}} of the No.5 EFTS's four {{required}} hangars had been completed. Accommodation facilities were, according to the unit operations book, [...] "bleak and depressing" [...] and deficiencies in equipment were [...] "too numerous for itemising". The primitive conditions meant that personnel suffered adverse health effects from the cold in winter and hot, dusty conditions in the summer. Flying at Narromine was also hampered by bad weather, particularly heavy rain and wind. Accidents were frequent at all EFTSs, though fatalities were rare. An instructor and his passenger from No.5 EFTS were killed when a Tiger Moth crashed on 3August 1940, possibly caused by a stall while practising forced landings. By the end of August, the school was operating one of its two required <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> simulators.|$|E
25|$|In September 1935, Earhart and Mantz {{formally}} {{established a}} business partnership {{that they had}} been considering since late 1934 by creating the short-lived Earhart-Mantz Flying School, which Mantz controlled and operated through his aviation company, United Air Services. The company was located at the Burbank Airport, about five miles (8km) from Earhart's Toluca Lake home. Putnam handled publicity for the school that primarily taught instrument flying using <b>Link</b> <b>Trainers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{aviation}} flight schools {{showed little}} interest in the [...] "Link Trainer". Link also demonstrated his trainer to the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF), but with no result. However, the situation changed in 1934 when the Army Air Force was given a government contract to fly the postal mail. This included having to fly in bad weather as well as good, for which the USAAF had not previously carried out much training. During the first weeks of the mail service, nearly a dozen Army pilots were killed. The Army Air Force hierarchy remembered Ed <b>Link</b> and his <b>trainer.</b> <b>Link</b> flew in to meet them at Newark Field in New Jersey, and they were impressed by his ability to arrive on a day with poor visibility, due to practice on his training device. The result was that the USAAF purchased six <b>Link</b> <b>Trainers,</b> and this can be said to mark the start of the world flight simulation industry.|$|R
50|$|The 86th FBG was in{{activated}} at Waycross AAF and The 346th Army Air Force Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter), was activated on 1 May 1944. Pilots receiving training were normally {{organized into}} two classes, (an upper and a lower), of thirty pilots each. Synthetic training devices present included two <b>Link</b> <b>trainers,</b> two Gunairstructors, and one deflection gunnery trainer. The airfield ended its training mission and {{was assigned to}} Air Technical Service Command, becoming a sub-base of Statesboro AAF on 31 December 1944.|$|R
2500|$|This {{project was}} {{supported}} by the Heritage Lottery Fund [...] as well as local benefactors. It commenced in June 2010 and involved extending the Romney Building to create room for new facilities. These included a <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer,</b> computer flight simulator and a learning zone with audio and video resources. It was completed in October 2012.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Hamilton was an {{important}} West Coast air training facility. [...] Its mission was that of an initial training base for newly formed fighter groups. [...] The airfield was rapidly expanded to a wartime status, with construction of additional barracks, mess halls, administration buildings, warehouses, <b>Link</b> <b>trainer</b> buildings, schools, hospital and other structures.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer,</b> {{also known}} as the [...] "Blue box" [...] and [...] "Pilot Trainer" [...] is {{commonly}} used to refer to a series of flight simulators produced between the early 1930s and early 1950s by the Link Aviation Devices, Inc, founded and headed by Ed Link, based on technology he pioneered in 1929 at his family's business in Binghamton, New York. [...] During World War II, they were used as a key pilot training aid by almost every combatant nation.|$|E

50|$|The school's {{mission was}} to train cadets to fly {{twin-engine}} transports and bombers in a nine-week course. During training flight training was combined with ground school classes including radio navigation, aircraft and naval identification, armament, photo interpretation, weather forecasting and other courses. Several hours of instruction were taught in the ground-based <b>Link</b> <b>Trainers.</b> Pilot wings were awarded upon graduation and were sent on to group combat training by First, Second, Third or Fourth Air Force. Graduates were usually graded as Flight Officers (Warrant Officers); cadets who graduated {{at the top of}} their class were graded as Second Lieutenants.|$|R
50|$|Early, only broad course objectives, requirements, and {{directives}} {{were received}} from higher headquarters. As time went by, these directives became more specific. As a result, the flight training program at Coffeyville continually changed. Additionally, training was hindered {{by lack of}} equipment, facilities, and trained personnel. Instrument training provides {{a good example of}} the continual evolution of training at Coffeyville At first, all instructors gave their students the appropriate instrument training. Later, this phase of training was delegated to a few instructors who specialized in this phase of the cadets training. During the winter of 1943 and 1944, all instructors took additional training and became qualified to teach instrument flying. So, the centralized training for instruments was stopped. Many felt this was a positive move, because the student could stay with the same instructor throughout his training at Coffeyville Later as directives became more specific, some instructors would complain about the lack of flexibility. Students were now required to spend a specific amount of time on specified maneuvers. To help with instrument training fifteen <b>Link</b> <b>Trainers</b> were put into operation in mid-December 1942 with Class 43-C. The course of instruction was 15 hours. One problem with the Link instructors was, they were trained at twelve different fields and so taught the course twelve different ways. Additionally, supplies were hard to get, and the training buildings were not suited for the task. A new building was built specifically for Link Training. By March 1944, there were thirty-four <b>link</b> <b>trainers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The most {{prolific}} {{version of the}} <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> was the ANT-18 (Army Navy Trainer model 18), which was in its turn, a slightly enhanced version of Link's C3 model. [...] This model was also produced in Canada for both the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Air Force with a somewhat modified instrument panel, where its model designation was D2. It was used by many countries for pilot training {{before and during the}} Second World War, especially in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.|$|E

[...] This trainer was {{physically}} and mechanically restored to full working order in 1992. [...] This trainer did not originally have the wings and tail assembly installed. [...] They were often omitted on trainers made during World War II. [...] However, a set of [...] "paddle style" [...] wings and tail assembly was manufactured from original Link documentation specs, and added during the restoration. Updated Dec. 19, 2015 - This trainer has been moved and is now on public display at the Moffett Field Historical Society Museum, Moffett Field, Mountain View, CA.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} <b>Link</b> <b>Trainer</b> {{was created}} in 1929 out {{of the need for}} a safe way to teach new pilots how to fly by instruments. [...] Ed Link used his knowledge of pumps, valves and bellows gained at his father's Link Piano and Organ Company to create a flight simulator that responded to the pilot's controls and gave an accurate reading on the included instruments. More than 500,000 US pilots were trained on Link simulators, as were pilots of nations as diverse as Australia, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Pakistan, and the USSR. Following WWII, Air Marshall Robert Leckie (wartime RAF Chief of Staff) said “The Luftwaffe met its Waterloo on all the training fields of the free world where there was a battery of Link Trainers.” ...|$|E
50|$|Using <b>Link</b> <b>Trainers</b> and B-24 {{training}} aircraft, the TWA instructors trained {{more than}} 1,100 pilots and crewmen during the eight months the company operated the school. On 7 February 1942, the U.S. Army transferred the training function from TWA {{back to the}} USAAF, and the school was redesignated the Combat Crew Training School. The Air Corps Ferrying Command was redesignated the Army Air Forces Ferrying Command in March 1942, {{a month after the}} AAC transferred the school from TWA training back to the military.
