5|$|On his deathbed, Von Neumann entertained {{his brother}} by reciting, by heart and word-for-word, {{the first few}} lines of each page of Goethe's Faust. He died at age 53 on February 8, 1957, at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., under {{military}} security <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> reveal military secrets while heavily medicated. He was buried at Princeton Cemetery in Princeton, Mercer County, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The King {{immediately}} {{proved himself}} a conscientious worker. His first Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, {{stated that he}} had done more business with King William in ten minutes than he had with George IV in as many days. Lord Brougham described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter—whereas George IV feared to ask questions <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.|$|E
5|$|While {{wandering}} in the woods, Finn and Jake fall down two separate holes. Finn {{lands in the}} Kingdom of Huge, where he is greeted by its sovereign, King Huge. The king lavishes Finn with food and asks that he stay and watch the chiming of his cuckoo clock. However, it soon becomes apparent that King Huge is insane; he demands that Finn remain and watch every time the clock chimes the hour. Meanwhile, Jake lands on the barge of a bear named Seven. According to Seven, the barge has been falling for years, and he warns Jake not to try and escape, <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> die.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E

5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II {{broke out}} across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and {{considered}} a self-imposed exile, he ultimately {{decided to return}} to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle, leaving Hergé unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> {{and his men}} should be engaged {{when they reached the}} Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did not hit them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E
6000|$|The ravages {{which they}} {{committed}} compelled the king {{to send the}} Bishop of Chartres to sue for peace, {{but he would not}} venture into the camp without an escort from the duke, <b>lest,</b> as <b>he</b> said, [...] "the Danish wolves should devour him on the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will, then," [...] said I, {{my voice}} almost strangled with the thumping of my heart.

5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford {{to take the time to}} deal with the affair <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E

25|$|It {{was then}} claimed he flew further (unofficial?) {{operations}} with an unnamed P-51 group, claiming a Me-262 jet downed, {{but this is}} not confirmed by USAAF records and his ten credited kills were all made with the 61st FS. It is also claimed he intentionally understated the total of his air victories <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> be promoted and transferred off combat duties.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be not foolish," [...] I answered, for I feared <b>lest</b> when <b>he</b> {{found that}} all this strange {{resemblance}} was a chance, the bitterness of his disappointment might overwhelm him. [...] "Be not foolish, son; are there not many hills in this great land with ridges on their flanks, and streams of water running down them?" ...|$|R
60|$|From the knoll {{the bustle}} of {{preparation}} grew, the hacking of spears and throwing-stones. None spake the name of Ugh-lomi for fear that it might bring him. The men were going to keep together, close together, in the hunting {{for a day or}} so. And their hunting was to be Ugh-lomi, <b>lest</b> instead <b>he</b> should come a-hunting them.|$|R
60|$|The sound had its pathos too. At {{some of its}} simple cadences, {{the tears}} came quietly into Kenyon's eyes. They welled up slowly from his heart, which was thrilling with an emotion more {{delightful}} than he had often felt before, but which he forbore to analyze, <b>lest,</b> if <b>he</b> seized it, it should at once perish in his grasp.|$|R
25|$|On December 29, 2011, Israel {{rescinded}} Zubeidi's pardon for unstated reasons. Zubeidi stated to Ma'an News Agency {{that he had}} not violated any of {{the conditions}} of his amnesty. He was advised by PA security officials to turn himself in to Palestinian custody <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> be arrested by Israel's security forces. A week before Zubeidi was notified about the cancellation of his amnesty, his brother had been arrested by the PA.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{says that}} a righteousness from God has made itself known apart from the law, to which the law and prophets testify, and this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus to all who believe. He {{describes}} justification – legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin – as a gift of God, and not the work of man (<b>lest</b> <b>he</b> might boast), but by faith.|$|E
25|$|Luthor {{eventually}} {{returns to}} Earth, unable {{to accept his}} own role in Lexor's destruction and blaming Superman for it, even psychologically blocking the memory, <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> go insane. The Lexorian supersuit now enabled Luthor to fight Superman in hand-to-hand combat. Luthor's trademark battlesuit from this era—a heavily armored, flight-capable suit with kryptonite fixtures embedded in its gauntlets— was designed by George Pérez {{as part of the}} Super Powers toyline in the early 1980s and introduced as Luthor acted as Lexor's sovereign. It has reappeared in recent continuity, most notably during Infinite Crisis.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Go, Asti, to Pharaoh, {{and say to}} Pharaoh {{that great}} danger threatens him and our royal daughter. Say to him--Fly from Memphis, <b>lest</b> there <b>he</b> should be {{prepared}} for burial, and the Star of Amen hidden by a cloud of shame. Bid him beware of one about his throne, and of that evil magician with whom she made a pact last night.'" ...|$|R
60|$|In a word, I {{had in a}} {{few seconds}} been {{transformed}} from a cowardly lad who would shirk his duty <b>lest,</b> perchance, <b>he</b> receive some bodily hurt, to a boy burning with the desire to do whatsoever lay in his power toward checking the advance of an enemy who was bent upon carrying on the war by destroying the property of peaceful settlers.|$|R
60|$|And all {{day long}} I kept beside him, or {{followed}} him unseen, <b>lest</b> by chance <b>he</b> should learn the secret of that hidden door; and at night I lay awake watching him.|$|R
25|$|Having {{completed}} their mission, {{the team was}} {{on their way back}} to the army lines when they were spotted by Tamil Tiger units while crossing the Mankulam–Thunukkai road. They came under heavy fire, which injured one of the soldiers in the team. Chandana and the team leader, a Sergeant named Jayakodi, provided covering fire {{while the rest of the}} team withdrew, carrying the injured soldier. However, Chandana was severely injured in the firefight and was left unable to move by himself. He insisted that his team leader withdraw with the rest of the team <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> also would get captured or killed, and kept fighting by himself against the Tamil Tiger units which were converging on their position.|$|E
25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> collapse in the effort.|$|E
25|$|Jesse {{threatens to}} report Walter {{to the police}} if he is arrested, but Walter offers him Gale's {{position}} at the lab. After obtaining the position, Jesse begins stealing meth from the lab and selling it in secret on the side. Jesse gets romantically involved with a woman he meets in his rehab group and learns her kid brother, age 11, was put up by Gus and his street dealers to kill Combo. Jesse decides to avenge Combo. Walter aids Jesse in escaping from Gus' wrath. Gus begins to lose trust in Walter and asks Gale {{to take over the}} lab. He orders his henchmen to kill Walter and Jesse. After he is abducted by the henchmen, Walter instructs Jesse over the phone to kill Gale in order to force Gus not to kill Walter (and, by extension, Jesse) <b>lest</b> <b>he</b> eliminate his only remaining trained chemist.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had asked}} the {{question}} in perfect innocence, to change the topic. He knew that, and said merely, [...] "At an inn," [...] though {{it would have been}} a relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one. But the latter's final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered him <b>lest</b> what <b>he</b> might say should do his ignorant wife an injury.|$|R

6000|$|... "All," [...] he replied; [...] "but I {{have been}} unable to procure a horse for the lady. Giles Gosling, the cowardly hilding, refused me one on any terms whatever, <b>lest,</b> forsooth, <b>he</b> should suffer.
