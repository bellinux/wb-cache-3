25|$|D50 is {{scientific}} {{shorthand for}} a standard illuminant: the daylight spectrum at a {{correlated color temperature}} of 5000K. Similar definitions exist for D55, D65 and D75. Designations such as D50 are used to help classify color temperatures of light tables and viewing booths. When viewing a color slide at a <b>light</b> <b>table,</b> {{it is important that}} the light be balanced properly so that the colors are not shifted towards the red or blue.|$|E
25|$|A common {{method of}} obtaining pure {{cultures}} is serial dilution. Cultivators dilute either a wild sample or a lab sample containing the desired algae with filtered water and introduce small aliquots (measures of this solution) into {{a large number of}} small growing containers. Dilution follows a microscopic examination of the source culture that predicts that a few of the growing containers contain a single cell of the desired species. Following a suitable period on a <b>light</b> <b>table,</b> cultivators again use the microscope to identify containers to start larger cultures.|$|E

He came back with some cold cutlets and bread, pulled up a <b>light</b> <b>table,</b> and placed them before his guest. [...] "Never mind knives," [...] said his visitor, and a cutlet hung in mid-air, with a sound of gnawing.|$|E

6000|$|Veronica {{came in with}} a tray, and a bowl of bouillon on it; and Mrs. Erwin {{pulled up}} a <b>light</b> <b>table,</b> and slid about, serving her, in her cabalistic dress, like an Oriental sorceress {{performing}} her incantations. She volubly watched Lydia while she ate her supper, and at the end she kissed her again. [...] "Now you feel better," [...] she said. [...] "I knew it would cheer you up more than any one thing. There's nothing like something to eat when you're homesick. I found that out when I was off at school." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} the curtain rose, and Loring came forward, {{carrying}} a small, <b>light</b> <b>table,</b> which he placed {{near the front of}} the stage, and for a moment stood quietly by it. Edith noticed upon his face the expression of uncertainty and anxiety which had not yet left it. Standing {{by the side of the}} table, and speaking very slowly, but so clearly that his words could be heard distinctly in all parts of the room, he began some introductory remarks regarding the second part of his performance.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had begun}} {{with a few}} experiments. He did not know French except 'sivver play,' a phrase he seemed to regard as a very good <b>light</b> <b>table</b> joke in itself. His English was uncertain, but not such as books {{informed}} her distinguished the lower classes. His manners seemed to her good on the whole, but a trifle over-respectful and out of fashion. He called her I Madam' once. He seemed a person of means and leisure, but he knew nothing of recent concerts, theatres, or books. How did he spend his time? He was certainly chivalrous, and a trifle simpleminded. She fancied (so much is there in a change of costume) {{that she had never}} met with such a man before. What COULD he be? ...|$|E

50|$|Completed slides were mounted into pin-registered slide mounts.

6000|$|And {{another thing}} dawned upon him. There was no {{fireplace}} in either room. Was the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or {{was the whole}} city uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested in these questions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls, the simply constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedroom service was practically abolished. And over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form and colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. There were several very comfortable chairs, a <b>light</b> <b>table</b> on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance like jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no writing materials. [...] "The world has changed indeed," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|His {{purpose was}} to {{demonstrate}} that tables turn, that the phenomenon is purely physical, that it cannot {{be explained by the}} mechanical action of the muscles, nor by that of 'spirits'. His allies were his personal friends, and it is pretty clear that two ladies were the chief 'agents'. The process was conducted thus: a 'chain' of eight or ten people surrounded a table, lightly resting their fingers, all in contact, on its surface. It revolved, and, by request, would raise one of its legs, and tap the floor. All this, of course, can be explained either by cheating, or by the unconscious pushes administered. If any one will place his hands on a <b>light</b> <b>table,</b> he will find that the mere come and go of pulse and breath have a tendency to agitate the object. It moves a little, accompanying it you unconsciously move it more. The experiment is curious because, on some days, the table will not budge, on others it instantly sets up a peculiar gliding movement, in which it almost seems to escape from the superimposed hands, while the most wakeful attention cannot detect any conscious action of the muscles. If you try the opposite experiment, namely conscious pushing of the most gradual kind, you find that the exertion is very distinctly sensible. The author has made the following simple experiment.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} upon {{a day in}} Kabul that the Amir chose to do his day's work in the Baber Gardens, which lie {{a short distance from}} the city of Kabul. A <b>light</b> <b>table</b> stood before him, and round the table in the open air were grouped generals and finance ministers according to their degree. The Court and the long tail of feudal chiefs--men of blood, fed and cowed by blood--stood in an irregular semicircle round the table, and the wind from the Kabul orchards blew among them. All day long sweating couriers dashed in with letters from the outlying districts with rumours of rebellion, intrigue, famine, failure of payments, or announcements of treasure on the road; and all day long the Amir would read the dockets, and pass such of these as were less private to the officials whom they directly concerned, or call up a waiting chief for a word of explanation. It is well to speak clearly to the ruler of Afghanistan. Then the grim head, under the black astrachan cap with the diamond star in front, would nod gravely, and that chief would return to his fellows. Once that afternoon a woman clamoured for divorce against her husband, who was bald, and the Amir, hearing both sides of the case, bade her pour curds over the bare scalp, and lick them off, that the hair might grown again, and she be contented. Here the Court laughed, and the woman withdrew, cursing her king under her breath.|$|E

50|$|RemoteView is {{a widely}} {{available}} electronic <b>light</b> <b>table</b> application, initially developed and released commercially by Sensor Systems in 1996. An electronic <b>light</b> <b>table</b> application {{makes it possible for}} imagery analysts to review satellite images on a computer instead of examining film or printed photographs. RemoteView was originally written only for the Unix operating system, but as the US Department of Defense transitioned to the Windows operating system, Sensor Systems released a Windows-based version that soon became a primary tool used by the intelligence community. Overwatch acquired Sensor Systems and the RemoteView software in 2005. Textron Systems acquired Overwatch in 2006.|$|E
