The enzymes of PP pathway were expressed constitutively in both the susceptible and resistant genotype. However, the activity was higher in all the developmental stages of resistant genotype and its RILs, indicating that this genotype has a significant higher basal level of these enzymes {{as compared to the}} susceptible line and could be used as marker(s) to define KB resistance. The activity of PAL and POD was significantly higher in WSv stage (Z = 16) while the specific activity of PPO was higher in WS 3 (Z = 77) stage as compared to the other physiological stages in both the genotypes. In resistant genotype the lignin content increased two-fold and three-fold at WS 2 and WS 3 stage, respectively, while in susceptible genotype no significant increase in lignin content was observed. The pathway might be associated with the enhancement of structural defense barrier due to <b>lignifications</b> of cell wall as evident from the enhanced synthesis of lignin in all the stages of resistant genotype.

Clusterbean seedlings were grown with 0, 10, or 20 [*]mg[*]Zn[*]kg− 1 soil treatments in earthen pots filled with 700 [*]g inoculated soil. Soil was inoculated by pretreatment with 250 [*]mg (wet weight) of Rhizoctonia inoculums per pot. A similar set was maintained in uninoculated soil. Root rot incidence decreased to 41 and 27 per cent with 10 and 20 [*]mg[*]Zn[*]kg− 1 soil treatments, respectively, as compared to 68 percent at control. Antioxidative enzyme activity (polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and tyrosine ammonia lyase) increased in inoculated seedlings and was increased further by 20 [*]mg[*]Zn[*]kg− 1 soil treatment. Antioxidative enzymes play an important role against fungal invasion, as peroxidase is involved in the formation of barrier via <b>lignifications</b> at the site of pathogen penetration.

40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the major}} abiotic stress {{conditions}} limiting crop growth and productivity. Duilio is a wheat genotype that shows tolerant behavior in both salt-stress and drought-stress conditions. Toward better understanding of the biochemical response to salinity in this genotype of durum wheat, a comparative label-free shotgun proteomic analysis based on normalized spectral abundance factors was conducted on wheat leaf samples subjected to increasing salt-stress levels (100 and 200 mmol L- 1 NaCl) with respect to untreated samples. We found significant changes in 71 proteins for the first stress level, in 83 proteins at the higher salinity level, and in 88 proteins when comparing salt-stress levels with each other. The major changes concerned the proteins involved in primary metabolism and production of energy, followed by those involved in protein metabolism and cellular defense mechanisms. Some indications of different specific physiological and defense mechanisms implicated in increasing tolerance were obtained. The enhanced salinity tolerance in Duilio appeared to be governed by a higher capacity for osmotic homeostasis, a more efficient defense, and an improvement of protection from mechanical stress by increased cell wall <b>lignifications,</b> allowing a better potential for growth recovery...|$|R
30|$|The visual lodging rate in {{japonica rice}} {{differed}} remarkably between genotypes and top-dressing N treatments. The higher lodging index of rice plants was primarily {{attributed to the}} weak breaking strength of the lower internodes. The longer elongated basal internodes were responsible for higher plant height and a higher lodging index. Correlation analysis showed that breaking strength was significantly and positively correlated with {{the thickness of the}} mechanical tissue but was significantly and negatively correlated with the inner diameter of the major axis (b 2). With increasing top-dressing N rates, the sclerenchyma cells of the mechanical tissues and the vascular bundles of the Wuyunjing 23 cultivar varied little. The plant height, inner diameter of the minor axis (a 2) and b 2 increased significantly, but the area of the large vascular bundle (ALVB) and the area of the small vascular bundle (ASVB) decreased significantly and resulted in lower stem strength and a higher lodging index under higher top-dressing N conditions. The culm diameter of the W 3668 cultivar increased slightly with no significant difference, and the sclerenchyma cells in the mechanical tissues and vascular bundles showed deficient <b>lignifications</b> under high top-dressing N conditions. Moreover, the ALVB and the ASVB decreased significantly, while the area of air chambers (AAC) increased rapidly.|$|R

This tissue is usually one to several layers thick, with cells walls of uneven thickness due to uneven <b>lignification.</b> The cells lose water, and the uneven thickness causes the thinner walls of the cells to stretch to a greater extent.

Another way of reducing somaclonal variation is to avoid 2,4-D in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce variation. Vitrification, commonly referred to as hyperhydricity in the tissue culture world, may be a problem in some species.

After pollination and fertilization of egg cell, after 6 weeks of complete dehiscence, the pericarpe was grown to final size and even the <b>lignifications</b> of endocarpe started but the zygote cell was in a dormant state and in 6 - 8 weeks after complete dehiscence the zygote cell division along an increase in endosperm division occured so that cotyledonary embryo was formed in 10 - 12 weeks after complete dehiscence and the cotyledons attained their final size in 3 weesks after that, namely 15 weeks after complete dehiscence and at this time, the seedless and filled fruits were completely distinguished. During the ovule development stages, some abnormalities were observed such as lack of embryo sac formation, embryo sac degeneration, small and abnormal embryo sac formation, vascular band collapse inside the funicule, presence of zygote without endosperm and presence of endosperm without zygote, and these abnormalities caused lack of enough ovule growth and seedless or semiseedless fruit formation in pistachio...|$|R

50|$|Phylogenomic {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} enzymes with true CCR activity first {{evolved in the}} ancestor(s) of land plants. Most if not all modern land plants and all vascular plants {{are believed to have}} at least one functional CCR, an absolute requirement for any plant species with lignified tissues. Most CCR homologs are highly expressed during development, especially in stem, root, and xylem cells which require the enhanced structural support provided by lignin. However, certain CCRs are not constitutively expressed throughout development and are only up-regulated during enhanced <b>lignification</b> in response to stressors such as pathogen attack. CCR is especially important because it acts as a final control point for regulation of metabolic flux toward the monolignols and therefore toward lignin as well; prior to this reduction step, the cinnamoyl-CoA's can still enter into other expansive specialized metabolic pathways. For example, feruloyl-CoA is a precursor of the coumarin scopoletin, a compound believed {{to play an important role}} in plant pathogen response. CCR also plays a role in determining lignin composition by regulating levels of the different monomers according to its specific activity toward particular cinnamoyl-CoA's. Monocots and dicots, for example, tend to have very different lignin patterns: lignin found in monocots typically has a higher percentage of p-coumaroyl alcohol-derived subunits, while lignin found in dicots is typically composed of almost entirely coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol subunits. As can be seen in the diagram shown to the right, these monolignols are derived directly from their corresponding aldehydes, except in the case of sinapyl alcohol - interestingly, while several CCR homologs have been shown to act on sinapoyl-CoA in vitro, it is unclear whether this activity is biologically relevant and most current models of the lignin pathway do not include this reaction as a valid step.|$|E

He does however makes a point of using deep-rooted pioneer plants such as lupins, sweet clover, lucerne and broom. These crops are said to aerate the soil and make sure no water is left standing near the tree. No use is made of wire meshes as protection against voles, since he states they are not efficient in preventing damage from voles using this technique anyway. He makes no use of contemporary fruit tree cultivars, but only uses (very strong/hardy) old, local (heirloom) cultivars. In addition to (old cultivars of) regular fruit trees, he also plants much fruit tree species that are specific to use in phytotherapy or which can only function as animal feed (i.e. crab apple, wild pear, wild cherry, blackthorn, rowan, wild service, service tree, cornelian cherry, snowy mespilus, ...). Similar to mainstream permaculture, he makes no use of chemical fertiliser or pesticides, at all. It should be noted that due to the altitude he's at, his trees bear fruit later, meaning he can sell it after most (sealevel) farmers sold their produce. Due to this (and the fact that he produces heirloom fruit varieties, and not regular varieties), he is often able to get a better price for it. In some cases, customers (like distilleries) are even willing to pick the fruit themselves, eliminating the labour expense for him.|$|E
40|$|Background: Duckweed can {{thrive on}} {{anthropogenic}} wastewater and produce tremendous biomass production. Due to its relatively high starch and low lignin percentage, duckweed {{is a good}} candidate for bioethanol fermentation. Previous studies have observed that water devoid of nutrients is good for starch accumulation, but its molecular mechanism remains unrevealed. Results: This study globally analyzed the response to nutrient starvation in order to investigate the starch accumulation in duckweed (Landoltia punctata). L. punctata was transferred from nutrient-rich solution to distilled water and sampled at different time points. Physiological measurements demonstrated that the activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the key enzyme of starch synthesis, as well as the starch percentage in duckweed, increased continuously under nutrient starvation. Samples collected at 0 h, 2 h and 24 h time points respectively were used for comparative gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq. A comprehensive transcriptome, comprising of 74, 797 contigs, was constructed by a de novo assembly of the RNA-Seq reads. Gene expression profiling results showed that the expression of some transcripts encoding key enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis was up-regulated, while the expression of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in starch consumption were down-regulated, the expression of some photosynthesis-related transcripts were down-regulated during the first 24 h, and the expression of some transporter transcripts were up-regulated within the first 2 h. Very interestingly, most transcripts encoding key enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were highly expressed regardless of starvation, while transcripts encoding laccase, the last rate-limiting enzyme of <b>lignifications,</b> exhibited very low expression abundance in all three samples. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive expression profiling of L. punctata under nutrient starvation, which indicates that nutrient starvation down-regulated the global metabolic status, redirects metabolic flux of fixed CO 2 into starch synthesis branch resulting in starch accumulation in L. punctata...|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{are central}} to the {{livelihoods}} of Tanzanians who rely on them for income via sales of milk, meat, skins and draught power. Owning livestock is amongst the ways in which many Tanzanians could diversify their risks, increase assets and improve their resilience to changes in climate. Though local coping strategies can deal with shocks in the short-term, they are hardly able to cope with more frequent and severe climate events. Observably, temperature, rainfall and atmospheric CO 2 concentration interact with grazing and land cover change to influence rangeland quality and composition. Increased temperature increases drought stress and tissue <b>lignifications</b> in plants and, consequently, affects their digestibility and decomposition rate. Increased temperature and lower rainfall also increases vegetation flammability resulting in a shift in species composition due to increased fire frequency. Literature indicates that, Tanzania rangelands receiving between 400 and 1000 mm of rain per year (e. g. Kongwa, Monduli, Kiteto, Simanjiro, Ngorongoro, Babati, Hanang, Mbulu and Karatu) have greatest impact on climate change on surface drainage. A 10 % drop in rainfall of 1000 mm per year in a rangeland results in a decline in surface drainage of only 17 %, while in areas of 500 mm per year will result in a 50 % decline. Interventions such as controlled animal stocking rates, sustainable yield and use of good pasture will lessen the negative impacts of climate change on rangelands. Opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions on rangelands include maintaining or increasing carbon sequestration through better soil management and reducing methane production by altering animal management practices on rangelands. There is a need to focus on enabling herd mobility through securing better access to water resources, land use planning, and improve early warning systems and supporting a diversification of livelihoodsThis article is available at [URL]...|$|R
30|$|Heartwood {{formation}} {{is a unique}} feature of woody plants. Heartwood is important both for a tree’s life and wood usage. The roles of heartwood {{are considered to be}} optimizing sapwood volumes, recycling nutrients, and providing mechanical support with durability [1, 2]. For the usage of wood, heartwood has positive or negative effect on wood properties due to the presence of extractives [3]. To utilize trees more efficiently as wood sources, it is crucial to understand the mechanism of heartwood formation toward regulation of the formation. Heartwood formation has been studied from anatomical, chemical and biochemical perspectives [3 – 5]. However, why and how heartwood is formed remains largely elusive. It has been proposed that heartwood {{formation is}} an actively regulated physiological process [3, 5 – 7] and it is regarded as the final stage of wood differentiation [8]. The early stage is mature xylem formation, which includes cell division from vascular cambium, cell expansion, cell wall thickening and <b>lignifications</b> [1]. For this stage, expressed genes were collected and changes in gene expression were investigated on a large scale for several tree species belonging to Pinus [9 – 12], Populus [13 – 16], Eucalyptus [17 – 20] and Acacia [21]. In contrast, there have been only a few large-scale gene analyses for heartwood formation. Studies have been conducted on broad-leaved trees, Robinia pseudoacacia [22, 23] and Juglans nigra [24, 25], but there have been no reports on conifers. The sugi tree (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) has sharply defined heartwood, and usually also a readily recognized transition zone (TZ) between sapwood and heartwood [26]. Thus, C. japonica is a good sample material to study events having occurred during heartwood formation. To obtain clues to elucidate the mechanism of heartwood formation at a molecular level, we collected expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the TZ in November, in which heartwood formation is considered to proceed. The ESTs were assembled and the resulting sequences were functionally categorized. Furthermore, the expression of genes selected as having potential involvement in heartwood formation was quantified in various organs.|$|R
