5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which had included unpaid household work in the GDP {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, it was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1950 for reasons of compatibility with the new international standard.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino {{can live}} around 30–45years in the wild. It {{historically}} inhabited lowland rain forest, wet grasslands, and large floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and offspring-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no predators in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans, but will attack when it feels threatened. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly {{due to their}} extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on February 28, 2011, by WWF and Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring pairs and courting adults. As of 2016 there are only 63 individuals <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the wild and none captive.|$|E
5|$|Tripathi had {{confirmed}} in September 2011 {{that he was}} writing The Oath of the Vayuputras, with Westland announcing the release date as 27 February 2013. The book was longer than the previous installments of the series and Tripathi clarified that all the loose ends <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the previous book would be addressed, {{with the death of}} certain characters. Following the release of the cover art, it was announced that the publication rights of the books have been bought by both US and UK publisher houses. Like The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, the book contained innovative marketing techniques, including launching interactive apps, merchandise and a music album titled Vayuputras, containing music inspired by different events in the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of a DH laser is that the region where free electrons and holes exist simultaneously—the active region—is confined to the thin middle layer. This means that many more of the electron-hole pairs can contribute to amplification—not so many are <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the poorly amplifying periphery. In addition, light is reflected from the heterojunction; hence, the light is confined to the region where the amplification takes place.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} a {{continuing}} misrepresentation, lying by omission occurs when an important fact is <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> order to foster a misconception. Lying by omission includes the failure to correct pre-existing misconceptions. For example, when the seller of a car declares it has been serviced regularly but does not tell that a fault was reported at the last service, the seller lies by omission. It {{can be compared to}} dissimulation.|$|E
25|$|Night patrols were <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> no man's land, {{after day}} patrols and longer reconnaissances, to keep watch {{in case of}} {{surprise}} attacks. The patrol would ride out, guided only by compass, to establish nighttime listening posts, where some dismounted to move close to Ottoman positions, to listen for and note all movements. Others tested for water sources, examined Ottoman trenches and tracks in the area, or verified aerial reports. These night patrols consisted of one officer and 12 other ranks.|$|E

25|$|With {{a handful}} of exceptions, there was little serious history of women in Australia before the 1970s. Women's history as an {{academic}} discipline emerged in the mid-1970s, typified by Miriam Dixson's The Real Matilda: Woman and Identity in Australia, 1788 to the Present (1976). The first studies were compensatory, filling in the vacuum where women had been <b>left</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> common with developments in the United States and Britain, there was a movement toward gender studies, with a field dominated by feminists. Of recent importance are studies {{of the role of}} women on the homefront, and in military service, during world wars.

25|$|One {{style of}} Maury known as rancio is {{produced}} when the wine is racked into clear glass demi-johns or bonbonne and <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the summer sun to oxidize and age. This causes {{many of the}} colour compounds and tannins in the wines to fall out, leaving a thick, dark coloured deposit in the bonbonne. This deposit is allowed {{to stay in the}} bonbonne to influence the colour and flavour of resulting vintages of wine that are aged in the container. Once the wine has finished aging for the summer it is usually blended with wine that has spent time aging in large foudres oak cask or sold separately as Maury Rancio.|$|E
25|$|It was {{immediately}} clear that most media markets which had stations that were owned by Tribune would receive the CW affiliation, leaving Fox Television Stations, UPN's second largest affiliate group (after the UPN O owned by CBS Television Stations), without any network programming during primetime hours.

He was one hundredth to win the silver medal. Pereira also swam, {{for the first time in}} the World Championships, the 100-meter butterfly event, finishing in 15th place. Pereira had decided to forego the 400-meter individual medley despite being qualified for the race, but decided otherwise and entered the contest. Although he has not trained specifically for this race, he qualified for the final in eighth place, and by a few hundredths not <b>left</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> the final, he won the bronze medal with a time of 4:09.48, his second medal at World Championships.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall, however, bowled in {{excellent}} form for Lancashire {{right up to}} 1957; taking 100 County Championship wickets every year except 1956, when after an irresistible start, he unaccountably lost form. In the wet summer of 1958. he failed to reach 100 wickets {{for the first time}} since 1949. The eminent Lancashire cricket writer, John Kay, felt Tattersall the victim of inconsistent policy at Old Trafford. In 1956, he was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> mid-season, a move that probably cost the County the championship. Nonetheless, it was a surprise to see Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton dropped at the beginning of 1959, for the leg-spinner Tommy Greenhough. Although Tattersall was recalled at the beginning of the 1960 season, he did not do well enough to keep his place after May.|$|E

25|$|By 1810, {{the city}} of Oaxaca had 18,000 inhabitants, most of whom where mestizos or mixed indigenous/European. During the Mexican War of Independence the {{government}} of this area remained loyal to the Spanish Crown.

Some early rebel groups emerged in the state, such as those led by Felipe Tinoco and Catarino Palacios, {{but they were also}} eventually executed. After 1812, insurgents began to have some success in the state, especially in the areas around Huajuapan de León, where Valerio Trujano defended the city against royalist forces until José María Morelos y Pavón was able to come in with support to keep the area in rebel hands. After that point, insurgents had greater success {{in various parts of the}} state, but the capital remained in royalist hands until the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|Baebius spearheaded {{legislation}} {{to crack down}} on ambitus. Anyone convicted of bribery was disqualified from holding public office for ten years. This law was accompanied by an attempt to regulate prorogation. The Lex Baebia et Cornelia of 181 devised a complicated system aimed at limiting the number of ex-praetors vying for the consulship. In the sortition for provinciae, the two Spains were to be <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> odd-numbered years, and only four praetorships would be available in those years. In effect, a provincial appointment in Spain meant automatic prorogation, resulting in a two-year term. The Lex Baebia thus marks the constitutionalized acceptance of routinely extending commands past the year of the elected magistracy. This law was supported by M. Porcius Cato, the famous legislative and moral reformer. But because this limit only decreased the number of administrators available for other provinces, resulting in further use of prorogation, six praetors became the norm again in the mid-170s, and the moral issues were set aside.|$|E
