As others took notice of the project the engine was duplicated over 15 times, but while the interfaces and services others provided were great, they could not keep up with the main development. So the decision was taken, to move the Gnucleus engine, now called GnucDNA, into a separate component, so that anyone has access to it without fear of falling behind in the developments and improvements that are made. It also opens up new doors for those interested in creating their own P2P networks, but do not want to re-invent the <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> communication and file transfer mechanisms.|$|E

G3-PLC is the <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> protocol to enable large scale infrastructure on the electrical grid. G3-PLC may operate on CENELEC A band (35 kHz to 91 kHz) or CENELEC B band (98 kHz to 122 kHz) in Europe, on ARIB band (155 kHz to 403 kHz) in Japan and on FCC (155 kHz to 487 kHz) for the US {{and the rest}} of the world. The technology used is OFDM sampled at 400 kHz with adaptative modulation and tone mapping. Error detection and correction is made by both a convolutional code and Reed-Solomon error correction. The required media access control is taken from IEEE 802.15.4, a radio standard. In the protocol, 6loWPAN has been chosen to adapt IPv6 an internet network layer to constrained environments which is Power line communications. 6loWPAN integrates routing, based on the mesh network LOADng, header compression, fragmentation and security. G3-PLC has been designed for extremely robust communication based on reliable and highly secured connections between devices, including crossing Medium Voltage to Low Voltage transformers. In December 2011, G3 PLC technology was recognised as an international standard at ITU in Geneva where it is referenced as G.9903.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Low</b> <b>layer</b> {{plants as}} one of {{component}} in forest ecosystem today still lack of attention due to the limited information about them. <b>Low</b> <b>layer</b> plants {{plays an important role}} in forest ecosystem, and also they are potential to be use as a medicinal plants, genetic resources and other uses that are not yet revealed. For that reason reseach about <b>Low</b> <b>Layer</b> Plants; Community Structure and Their Use as Medicinal Plants need to be conducted. The objective of this research was to get the information about : (1) Community structure of <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> plants in compartment seven Kaliurang protection forest and (2) Species that are use as a medicinal pants. To fulfill this goal, small plots of 1 x 1 m along forest pathways were made in sampling area. Result showed that as many as 47 species of <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> plants were found in sampling area. There were five main species which has high importance value index : Eupatorium riparium Regel. with importance value index 21, 29 %, followed by Eleusine indica Gaertn. 17, 82 %, Oplismenus burmanii Beauv. 14, 61 %, Diplazium proliferum 14, 04 % and Panicum reptans Kunth. 11, 27 %.

The proposed method {{not only can}} resist Holliman-Memon attack, but also can accurately detect the tampered location of an image. First, a watermark is created from a protected image by using an edge detection technique. Second, the created watermark is divided into blocks and embedded into the 2 -LSB (top layer) of the protected image. Third, all block signatures are calculated and embedded into the 1 -LSB (<b>low</b> <b>layer)</b> of the protected image. At the <b>low</b> <b>layer,</b> the calculated signatures can resist Holliman-Memon attack. At the top layer, the created watermark can accurately detect the tampered location of an image.

40|$|We {{present the}} development, tests and first {{results of the}} second {{generation}} <b>Low</b> <b>Layer</b> Scidar (LOLAS- 2). This instrument constitutes a strongly improved version of the prototype <b>Low</b> <b>Layer</b> Scidar, which is aimed at the measurement of optical turbulence profiles close to the ground, with high altitude-resolution. The method {{is based on the}} Generalised Scidar principle which consists in taking double-star scintillation images on a defocused pupil plane and calculating in real time the autocovariance of the scintillation. The main components are an open-truss 40 -cm Ritchey-Chrétien telescope, a german-type equatorial mount, an Electron Multiplying CCD camera and a dedicated acquisition and real-time data processing software. The new optical design of LOLAS- 2 is significantly simplified compared with the prototype. The experiments carried out to test the permanence of the image within the useful zone of the detector and the stability of the telescope focus show that LOLAS- 2 can function without the use of the autoguiding and autofocus algorithms that were developed for the prototype version. Optical turbulence profiles obtained with the new <b>Low</b> <b>Layer</b> Scidar have the best altitude-resolution ever achieved with Scidar-like techniques (6. 3 m). The simplification of the optical layout and the improved mechanical properties of the telescope and mount make of LOLAS- 2 a more robust instrument.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the wind assessment of high layer for siting the wind turbine on the complex terrain, {{which is based}} on the data measured by the use of Doppler SODAR. Although a rough estimation of the wind assessment using standard meteorological anemometers at <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> are cost effective and easy to be installed, it is necessary to measure the wind condition at hub height for accurate assessment. Comparison between measured data by Doppler SODAR and the data predicted from observation of the wind condition at <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> is performed. Large difference is seen in the measured wind profile and calculated power law plots of the wind. Estimation of generation power of wind turbine due to SODAR measurement agrees well with the actual turbine generation power. In the complex terrain, {{it can be said that}} observation of the low layers does not suffice to assess accurately the wind, while Doppler SODAR measurement is useful...|$|E

ServerTemplates of RightScale [[16]] is an abstract template approach. When a user deploys a template to a Cloud such as Amazon Web Services or RackSpace Cloud Servers, RightScale sets a configuration adapting to each component of deployed Cloud. This concept is similar to our template extraction to enable easy Cloud migration or replication. However, RightScale ServerTemplates transaction managements or reflections of environment change depend on each Cloud and remain unresolved. Our work resolves them by the TM server.

Amazon recommends using OpsWorks in high layer management and using CloudFormation for <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> deployment. Support range of OpsWorks is limited in application oriented Amazon Web Services resources and support range of CloudFormation is much larger.

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} service providers have been showing {{strong interest in}} Proxy Mobile IPv 6 for providing network-based IP mobility management. This could be a prominent way to support IP mobility to mobile nodes, because Proxy Mobile IPv 6 requires minimal functionalities on the mobile node. While several extensions for Proxy Mobile IPv 6 are being developed in the Internet Engineering Task Force, {{there has been little}} attentions paid to developing efficient authentication mechanisms. An authentication scheme for a mobility protocol must protect signaling messages against various security threats, e. g., session stealing attack, intercept attack by redirection, replay attack, and key exposure, while minimizing authentication latency. In this paper, we propose a Diffie-Hellman key based authentication scheme that utilizes the <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> signaling to exchange Diffie-Hellman variables and allows mobility service provisioning entities to exchange mobile node's profile and ongoing sessions securely. By utilizing the <b>low</b> <b>layer</b> signaling and context transfer between relevant nodes, the proposed authentication scheme minimizes authentication latency when the mobile node moves across different networks. In addition, thanks {{to the use of the}} Diffie-Hellman key agreement, pre-established security associations between mobility service provisioning entities are not required in the proposed authentication scheme so that network scalability in an operationally efficient manner is ensured. To ascertain its feasibility, security analysis and performance analysis are presented...|$|E
