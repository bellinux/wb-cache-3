50|$|Trapper Keeper is a {{brand of}} <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder</b> created by Mead. Popular with {{students}} in the United States, Canada and parts of Latin America from the 1970s to the 1990s, it featured sliding plastic rings (instead of standard snap-closed metal binder rings), folders, and pockets to keep schoolwork and papers, and a wrap around flap with a Velcro closure (originally a metal snap closure).|$|E

50|$|The next year, Oxford Pendaflex {{changed its}} name to Esselte Pendaflex Corporation and {{continued}} to expand through acquisitions. In 1981, Esselte Pendaflex took over the operation of its parent's U.S. price marking division by integrating with the Esselte subsidiary Esselte Meto. Esselte Meto had been formed out of the price marking operations of Dymo and that of a 1980 acquisition, Primark. The company's next major addition was the Boorum & Pease Company in 1985. Boorum & Pease, based in Elizabeth, New Jersey, manufactured and marketed office supplies, record-keeping supplies, and information storage and retrieval products, and was a leading manufacturer of blank books and <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binders.</b> The company had revenues of $70 million in 1985, and Esselte Pendaflex paid $40 million for it. That year, Esselte Pendaflex also acquired a Los Angeles firm called Universal Paper Goods. This company had a West Coast business manufacturing custom order folders and office supplies.|$|R

50|$|The {{game was}} again {{published}} as three core rulebooks which incorporated the expansions and revisions {{which had been}} published in various supplements over the previous decade. However, the Monster Manual {{was replaced by the}} Monstrous Compendium, a <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder</b> in which every monster is given a full page of information, the justification being that packs of new monsters (often setting-specific) could be purchased and added to the binder without the expense or inconvenience of a separate book. It was intended that the <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder</b> would allow the book to be updated and customized as needed. This format proved highly susceptibile to wear and tear however, and presented difficulties in keeping alphabetic order when pages had been printed with monsters on each side. Subsequently, the loose leaf formatting was abandoned and the Compendium as a core book was replaced by single-volume hardcover Monstrous Manual in 1993, collecting popular monsters from the Compendium. The edition also greatly increases the power of dragons. This was done to counter the impression of relative weakness of the game's titular monster.|$|E

50|$|Psychoanalysts and psychotherapists such as Sigmund Freud, Marion Milner, Carl Jung and Ira Progoff {{have all}} used journaling, {{autobiography}} {{and other types}} of writing for personal insights, and to develop their own theories. Journal writing began in 1966 in New York and was started by Ira Progoff. Progoff created the intensive journal method, a structured way of writing about life that allows the writer to achieve spiritual and personal growth. This method consisted of a three-ring, <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder</b> with four color-coded sections: lifetime dimension, dialogue dimension, depth dimension and meaning dimension. These sections are divided into several subsections. Some of these subsections include topics like career, dreams, body and health, interests, events and meaning in life. Progoff created the intensive journal so that working {{in one part of the}} journal would in turn stimulate material to work in another part of the journal, leading to different viewpoints, awareness and connection between subjects. The Intensive Journal Method began with recording in a daily log.|$|E

40|$|The Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs (DCA) Examination Manual (manual) is {{designed}} as a job performance aid for field examiners conducting Compliance and CRA examinations, and for Regional Office and Washington Office employees processing examination reports and related documents. The information contained in the manual is presented by task. This format comprehensively displays information to assist examiners in performing examinations. In the task-oriented format, information is grouped by process, which has been shown through practice to be the format in which individuals best assimilate and comprehend information. In addition, the manual pages are divided into two columns to enhance locating particular topics and reading ease. The left-hand column contains headers and icons for assistance in locating detailed information contained in the right-hand column. Also, the manual is presented in a <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder</b> format to facilitate periodic updates and to allow users to insert other references. Structuring the manual around the examination process, from pre-examination planning to report preparation, reflects the logical flow of the examination process and the actual procedures performed by DCA field examiners. This format, of grouping by examination process and area of review, allows for the assimilation and integration of different regulatory requirements as they apply to {{a specific type of}} transaction. For example, the section for primary residence loan review combines Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act requirements into one consolidated loan file review. The manual outlines detailed procedures to be performed during each examination. In addition to examination procedures, each section includes, where applicable...|$|E
40|$|During this course, we {{are going}} to create an entire new book {{tailored}} to your needs as an RPG student. It will fill a large, 2 -ring <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder.</b> It will, in the end, contain much more information than we can possibly discuss in class. Hence, it is both a course text and syllabus, as well as a resource for the future. This book has grown out of a long-established traditional class in Advanced (Legal) Research Methodology (ARM) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Faculty of Law, Department of Law. It is a required class for all Research Postgraduate (RPG) Students in law, but it often includes undergraduates, non-law students, students from other universities, and many others who {{want to learn more about}} sophisticated legal research techniques. My first encounter with the class was as an RPG student when I started my PhD studies in 2001. The teacher was Professor Jill Cottrell, whose book, Legal Research: A Guide for Hong Kong Students, is still a standard work on the subject and is now being revised and updated. 1 In following semesters, I had the privilege of team-teaching the class with Jill, and these pages reflect much of her influence and pedagogical philosophy. Her text is still one of the foundational sources for the ARM course, and I assign it for two reasons. First, it teaches the skills of basic legal research. Second, and just as importantly, it is jargon-free. Jill writes with simplicity and springboard lucidity—skills I want my RPGs to see and practice. I also team-taught the class with Professor Michael J. Dilena for one semester, and his counsel on “how to get a PhD” is also reflected here. As was the practice of both Jill and Michael, I invite guest lecturers to share their personal experiences and wisdom (we call them “war stories”) with each class. Among our regular guests have been Fu Hualing (department head) and Albert Chen (my own PhD supervisor) —of the HKU Faculty of Law—and they have all told us some tremendous (and often harrowing) war stories. I thank all of them. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|This Manual is {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} guide {{for the development of the}} Smallpox Eradication/Measles Control Program in Africa. The principles set forth and procedures suggested have been developed on the basis of diverse staff and consultant experience in field epidemiology and vaccination programs in many parts of the world and on the basis of a decade of experience with vaccination and surveillance programs in the United States. However, no program has ever been undertaken of the general character and dimensions planned in West Africa. It must be recognized therefore, that this manual represents only an informed judgment regarding the principles involved and possible methods and procedures applicable to the various country programs. These require tempering in the crucible of practical field experience. In addition, each of the separate country programs necessarily will require adaptation and modification to fit the needs of the country in question, for each country has its unique administrative structure, customs and policies. The manual is printed as a "draft" rather than as a formal document. After a year's experience, a more definitive document can be prepared. In preparing this document, full cognizance has been taken of policies and guidelines for smallpox eradication developed by the World Health Organization. We believe there are no basic conflicts in approach or in philosophy. Because of the nature of the assistance we are able to provide, the structure and organization of this Program, and the early inception of the Program compared to the present timing of the global program, the manual provides a more detailed modus operandi than has yet been developed by WHO. The Manual first takes up the important question of relationships of CDC staff to national authorities, other American personnel, WHO and other regional health organizations and personnel and other Program staff. Next to be dealt with, in Sections III, IV and, are the three principal functional components of the Program: Operations, Assessment and Surveillance. Technical information pertaining to vaccines is provided under Section VI. General areas of interest with respect to field research and investigation are outlined in Section VII. General administrative procedures and procedures relating to inventory and supply are described in Sections VIII and IX. In Section X, Reports and Records to be provided to the Regional Project Office are presented as a unit. This material has been prepared in <b>loose-leaf</b> <b>binder</b> form to permit expansion and to allow for revisions to be made as dictated by experience. I. Introduction [...] II.
