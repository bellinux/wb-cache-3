40|$|The {{application}} of biocontrol in Dutch glasshouses has increased tremendously from its rediscovery in the 1960 's up to now. In the last decade, {{the number of}} different natural enemies sold to Dutch growers increased from 7 in 1992 to 26 in 2001 (<b>LTO</b> <b>Nederland,</b> vakgroep Glastuinbouw, 2003). Integrated pest management (IPM) is practised {{on a large scale}} in all main vegetable crops. At the end of the millennium more than 90 % of all tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet peppers were produced under IPM in The Netherlands (Van Lenteren, 2000). Also the area of glasshouse ornamentals grown under IPM increased. In 1998 biocontrol was applied in more than 10 % of the Dutch ornamental crops (Van Lenteren, 2000). This increase is mainly accounted for by gerberas, roses, orchids and potted plants (<b>LTO</b> <b>Nederland,</b> vakgroep Glastuinbouw, 2003). According to Van Lenteren (2000), natural enemies were released on 78 % of the area down to gerbera...|$|E
40|$|Within {{a project}} Sustainable control {{strategies}} Wageningen University & Research Greenhouse Horticulture literature screening {{to develop an}} integrated pest management strategy to control airborne fungi. This project {{was funded by the}} former Dutch Horticultural Production Board and accompanied by the Dutch growers association, <b>LTO</b> Glaskracht <b>Nederland.</b> In 2016 two greenhouse trials were performed with pot tomato, Petunia and pot gerbera. Additionally, a greenhouse test was performed at a commercial greenhouse with pot gerbera. Goal was to test the side effects of synthetic elicitors which stimulate systemic acquired resistance against biotrophic fungi on disease resistance against nectrotrophic fungi like Botrytis. A commercially available synthetic elicitor, Fado (Nufarm) was able to reduce the Botrytis infection in pot tomato and in flowers of pot gerbera. Effectivity was supported by a combined treatment with Jiffy mineral (soil addition) and Serenade. Two experimental products of BASF and Nufarm were effective in reducing Botrytis in pot gerbera. Botrytis infection was not only related to light and relative humidity, but was also correlated with nutrients and chlorophyll content. Based on this knowledge, prediction models for Botrytis can be improved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture {{developed}} together with <b>LTO</b> Glaskracht <b>Nederland</b> {{and a group}} of growers, advisors and producers a sustainable control strategy for mildew. Several green products with a systemic or a contact mode of action were tested on their contribution to a resilient plant system. Three systemic green products were able to stimulate hormonal signalling pathways against biotrophic organisms and effective combinations were possible with biological green products. This research shows the first proof-ofprinciple that in a young plant system with smart combining of green products infection of mildew spores can be prevented. Follow-up research in multiple cropping systems with longer cultivation periods have to indicate what the impact is on the disease development {{over a longer period of}} time under more commercial growing conditions. For the development of (early) indicators of plant resilience, it is clear that multiple measuring methods are needed at the same time, during a certain cultivation phase, because the germination and infection is dependent of several climate and plant factors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{analysis}} is presented on {{the perspectives of}} highly insulated greenhouses for extensively heated greenhouse crops. Three crops were used as an example, ranging from Antirrhinum, with a yearly heating demand of 4 m³ of natural gas equivalents per m² to strawberry, with 13 m³ of gas consumption per m² per year. If Antirrhinum would be grown in a double glazed, highly insulated greenhouse with an energy recuperating dehumidification system, the remaining heat demand will be almost zero. Growing strawberries in such a greenhouse reduces the gas consumption for heating down to 7 m³/(m² year). When generating this heat with a heat pump, only 21 kWh/(m² year) will be needed for heating. In all greenhouse sectors, a tendency towards an intensified production by using artificial illumination can be seen. Illumination has a much higher impact on energy consumption than heating, so insulation of greenhouses for extensively heated crops is of less importance than improving the transmissivity or developing better lighting systems. Besides energy for heating and lighting, greenhouses use {{a substantial amount of}} energy for soil disinfection. Here savings can be achieved by using biological disinfection, substrate systems or ozonized water. This project was funded by the research program ‘Kas als Energiebron’, the joined action and innovation program of the ministry of Economic affairs and <b>LTO</b> Glaskracht <b>Nederland...</b>|$|R
