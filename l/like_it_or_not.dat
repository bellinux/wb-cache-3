I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. <b>Like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none of us will soon forget.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether you <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} and poorly understood situations related to the charging of an error occurs when an outfielder misjudges the flight of a ball and allows the ball to drop out of his reach.

On that topic Bill Shannon, who was an official scorer for the New York Yankees, said [...] "That's a base hit whether we <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> As a practical matter, we don't charge errors on those plays. No one says that baseball is entirely fair." [...] Outfielders are generally charged with an error on a fly ball when they arrive at the ball's destination with sufficient time to make a catch with an ordinary effort, but simply miss the catch or drop the ball.|$|E

500|$|In 1927 Holst was {{commissioned}} by the New York Symphony Orchestra to write a symphony. Instead, he wrote an orchestral piece Egdon Heath, inspired by Thomas Hardy's Wessex. It was first performed in February 1928, a month after Hardy's death, at a memorial concert. By this time the public's brief enthusiasm for everything Holstian was waning, and the piece was not well received in New York. Olin Downes in The New York Times opined that [...] "the new score seemed long and undistinguished". The day after the American performance, Holst conducted the City of Birmingham Orchestra in the British premiere. The Times acknowledged the bleakness of the work but allowed that it matched Hardy's grim view of the world: [...] "Egdon Heath {{is not likely to}} be popular, but it says what the composer wants to say, whether we <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> and truth is one aspect of duty." [...] Holst had been distressed by hostile reviews of some of his earlier works, but he was indifferent to critical opinion of Egdon Heath, which he regarded as, in Adams's phrase, his [...] "most perfectly realized composition".|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is {{that we live in a}} time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E

On the topic, Rhimes elabroated, [...] "The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he knows what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." [...] Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. [...] Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, [...] "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me." [...] Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former [...] "off the hook" [...] for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. [...] "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But {{do you know how many}} packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E
