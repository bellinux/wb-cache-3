5|$|In {{the summer}} season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes {{during the winter}} months. Kommandøren was {{generally}} used as an express route ship, often carrying patients {{on their way to}} treatment. Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> at the {{beginning}} of her Senate career, Clinton kept a low profile during her early months and worked hard to familiarize herself with the culture and institutional history of the department. She met or spoke with all of the living former secretaries, and especially relied upon her close friendship with Madeleine Albright.|$|E

She tells them that she has hidden the money in seven {{different}} places across India. Jimmy and Pooja decide to run away with the money. The duo decide that Pooja should seduce Bachchan just <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> Jimmy. She tries to seduce him but finds out that they are each other's childhood loves, and they both fall in love. After recovering all of the money, Bachchan decides to leave with it, not knowing that Jimmy has replaced the money with stones.|$|E
25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E

Ayane was featured through Monty Oum's computer-animated fan series Dead Fantasy from the start. A fan mod also brought Ayane to Ultra Street Fighter IV, mapping her over Ibuki, and another removes Ayane's makeup in DOA5 to make her look more <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in DOA2.|$|E

[...] Over lunch with Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), Leslie seeks advice {{on how to deal with}} the press. [...] Leslie once again tells the documentary crew <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in the pilot that she previously had sex with Mark and seems to still harbor feelings for him. [...] The reporter, Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker) arrives the next day to interview Leslie, along with Ann (Rashida Jones) and Andy (Chris Pratt). [...] During the interview, Andy reveals he was drunk when he fell in the pit, much to the horror of Leslie and Ann, who were not previously aware of it.|$|E
500|$|During production, Bell and Menzel {{had to do}} a lot of {{recordings}} and re-recordings, and were required to be together in the same room when on the key emotional scenes between Anna and Elsa. [...] "We even got Kristen and Idina together for a song. That really helped elevate the song because they have a duet in the movie and it definitely helped drive that," [...] said producer Peter Del Vecho. Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made them really interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had to re-record some of the lines after giving birth, as her voice had deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as [...] "cool and weird and surreal and jarring", saying that she was really proud that Anna [...] "came out <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> that [...] let [...] do her like this." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Josh Tyrangiel of Time complimented the song's [...] "rubber-ball melodies that bounce around your head". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that unlike the usual seventh single release by an artist, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is one Rihanna's stronger releases {{and that it}} proves that she is ruling '08 much <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> '07. He went on to describe it as a [...] "fun-packed electro treat filled with sizzling beats and crazy vocal effects." [...] Fletcher further highlighted the song's strong intro hook {{and said that the}} chorus is her catchiest since [...] "Umbrella". Spence D of IGN felt that the track has an infectious [...] "Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum" [...] hook that sucks you into the detached electronic bounce of the track. Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music highlighted the song's [...] "insistent hook, sturdy beat and weaving, winding melody." [...] Fraser McAlpine from the BBC Music deemed the song's plus points to be Rihanna's icy whine, the frosty-rave chorus and the Eiffel 65-like refrain.|$|E
500|$|As {{the race}} for prom queen intensifies, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) begins campaigning against Quinn. She discovers that Quinn's first name is Lucy, and {{that she used to}} be an {{overweight}} outcast who had rhinoplasty before re-inventing herself and transferring to McKinley. Lauren attempts to sabotage Quinn's campaign by revealing her former image to the other students, but it backfires when Quinn's popularity actually increases amongst the girls like Lauren, encouraged by the idea of someone able to rise above such difficulties <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> and become popular. Lauren apologizes to Quinn, but Quinn commends her for her confidence and pride, and the two form a bond. Brittany shows off her shirt to Santana, and gives Santana a shirt reading [...] "Lebanese", believing that it reads [...] "Lesbian". Santana balks at wearing it, and the two argue; Brittany finally storms off saying that if Santana loved herself as much as Brittany loved her, she would put on the shirt and dance with her. The episode closes with the club, minus Santana, embracing their identities and performing [...] "Born This Way". During the song, Emma arrives wearing a T-shirt that acknowledges her own problems—it reads [...] "OCD"—and she and Will join the performance. Karofsky and Santana watch from the audience, with Santana wearing her [...] "Lebanese" [...] shirt.|$|E
500|$|Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News {{reported}} Jackson often lip syncs in concert; he wrote: [...] "Janet Jackson—one of pop's {{most notorious}} onstage lip-syncers—conceded... she uses 'some' taped vocals to augment her live vocals. But {{she refused to}} say what percentage of her concert 'voice' is taped {{and how much is}} live." [...] Michael MacCambridge of the Austin American-Statesman, who reviewed Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour, described lip-syncing as a [...] "moot point", stating [...] "Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles." [...] MacCambridge also observed [...] "it seemed unlikely that anyone—even a prized member of the First Family of Soul Music—could dance <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the '90s super concerts are expected to achieve." [...] Similarly, Chris Willman commented, [...] "even a classically trained vocalist would be hard-pressed to maintain any sort of level of volume—or, more appropriately, 'Control'—while bounding up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable, breakneck speed." [...] Critics observed that in the smaller scale of her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour, she forewent lip-syncing. Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated [...] "even at its breathiest, that delicate voice hasn't lost the laserlike precision." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Just imagine Mayor Emanuel had {{released}} the video in, say, November —without {{being forced to}} by a lawsuit.... But of course, he didn't do the right thing. He buried the video. He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, for once in his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{running in}} a trial at Warwick Farm, Winx began her third season by {{starting}} favourite for the Group 2 Theo Marks Stakes over 1300 metres at Rosehill on 12 September and won by a head from the outsider Sons of John. Three weeks later she contested the 150th running of the Epsom Handicap over 1600 metres at Randwick. Starting favourite against thirteen opponents, she overcame serious interference on the final turn to win by {{two and a half}} lengths from the six-year-old gelding Ecuador. Her weight of [...] was the highest ever carried to victory in the race by a female. Speaking after the race, her trainer Chris Waller commented [...] "For her to pick herself up after that and put herself back in the race before bursting through <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> it was pretty special. Her winning strike rate separates her from a lot of horses. She overcomes barrier draws, track conditions and distances. She had a long three-year-old year. She has been everywhere and she is still firing. For her to come back as a four-year-old is pretty special." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was around}} this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, {{particularly}} on her older songs; the singer later admitted to feeling the same way, explaining that [...] "I'd go to hit a note {{and there was nothing}} there". While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she has been described as [...] "one of the world's last great smokers"), Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were due to other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio. In an interview in 2004, she denied that [...] "my terrible habits" [...] {{had anything to do with}} her more limited range and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that in her opinion her voice became a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in her youth.|$|E

2500|$|Just <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{before on}} her {{previous}} projects Sugar & Spice and Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1, Harrison served as executive producer for K.I.S.S which entailed her scouting the producers, songwriters, arranging the album track listing, and {{keeping track of}} the accounting. Her fifth studio album Sugar & Spice was catered more to Japan's distinct sound and market, but approaching K.I.S.S., she wanted to make a classic Mýa album even if it meant digging deeper into her pockets. K.I.S.S. has a balance of mid-tempos, up-tempos, slow jams and great production. [...] "As fun as this album is, there's also lots of substance to be discovered lyrically, without getting bored or depressed", she described. In an interview with 4Eight Media, she said, [...] "The creative process was a combination of including songs that I had in my archive for years in addition to travelling across the U.S. and Jamaica to work with different producers and artists. She chose the songs that best worked together sonically & arranged the track listing of the album accordingly." [...] Harrison used a few songs on the album that have existed in her archive {{for a couple of years}} that finally found the appropriate place to reside. The entire album with the new material took her about 5 months to assemble & complete. Between October 2010 & February 2011.|$|E
