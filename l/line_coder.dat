The feedback also implies data dependency which voids usual par-allel implementations, further exacerbating the throughput problem.

This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a metal rod or sprool at one end, from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets. To encourage the fish to bite, the boats had to be held still by their rowers, which required great skill in the Firth's unpredictable currents. The island was noted for its native type of boat, the Stroma yole, which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{validity}} and reliability of distance data measured by global positioning system (GPS) units sampling at 1 and 5 Hz during movement patterns common to team sports. Methods: Twenty elite Australian Football players each wearing two GPS devices (MinimaxX, Catapult, Australia) completed straight line movements (10, 20, 40 m) at various speeds (walk, jog, stride, sprint), changes of direction (COD) courses of two different frequencies (gradual and tight), and a team sport running simulation circuit. Position and speed data were collected by the GPS devices at 1 and 5 Hz. Distance validity was assessed using the standard error of the estimate (± 90 % confidence intervals [CI]). Reliability was estimated using typical error (TE) ± 90 % CI (expressed as coefficient of variation [CV]). Results: Measurement accuracy decreased as speed of locomotion increased in both straight <b>line</b> and the <b>COD</b> courses. Difference between criterion and GPS measured distance ranged from 9. 0 % to 32. 4 %. A higher sampling rate improved validity regardless of distance and locomotion in the straight <b>line,</b> <b>COD</b> and simulated running circuit trials. The reliability improved as distance traveled increased but decreased as speed increased. Total distance over the simulated running circuit exhibited the lowest variation (CV 3. 6 %) while sprinting over 10 m demonstrated the highest (CV 77. 2 % at 1 Hz).

40|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} insoluble mineral found in plants and its crystals {{have been reported in}} more than 200 plant families. In the barrel medic Medicago truncatula Gaertn., these crystals accumulate predominantly in a sheath surrounding secondary veins of leaves. Mutants of M. truncatula with decreased levels of calcium oxalate crystals were used to assess the defensive role of this mineral against insects. Caterpillar larvae of the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Hübner show a clear feeding preference for tissue from calcium oxalate-defective (<b>cod)</b> mutant <b>lines</b> <b>cod</b> 5 and cod 6 in choice test comparisons with wild-type M. truncatula. Compared to their performance on mutant lines, larvae feeding on wild-type plants with abundant calcium oxalate crystals suffer significantly reduced growth and increased mortality. Induction of wound-responsive genes appears to be normal in cod 5 and cod 6, indicating that these lines are not deficient in induced insect defenses. Electron micrographs of insect mouthparts indicate that the prismatic crystals in M. truncatula leaves act as physical abrasives during feeding. Food utilization measurements show that, after consumption, calcium oxalate also interferes with the conversion of plant material into insect biomass during digestion. In contrast to their detrimental effects on a chewing insect, calcium oxalate crystals do not negatively affect the performance of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, a sap-feeding insect with piercing-sucking mouthparts. The results confirm a long-held hypothesis for the defensive function of these crystals and point to the potential value of genes controlling crystal formation and localization in crop plants...|$|R

Two sets of experiments were carried out. In the first experimental set, {{the influences of}} the organic loading rate (OLR), the fluidization level (FL) and the particle diameter of the natural zeolite (Dp) were evaluated. This experimental set was carried out at an OLR from 2 to 5 g COD (chemical oxygen demand) /Id, at FL 20 % and 40 % and with Dp {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm (reactor 1) and of 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm (reactor 2). It was demonstrated that OLR and FL had a slight influence on COD removal, whereas they had a strong influence on the methane production rate. The COD removal was slightly higher for the highest particle diameter used. The second experimental set was carried out at an OLR from 3 to 20 g COD/I d with 25 % of fluidization and Dp in the above-mentioned ranges for reactors I and 2. The {{performance of}} the two reactors was similar; no significant differences were found.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of velocity fields in early to late M-type hydrodynamic stellar atmosphere models. These velocities will be expressed in classical terms of micro- and macroturbulent velocities for usage in 1 D spectral synthesis. The M-star model parameters range between logg of 3. 0 – 5. 0 and Teff of 2500 K – 4000 K. We characterize the Teff- and logg-dependence of the hydrodynamical velocity fields in these models with a binning method, and for the determination of micro-turbulent velocities, the Curve of Growth method is used. The macro-turbulent velocities are obtained by convolutions with Gaussian profiles. Velocity fields in M-stars strongly depend on logg and Teff. Their velocity amplitudes increase with decreasing logg and increasing Teff. The 3 D hydrodynamical and 1 D macro-turbulent velocities range from ∼ 100 m/s for cool high gravity models to ∼ 800 m/s– 1000 m/s for hot models or models with low logg. The micro-turbulent velocities range {{in the order of}} ∼ 100 m/s for cool models, to ∼ 600 m/s for hot or low logg models.

40|$|Full {{displacement}} {{and stress}} fields in a two-dimensional elastic solid with multiple interacting cracks is constructed in an approximate way, in elementary functions. It {{is done by}} approximating the actual displacement discontinuity (COD) on each crack, in each of modes I and II, by {{a product of the}} ellipse corresponding to an isolated crack and a quadratic polynomial. The polynomial's coefficients, that reflect crack interactions, are chosen to match the SIFs and the average tractions on cracks (quantities found, for example, by a simple method of analysis of crack interactions; Kachanov, M. Elastic solids with many cracks: a simple method of analysis. International Journal of Solids and Structures, 23, 1987. 23 - 43). We then use this approximated CODs in the representation of the displacement field in the solid in terms of integrals over crack <b>lines,</b> with <b>CODs</b> as kernels. The constructed field differs from the actual one by the field generated by such traction distributions on cracks that have zero averages and produce zero stress intensity factors. The accuracy of the suggested method depends on the configuration, but, generally, remains good at spacings between cracks that are substantially smaller than the crack lengths.

40|$|Responsible sheries {{management}} involve, {{among other}} things, operations to avoid catches of juvenile sh. Technical measures of shing gears to exclude small sh are thus generally regulated. Knowledge {{and control over}} the size selection characteristics of the shing gear are therefore required, and the escaping sh should survive for the size selection to be a meaningful action. This thesis consists of four papers that deal with size selectivity and escape mortality of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aegle nus) and saithe (Pollachius virens) in the Barents Sea bottom trawl sheries. Our {{studies show that the}} trawl ground gears contribute to the overall size selectivity of bottom trawls. Netting bags were rigged underneath a commercial trawl with a rockhopper gear, along the shing line, to collect sh that passed beneath the trawl. Approximately one third of the cod, a quarter of the haddock and seven percent of saithe available to the trawl escaped below the shing <b>line.</b> <b>Cod</b> escape rates were highly length dependent with an estimated length at 50 % retention (L 50) of 38. 5 cm and selection range (L 75 − L 25 = SR) of 34. 1 cm. Length dependence was less pronounced for haddock, and the escape rate of saithe was not length dependent. Some of the sh had been overrun by the gear as evidenced by scale abrasions and video observations. The size selection of a bottom trawl for cod with the mandatory con guration of a sorting grid with 55 mm bar spacings and a 135 mm diamond mesh codend was compared to that of conventional codends of 135 and 155 mm mesh sizes. Previous indirect comparisons have indicated sharper selection (narrower SR) for sorting grids than conventional codends. Based on these comparisons, the use of grids was made mandatory in the Barents Sea bottom trawl shery for cod. Our experimental studies demonstrated no evidence that the grid and mesh combination has sharper selection than conventional codends. The introduction of the grid corresponded to approx. 20 mm increase in mesh size, from 135 mm to 155 mm. The L 50 for the grid declined with increasing catch rates, but grid selection appeared less affected by seasonal variations in girth and sh condition than mesh selectivity. Mortality of cod, saithe and haddock that escaped through meshes and sorting grids were studied in four eld experiments. Cod and saithe mortality were negligible, suggesting that selection devices serve their purpose as conservation tools regarding these species. Haddock mortality was higher and inversely related to sh length. Their mortality could neither been shown to depend upon selection device nor shing intensity. There was, however, a considerable variation between replicates masking any such possible effects. It is concluded that the trawl passage, but not mesh and grid penetration is the ii primary cause of mortality. Injury analysis supports this suggestion. The mortality estimates were confounded by methodological problems. Potential sources of experimentally induced mortality were identi ed throughout the experiments and the methods subsequently improved. The confounding methodological effects are accounted for in a model describing haddock escape mortality...|$|R

At the point where it runs {{parallel}} to runway of the former RAF Dishforth at Norton-le-Clay, it joins {{the route of}} the Roman road Dere Street. The road becomes the parish boundary between Marton-le-Moor and Dishforth. At Dishforth, the road leaves Dere Street and forms part of junction 49 of the A1(M). The A1 junction was planned in the 1970s to be the northern terminus of the A6183, a motorway-standard road that bypassed Leeds to the west from Kirkhamgate, north-west of Wakefield. The scheme was eventually condensed into the A1-M1 motorway link road and the improvement of the A1 to Dishforth. The A168 becomes the main route from the A1 to Teesside, joining the short section of the A168(M), and a trunk road. The former route went through Dishforth, to the south. The South of Topcliffe and Asenby By-pass, including Dishforth by-pass section was built in 1970, connecting with the A1 at the Dishforth Roundabout. At Asenby, the A167 leaves to the left, which is the former route of the A168, and the A168 bypasses Asenby and Topcliffe, crossing the River Swale, and consequently entering the district of Hambleton. The Topcliffe and Asenby By-pass was built in the late 1960s. There is a left turn for Topcliffe, the A167, also for RAF Topcliffe (which is still operational), and access to the east for Dalton and the former RAF Dalton. RAF Dishforth, Dalton, and Topcliffe were all used by No. 6 Group RCAF during the Second World War. It rejoins the former route. The South of Thirsk By-pass to north of Topcliffe and Asenby By-pass section opened in the late 1960s. In the parish of Topcliffe, there is a left turn for Sowerby, the B1448, the former route of the A168. The road becomes part of the Thirsk bypass, and at Sowerby crosses the East Coast Main <b>Line,</b> then <b>Cod</b> Beck. At Pudding Pie Hill it meets the A170 at a grade-separated junction, where the road continues as the A19 to Teesside. The improvements from the A1 to Thirsk in the late 1960s originally included classifying that section as the A19, not the A168. The Thirsk by-pass opened as the A19 in September 1972.|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{processing}} of large data sets {{is an area}} that received much attention from researchers and practitioners over the last few years. In this context, several proposals exist that leverage the observation that data sets evolve over time, and as such there is often a substantial overlap between the input to consecutive runs of a data processing job. This allows the programmers of these systems to devise an efficient logic to update the output upon an input change. However, most of these systems lack compatibility existing models and require the programmer to implement an application-specific dynamic algorithm, which increases algorithm and code complexity. In this chapter, we describe our previous work on building a platform called Incoop, which allows for running MapReduce computations incrementally and transparently. Incoop detects changes between two files that are used as inputs to consecutive MapReduce jobs, and efficiently propagates those changes until the new output is produced. The design of Incoop is based on memoizing the results of previously run tasks, and reusing these results whenever possible. Doing this efficiently introduces several technical challenges that are overcome with novel concepts, such as a large-scale storage system that efficiently computes deltas between two inputs, a Contraction phase to break up the work of the Reduce phase, and an affinitybased scheduling algorithm. This chapter presents the motivation and design of Incoop, as well as a complete evaluation using several application benchmarks.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the escapement under the fishing <b>line</b> for <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) with the conventional rock-hopper gear and a new type of gear termed semicircular spreading gear (SCSG). The trials were conducted during November 2014 and February 2015 in the Barents Sea under varying environmental conditions. In order to catch the escapees a retainer bag was attached to the fishing line of the trawl. Multi model averaging was applied for calculating the efficiency, i. e. escapement rate for all length groups. A highly significant difference in the rate of escapement between the two types of ground-gears was found. Summarized for all length groups above 65 cm, 14 % of the cod escaped under the fishing line of the rock-hopper gear, and 5 % under the SCSG during the trials in November 2014. This resulted in an efficiency improvement of 11 %, and escapement reduction of 67 %. In February 2015 the escapement was 5 % for the rock-hopper, and 2 % for the SCSG, resulting in an efficiency improvement of 3 %, and an escapement reduction of 57 %. The overall improvement of efficiency for cod is thus 8 %, and a reduction in escapement of 63 %. The escapement of haddock for all lengths above 62 cm was estimated to 7 % for the rock-hopper gear, and 1 % for the SCSG, implying an efficiency improvement of 6 %, and an escapement reduction of 85 %. Based on the present data no correlation was found between the rate of escapement and fish density, ambient light intensity, nor artificial light. However, a positive correlation was obtained between temperature and the escapement rate for some length groups. Over the recent years the tendency in the bottom trawl fisheries has been increasing the trawl dimension in order to increase efficiency, with subsequent increase in fuel consumption and emission, as well as possibly increased negative bottom impact. The demonstrated improvement of the SCSG compared to the conventional rock-hopper gear entails multiple advantages such as increased efficiency due to reduced escapement, reduced fuel consumption and emission, and reduced negative bottom impact. By introducing a more efficient ground-gear this study provides an improvement from the current situation that is believed to be of importance both from fisheries and environmental point of view, as well as for the accuracy of the trawl surveys for stock assessment purpose.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to investigate: a) the {{potential}} involvement of the fish lateral line system in hearing at 250 Hz and b) the possible regeneration of the inner ear hair cells in the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The inner ear and lateral line system of the Atlantic cod were inactivated using ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics by injection (gentamicin) or bath (gentamicin and streptomycin), respectively. Hearing thresholds were measured in the fish using the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) technique at 10, respectively 17 - 20 days following antibiotic treatment. Results were compared between groups of individuals i) with inner ear damage, ii) with lateral line system altered, iii) placebo (immersion in fresh sea water) and iv) control. The sound stimuli applied were series of 2000 five-cycle (2 - 1 - 2) 250 Hz tone bursts delivered using a Brüel & Kjær (Nærum, Denmark) loudspeaker. ABRs were measured using a filter set at 30 - 3000 Hz, a gain of 100 000 and visual interpretation using the Bio-Logic AEP software. Sound stimulus level was reduced until threshold was attained. To check the tissue status of the inner ear and lateral line system, hair cells from sensory maculae were visualized using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ten days after treatment, hearing thresholds of placebo and lateral <b>line</b> damaged <b>cods</b> did not differ from controls fish (p = 0. 387 and p = 0. 095, respectively), whereas the fish that received intravenous gentamicin injection had significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared to controls (p < 0. 0001). SEM analyses further demonstrated that, 10 days following antibiotic treatment, cod inner ear hair cells were damaged, as well as lateral line hair cells and more particularly in the case of canal neuromasts. There was no hearing effect or microscopic tissue damage in untreated fish. From the 17 th day after treatment, ABR measurements showed that some of the gentamicin treated fish had regained hearing thresholds comparable to the control cods (p = 0. 535), and this was associated with an apparent regeneration of hair cells in the sensory maculae of their inner ear. This study indicates a capacity for inner ear hair cell regeneration in Atlantic cod, and illustrates the advantages of the ABR-method for investigation of fish hearing after intervention on the inner ear, and during the hair cell regeneration process. The present work further suggests that the lateral line system is not involved in cod hearing at 250 Hz. Peer reviewe...|$|R

It can extract data along arbitrary lines (such as between atoms) as 1 D output. C 2 x is able to convert between several common formats for describing molecules and crystals, including the. cell format of Castep. It can construct supercells, reduce cells to their primitive form, and add specified k-point meshes. It uses the spglib library to report symmetry information, which it can add to. cell files. C 2 x is a command-line utility, so is readily included in scripts. It is available under the GPL and can be obtained from [URL] It {{is believed to be the}} only open-source code which can read Castep's. check files, so it will have utility in other projects.

40|$|The Baltic herring Clupea harengus membras, a local {{subspecies}} of the North Atlantic herring {{which had}} reached the Baltic Sea nearly 5, 000 years ago, {{is probably the most}} important food fish (for salting) both in the coastal regions as well as everywhere else in Estonia. The need to determine the exact time of fishing has inspired nearly 30 % of its popular names, mainly on the basis of orientation to phenological phenomena or popular festivals. Vendace/whitefish? Coregonus albula and rudds Rutilus rutilus and Scardinius erythrophthalmus, as common fresh-water fishes, are mentioned mostly in relation to omens. According to a legend the smelt Osmerus eperlanus smelled of horsemeat, as the fish were believed to have been born of drowned horses. According to ichthyologists, reports stating that the freshwater form of this species usually found in Lake Peipus had also been discovered in Estonia's largest inland-lake (Lake Võrtsjärv) date back to the 19 th century. By the mid- 20 th century the species had disappeared from Lake Võrtsjärv. A popular belief accuses the competing Russian fishers who had used magic to make the fish disappear (Orthodox peoples ate primarily fish during the Lent). The Baltic cod Gadus morhua callarias was traditionally caught with trawl-lines, as suggest the words of the spelling song in the article. The making of <b>cod</b> <b>line</b> was also associated with magic. Similar to the pike, the Baltic cod was considered a mythological being of the underworld (it has been called a one-eyed hog, piglet, etc.). The outward appearance of the fish has become to be thought as resembling the face of the Evil One (cf. Loorits 1926 : US 95). Various long-jawed species of fish have been popularly called 'windfish'. In coastal villages people used to hang the windfish outside {{and use it as a}} windsock. The coming of garpike Belone belone to the coastal waters before the Midsummer Day indicates the beginning of the Baltic herring's fishing season. Sturgeon Acipenser sturio was once considered an important food fish in Estonia, both for its flesh as well as roe. The collection of folklore at the second half of the 19 th century began too late to find reports on this wholly agreeable species. Stylised figures of two sturgeons were depicted on the blazon of Narva town, and the 17 th century öre coined in Narva. Remarkably, the popular name of the fish on the northern coast of Estonia was samb. According to the Finnish legends, sampo-fish was a giant mythical fish. And the Finno-Ugric myth about the three primordial bearers of the Earth is associated to the three sturgeons of the rivers. We might assume that the mythological concept which was inspired by the huge dimensions of the fish rather than particular species or family, concerned also other large fish (pike, sheatfish). The Russian word som and the Latvian word sams denoting sheatfish, not sturgeon, suggest the same. A legend from South-East Estonia concerning weatherfish Misgurnus fossilis or Cobitis fossilis, tells a story, where one of the characters, according to the register, was a snake (cf. Aa US 61). The Evil One tempted the rat to chew a hole into [Noah's] Ark, but the weatherfish closed the opening with its tail. There upon God rewarded weatherfish by naming them the best of fishes. A belief report from the northern coast of Lake Peipus contends that weatherfish could turn into snakes. And as weatherfish (much like eel) resemble snakes in many ways, the folkloric transmittance from one species to another is quite logical and expected...|$|R
