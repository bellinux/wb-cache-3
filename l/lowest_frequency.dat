Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E

25|$|When the {{original}} sound sources are perfectly periodic, the note consists of several related sine waves (which mathematically add to each other) called the fundamental and the harmonics, partials, or overtones. The sounds have harmonic frequency spectra. The <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> present is the fundamental, {{and is the}} frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. The overtones vibrate faster than the fundamental, but must vibrate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency for the total wave to be exactly the same each cycle. Real instruments are close to periodic, but the frequencies of the overtones are slightly imperfect, so {{the shape of the}} wave changes slightly over time.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the y-axis is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a band-pass filter removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, Heinrich Hertz {{observed}} that when light with sufficient frequency hits a metallic surface, it emits electrons. In 1902, Philipp Lenard {{discovered that the}} maximum possible energy of an ejected electron {{is related to the}} frequency of the light, not to its intensity: if the frequency is too low, no electrons are ejected regardless of the intensity. Strong beams of light toward the red end of the spectrum might produce no electrical potential at all, while weak beams of light toward the violet end of the spectrum would produce higher and higher voltages. The <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> of light that can cause electrons to be emitted, called the threshold frequency, is different for different metals. This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that the electron's energy should be proportional to the intensity of the radiation. So when physicists first discovered devices exhibiting the photoelectric effect, they initially expected that a higher intensity of light would produce a higher voltage from the photoelectric device.|$|E

25|$|The {{factors and}} {{processes}} {{that influence the}} rate and spatial distribution of sediment accretion within the salt marsh are numerous. Sediment deposition can occur when marsh species provide a surface for the sediment to adhere to, followed by deposition onto the marsh surface when the sediment flakes off at low tide. The amount of sediment adhering to salt marsh species {{is dependent on the}} type of marsh species, the proximity of the species to the sediment supply, the amount of plant biomass, and the elevation of the species. For example, in a study of the Eastern Chongming Island and Jiuduansha Island tidal marshes {{at the mouth of the}} Yangtze River, China, the amount of sediment adhering to the species Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Scirpus mariqueter decreased with distance from the highest levels of suspended sediment concentrations (found at the marsh edge bordering tidal creeks or the mudflats); decreased with those species at the highest elevations, which experienced the <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> and depth of tidal inundations; and increased with increasing plant biomass. Spartina alterniflora, which had the most sediment adhering to it, may contribute >10% of the total marsh surface sediment accretion by this process.|$|E
25|$|As {{electric}} fish mature, some taxa develop {{differences in}} EOD {{between males and}} females (i.e. sexual dimorphism). Typically, male electric fish have lower EOD frequency and longer EOD duration than females; among males, the dominant and largest fish generally possesses the <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency.</b> For example, measurements made in Sternopygus marucus (Hagedorn, 1986) showed that males usually generate EOD at about 80Hz, while females generate EOD at around 150Hz. Such differences in EOD between the sexes {{can be traced back to}} changes in the action potential in electrocytes. As electric fish mature from the juvenile stage, male fish grow larger with longer and thicker tails, which might result in larger electric organs that generate lower frequency EODs. One of the physiological factors that have been proven to contribute to the sexual dimorphism of EODs is the level of teleost hormone- androgen 11-keto-testosterone (11-KT) and estrogen. Experiments shown that by injecting 11-KT into female electric fishes, not only did their EOD waveforms and frequencies become closer to that of the males, but their tuberous electroreceptors were also modified to be able to detect signals according to the newly transformed EOD properties. However, when estrogen was applied, the EODs of male electric fish gradually became closer to the female EODs.|$|E

Some subwoofers, such as [...] "The Abyss" [...] by MartinLogan for example can reproduce pitches down to around 18Hz (which is about the pitch of the lowest rumbling notes on a huge pipe organ with -16Hz-bass pipes) to 120Hz (±3dB). Nevertheless, even though the Abyss subwoofer can go down to 18Hz, its <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> and maximum SPL with a limit of 10% distortion is 35.5Hz and 79.8dB at 2 meters.

In the present work, the mental performance of students exposed to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises at low and high levels (45 & 65 dB) were studied. Additionally, other factors such as annoyance, sensitivity to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise and hearing status of participants were considered. Materials and Methods: After generating <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises required for the study, a pilot study was conducted. Then, 54 students participated in the main study after preliminary tests. Their mental performances were evaluated with standard psychological tests while they were exposed to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises at 45 and 65 dBA. Results: The results showed that noise annoyance and <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise sensitivity do not have a significant correlation with age and sex. The results also revealed that, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise at 65 dB can decrease concentration (P= 0. 003) and increase response time (P= 0. 039) of performance in comparison with <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise at 45 dB. On the other hand, reference noise at 65 dB can increase speed (P< 0. 001) of performance in comparison with reference noise at 45 dB.
