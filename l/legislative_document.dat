40|$|Previous {{disaster}} management studies allude {{to the problems}} of coordination and the difficulties that may be associated with the implementation of recovery programmes in New Zealand. These studies have also indicated opportunities for improving the current recovery and reconstruction framework in advance of a major disaster. They have shown that much existing legislation were not drafted to cope with wide-scale devastations and were not developed to operate under the conditions that will inevitably prevail {{in the aftermath of a}} severe disaster. This thesis therefore explores improvements that could be made to legislative provisions so that they facilitate large-scale recovery management in New Zealand. Three <b>legislative</b> <b>documents</b> are in view: Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Act, Resource Management Act (RMA) and Building Act (BA). The research investigations involved qualitative research methodology using multi-methods to determine the practical implication of implementing current reconstruction arrangement under these <b>legislative</b> <b>documents.</b> The methods employed include: interviews, document analysis, focus group study, surveys, and the use of subject matter experts for research verification. Results show that the three <b>legislative</b> <b>documents</b> may become sources of vulnerability in post disaster reconstruction because of their influence on the timely achievement of recovery objectives. The impediments posed by these <b>legislative</b> <b>documents</b> are mainly in the form of procedural constraints; ambiguities in rights and responsibilities for recovery management; and deficiencies in the intents and purposes of the <b>legislative</b> <b>documents.</b> More general results show that pre-planning the management of disaster resources; and collaborative arrangements for response and recovery programmes are a pre-cursor to effective and efficient management of reconstruction in New Zealand. The research concludes by providing useful recommendations that are specific to the three <b>legislative</b> <b>documents</b> and other general recommendations. It is hoped the implementation of these recommendations could improve the robustness of the current reconstruction framework so that it is able to cater for the complex needs of rebuilding for resilience in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{development}} of public policy in relation to single mothers from 1989 to 2015. Specifically, it focuses on the <b>legislative</b> <b>documents,</b> which are related directly to single mothers, which <b>legislative</b> <b>documents</b> are affecting them, how they deal with their situation and what benefits they bring to them. The paper also describes the evolution of these documents over time, specifically from 1989 to 2015. It concerns also the legislation which was accepted or cancelled and the whole background of these documents origin. The core of the empirical part is analysis of <b>legislative</b> <b>documents</b> affecting single mothers and their families and analysis of stenographic records of Parliament's meetings. The outlined development is explained in the context of theory of social constructions of target populations, depoliticization theory and path dependence theory. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find out how the situation of single mothers has developed since 1989 and whether it is improving or getting worse. The assumption is there has been a transformation since 1989, from socialist greater protection on the labor market and greater social support to extinction of single mothers as a specific target group of social policy...|$|R

The PMR side argues that, since this law was the only <b>legislative</b> <b>document</b> binding Transnistria to Moldova, there is neither historical nor legal basis for Moldova's claims over the territories on the left bank of the Dniester.

This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights. To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that [...] "to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country."

When {{asked in a}} press conference how Francis' work related to Familiaris consortio, which states that remarried divorcees must live [...] "as brother and sister" [...] in order to take communion, Cardinal Schönborn said that the former builds on the earlier work: [...] "there is no change, but there is development". Some traditionalists, notably Kazhakstani Bishop Athanasius Schneider and British advocacy group Voice of the Family, have criticized Francis' exhortation. Voice of the Family has called on him to [...] "recognise the grave errors in the recently published Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, in particular those sections which will lead to the desecration of the Holy Eucharist and to the harming of our children, and to withdraw the Apostolic Exhortation with immediate effect." [...] Edward N. Peters, a referendary of the Apostolic Signatura, wrote that Amoris laetitia [...] "is not a <b>legislative</b> <b>document,</b> it contains no legislative or authentic interpretative language, and it does not discuss Canon 915."

5000|$|Thomas {{is a tax}} protester, {{and one of his}} {{arguments}} is that he did not need to file tax returns because the sixteenth amendment {{is not part of the}} constitution. It was not properly ratified, Thomas insists, repeating the argument of W. Benson & M. Beckman, The Law That Never Was (1985). Benson and Beckman review the documents concerning the states' ratification of the sixteenth amendment and conclude that only four states ratified the sixteenth amendment; they insist that the official promulgation of that amendment by Secretary of State Knox in 1913 is therefore void.Benson and Beckman did not discover anything; they rediscovered something that Secretary Knox considered in 1913. Thirty-eight states ratified the sixteenth amendment, and thirty-seven sent formal instruments of ratification to the Secretary of State. (Minnesota notified the Secretary orally, and additional states ratified later; we consider only those Secretary Knox considered.) Only four instruments repeat the language of the sixteenth amendment exactly as Congress approved it. The others contain errors of diction, capitalization, punctuation, and spelling. The text Congress transmitted to the states was: [...] "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration." [...] Many of the instruments neglected to capitalize [...] "States", and some capitalized other words instead. The instrument from Illinois had [...] "remuneration" [...] in place of [...] "enumeration"; the instrument from Missouri substituted [...] "levy" [...] for [...] "lay"; the instrument from Washington had [...] "income" [...] not [...] "incomes"; others made similar blunders.Thomas insists that because the states did not approve exactly the same text, the amendment did not go into effect. Secretary Knox considered this argument. The Solicitor of the Department of State drew up a list of the errors in the instruments and - taking into account both the triviality of the deviations and the treatment of earlier amendments that had experienced more substantial problems - advised the Secretary that he was authorized to declare the amendment adopted. The Secretary did so.Although Thomas urges us to take the view of several state courts that only agreement on the literal text may make a legal document effective, the Supreme Court follows the [...] "enrolled bill rule". If a <b>legislative</b> <b>document</b> is authenticated in regular form by the appropriate officials, the court treats that document as properly adopted. Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 36 L.Ed. 294, 12 S.Ct. 495 (1892). The principle is equally applicable to constitutional amendments. See Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 66 L.Ed. 505, 42 S.Ct. 217 (1922), which treats as conclusive the declaration of the Secretary of State that the nineteenth amendment had been adopted. In United States v. Foster, 789 F.2d. 457, 462-463, n.6 (7th Cir. 1986), we relied on Leser, as well as the inconsequential nature of the objections in the face of the 73-year acceptance of the effectiveness of the sixteenth amendment, to reject a claim similar to Thomas's. See also Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 83 L. Ed. 1385, 59 S. Ct. 972 (1939) (questions about ratification of amendments may be nonjusticiable). Secretary Knox declared that enough states had ratified the sixteenth amendment. The Secretary's decision is not transparently defective. We need not decide when, if ever, such a decision may be reviewed in order to know that Secretary Knox's decision is now beyond review. United States v. Thomas ...|$|E
