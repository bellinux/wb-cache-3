50|$|Central Europe {{contains}} the continent's earliest railway systems, whose greatest expansion {{was recorded in}} Austro-Hungarian and German territories between 1860-1870s. By the mid-19th century Berlin, Vienna, and Buda/Pest were focal points for network lines connecting industrial areas of Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia and Lower Austria with the Baltic (Kiel, Szczecin) and Adriatic (Rijeka, Trieste). Rail infrastructure in Central Europe remains the densest in the world. Railway density, with total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> <b>operated</b> (km) per 1,000 km2, is {{the highest in the}} Czech Republic (198.6), Poland (121.0), Slovenia (108.0), Germany (105.5), Hungary (98.7), Slovakia (73.9) and Croatia (72.5). when compared with most of Europe {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|R

50|$|Prior to {{the partial}} {{suspension}} of services by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, all trains originated from Aoba-dōri Station, with most running to Tagajō or Higashi-Shiogama. Local trains and rapid service trains that ran the entire <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>operated</b> at 30-minute intervals. When the line was fully recovered in 2015, rapid services were switched to the route via the Senseki-Tōhoku Line. Therefore, under the 2015 timetable, the section between Aoba-dōri and Takagimachi is served only by local trains.|$|R
50|$|Tension blocks are single-sheave blocks {{located at}} the lower end of the arbor guide track, beneath the arbor. The <b>operating</b> <b>line</b> is reeved through the tension block from the bottom of the arbor through the rope lock.

50|$|A short <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a power <b>line</b> (less than 80 km) can be {{approximated}} with {{a resistance}} {{in series with}} an inductance and ignoring the shunt admittances. This value is not the total impedance <b>of</b> the <b>line,</b> but rather the series impedance per unit <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>line.</b> For a longer <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> (80-250 km), a shunt capacitance {{is added to the}} model.
