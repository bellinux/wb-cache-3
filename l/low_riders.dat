5000|$|One memorable {{and still}} alive trend along Whittier Boulevard is the usage and showings of lowriders. [...] It {{has been said}} that East Los Angeles, {{specifically}} on Whittier Boulevard {{was one of the few}} first places that <b>low</b> <b>riders</b> began to appear around World War II and up until now, there are still low-rider showings along Whittier Boulevard, or anywhere in East Los Angeles. Drivers would compete against each other and hope to win the other driver’s car, known as [...] "hopping for pink slips.” [...] The street itself became very popular because it became a place for <b>low</b> <b>riders</b> to come together and the locals would cruise up and down the streets. To this day lowriders are still being driven and meet ups occur, where those who still have cars and want to showcase them come together at parks, parking lots, etc. anywhere they find place and come in groups.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Low</b> <b>riders</b> are {{specifically}} designed to be mounted on a specific kind of fork.Touring bicycles usually have a front fork {{with one or two}} threaded eyelets for M5 bolts on the front dropout on each side. These are for mounting fenders and/or luggage carrier. Another mid-fork eyelet [...] "braze-on" [...] is positioned 160 to 175 mm above it for mounting a low rider front luggage carrier. [...] There is no established standard for the position of the mid-fork eyelet. Most <b>low</b> <b>riders</b> are adjustable to compensate for this.Some forks have mid-fork eyelets on the inside as well as outside to provide mounting of some specialized carriers such as the Tubus Duo.For bicycles that do not have these eyelets or [...] "braze-ons", various alternatives exist. Some of these {{come in the form of}} [...] "U-Bolts", clamps, or some sort of clamp-on eyelet (see Tubus Aluminum Alloy Fork Mounting Kit) When installing carriers, a drop of thread locking compound is advised to ensure that the screws do not loosened from vibrations under load.|$|E
