5000|$|The known {{particles}} {{with strange}} quarks are unstable because the strange quark is {{heavier than the}} up and down quarks, so strange particles, such as the <b>Lambda</b> <b>particle,</b> which contains an up, down, and strange quark, always lose their strangeness, by decaying via the weak interaction to lighter particles containing only up and down quarks. But states with a larger number of quarks might not suffer from this instability. This is the [...] "strange matter hypothesis" [...] of Bodmer [...] and Witten. According to this hypothesis, when a large enough number of quarks are collected together, the lowest energy state is one which has roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, namely a strangelet. This stability would occur because of the Pauli exclusion principle; having three types of quarks, rather than two as in normal nuclear matter, allows more quarks to be placed in lower energy levels.|$|E

50|$|The first strangeness {{signature}} {{of a possible}} quark-gluon formation was presented in May 1990 by the CERN-NA35 experimental collaboration at the Quark Matter meeting in Menton, France These results on Antilambda formation in S-S reaction shown in the figure indicate a significant enhancement of the production of this antimatter particle comprising one antistrange quark as well as antiup and antidown quarks. All three constituents of the <b>Lambda</b> <b>particle</b> are newly produced in the reaction. The expected no-quark-gluon plasma production yield is shown {{at the bottom of}} the figure.

One of the most accessible signatures would be the relative Kaon yield ratio. A possible structure has been predicted, and indeed, an unexpected structure is seen in the ratio of particles comprising the positive kaon K (comprising anti s-quarks and up-quark) and positive pion particles, seen in the figure (solid symbols). The rise and fall (square symbols) of the ratio has been reported by the CERN NA49.

In the present study, we evaluated a chemical coupling strategy for displaying human holotransferrin as a targeting molecule on the surface of phage <b>lambda</b> <b>particles</b> for specifically delivering green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoding gene into a human cell line. Methods Human holotransferrin was coupled on the phage <b>lambda</b> <b>particles</b> bearing a GFP-expression cassette by a chemical coupling strategy to formulate transferrin-targeted lambda-GFP (Tf-targeted-l-GFP) gene nanocarrier. The carrier was then characterized by phage-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments and used for transfection of the human 293 T cell line. Particle internalization into the cells was evaluated by immunocytochemical staining and transfection efficacy was studied using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Results Characterization of the nanocarrier showed a rather high copy number (274 molecules) of transferrin molecules coupled per phage particle. Immunocytochemical staining revealed efficient internalization of the Tftargeted- l-GFP compared to wild lambda-GFP (l-GFP) particles.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of a <b>Lambda</b> <b>particle</b> {{embedded in a}} nucleus (hypernucleus) decreases from that of free Lambda decay due {{to the opening of}} the Lambda N to NN weak decay channel. However, it is generally believed that the {{lifetime of}} a hypernucleus attains a constant value (saturation) for medium to heavy hypernuclear masses, yet this hypothesis has been difficult to verify. The present paper reports a direct measurement of the lifetime of medium-heavy hypernuclei produced with a photon-beam from Fe, Cu, Ag, and Bi targets. The recoiling hypernuclei were detected by a fission fragment detector using low-pressure multi-wire proportional chambers. The experiment agrees remarkably well with the only previously-measured single-species heavy-hypernucleus lifetime, that of Fe 56 _Lambda at KEK, and has significantly higher precision.

40|$|Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV 2) {{associated}} diseases (PCVAD) cause {{economic loss}} to the global swine industry. Control measures for PCVAD largely depend {{on the use of}} PCV 2 vaccines. The available commercial PCV 2 vaccines contain either inactivated whole virus particles or recombinant PCV 2 capsid protein. These preparations most likely contain varying amounts of immune-irrelevant proteins that can cause adverse injection site reactions, with compromised efficacy due to alteration of protective immune epitopes arising during the viral inactivation process. Other constraints include high production cost attributed to propagation of slow growing virus and expression and extraction of recombinant proteins, a requirement for adjuvants, and the induction of a Th 2 -biased immune response. Hence, development of new PCV 2 vaccines is necessary. There are two recommended PCV 2 vaccination strategies. They are i. vaccinating sows, which relies on the passive transfer of maternal immunity to offspring, and ii. immunizing young piglets to induce an active immune response. The piglet vaccination has been shown to confer better protection from mortality. Maternal antibody interference to the induction of an active immune response is an obstacle when piglets are vaccinated at an early age. Can we sidestep this maternal antibody interference? To address this issue, I investigated whether a prototypical PCV 2 vaccine, parenterally administered, could override maternally-derived PCV 2 antibodies in seropositive piglets. The results of this study were not conclusive. However, they laid the foundation for future studies based upon using varying levels of vaccine antigen with different adjuvants, and administered to piglets with defined maternally derived PCV 2 antibodies. Subsequently, I examined if a new PCV 2 vaccine candidate comprised of bacteriophage <b>lambda</b> <b>particles</b> displaying part of the PCV 2 capsid protein could induce anti-PCV 2 immunity. Initial experiments showed that pigs do not have pre-existing anti-lambda antibodies and thus will not neutralize display particles used as a vaccine at primary vaccination.

For the scalar- and vector-meson exchanges, the momentum-dependent higher-order term is incorporated {{to reduce the}} attractive effect of the central interaction at higher energies. The single-particle potentials of the nucleon and Lambda, predicted by the G-matrix calculation, now have proper repulsive behavior in the momentum region q_ 1 = 5 - 20 fm^- 1. A moderate contribution of the spin-orbit interaction from the scalar-meson exchange is also included. As to the vector mesons, a dominant contribution is the quadratic spin-orbit force generated from the rho-meson exchange. The nucleon-nucleon phase shifts at the non-relativistic energies up to T_lab= 350 MeV are greatly improved especially for the 3 E states. The low-energy observables of the nucleon-nucleon and the hyperon-nucleon interactions are also reexamined. The isospin symmetry breaking and the Coulomb effect are properly incorporated in the particle basis. The essential feature of the Lambda N - Sigma N coupling is qualitatively similar to that obtained from the previous models. The nuclear saturation properties and the single-particle potentials of the nucleon, Lambda and Sigma are reexamined through the G-matrix calculation. The single-particle potential of the Sigma hyperon is weakly repulsive in symmetric nuclear matter. The single-particle spin-orbit strength for the <b>Lambda</b> <b>particle</b> is very small, in comparison {{with that of the}} nucleons, due to the strong antisymmetric spin-orbit force generated from the Fermi-Breit interaction.

40|$|The {{emergence}} or {{formation of}} leptons from particles composed of quarks is still re- mained very poorly understood. In this paper, we propose that leptons are formed by quark-antiquark annihilations. There {{are two types}} of quark-antiquark annihilations. Type-I quark-antiquark annihilation annihilates only color charges, which is an incom- plete annihilation and forms structureless and colorless but electrically charged leptons such as electron, muon, and tau particles. Type-II quark-antiquark annihilation an- nihilates both electric and color charges, which is a complete annihilation and forms structureless, colorless, and electrically neutral leptons such as electron, muon, and tau neutrinos. Analyzing these two types of annihilations between up and down quarks and antiquarks with an excited quantum state for each of them, we predict the fourth gener- ation of leptons named <b>lambda</b> <b>particle</b> and neutrino. On the contrary quark-antiquark annihilation, a lepton particle or neutrino, when it collides, can be disintegrated into a quark-antiquark pair.

This quark-antiquark annihilation and pair production scenario pro- vides unique understanding for the formation of leptons, predicts the fourth generation of leptons, and explains the oscillation of neutrinos without hurting the standard model of particle physics.

40|$|We {{present the}} study of K 0 s and Lambda {{production}} performed with the ALICE experiment at the LHC in Pb [...] Pb collisions at √(s_NN) = 2. 76 TeV and pp collisions at √(s) = 0. 9 and 7 TeV. The K 0 s and <b>Lambda</b> <b>particles</b> are reconstructed via their V 0 decay topology allowing their identification up to high transverse momenta. The corresponding baryon/meson ratios {{as a function of}} transverse momentum are extracted for Pb [...] Pb collisions in centrality bins and in the transverse momentum range from 1 to 6 GeV/c. They are also compared with those measured in pp events at the LHC energies of 0. 9 and 7 TeV as well as in Au [...] Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 62. 4 and 200 GeV from RHIC.

40|$|The {{elliptic}} flow of Lambda hyperons {{has been}} {{measured by the}} NA 49 Collaboration at the CERN-SPS in semicentral Pb+Pb collisions at 158 A GeV. The standard method of correlating particles with the event plane was used. Measurements of v 2 near midrapidity are reported {{as a function of}} rapidity, centrality and transverse momentum. Elliptic flow of <b>Lambda</b> <b>particles</b> increases both with the impact parameter and with the transverse momentum. It is compared with v 2 for pions and protons as well as with model calculations. The observation of significant elliptic flow and its mass dependence suggest strong collective behavior of the matter produced in collisions of heavy nuclei already at the SPS. Scaling properties of elliptic flow of different particle species have been tested at 158 A GeV. The limited pT range of the data does not allow for a decisive test of the coalescence model...|$|R
