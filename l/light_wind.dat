Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C., {{were among the}} most {{damaging}} from a tropical cyclone in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, United States. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
5|$|Alpha's origins {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October20. Satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear, the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation. On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding. Later that same day, the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; {{this was the first time}} the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, {{delayed by}} {{the effect of}} the Rock of Gibraltar on the wind, the British {{squadron}} rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point. The <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> prevented any rapid movement, and Saumarez began to slowly tack towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation. The delay with Moreno's departure had been due to the state of the captured Hannibal, renamed Annibal, which was unable to make any progress under its jury masts and had been taken under tow by the frigate Indienne. Sighting Saumarez's force, Moreno instructed Indienne and Hannibal to return to Algeciras and at 19:45 issued orders {{for the remainder of the}} squadron to sail eastwards through the Gut of Gibraltar towards Cadiz. He also, following Spanish naval tradition, disembarked his flagship Real Carlos and transferred to the frigate Sabina, persuading Linois to quit Formidable and do the same.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fabian was a {{powerful}} Cape Verde-type hurricane that hit Bermuda in early September during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Fabian was the most recent major hurricane to directly impact Bermuda until Hurricane Nicole of 2016. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, developed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean on August 25. It moved west-northwestward {{under the influence of}} the subtropical ridge to its north, and steadily strengthened in an area of warm water temperatures and <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear. The hurricane attained a peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1, and it slowly weakened as it turned northward. On September 5, Fabian made a direct hit on Bermuda with wind speeds of over 120mph (195km/h). After passing the island, the hurricane turned to the northeast, and became extratropical on September 8.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel was the costliest, deadliest, and strongest {{hurricane}} in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, {{and second}} major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.|$|E
5|$|<b>Light</b> <b>wind</b> shear allowed Ida {{to quickly}} intensify as it slowly tracked towards the Nicaraguan coastline. Late on November4, {{microwave}} satellite imagery depicted an eye-like featured forming within the storm. The storm tracked west-northwestward {{in response to}} a weak ridge over the north-central Caribbean Sea and a weak trough over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico; these features were also responsible for Ida's slow forward motion. Early on November 5, the storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale as it passed near the Corn Islands. At approximately 1117 UTC, the center of Ida made landfall near Rio Grande, Nicaragua, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). After the hurricane moved inland, the high mountains of Nicaragua caused the convection associated with the hurricane to diminish, resulting in rapid weakening. Roughly 18 hours after landfall, Ida weakened to a tropical depression as it turned northward over Honduras.|$|E

5|$|<b>Light</b> <b>wind</b> shear and {{favorable}} ocean temperatures led {{to steady}} intensification of the storm, and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on August 31. Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that would do so during the season.|$|E
5|$|Located {{within an}} area of <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear and warm waters, Isabel {{gradually}} organized as curved bands developed around a circular area of deep convection near the center. It steadily strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest, and Isabel strengthened to a hurricane on September 7 subsequent {{to the development of}} a large, yet ragged eye located near the deepest convection. The eye, overall convective pattern, and outflow steadily improved in organization, and deep convection quickly surrounded the -wide eye. Isabel intensified on September 8 to reach major hurricane status while located 1,300miles (2,100km) east-northeast of Barbuda. On September 9, Isabel reached a primary peak intensity of 135mph (215km/h) for around 24hours, a minimal Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{was also}} {{employed}} {{to determine the}} size of the hurricane's eye, stated to be roughly 13mi (20km) in diameter, following a 6-mile (10km) decrease due to the strengthening. <b>Light</b> <b>wind</b> shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place. Late on August2, the system attained winds of 135mph (215km/h), making it a Category4 storm. During the afternoon of August3, Guillermo nearly attained Category5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925mbar (hPa; 27.32inHg). A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued. Late on August4, Guillermo intensified into a Category5 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h). Operational analysis of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg); however, post-storm studies stated that the pressure was more likely around 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg).|$|E

After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over Pennsylvania the next day. The storm's center remained to the south and west of Delaware, and was about 175miles (280km) from Delaware at its closest approach. At that time, Isabel was a strong tropical storm located in central Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50million in damage (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).

It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. Several days before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike. At least one computer model predicted a landfall on New Jersey, {{and as a result}} services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Carlos {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited {{the west coast of}} Africa on June14. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, with little evidence of its existence on satellite imagery. By June20 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean, later spawning an area of convection, or thunderstorms, south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the system in its tropical weather outlook on June24, by which time a low pressure center developed. Gradually, the system continued to develop due to <b>light</b> <b>wind</b> shear, with rainbands and convection located near the broad center. By early on June26, the disturbance had organized enough for the NHC to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Three-E, about 130miles (210km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca.|$|E
