At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest,</b> the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Arizona Court of Appeals, in a {{decision}} Standhardt v. Superior Court (77 P.3d 451, 463-464) with regards to Arizona's state marriage law, a three judge panel concluded that the petitioners had failed {{to prove that the}} State's prohibition of same sex marriage is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest holding that the State has a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in encouraging procreation and child-rearing within the marital relationship, and that limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman is rationally related to that interest and that even assuming that the State's reasoning for prohibiting same sex marriage was debatable, it was not 'arbitrary' or 'irrational'.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} of privity of {{contract}} is a sub-rule of consideration because it restricts who can enforce an agreement {{to those who have}} brought consideration to the bargain. In an early case, Tweddle v Atkinson, it was held that because a son had not given any consideration for his father in law's promise to his father to pay the son £200, he could not enforce the promise. Given the principle that standing to enforce an obligation should reflect whoever has a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in its performance, a 1996 report by the Law Commission entitled Privity of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties, recommended that while courts should be left free to develop the common law, some of the more glaring injustices should be removed. This led to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Under section 1, a third party may enforce an agreement if it purports to confer a benefit on the third party, either individually or a member as a class, and there is no expressed stipulation that the person was not intended to be able to enforce it. In this respect there is a strong burden on the party claiming enforcement was not intended by a third party. A third party has the same remedies available as a person privy to an agreement, and can enforce both positive benefits, or limits on liability, such as an exclusion clause. The rights of a third party can then only be terminated or withdrawn without her consent if it is reasonably foreseeable that she would rely upon them.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster {{dropped the}} charges, agreeing {{with the defense}} that the federal anti-obscenity {{statutes}} were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want {{in the privacy of}} their own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued that the government had a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.|$|E

500|$|In Jeyaratnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992), Justice L.P. Thean, when {{delivering}} {{the judgment of}} the court, held that [...] "ersons holding public office or politicians ... are equally entitled to have their reputations protected as those of any other persons". In this case, counsel for the appellant argued that [...] "qualified privilege attaches to defamatory publications concerning public officials (or candidates for a public office) relating to their official conduct or the performance of their public duties by those who have an honest and <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in the matter to those who have a corresponding and <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> (whether as electors or as citizens potentially affected by the conduct of public officials)". The fact that the statements were made in a political rally during the run-up to elections meant that the requirement of a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> was met. Lingens v. Austria (1986) was relied upon in support of the premise that [...] "the limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual". In Lingens, the European Court of Human Rights was of the opinion that a politician [...] "inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance". The reasoning of the European Court was in line with the public figure doctrine enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), where the United States Supreme Court decided in favour of the defendant newspaper, {{making it one of the}} key decisions supporting the freedom of the press.|$|E

500|$|In United States v. Gillock (1980), a {{prosecution}} under the Hobbs Act and Travel Act, the Supreme Court declined {{to recognize a}} legislative act privilege for state legislators analogous in scope to the Speech or Debate Clause, either under the Tenth Amendment or Federal Rule of Evidence 501. Gillock argued that [...] "recognition of an evidentiary privilege for state legislators for their legislative acts would impair the <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> of the Federal Government in enforcing its criminal statutes with only speculative benefit to the state legislative process." [...] Similarly, the courts have consistently rejected claims by convicted state legislators that their prosecutions violate the Tenth Amendment.|$|E
500|$|However {{federal judge}} William H. Pauley III in New York City [...] the U.S. government's global {{telephone}} data-gathering system {{is needed to}} thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can only work if everyone's calls are swept in. U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program {{and that it does}} not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is Smith v. Maryland: [...] "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," [...] Judge Pauley wrote. The American Civil Liberties Union declared on January 2, 2014 that it will appeal Judge Pauley's ruling that NSA bulk phone record collection is legal. [...] "The government has a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in tracking the associations of suspected terrorists, but tracking those associations does not require the government to subject every citizen to permanent surveillance," [...] deputy ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement.|$|E
2500|$|... {¶ 35} In conclusion, {{the state}} and the city of Toledo possess the {{constitutional}} authority to exercise police powers that are rationally related to a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.

We hold that the state of Ohio and the city of Toledo have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting citizens from the dangers associated with pit bulls, and that R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to that interest and are constitutional.|$|E
