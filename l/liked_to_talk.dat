25|$|QOTW Off Topic {{was invented}} for those users of QOTW who found they had {{things in common}} and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other using the reply system. Over several weeks {{it became clear that}} more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already set up, so Off Topic was created.|$|E
60|$|Foster <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to strangers}} {{and as the}} girl had not rebuffed him, he took her cloak, which looked very wet, from the rack.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did," [...] said Helen. [...] "You {{were rather}} disagreeable about it; but you objected because he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and kept {{you from your}} work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I couldn't induce him," [...] said Mrs. Miller very gently. [...] "He wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the waiter. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that waiter." ...|$|R

30|$|I can {{understand}} why students don’t {{want to be called}} on personally, and I'm pretty uncomfortable calling students by name in a class environment. But I think it’s important because unless I am calling on everyone, the conversation usually degrades to two or three people who <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me or <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the class. So getting multiple people talking in the class is an essential goal for me and right now that's one of my best tools to accomplish that.|$|R
6000|$|On {{returning}} to the waiting-room, he addressed a characteristic question to the assembled visitors. [...] "More humbug?" [...] asked the gentleman who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a pretty woman.|$|E
60|$|Juliette {{clung to}} the vision of that heroine, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of her. She {{appeared}} as a justification of her own actions, which somehow seemed to require justification.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why in {{the name}} of common sense," [...] I cried, turning {{suddenly}} around in my chair and facing Walkirk, [...] "did you put into Miss Raynor's head all that stuff about typewriting? Did you do it simply because you <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her?" ...|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTA. Asher, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Minnie, if {{you don't}} mind.|$|R
60|$|Of course. There are one or {{two things}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE (gazing at him; after a moment). Sure! I guess I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
6000|$|Evidently now too {{again he}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of it. [...] "I don't {{think of it}} as--when it does come--necessarily violent. I only {{think of it as}} natural and as of course above all unmistakeable. I think of it simply as the thing. The thing will of itself appear natural." ...|$|E
60|$|Soames <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{during dinner}} about business, {{or what he}} had been buying, and so long as he talked Irene's silence did not {{distress}} him. This evening he had found it impossible to talk. The decision to build had been weighing on his mind all the week, and he had made up his mind to tell her.|$|E
60|$|Twinkle {{was glad}} to see them go. She didn't care much for the woodchuck children, they were so wild and ill-mannered, and their mother was even more disagreeable than they were. As for Mister Woodchuck, she did not object to him so much; in fact, she rather <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him, for his words were polite and his eyes {{pleasant}} and kindly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{be able to}} {{ride and}} take care of myself in a day or two," [...] went on Duane. [...] "Then I'll go--I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about Jennie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They drink, {{and they}} don't mind as they should." [...] Captain Marshall turned to Phil. [...] "After breakfast, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you on {{business}} in the cabin," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes when I hain't busy, I {{drop into}} the state library at the capital and enjoy myself. It's <b>like</b> goin' <b>to</b> another world without any folks to bother you. Er--er--there's books I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about--sometime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] said Mrs. Lapham, deeply pleased inwardly, but {{not going}} to show it, as she would have said. [...] "I guess you want to build there yourself." [...] She insensibly got a little nearer to her husband. They <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other in that blunt way; it is the New England way of expressing perfect {{confidence}} and tenderness.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{loved his}} port wine, and thawed {{a little in}} his manner. He loved it not as a toper, but as a {{collector}} loves his pet pictures. He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it, and think about it; to praise it, and hear it praised; {{to look at it}} turned towards the light, and to count over the years it had lain in his cellar.|$|E
6000|$|The {{manager was}} like the man of any other trade; he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of his business, and this morning he talked of it a long time, and to an effect that Maxwell must have found useful {{if he had not}} been so bent upon getting to his {{manuscript}} that he had no mind for generalities. At last the manager said, abruptly, [...] "You want me to read your play?" ...|$|E

60|$|HILLMAN (glancing at DR. JONATHAN). There's {{a matter}} we'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over with you, Mr. Pindar, {{as soon as}} convenient.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little amateurish," [...] {{said the}} Curate from Iping Hanger to Mr Rathbone-Slater. [...] "A great gift, undoubtedly, but a certain lack of {{sustained}} training. There were {{one or two}} little things ... I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|The ceremonies {{were over}} and the priests, with the {{exception}} of Harût and two who remained to attend upon him, vanished, probably to inform the male and female hierophants of their result, and through these the whole people of the White Kendah. Old Harût stared at us for a little while, then said in English, which he always <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> when Ragnall was present, perhaps for the sake of practice: ...|$|E
60|$|Sympathy is a sweet thing, and {{it worked}} wonders here, for each boy knew that Father Bhaer was {{interested}} in him, and some were readier to open their hearts to him than to a woman, especially the older ones, who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over their hopes and plans, man to man. When sick or in trouble they instinctively turned to Mrs. Jo, while the little ones made her their mother-confessor on all occasions.|$|E
60|$|He had female acquaintances in Plainton, {{but not one}} of {{them seemed}} to have the {{qualifications}} he would desire in a wife. Willy Croup was a good-natured and pleasant woman, and he always <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her, but she was too old for him. He might like to adopt her as a maiden aunt, but then that would not be practicable, for Mrs. Cliff would not be willing to give her up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you don't}} mind, Mrs Clinton, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your doctor alone about the case. You can {{wait in the}} next room.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Kipps {{spoke of}} his respect for Miss Walshingham and her {{freckled}} friend. He contrived not to look too self-conscious. [...] "You know, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people <b>like</b> that, but I can't. A chap's afraid of giving himself away." ...|$|R
6000|$|Each {{of those}} two <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the other {{as a sort of}} fellow- captive, solacing {{themselves}} with discussions over the 'Censor' and its fellows. Love is not often the first thought, even where it lurks in modern intellectual intercourse between man and maid; and though Kitty Varley might giggle, the others thought the idea only worthy of her. Aunt Jane, however, smelt out the notion, and could not but communicate it to her sister, though adding—- ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you {{of what he}} {{had found}} {{characteristic}} in your work, to analyze you to yourself; and the very modesty of the man, which made such a study impersonal {{as far as he was}} concerned, sometimes rendered him insensible to the sufferings of his subject. He had a keen perception of humor in others, but he had very little humor; he had a love of the beautiful in literature which was perhaps sometimes greater than his sense of it.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards {{a silence}} fell, {{through which the}} lap of the waves on the sands and the far-off moan of the Atlantic surges came sonorously. Jacky was restless and wakeful, but did not suffer, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> Frances listened {{to him with a}} new-born power of sympathy, which she thought she must have caught from Corona. He told her all the tragedy of his short life, and how bad he felt, about Dad's taking to drink and Mammy's having to work so hard.|$|E
6000|$|The {{tears came}} to the girl's eyes. [...] "I do believe you know best, Mary," [...] she said, in a distressed voice. [...] "Oh, please don't think that I am cross. I am so glad you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wouldn't you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{him some}} more?" [...] I suggested; [...] "I {{can see you}} any time about this little {{business}} of ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you for a}} few moments," [...] {{she said}} quietly. [...] "Afterwards will you come on to the terrace?" ...|$|R
