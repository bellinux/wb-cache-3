5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in <b>Lesch-Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. <b>Lesch-Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome</b> is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Lesch-Nyhan</b> (LN) <b>syndrome</b> is {{a severe}} X chromosome-linked disease {{that results from}} a {{deficiency}} of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The mutations leading to the disease are heterogeneous and frequently arise as de novo events. We have identified nucleotide alterations in 15 independently arising HPRT-deficiency cases by direct DNA sequencing of in vitro amplified HPRT cDNA. We also demonstrate that the direct DNA sequence analysis can be automated, further simplifying the detection of new mutations at this locus. The mutations include DNA base substitutions, small DNA deletions, a single DNA base insertion, and errors in RNA splicing. The application of these procedures allows DNA diagnosis and carrier identification by the direct detection of the mutant alleles within individual families affected by LN...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{deficiency of}} the purine salvage enzyme, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC 2. 4. 2. 8), in man {{results in the}} <b>Lesch-Nyhan</b> (LN) <b>syndrome.</b> Two unrelated patients with the full LN syndrome showed {{no evidence of a}} major alteration to the gene encoding HPRT (HPRT) by restriction endonuclease analysis, but exhibited negligible levels of HPRT mRNA on Northern blots. DNA from these patients was characterised further. Amplification, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), of individual HPR T-exon fragments from genomic DNA followed by nucleotide (nt) sequence analysis using automated technology, revealed single-base mutations in each patient. One patient has an insertion of a T within exon- 2, which places a stop codon in frame, presumably resulting in premature termination of translation of the HPRT mRNA. The other patient has a G → A base substitution at the 52 ̆ 7 end of intron- 6, at the junction of exon- 6 and intron- 6. Although dot blot analysis indicated negligible HPRT mRNA in lymphoblast cells from both patients, we were successful in amplifying HPRT cDNA using PCR. Direct nt sequence analysis of the amplified cDNA confirmed the insertion of a T in exon- 2 in the one patient and revealed a complete deletion of exon- 6 in the other patient, the latter event presumably arising due to aberrant splicing of primary message. Both mutations were also confirmed by hybridisation of amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes. This study illustrates two approaches for analysing DNA mutations at the molecular level and demonstrates the power of PCR technology in the study of genetic diseases. The procedures {{can be applied to the}} identification of carrier females with mutant alleles in these two LN families...|$|R
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of <b>Lesch-Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome</b> may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
25|$|A less severe, related disease, partial HPRT deficiency, {{is known}} as Kelley–Seegmiller {{syndrome}} (<b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome</b> involves total HPRT deficiency). Symptoms generally involve less neurological involvement but the disease still causes gout and kidney stones.|$|E
25|$|The urate to {{creatinine}} (breakdown {{product of}} creatine phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. This {{is a good}} indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} method of testing, as HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with LNS. Individuals who display the full Lesch–Nyhan phenotype all have mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Sequence analysis of mRNA is available clinically and can be utilized in order to detect HPRT1 mutations in males affected with <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Techniques such as RT-PCR, multiplex genomic PCR, and sequence analysis (cDNA and genomic DNA), used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, are performed on a research basis. If RT-PCR tests result in cDNA showing the absence of an entire exon or exons, then multiplex genomic PCR testing is performed. Multiplex genomic PCR testing amplifies the nine exons of the HPRT1 gene as eight PCR products. If the exon in question is deleted, the corresponding band will be missing from the multiplex PCR. However, if the exon is present, the exon is sequenced to identify the mutation, therefore causing exclusion of the exon from cDNA. If no cDNA is created by RT-PCR, then multiplex PCR is performed on the notion that most or all of the gene is obliterated.|$|E

2500|$|When an {{affected}} {{individual has}} fully developed the three clinical elements of uric acid overproduction, neurologic dysfunction, and {{cognitive and behavioral}} disturbances, diagnosis of LNS is easily made.

Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome</b> is first suspected when self-inflicted injury behavior develops. However, self-injurious behaviors occur in other conditions, including nonspecific intellectual disability, autism, Rett syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Tourette syndrome, familial dysautonomia, choreoacanthocytosis, sensory neuropathy including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, and several psychiatric conditions. Of these, only individuals with <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> de Lange syndrome, and familial dysautonomia recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers. <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome</b> ought to be clearly considered only when self-injurious behavior takes place in conjunction with hyperuricemia and neurological dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} X-linked diseases, males are {{affected}} because {{they only have}} one copy of the X chromosome.

[...] LNS affects about one in 380,000 live births. The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, who published their findings in 1964.|$|E
2500|$|An {{article in}} the August 13, 2007 issue of The New Yorker magazine, written by Richard Preston, {{discusses}} [...] "deep-brain stimulation" [...] as a possible treatment. It has been performed on a few patients with <b>Lesch–Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome</b> by Dr. Takaomi Taira in Tokyo and by a group in France led by Dr. Philippe Coubes. Some patients experienced a decrease in spastic self-injurious symptoms. The technique was developed for treating people with Parkinson's disease, according to Preston, over 20 years ago. The treatment involves invasive surgery to place wires that carry a continuous electric current into a specific region of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|X-linked {{recessive}} {{conditions are}} also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, {{and the chance}} of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons {{of a man with}} an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene. [...] A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (XRXr) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers. [...] X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and <b>Lesch-Nyhan</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as well as common and less serious conditions such as male pattern baldness and red-green color blindness. [...] X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to skewed X-inactivation or monosomy X (Turner syndrome).|$|E
