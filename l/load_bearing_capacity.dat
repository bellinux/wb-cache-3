40|$|Abstract: Synchro drive uses chain {{sprocket}} mechanism to drive three wheels at vertex of triangular chaises and has limited <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> due to asymmetry. The driving and steering motors fixed {{near to the}} vertex of the triangular chassis and wear in chains {{over a period of}} time results in increased dead reckoning. The concept of simple pivot based mobile platform using two drives overcasts a conventional synchro drive omnidirectional mobile platform in many aspects. This mobile platform has symmetric chassis with six wheels that makes platform stable irrespective of any configuration. Gear trains to steer the four corner wheels in tandem with pivot wheel adds omnidirectional feature along with increased <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> and reduced dead reckoning.

For example, the width and height of the main vomitoria vary significantly at the junction of two phases of work; two half-diameter reinforcements were built {{on either side of}} the entrances to increase the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> (see Fig. 1), given the increased height (and weight) along the edge where the mass backfill rose sharply.|$|E

40|$|As it {{has been}} found out, fiberconcrete has many {{positive}} attributes, which make that material a target of the numerous investigations. Traditionally fibers are homogeneously dispersed in the concrete volume. At the same time, in many situations fiber reinforced concrete with homogeneously dispersed fibers is not optimal (the majority of added fibers do not participate in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> process). In the present investigation {{it has been}} demonstrated that the use of homogeneous fiberconcrete in eccentrically loaded and subjected to bending structures is not rational from mechanical and economical point of view. Fiber reinforced concrete prisms with homogeneous and layered fiber distribution inside them were elaborated.

40|$|From a biomechanical viewpoint, {{fractures}} {{are due to}} {{a structural}} failure of the bone. This failure occurs when the forces applied to the bone exceed its <b>load</b> – <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The <b>load</b> – <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of a bone depends on the geometry (its size, shape and distribution of bone mass), and the material properties of a bone {{as well as the}} direction and magnitude of applied load. Bone fragility can be defined by biomechanical parameters such as strength, brittleness and work to failure. Strategies to reduce fracture risk must be based on a sound understanding of the cellular, molecular and biomechanical mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of fractures while aging. In this review biomechanics of bone and the etiology of age – related fractures from a biomechanical viewpoint have been discussed in the view of current literature.

40|$|Lattice slabs are {{usual in}} Brazil. They are formed by precast joists with {{latticed}} bars on {{a base of}} concrete, and a cover of concrete placed at the jobsite. The assembly of the joists and the filling elements is simple and do not require manpower with great skill, presenting low cost-benefit ratio. However, it is precisely in assembling phase that arise questions related to the scaffold support distance. A mistake in the proper positioning can lead to two undesirable situations. In one of them, a small space between the support lines increases the cost of scaffold, and in other an excessive space can generate exaggerated displacements, and even {{the collapse of the}} slab in the stage of concreting. The objective of this work is to analyze the <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of lattice joists in assembling phase, looking for information that is useful in defining the scaffold support distance.

40|$|A discontinuous-based porosity-based {{model for}} {{concrete}} subjected to time- evolution self-healing phenomena {{is presented in}} this work. The model represents an extension of a fracture energy-based elasto-plastic interface formulation which now in- cludes porosity evolution induced by self-healing mechanisms. The formulation accounts for the characterization of concrete failure behavior in mode I and II fracture types. The post-cracking response is considered by means of specic work softening rules in terms of work spent and porosity evolution. The eects of the aforementioned phenomenon on the recovery of stiness and <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> have been evaluated by means of three-point bending (3 PB) tests performed up to controlled crack opening and up to failure, respectively, before and after conditioning.

The chemical composition, structure and morphology of the coatings were analyzed and correlated with the mechanical properties. A complete detailed tribological characterization was performed by pin-on-disk tests varying the applied load, the humidity ratio and the temperature.

30|$|Column usually rests {{directly}} {{on top of}} a stone base without any physical connection in traditional timber structures. When timber structure is subjected to horizontal loads, rotation around the edge of column foot may occur with or without slippage of column. Columns rock with cyclic lift and reset. Compression deformation occurs to column foot due to the heavy vertical load of the structure and it is an important factor to the <b>loading</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of timber structure. Accordingly, the rotation behavior of column foot during rocking has {{to be taken into account}} when carrying out the structural analysis. For this purpose, rotation behaviors of column foot during rocking is studied, and theoretical model of restoring moment at column foot joint is proposed with consideration of the compression effect; finite element model is established to verify the proposed model and good agreement of the two models is found. Result shows that column foot has contributions to resist horizontal loads with rocking under lateral load.|$|R

It is shown in this paper that the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of spot welds under different loading situations are computable using detailed finite element models, in which local material properties and a damage model are used. But these detailed models are not applicable in crash simulations of whole vehicles using explicit finite element codes due to the huge amount of elements per spot weld and small dimensions of the elements. Instead of detailed spot weld models simplified models are used in crash simulations to calculate the deformation and fracture behavior with less computational capacity and costs. In this paper a simplified spot weld model and a procedure for determination of the damage parameters are presented. The method is verified with simulations of spot welded comp onent tests...|$|R
