5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E
25|$|Low-resistance {{grounding}} systems use {{a neutral}} grounding resistor (NGR) {{to limit the}} fault current to 25A or greater. <b>Low</b> <b>resistance</b> grounding systems will have a time rating (say, 10 seconds) that indicates how long the resistor can carry the fault current before overheating. A ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit before overheating of the resistor occurs.|$|E
25|$|In 1875 Swan {{returned}} {{to consider the}} problem of the light bulb {{with the aid of a}} better vacuum and a carbonized thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. However, his filament had <b>low</b> <b>resistance,</b> thus needing heavy copper wires to supply it.|$|E
5000|$|Properties include 'high {{temperature}} resistance', hardness (7 Mohs), low density, <b>low</b> electrical <b>resistance,</b> <b>low</b> friction, and <b>low</b> thermal <b>resistance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Resistance {{distances}} are {{computed for}} all 1812 C 60 fullerenes {{and found to}} correlate {{with the number of}} pentagon adjacencies and hence with relative energy. Within the set, the unique isolated-pen-tagon isomer has the <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> distance (RT = 479482 / 209), the lowest Wiener index (W = 8340) and the highest Balaban index (J = 2025 / 2224). The most stable C 40 fullerene isomer, one of two with the lowest achievable number of pentagon adjacencies, also has the <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> distance in the set...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} system must has as <b>low</b> aspossible <b>resistance</b> {{to get high}} efjisien. One. of that is starting system. In this system, <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> reach when it only use armature resistance. But lower resistance make higher current. In other hand, highest current should not higher than insulation system could take. So this study trying tofind to get safety on the starting system...|$|R
25|$|So-called self-resetting fuses use a {{thermoplastic}} conductive element {{known as}} a Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient (or PPTC) thermistor that impedes the circuit during an overcurrent condition (by increasing device resistance). The PPTC thermistor is self-resetting in that when current is removed, the device will cool and revert to <b>low</b> <b>resistance.</b> These devices are often used in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult, or on a computer motherboard so that a shorted mouse or keyboard does not cause motherboard damage.|$|E
25|$|The silver {{chloride}} electrode is {{most commonly used}} as a reference electrode in pH meters, although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode. The {{silver chloride}} electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The reference electrode usually consists of a platinum wire that has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, {{which serves as a}} contact to the test solution, providing <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> while preventing mixing of the two solutions.|$|E
25|$|In normal early {{embryonic}} development, {{the outer}} epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type {{found in the}} trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> and high blood flow.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} {{specialised}} instruments to detect short-circuits between adjacent PCB tracks, an ESR meter is useful {{because it can}} measure <b>low</b> <b>resistances</b> while injecting a voltage too low to confuse readings by switching on semiconductor junctions in the circuit. An ESR meter {{can be used to}} find short-circuits, even finding which of a group of capacitors or transistors connected in parallel by printed circuit tracks or wires is short-circuited. Many conventional ohmmeters and multimeters are not usable for very <b>low</b> <b>resistances,</b> and those that are often use too high a voltage, risking damage to the circuit being tested.|$|R
30|$|In groundwaters of Yaoundé, P. aeruginosa strains {{expressed}} highest {{resistance to}} fosfomycin (90.09 %) and ofloxacin (30 %) and <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> to tobramycin (0.6 %) (Fig.  1 a). In well waters of Douala, P. aeruginosa strains expressed highest resistance rates to fosfomycin (77.88 %) and <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> to cefsulodin (2.88 %) (Fig.  1 b). The prevalence of resistant strains to ceftazidime, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin was relatively different in wells of Douala {{when compared to}} those of Yaoundé (Fig.  1). Resistant strains to cefsulodin were recorded in wells of Douala (2.88 %), while in Yaoundé there were no resistant strains recorded to this drug.|$|R

25|$|Swan's {{carbon rod}} lamp and carbon {{filament}} lamp, while functional, were still relatively impractical due to <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life. While {{searching for a}} better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881 he developed and patented a process for squeezing nitro-cellulose through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan's cellulose filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process.|$|E
25|$|Although the park's terrain {{may appear}} rugged and durable, it is {{extremely}} fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem. The problem lies within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests {{that are used to}} compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.|$|E
25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|E
50|$|An {{instrument}} for measuring resistance is called an ohmmeter. Simple ohmmeters cannot measure <b>low</b> <b>resistances</b> accurately because {{the resistance of}} their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use four-terminal sensing.|$|R

25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that {{presence}} of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have resulted in resistance to bevirimat. However, mutations at these sites were not found in phase I and II clinical trials. Instead, mutations in the glutamine-valine-threonine (QVT) motif of the SP1 peptide are also known to cause bevirimat resistance. In addition, V362I mutations have been shown to confer strong resistance to bevirimat, where the S373P and I376V mutations may confer <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> to bevirimat. A further complication of the use of bevirimat is that, since bevirimat targets the CA/SP1 cleavage site, it could also be used in the treatment of protease inhibitor resistant patients. Except for A364V, mutations in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have showed to result in fitness deficits when combined with protease inhibitor resistance. This proposes that these mutations may develop slowly. It has been shown that protease inhibitor resistance can result in an increase in the occurrence of mutations within the downstream QVT motif.|$|E
25|$|Normal flatus {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present <b>low</b> <b>resistance,</b> and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.|$|E
25|$|For air {{dielectric}} capacitors {{the breakdown}} field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m; for oil, 15 to 25 MV/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric. The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by {{factors such as the}} geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively <b>low</b> <b>resistance)</b> circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy. However, in capacitors with particular dielectrics and thin metal electrodes shorts are not formed after breakdown. It happens because a metal melts or evaporates in a breakdown vicinity, isolating it {{from the rest of the}} capacitor.|$|E
40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{research}} about catamaran have generated a practical formula {{to simplify the}} calculations of catamaran resistance. Ship designer will calculate the predictions of catamaran resistance rapidly. The aim {{of this research is}} focused to search the optimal demihull form where the hull form has the <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to other hull form models with the same displacement. To generate the different hull form, the initial hull form (parent hull) is transformed so that become some models by changing the parameter of coefficient block (Cb) in range ± 10 % with Lwl, T, H, volume and displacement are constant. The transformed hull form are calculated their total resistance from Froude number (Fr) 0, 2 to 0, 65 with spacing hull to length ratio (S/L) 0, 2 to 0, 4. The results of calculation show that the optimal demihull form is Model 4 where the initial hull form Cb + 5 %. The model has the <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to other models. The comparisons of resistance Model 4 with the configurations of S/L shows that the <b>lowest</b> <b>resistance</b> is S/L 0, 4, so that the optimal demihull form is Model 4 with S/L 0, 4. </p...|$|R
50|$|A Kelvin clip is {{a special}} form of {{crocodile}} clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing 2 isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables 4-wire measurement of circuits with very <b>low</b> <b>resistances.</b>|$|R
50|$|Class 3: Provides {{protection}} against corrosion where <b>low</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> is required. This is a thin coating providing <b>low</b> contact <b>resistance,</b> and the coating weight is lower as is the corrosion resistance. There may be some advantages using this thinner film in bonding applications.|$|R
25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E
2500|$|Analog meter {{movements}} are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters. Many analog multimeters feature a range switch position marked [...] "off" [...] {{to protect the}} meter movement during transportation which places placing a <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> across the meter movement, resulting in dynamic braking. Meter movements as separate components may be protected {{in the same manner}} by connecting a shorting or jumper wire between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a shunt across the winding such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the <b>low</b> <b>resistance</b> of the shunt.|$|E
