5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean.

As she explores, she is led by a great white shark to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore <b>life</b> <b>to</b> the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees the great white shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring <b>life</b> <b>to</b> the ocean—and mortally wounds the great white shark, which dies as the diver comforts it.
