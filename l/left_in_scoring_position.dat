5000|$|In {{the sport}} of baseball, a baserunner {{is said to be}} in scoring {{position}} when he is on second or third base. The distinction between being on first base and second or third base is that a runner on first can usually only score if the batter hits an extra-base hit, while a runner on second or third can score on a single. This is also known as [...] "ducks on the pond". Runners <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> refers to the number of runners on second or third base {{at the end of an}} inning and is an inverse measure of a team's offensive efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|... 7:30 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, MissouriGame 5 saw {{a battle}} of the aces with Adam Wainwright on the short end as Lester pitched another gem of 7 2/3 innings. Boston struck first on {{back-to-back}} one out doubles by Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz, who continued his monstrous tear, hitting [...]733 in the series. Wainwright ended up striking out the side {{in the first two}} innings before Jon Lester broke the streak with a groundout. St. Louis had back-to-back leadoff singles {{in the second and third}} by Carlos Beltrán and David Freese, latter advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Pete Kozma but was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> In the fourth Ortiz tied a World Series record by Billy Hatcher on a hit, reaching base in nine consecutive plate appearances, but failed to set a new record by flying out to center field in the sixth. With one out in the bottom of the fourth, Matt Holliday hit a solo shot to center field to tie the game. Boston threatened in the fifth after a leadoff hit by Xander Bogaerts and a one out single by David Ross but Wainwright struck out Lester and Ellsbury to strand both runners. After a leadoff single by Bogaerts, Stephen Drew walked and Ross drove in one run on a ground rule double to left field. With two runners in scoring position Ellsbury's single scored Drew but Ross was tagged out at home plate on the throw by Shane Robinson. In the bottom of the eighth Lester allowed a one out double against Freese and Koji Uehara took over the mound for a four out save after Kozma hit a fly ball to left field for the second out of the inning. Uehara struck out pinch hitter Matt Adams on three pitches for the third out. The Red Sox closer struck out Matt Carpenter, grounded out pinch hinter John Jay and Holliday flew out to right field to earn the save in back-to-back games. This was the first game of this series neither team committed an error.|$|E
50|$|Eddie Plank {{returned}} for the A's against Joe McGinnity for the Giants in Game 4. Both <b>left</b> men on <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> early on, {{and kept the}} game scoreless until {{the bottom of the}} fourth, when Sam Mertes led off the inning by reaching on an error by Monte Cross. After Bill Dahlen flied to right Art Devlin grounded out, moving Mertes to second. With two outs, Billy Gilbert singled to left, bringing Mertes home for the only run of the game, McGinnity outdueling Plank 1-0 and giving the Giants a three-games-to-one lead.|$|R
5000|$|Game 4 {{was another}} {{marathon}} affair. Joe Saunders and Phil Hughes matched zeroes for four innings, before Nate McLouth led off the fifth for Baltimore {{with a home}} run. The Yankees responded in the sixth when Robinson Canó had an RBI groundout, but they <b>left</b> a runner <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> that inning when Alex Rodriguez struck out. Rodriguez also left men on second and third with one out {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, dropping his batting average for the series down to [...]125 and continuing to draw the scorn of Yankees fans.|$|R
50|$|Despite having {{claimed the}} Wild Card {{spot on the}} final day of the regular season, the Giants were able to tab ace Madison Bumgarner for the Wild Card game start. Bumgarner had an {{excellent}} regular season for the Giants, finishing with a career-low in ERA and a career-high in strikeouts, finishing fourth in the National League in both categories. On the hill for the New York Mets was Noah Syndergaard, who himself finished 3rd in the NL in ERA and 9th in strikeouts. The pitching matchup didn't disappoint, it took until the bottom of the third inning for the game's first hit and baserunner, with Syndergaard striking out four straight batters on two occasions. The closest either side came to <b>scoring</b> was <b>in</b> the top of the 6th when, after Denard Span singled and stole second base with two outs, Brandon Belt hit a long fly ball to center field which was caught on the dead run by Curtis Granderson, smashing into the wall and holding on. Syndergaard exited after 7 innings, having struck out 10. Crucially as it turned out, the Giants had forced Syndergaard out of the game with Bumgarner still going strong. Another golden opportunity was squandered by the Giants in the top of the 8th inning, when Addison Reed struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning with the bases loaded. After Bumgarner <b>left</b> a runner <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the bottom of the 8th, the game moved to the 9th with the Mets bringing in closer Jeurys Familia. Brandon Crawford led the inning off with a double to left-center, but Ángel Pagán couldn't lay down the sacrifice bunt and then struck out. Joe Panik worked a walk and Conor Gillaspie stepped up to the plate to launch a three-run home run to right field. Gillaspie had only started the game because Eduardo Núñez was still dealing with a hamstring injury and had to be left off the roster. Bumgarner then got the final three outs, completing the shutout just as he had done in the 2014 Wild Card Game. Bumgarner made 119 pitches, allowed just 6 total baserunners, striking out 6 and setting an MLB record of 23 consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason elimination games. With the win, the Giants equalled the Major League record for consecutive postseason series wins with 11, also extending their streak of postseason elimination game wins to 9.|$|R

A tiring Roark <b>left</b> the game <b>in</b> the fifth inning, after 4⅓ innings pitched and 85 pitches, with two Dodgers on base and Washington still holding a 3-2 lead. After that, Washington′s bullpen, a postseason weakness for the 2012 and 2014 teams, held the Dodgers scoreless; Marc Rzepczynski, Sammy Solis, Blake Treinen, Óliver Pérez, and Mark Melancon combined to give up only three walks (all by Rzepczynski) and one hit (a single yielded by Melancon) in the game′s remaining 4⅔ innings, striking out five Dodgers.
