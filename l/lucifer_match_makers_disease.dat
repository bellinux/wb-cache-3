5000|$|Sir Isaac Holden, 1st Baronet, (1807-1897), {{inventor}} and manufacturer, {{known for}} <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches,</b> {{and served as}} Liberal MP for Keighley 1888-1895 ...|$|R
60|$|Night fell: a strange, murky night, {{smelling of}} <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches,</b> and lit {{on the eastern}} horizon by a mysterious light, flaring like a dreary dawn.|$|R
6000|$|... [FN#4] [...] This word is the Muzungu of the Zanzibar coast, and {{contracted}} to Utángá and even Tángá {{it is found}} useful in expressing foreign wares; Utangáni's devil-fire, for instance, is a <b>lucifer</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The one," [...] said Gillian, [...] "where Padua {{got into}} the kingdom of Naples, and {{the lady of the}} house lighted a <b>lucifer</b> <b>match,</b> besides the horse who drained a goblet of red wine." ...|$|R
50|$|Nearby is Holden Park, {{which was}} the site of Oakworth House and its grounds, once owned by Sir Isaac Holden, an {{inventor}} who is said to have invented the <b>lucifer</b> <b>match</b> and revolutionised the process of carding wool. He also owned Oakworth Hall.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the spatial competition in commission fees between two <b>match</b> <b>makers.</b> These <b>match</b> <b>makers</b> serve as middlemen between {{buyers and sellers}} who are located uniformly on a circle. The profits of the <b>match</b> <b>makers</b> are determined by their respective market sizes. A limited willingness to pay is incorporated by means of reservation prices. If the fraction of buyers and sellers is unequal, the <b>match</b> <b>makers</b> are willing to subsidize the short side of the market, while the long side is exploited completely, provided reservation prices are sufficiently high. Competition is then concentrated entirely on the short side. When reservation prices are low, two local monopolies will emerge. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. We {{want some}} bread and meat, and our pipes, {{and a little}} bag or two, {{and two or three}} kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they call <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches.</b> I tell you, many's the time I wished I had some when I was in there before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see, Claude, burning some {{straw and}} then digging, spoils the combs, as Wat does it; now I have got some puff-balls and sulphur {{to put into}} the hole, and set fire to them with a <b>lucifer</b> <b>match,</b> so as to stifle the wasps, and then dig them out quietly to-morrow morning.' ...|$|R
50|$|Dixon found {{commercial}} {{success as a}} manufacturer, first of pill boxes, then of matchboxes and <b>Lucifer</b> <b>matches.</b> This latter enterprise evolved into a timber yard and match manufacturing business, known at various times as Dixon & Nightingale and Dixon Son & Evans, and later as George Evans & Son. It expanded rapidly, and by 1850 had around 450 employees.|$|R
60|$|Away he went, deaf {{to all his}} sister's {{shouts of}} 'Maurice, Maurice,' and they went in, Ada not sorry to be unheard, as she was bent on the grand exploit of {{lighting}} a <b>lucifer</b> <b>match,</b> but Phyllis still pleading for the wafer. They found the schoolroom strewed with Maurice's preparations for fireworks, and Emily's letter on the chimney-piece.|$|R
5000|$|Chicopee {{adopted the}} motto [...] "Industriae Variae", which means [...] "Various Industries". Chicopee {{was home to}} many types of {{industries}} which include cotton mills, woolen mills, textiles, brass foundries and iron foundries, paper making, leather products like boots and shoes, the first <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches,</b> and ship building for the nearby South Hadley Canal, firearms company Crescent-Davis, which specialized in double barrel shotguns.|$|R
60|$|In {{those days}} <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> {{had not been}} invented, and light had to be struck by means of flint, steel, and tinder. The process was tedious {{compared}} with the rapid action of congreves and vestas in the present day. The man chipped away for full three minutes before he succeeded in relighting his candle. This done, the rock was examined.|$|R
6000|$|... 244 Writing to Mr. Lowe on {{his budget}} proposals, Mr. Gladstone Says [...] (April 11, 1871): “The <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> I hope and {{think you would}} [...] carry, but I have little information, and that old. I advise that on [...] this Glyn be {{consulted}} as to the feeling in the House of Commons. I [...] am sceptical as to the ultimate revenue of one million.” ...|$|R
60|$|A straight, dry, and partly-decayed {{stick of}} the Habiscus, {{about six feet}} in length, and half as many inches in diameter, with a smaller bit of wood, not {{more than a foot}} long, and {{scarcely}} an inch wide, is as invariably to be met with in every house in Typee, as a box of <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> in the corner of a kitchen-cupboard at home.|$|R
60|$|By and by I {{found him}} moving. He {{had heard the}} clock strike four, and thought it wiser to repair to his own quarters, where he {{believed}} the disturbance was over. <b>Lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> as yet were not, but {{he had always been}} a noiseless being, with a sailor's foot, so that, by the help of the moonlight through the hall windows, he regained his room.|$|R
5000|$|In 1861, at the Fairfield Works, a {{dilapidated}} site {{that had once}} been used for the manufacture of candles, crinoline and rope, close to the River Lea in Bow, they began to manufacture their own safety matches and [...] "other chemical lights". This site was gradually expanded as a model factory. The public were initially unwilling to buy the more expensive safety matches so they also made the more profitable traditional <b>Lucifer</b> <b>Matches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Holden Park in Oakworth {{occupies}} {{the grounds of}} an historic house owned by Sir Isaac Holden, an inventor {{who is said to}} have invented the <b>lucifer</b> <b>match</b> and revolutionised the process of wool carding. After Holden's death in 1897, his house, called Oakworth House, and its contents were sold at auction, and the house was all but destroyed by fire in 1907. [...] All that remains of the original building is the portico.|$|R
60|$|Regaining new stable {{equilibrium}} he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch {{of the area}} door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a <b>lucifer</b> <b>match</b> by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 Bryant and May {{also took}} over the Gloucester <b>match</b> <b>maker</b> S.J. Moreland and Sons, who made and sold matches under the trade name England's Glory.|$|R

60|$|The captain's cup {{was filled}} to the brim by the {{promotion}} of his first officer to the command of the Conqueror. It {{was by far the}} largest craft which sailed from the port of Sunwich, and its master held a corresponding dignity amongst the captains of lesser vessels. Their allegiance was now transferred to Captain Hardy, and the master of a brig which was in the last stages of senile decay, meeting Nugent in The Goblets, actually showed him by means of two <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> how the collision might have been avoided.|$|R
50|$|He co-produced The Yard Sale, {{which won}} Best Picture at the San Diego Latino Film Festival, and The Little <b>Match</b> <b>Makers,</b> which won Best Picture at the San Diego Indie Fest in 2011.|$|R
50|$|She {{was one of}} the Indonesian icons for {{the beauty}} soap product, Lux. The brand {{launched}} short movies for each of its stars and in 2006 Mariana starred in The <b>Match</b> <b>Maker,</b> directed by Nia Dinata.|$|R
50|$|In 1829 Holden {{obtained}} a {{post at the}} Castle Academy in Reading, Berkshire. It was here that he developed {{a version of the}} <b>Lucifer</b> <b>match,</b> but his invention was superseded by John Walker of Stockton-on-Tees in 1827, who did not patent the invention. The following year Holden returned to Scotland to set up a night school in Glasgow, but after a brief period of teaching he moved in 1830 to become a bookkeeper at Townsends' worsted factory in Cullingworth near Bingley. Transferring to the technical side and becoming a manager, he spent his time at seeking to improve the process of combing wool.|$|R
5000|$|Ball Hughes also {{designed}} numerous wax medallions, {{as well as}} coins for the United States mint, including modifications of Christian Gobrecht's design for the Seated Liberty quarter (1838), and the half dime (1859). In his final years, he began to produce burnt wood pictures (pyroengravings or [...] "poker pictures"), including The Witches of MacBeth (c. 1840), Babylonian Lions (1856), Don Quixote in His Study (1863), The Trumpeter (1864), General Grant Proclaiming the Surrender of Richmond (1865), The Last <b>Lucifer</b> <b>Match</b> (1865), and The Monk (1866). He also lectured on art. Hughes is buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery, Dorchester, Massachusetts.|$|R
6000|$|Finding, {{much to her}} own surprise, {{that her}} fancy was teeming with lovely conceits, she did hope for a quiet evening. But mother wanted a bit of gossip, father must have his papers read to him, the boys had lessons and rips and grievances to be {{attended}} to, May's lullaby could not be forgotten, and the maids had to be looked after, lest burly [...] "cousins" [...] should be hidden in the boiler, or <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> among the shavings. So Psyche's day ended, leaving her very tired, rather discouraged, and almost heart-sick with {{the shadow of a}} coming sorrow.|$|R
2500|$|Lowe was {{a rather}} cut-and-dried economist, who prided himself that during his four years of office he took twelve {{millions}} off taxation; but later opinion has hardly accepted his removal of the shilling registration duty on corn (1869) as good statesmanship, and his failures are remembered rather than his successes. His proposed tax of a halfpenny a box on <b>Lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> in 1871 (for which he suggested the epigram ex luce lucellum, [...] "out of light a little profit") roused a storm of opposition, {{and had to be}} dropped. In 1873 he was transferred to the Home Office, but in 1874 the government resigned.|$|R
50|$|Ling Wu Hei is a {{woman who}} has to pretend to be a male in order to fulfill her family's {{hereditary}} office of court <b>match</b> <b>maker,</b> this leads to difficulties when she falls in love with Ko Fei (Moses Chan) in a society intolerant of homosexuals.|$|R
50|$|Javier Descalza Coronado (born August 11, 1953) is a Mexican retired Luchador, or {{professional}} wrestler, currently {{working as a}} <b>match</b> <b>maker</b> for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Descalza is best known under the ring name Franco Columbo, a name he uses even after retiring from wrestling.|$|R
25|$|On July 3, 2013, the ROH World Championship was {{declared}} vacant {{for the first}} time since its inception, when ROH <b>Match</b> <b>Maker</b> Nigel McGuinness stripped then-champion Jay Briscoe of the title after he was sidelined with a storyline injury and wouldn't be able to compete for the foreseeable future.|$|R
50|$|On {{the press}} conference after the event, Rodrigues {{said he wanted to}} fight former UFC fighter Denis Stojnić in his next fight in FFC. Stojnić later refused that {{proposition}} saying UFC <b>match</b> <b>maker</b> Joe Silva wants him to fight Mirko Cro Cop, Mustapha Al Turk, Andrei Arlovski or Jeff Monson.|$|R
60|$|He {{extinguished}} {{the candle}} by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its {{back to the}} area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited <b>lucifer</b> <b>match,</b> thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.|$|R
50|$|The 3 acre (1.2 hectare) site, {{acquired}} by William Bryant and Francis May in 1861, contained {{a number of}} factories {{that had once been}} used for the manufacture of candles, crinoline and rope, but had fallen into disrepair. Assistance in adapting the site for match making was provided by John Edvard Lundström, the Swedish safety <b>match</b> <b>maker.</b>|$|R
50|$|In July 1874, Samuel Hippey, {{a six-year-old}} child, playing with <b>lucifer</b> <b>matches</b> beneath a straw stack of Mr Ball, the baker, started a {{conflagration}} that spread to two cowsheds. The high wind {{at the time}} scattered burning thatch and straw in all directions and in 20 minutes George Tailby and George Pretty's farms were ablaze, as were four cottages, two occupied by William Faulks and Thomas Skillett, and a pub tenanted by George Watson. These were in Pinfold Lane; {{the position of the}} inn is unrecorded, although it is known from the 1846 Directory that the pub was the Axe and Saw with Mr Pridmore the licensee. The fire covered some 3 acre, and eleven straw stacks caught fire as well.|$|R
