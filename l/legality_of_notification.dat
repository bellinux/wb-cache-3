5000|$|Though fairly {{uncommon}} in democracies, dictatorial regimes often declare {{a state of}} emergency that is prolonged indefinitely {{for the life of the}} regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights. In some situations, martial law is also declared, allowing the military greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. Nicole Questiaux (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive United Nations Special Rapporteurs have recommended to the international community to adopt the following [...] "principles" [...] to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> Proclamation, <b>Notification,</b> Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. [...] "Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also état d'exception).|$|R

40|$|Although the new Criminal Code made {{a series}} of {{amendments}} to the criminal legislation, the regulation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation has not been significantly changed, but only {{from the point of view}} of the structure of governing rules. Thus, while the previous Criminal Code regulated through a single provision both the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, the new Criminal Code has split the content of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and criminal penalties into two principles - the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, by allocating them two separate articles in Chapter I of Title I of the General Part. In this article, we aim to examine the theoretical side of the substance of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and to analyse some of the most important legal issues concerning the application of this principle in the case-law...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> nonforcible counter-measures in {{bilateral}} contexts. The major questions addressed are as follows: (i) do counter-measures constitute an autonomous category of justification for wrongful conduct? (ii) if so, what are the conditions <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> that category? (iii) what are the more significant collateral constraints on the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> countermeasures? and (iv) what {{is the extent to which}} policy considerations contribute towards the determination <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> counter-measures? The study begins with an Introduction which indicates the scope and the outline of the thesis, the terminology employed, and the approach adopted. Chapters One and Two deal with the historical development of the law of reprisals with special reference to non-forcible counter-measures. Chapter Three is entitled "The status of non-forcible counter-measures in customary international law since 1945 : a preliminary sketch". Chapters Four, Five,and Six are devoted to examining the conditions <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> non-forcible counter-measures, viz., (i) breach, (ii) prior demand for reparation; and (iii) proportionality. Chapter Seven examines some of the more significant collateral constraints on the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> counter-measures. In Chapter Eight an attempt will initially be made to examine the circumstances in which the performance of obligations under a treaty may be withheld as a counter-measure. The conclusions reached will then be compared and contrasted with the regime established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Chapter Nine considers the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> counter-measures in the context of a commitment to peaceful settlement. Chapter Ten is concerned with the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> economic coercion, and also with whether the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> that concept has a bearing on the question of lawful counter-measures. The final Chapter summarises the major characteristics of the existing legal regime of counter-measures. </p...|$|R
