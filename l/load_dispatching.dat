Accessing services directly from the Internet data centers inherently incurs high latency due to long RTTs and possible congestions in WAN. To lower the latency, some researchers propose to 'cache' the services at edge clouds or smart routers in the access network which are closer to end users than the Internet cloud. Although 'caching' is a promising technique, placing the services and dispatching users' requests in a way that can minimize the users' access delay and service providers' cost has not been addressed so far. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of service placement and <b>load</b> <b>dispatching</b> in the mobile cloud systems. We show this problem is unique to both the traditional caching problem in mobile networks and the content distribution problem in content distribution networks. We develop a set of efficient algorithms for service providers to achieve various trade-offs among the average latency of mobile users' requests, and the cost of service providers. Our solution utilizes user's mobility pattern and services access pattern to predict the distribution of user's future requests, and then adapt the service placement and <b>load</b> <b>dispatching</b> online based on the prediction.

To promote the integration of wind power and enhance the flexibility of CHP units, this paper presented a method of heat and power <b>load</b> <b>dispatching</b> by exploring the energy storage ability of electric heating boilers and district heating systems. The optimization results indicate that the proposed method can integrate additional wind power into the grid and reduce the coal consumption of CHP units over the optimized period.

Electricity load dispatch is concerned with the production of reliable electricity at the lowest costs, both monetary and environmental, within the limitations of the considered network. In this study, we propose a novel DDDAMS-based economic <b>load</b> <b>dispatching</b> framework for the efficient and reliable real-time dispatching of electricity under uncertainty. The proposed framework includes 1) a database fed from electrical and environmental sensors of a power grid, 2) an algorithm for online state estimation of the considered electrical network using particle filtering, 3) an algorithm for effective culling and fidelity selection in simulation considering the trade-off between computational requirements, and the environmental and economic costs attained by the dispatch, and 4) data driven simulation for mimicking the system response and generating a dispatch configuration which minimizes the total operational and environmental costs of the system, without posing security risks to the energy network. Components of the proposed framework are first validated separately through synthetic experimentation, and then the entirety of the proposed approach is successfully demonstrated for different scenarios in {{a modified version of the}} IEEE- 30 bus test system where sources of distributed generation have been added.

The {{integration}} of dispatchable renewable energies like biomass, geothermal and reservoir hydro technologies into an electrical network present no greater challenge than the {{integration of}} conventional power technologies for which are well understood by Eskom engineers. However, renewable energies {{that are based on}} resources that fluctuate throughout the day and from season to season, like wind and solar, introduce a number of challenges that Eskom engineers have not dealt with before. It is current practice for Eskom‟s generation to follow the load in order to balance the demand and supply. Through Eskom‟s <b>load</b> <b>dispatching</b> desk at National Control, generator outputs are adjusted on an hourly basis with balancing reserves making up {{only a small fraction of}} the total generation. Through the Integrated Resource Plan for Electricity of 2010, the Department of Energy has set some targets towards integrating renewable energy, including wind and solar generation, into the South African electricity market consequently introducing variability on the supply side. With demand that varies continually, maintaining a steady balance between supply and demand is already a challenging task. When the supply also becomes variable and less certain with the introduction of non-dispatchable renewable energy, the task becomes even more challenging. The aim of this research study is to determine whether the resources that previously helped to balance the variability in demand will still be adequate to balance variability in both demand and supply. The study will only concentrate on variable or non-dispatchable renewable energies as will be added to the South African electrical network according to the first two rounds of the Department of Energy‟s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. This research study only looks into the balancing challenge and does not go into an analysis of voltage stability or network adequacy, both of which warrant in depth analysis. Master...|$|E
