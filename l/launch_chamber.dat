After propellant charging was completed, the rocket was loaded tail-first into the launch breech, and a valved plug {{inserted into the}} nozzle. The <b>launch</b> <b>chamber</b> below the breech was charged with gaseous CO2 under pressure, and a launch tube added to the breech.|$|E

[...] Perini Corporation was awarded a $161 million contract to reconfigure the Harold Interlocking, increasing its capacity to accommodate trains bound for Grand Central Terminal and to accept new yard lead tracks to allow trains to enter the storage yards. On February 15, 2008, the MTA awarded Dragados-Judlau a $499 million contract to excavate the LIRR station and track wye caverns. On September 10, 2009, the MTA awarded Yonkers Contracting Company a $40.76 million contract to demolish a building at 44th Street and construct a ventilation plant and station entrance. On September 28, 2009, the MTA awarded Granite-Traylor-Frontiere Joint Venture a $659.2 million contract to employ two 500-ton slurry tunnel boring machines to create the tunnels connecting the LIRR main line and the Port Washington Branch to the tunnel under 41st Avenue (the 63rd Street tunnel).

50|$|Work on the Manhattan side {{includes}} {{building a}} new 8-track train station deep underground and connecting it to the 63rd Street Tunnel's lower level. The new station will be housed in two gigantic caverns blasted out of the Manhattan schist rock formation under the station. A three level structure is being built in each cavern, with a train platform and two tracks each {{on the top and}} bottom levels and a passenger concourse in the middle. The middle levels in the two caverns will be connected by passageways and the west cavern, in turn, will be connected by banks of escalators and elevators to a new concourse being constructed on the lower level of Grand Central Terminal. That concourse will replace ten tracks {{on the west side of}} GCT's Madison Yard. The track connections from the new station to the 63rd Street tunnel were excavated using tunnel boring machines. Dragados/Judlau created a <b>launch</b> <b>chamber</b> for the tunnel boring machines under Second Avenue at 63rd Street in Manhattan using a controlled drill-and-blast method, then assembled and launched each 640-ton machine. The first tunnel boring machine was launched west and southbound from the 63rd Street tunnel in September 2007 and reached Grand Central Terminal in July 2008. The second machine began boring a parallel tunnel in December 2007 and had completed its tunnel at 37th Street on September 30, 2008. Geocomp Corporation was hired to monitor the boring, using a battery of instruments to record vibration, ground settlement and any tilting or drift suffered by the tunnel boring machines. The instruments include inclinometers, extensometers, seismographs, observation wells, dynamic strain gauges, tilt meters and automated motorized total stations with prismatic targets. The next step in construction was to back the tunnel boring machines out of the tunnels and make cast-in-place concrete sections to create the tunnel lining. Each tunnel is 22 ft in diameter and carry trains 140 ft beneath street level. The tunnel boring machines bored an average of 50 ft per day. Cross-connections between the tunnels were created under Park Avenue, between 49th and 51st Streets, by controlled drill-and-blast; the work began in mid-July 2008 and was required between six and eight months to complete.|$|E

These requirements have been tailored specifically for the ECRB East-West Drift design and construction. The allocated requirements for the ECRB East-West Drift are in Sections III through VI. The requirements in sections III through VI contain requirement numbers from the ESFDR, Rev 2, ICN- 1 for reference back to the ESFDR. Each requirement in the ECRB-RD also identifies a trace to the Site Design and Test Requirements Document (YMP/CM- 0021, Rev. 2, ICN- 1) and 10 CFR 60 similar to the style used in the ESFDR.

50|$|In 1928, the Italian Army {{adopted an}} unusual cup-type 38.5 mm rifle grenade {{launcher}} bolted {{to the side of}} a normal Carcano 6.5 mm carbine, the Moschetto di Fanteria Mod. 91/28 con Tromboncino. In use, the rifle's bolt was removed and installed in the launcher chamber. The rifle was placed butt-first against the ground, a grenade loaded down the launchers muzzle and standard rifle round loaded into the grenade launcher's chamber. When fired, the bullet was trapped, the neck of the cartridge case expanded and the gases passed into launcher's barrel through four holes providing the energy needed to launch the grenade. After the grenade was <b>launched,</b> the <b>chamber</b> was opened, ejecting the spent cartridge case and making the bullet fall out. The necessity of changing the rifle bolt kept the rifle out of use until the bolt could be replaced, a slow and clumsy procedure. The bolt-changing procedure could also result in lost rifle bolts in the heat of battle, putting the weapon out of action completely. As a result, this design was not adopted by any other nation. Today, it can be seen as an early, if unsuccessful ancestor of modern under-barrel grenade launchers such as the M203.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "poppet valve" [...] (or simply [...] "poppet") design {{functions}} {{similarly to}} a mechanical blowback or Autococker-style marker; when the trigger is pulled, low-pressure {{air from the}} solenoid brings the bolt forward to chamber the paintball and also sends a connected, weighted ram into a pin valve, which opens to allow high-pressure air into the <b>chamber,</b> <b>launching</b> the ball. Then, either additional air from the solenoid in a [...] "two-way" [...] design, or a spring in a [...] "FASOR" [...] (Forward Air, Spring-Operated Return) design, returns the bolt and ram to the open position. Another paintball drops into the open chamber and the action is ready to fire again. Poppets are typically valued for high gas efficiency, as the low-pressure system to move the ram and the limited time the high-pressure valve is open saves gas compared to most competing designs. However, {{the nature of the}} mechanism produces very loud [...] "pops" [...] when the marker is fired, and the movement of the ram and bolt and the sudden high-pressure release of air can increase recoil, affecting accuracy during rapid fire.
