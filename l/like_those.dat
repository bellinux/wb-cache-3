5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

5|$|Other sounds {{attributed}} to this rail, such as loud screams, may be incorrect, {{since they are}} <b>like</b> <b>those</b> produced by the pale-vented bush-hen (Amaurornis moluccana).|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of Uranus, {{are thought to}} be {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! no,' said Phyllis, 'those {{are some}} Provence roses for Miss Weston and Marianne, because Miss Weston <b>likes</b> <b>those,</b> {{and they have}} none at Broomhill. Redgie {{is going to take}} care of them. I will get you a nosegay, Frank. I did not know you liked it.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Venus of Melos,--Correggio's Venus, (with Mercury {{teaching}} Cupid to read),--and Tintoret's Graces, {{have the}} forms which their designers truly liked {{to see in}} women. They may have been wrong or right in <b>liking</b> <b>those</b> forms, but they carved and painted them for their pleasure, not for vanity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Darn it, Honora, you're {{getting too}} deep for me!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You never <b>liked</b> <b>those,</b> Browning women down at Rivington, {{but if this}} isn't {{browning}} I'm hanged if I know what it is. An attack of nerves, perhaps. They tell me that women go all to pieces nowadays over nothing at all." ...|$|R
5|$|Arsenal's shirts {{have been}} made by {{manufacturers}} including Bukta (from the 1930s until the early 1970s), Umbro (from the 1970s until 1986), Adidas (1986–1994), Nike (1994–2014), and Puma (from 2014). <b>Like</b> <b>those</b> of most other major football clubs, Arsenal's shirts have featured sponsors' logos since the 1980s; sponsors include JVC (1982–1999), Sega (1999–2002), O2 (2002–2006), and Emirates (from 2006).|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{models of}} the Universe were {{proposed}} soon after astronomy began with the Babylonian astronomers, who viewed the Universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 4 further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case No. 1 and Case No. 3.

5|$|Deposits {{recording}} the last 14,000years at Mount Baker indicate that Mount Baker {{has not had}} highly explosive eruptions <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, such as Mount St. Helens, Mount Meager or Glacier Peak, nor has it erupted frequently. During this period, four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have been recently recognized.|$|E
5|$|Emerging economies <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of China and India {{aspire to}} the living {{standards}} of the Western world as does the non-industrialized world in general. It is the combination of population increase {{in the developing world}} and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war, her encounters with the enemy were infrequent. In fact, her next submarine contact did not occur until 17December and, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> before, resulted in no definite damage to the enemy. Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{data also}} allowed for an {{investigation}} into whether visual prominence {{is an important factor}} in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in <b>those</b> countries <b>liking</b> <b>those</b> letters relatively more.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{a strange}} social experiment, to be {{responsible}} for all that. It made me self-conscious, which, inherently, I'm not. People would say, [...] "I'm sick of boho", and now I stand up and say, [...] "But I <b>liked</b> <b>those</b> clothes - it's not my fault that they were copied, you wore them and now you're sick of them. Also, I did not start the trend.".|$|R
5000|$|At the January 2014 TCA conference, Leary and Fisher {{stated that}} the {{producers}} of the British series approached Leary's business partner, Jim Serpico, {{and asked him to}} adapt it for the U.S.. Leary stated, [...] "We really <b>liked</b> <b>those</b> guys, and USA network was pillaging the cast of recently ended Rescue Me and putting them into shows." [...] He added, [...] "we can make some money off these USA people." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1992, Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, London {{divided the}} eight major subfamilies of Bovidae into two major clades {{on the basis}} of their {{evolutionary}} history: the Boodontia, which comprised only the Bovinae, and the Aegodontia, which consisted of the rest of the subfamilies. Boodonts have somewhat primitive teeth, resembling those of oxen, whereas aegodonts have more advanced teeth <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of goats.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} that Robert Hamilton, an archaeologist who worked on the Temple Mount after the 1927 Jericho earthquake, had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations. These included a mosaic <b>like</b> <b>those</b> used in Byzantine churches, and a Jewish mikveh from the Second Temple period.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, the Conservation Authority of Borobudur {{reported}} some severe abrasion of {{the stone}} stairs caused by the scraping of visitors' footwear. The conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect the original stone stairs, just <b>like</b> <b>those</b> installed in Angkor Wat.|$|E
5000|$|The social {{interactions}} he chose for this experimental simulation were declarations of affinity (e.g. “I like Fred,” “I hate Jane”). The theory behind the simulation {{was that people}} <b>liked</b> <b>those</b> who shared their opinions of others, and were also influenced positively by their friends’ opinions and negatively by their enemies’ opinions. Such declarations, Crawford said, were implicit in many pieces of gossip. He produced the following mathematical model: ...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|In all platyhelminths, {{the nervous}} system is {{concentrated}} at the head end. This is least marked in the acoels, which have nerve nets rather <b>like</b> <b>those</b> of cnidarians and ctenophores, but densest around the head. Other platyhelminths have rings of ganglia {{in the head and}} main nerve trunks running along their bodies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, small privately owned dairies began to produce {{handmade}} cheeses from goat and sheep’s milk {{as well as}} cow’s milk, resembling traditional cheeses <b>like</b> <b>those</b> made in rural France, Spain and Italy. Many are made with organic milk. These are now also produced by kibbutzim and the national Tnuva dairy.|$|E
