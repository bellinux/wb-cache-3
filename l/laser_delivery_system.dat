40|$|A partial open beam <b>laser</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> was {{evaluated}} {{in a series}} of 664 lower extremity laser-assisted an-gioplasties performed in 349 consecu-tive patients with atherosclerotic oc-clusive disease. The 2. 5 mm, metal-capped, fiberoptic probe featured a 2 &mu;m central window through which 10 - 20 % active laser light was emitted. In combination with the thermal ef-fect produced by the metal tip, the partial beam probe was designed to more effectively ablate calcified ath-eroma that had been resistant to the closed beam hot tip probes. In 28 (4 %) angioplasties, lesions recalcitrant to the closed beam probe were treated with the partial beam delivery system. This probe opened 23 (82 %) arteries without difficulty. Three of the 5 probe failures were in lengthy occlusions (> 10 cm) in the superficial femoral artery. In the other 2 lesions, the delivery system opened a channel too small for the probe’s body to pass easily. The partial beam <b>laser</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> works satisfactorily in recana-lizing many of the peripheral vessels resistant to the standard closed beam probe...|$|E

Methods: A home–built Nd:Glass {{femtosecond laser}} is used with a CPA system and 1065 µm wavelength. The pulse repetition rate ranges from 1 to 10 KHz, with a maximum pulse energy of about 60 µJ. The <b>laser</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> works through an objective lens on an optical table. The samples are fixed to a 3 –dimensional moving anterior chamber system, which is connected to a micrometric stepper motor. Human corneas are obtained from the French Eye Bank and are divided into 2 groups, according to their pachymetry: Group 1 (n= 10) : 1000 µm +/– 75 µm, and Group 2 (n= 10) : 700 µm +/– 45 µm. The control group is composed of silicon dioxide samples. The treated corneas are analyzed through confocal microscopy. Results: At plasma threshold, the average cavitation bubble diameter is: 6 µm +/– 7 µm in the Group 1 corneas, 25 µm +/– 1. 5 µm in the Group 2 corneas and 2 +/– 1 µm in the silicon dioxide samples. In group 2 corneas and silicon dioxide samples, the majority of laser pulses generated cavitation bubbles. In group 1 corneas, far fewer of the laser pulses induced cavitation bubbles. The {{time it takes for}} one cavitation bubble to disappear is: 90 +/– 10 seconds for a 25 µm cavitation bubble, 25 +/– 5 seconds for a 6 µm cavitation bubble, and 10 minutes in the silicon samples.

40|$|A {{sapphire}} {{contact probe}} laser catheter {{was developed to}} increase the dimensions of tunnels created by laser angioplasty. The device consisted of a round sapphire probe (2. 2 mm diameter) attached to an 8 F catheter into which a 0. 2 mm optical fiber was inserted with a tip maintained at 3 mm from the sapphire. The fiber was connected to a continuous wave neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser. A saline perfusate was circulated through the catheter during laser emissions to prevent excessive heating of the fiber tip. The system was used in vitro on 16 sections of atherosclerotic calcified human cadaver aortic walls, using diluted blood as a medium, at powers ranging from 10 to 40 W and exposure times from 1 to 4 seconds. Six craters were created at each energy level. The system was also used on six human cadaver, agar-embedded, obstructed iliac and femoral arteries, using 40 W and 2 second laser emissions. Dimensions of probe-created craters were compared with those obtained using bare fibers. The shape of the probe craters {{was that of a}} trun- cated cone with the entry hole wider than the exit, as opposed to the cylindrical shape created with unmodified bare fibers. At 120 J (seconds × watts), areas of entry and exit probe-formed holes were greater than those created with the bare fibers (6. 7 ± 0. 5 and 3. 4 ± 0. 6 versus 0. 2 ± 0. 01 mm 2, respectively, p < 0. 001).

Over {{the past decade or so}} there have been significant advances in the design and development of computer assisted image guided surgery systems that can potentially perform complex tasks with high dexterity, speed and flexibility. The aim of this research work is to investigate various aspects in the design of a new computer assisted surgical tool capable of sawing, drilling and sculpturing of bone. in support of image guided surgery that aims to reduce invasiveness, minimise blood loss and improve surgical outcome. The research of this thesis focuses on the design of an active positioning system (robotic end-effector) that uses a laser to cut bone to replace some of the currently available tools. This thesis starts by reviewing medical lasers and laser delivery systems, and discussing the effects of different lasers and lasers' parameters on tissue ablation time, rate and depth. It then defines criterion for the selection of the most appropriate laser and <b>laser</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> for bone cutting, drilling and sculpturing applications. Secondly, the thesis presents a unique design of a robotic laser end-effector. This end-effector is designed to provide accurate laser guidance for precise surgical performance (tissue ablation). This design is supported by an in-depth forward and inverse kinematic analysis to determine the end-effector workspace, resolution, positioning accuracy and manipulation flexibility. Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, the thesis presents two innovative laser feedback techniques, developed by the author, to determine the laser ablation depth and rate in real time during laser tissue interaction. These techniques are presented with complete analysis and supported by real time feedback examples. The techniques showed high measurement accuracy and reliability.

However, periodontal anti-inflammatory therapy should not be limited to these parameters, but also should initiate tissue regeneration including bone tissue damaged by the disease. The aim of the investigation was to evaluate feasibility and characterize the process of laser microablative tunnel formation in gingiva and alveolar bone using a pulse-periodic, single mode Er laser, and determine laser parameters providing appropriate size of the tunnel and coagulation zone needed to initiate healing and regeneration of the alveolar bone. Materials and Methods. Ex vivo pig jaw was used {{as a model for the}} study. To create a through-gingiva microperformation of the alveolar bone, we used a laboratory prototype of Er <b>laser</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> Alta PE-AT (Dental Photonics, Inc.). Results. We performed a microperforation of a 1 mm thick gingiva and created a microcrater (tunnel) in the underlying bone using a single pulse with energy 5, 10 and 30 mJ. The laser tunnel characteristics in the gingiva, bone and dentine were characterized as a function of laser irradiation parameters. Optical microscopy and histology examination did not reveal carbonization or significant collateral damage of the bone tissue. Conclusion. Using a laboratory prototype of Alta PE-AT Er laser we demonstrated feasibility of through gingiva laser microperforation of alveolar bone that can serve as the first step towards further study of healing and initiation of the alveolar bone regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Multimode {{optical fibers}} enable {{efficient}} flexible <b>laser</b> beam <b>delivery</b> {{but at a}} loss {{in the quality of}} the delivered beam. The fiber-optic beam <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> effectiveness is strengthened by the optimal selection of its components not only for minimizing beam quality degradation but also for robustness. Smaller fibers tend to produce less degradation to beam quality but the minimum usable fiber size is limited by the quality of the laser beam, focusing optic, and the numerical aperture of the fiber. Selection of appropriate fiber type is important because the characteristics of the output beam enhance or degrade the utility of the fiber-optic-delivered beam for different applications. The other components of the beam <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> also impact performance. High-power handling requires high- quality fiber end-face finish and special connectors that can withstand back-reflections. Recent developments in optical materials allow manufacture of very low aberration optics useful for short focal length lenses in output optics. Harnessing the power of a high- power laser requires that knowledgeable and prudent choices be made when selecting the laser and its beam <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> We will focus on issues relevant to understanding and specifying a fiber-optic beam <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> and provide guidelines for specifying a system. Data obtained with high power Nd:YAG lasers will be used as examples...|$|R
40|$|Laser bending is a {{much more}} refined and {{controllable}} bending technique compared to conventional techniques. Laser bending has been applied to micro-scale bending in the microelectronics industry as well as large scale bending in automobile production due to its high levels of accuracy and reproducibility. ^ In this dissertation, experimental techniques and numerical models are developed to study pulsed and CW laser microbending. The experimental set-up includes a <b>laser</b> beam <b>delivery</b> <b>system,</b> an optical system for bending angle measurement, and a 2 -D optical scanner with a computer-based motion controller. Relationships between the bending angle and laser operating parameters are studied. Ceramic, silicon and stainless steel samples are chosen for the experiments. The bending results for the different materials are compared. ^ Numerical calculations were performed using the finite element method to calculate the thermomechanical effect induced by laser irradiation and the resulting bending. An uncoupled thermo-mechanical FEA model for simulations of laser bending is discussed. Four laser bending simulations are presented in detail: 3 D finite element analysis of pulsed laser bending, 2 D finite element analysis of the effect of melting and solidification in pulsed laser bending, simulation of laser curvature adjustment of hard disk drive suspension, and simulation of microscale densification during femto-second laser processing of dielectric materials. ^ During the research on laser high precision bending, it is found that our experimental techniques and fundamentals of the thermo-mechanical process involved can also be applied to many other areas of laser applications and nano-technology. For example, the technique of optical deflection measurement can be used to develop a microcantilever-based biosensor for biological molecular detection. By transplanting the optical deflection measuring technique, we show {{that it is possible to}} detect a cantilever deflection as small as 1 nm. Polymer materials are used to machine the microcantilevers, which are proven to be a cheaper and more sensitive alternative to the traditional material, i. e., silicon. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the research {{is to determine the}} feasibility of the prototype photoacoustic scanner to quantify localized blood perfusion and fractional plasma volume in vivo utilizing an exogenous dye within a breast cancer xenograft tumor model coupled with a dynamic contrast enhanced imaging protocol. ^ Methods and Materials: The prototype photoacoustic scanner was tested for motion artifacts during individual scans that exceeded the 154 micron theoretical spatial resolution utilizing phantoms. The <b>laser</b> optical <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> was also tested and optimized to minimize non-uniformities over the field of view. An isoflurane anesthetic <b>delivery</b> and scavenge <b>system</b> were designed and added to the scanner. Animal models were developed using the breast cancer cell lines MB-MDA- 231 and BT- 474. These were xenografted onto athymic nude mice. A synthesized arterial input function was produced utilizing measurements obtained with DCE-CT scans. 4 D image coregistration was performed to allow for measuring identical regions between DCE-CT and DCE-PCT scans. This data was then able to be used for compartmental modeling of dynamic contrast enhanced photoacoustic data. The perfusion and fractional plasma volume values as determined by DCE-PCT were then able to be compared to the values as measured by DCE-CT. A series of fiber optic dosimetry probes were also fabricated and calibrated to aid in measuring laser fluence within the photoacoustic scanner. ^ Results: The photoacoustic scanner was adjusted to have in scan motion less than that of the theoretical spatial resolution. The synthesized arterial input function was determined to have the same general shape, and peak timing as that of individual arterial input functions measured by both DCE-CT and DCE-PCT scans. A fiber optic dosimetry probe with a diameter of 1. 5 mm and a concentration of 5 mg/mL titanium dioxide was determined to yield a coefficient of variation of ∼ 7 %. Compartmental fitting after coregistration was performed to determine blood perfusion and fractional plasma volume. ^ Conclusion: This study explored the feasibility of a prototype photoacoustic scanner to quantify localized blood perfusion and fractional plasma volume in vivo using a dynamic contrast enhanced imaging protocol in a xenograft tumor model. The perfusion and fractional plasma volumes determined by DCE-PCT did not obtain statistically significant correlation to those same measurements as determined by DCE-CT. ...|$|R
