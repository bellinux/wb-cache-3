30|$|Interestingly, the RNA {{substrate}} induced conformational {{changes are}} {{correlated with the}} specific structural feature of the RNA <b>terminal</b> <b>loops.</b> It was obvious that the pre-miR- 151 and pre-miR- 151 A 3 I with the same predicted <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structure both induced hDicer into the open state (Fig.  4 D and 4 E). In contrast, the pre-miR- 151 A 1 I and pre-miR- 151 -A 13 I with a different predicted <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structure from that of pre-miR- 151 both induced hDicer into the close state (Fig.  4 B and 4 C). Such a conformational change variation also correlated to the dicing activities of these substrates by hDicer as shown earlier. Therefore, the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structural change caused by A-to-I edition of pre-miR- 151 induces specific conformational change of hDicer that represents the enzyme’s different activity states.|$|R

30|$|ADAR 1 P 110 is a {{constitutive}} expressed isoform of ADAR 1 protein {{which are}} {{proved to be}} a homo-dimer when functions as an RNA editing enzyme (Nishikura, 2010). ADAR 1 mediated A-to-I deamination reaction on dsRNA is the major RNA editing form in human cells (Blow et al., 2006; Kawahara et al., 2007 b; Nishikura, 2010). Pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA share a feature structure of dsRNA which is susceptible to be substrates of ADAR 1 family (Nishikura, 2010). Many pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA are predicted to be targets of ADAR 1 proteins and some pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA, for example pre-miR- 142 (Yang et al., 2006), pri-miR- 151 (Kawahara et al., 2007 a) and pri-miR- 376 (Kawahara et al., 2007 b), have been proved to be targets of ADAR 1 by biochemical assays. The adenosine converted into inosine happening near the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> of pre-miR- 151 could make terminal structure rearranged following the nucleotide changed in <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> (Fig.  2 B). Our structural prediction data confirmed the structural changes of <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> within edited pre-miR- 151.

Agreeing with the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structure’s importance, our in vitro cleavage assay showed that the pre-miR- 151 A 1 I and pre-miR- 151 A 13 I with changed terminal structure reduced the endonuclease activity of hDicer (Fig.  3 B), while the A-to-I editing at + 3 site only with little <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structural change does not affect hDicer’s activity.|$|R

50|$|On 7 October 1974, the {{tunneling}} {{work began}} {{to construct the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>loop,</b> which {{is connected to the}} Schwabstrasse station, branching structures, and 60-meter-long sections of two single-track tubes of the Hasenbergtunnel, started in 1979, to connect to the Gäubahn. The front section of the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> is located in depleted anhydrite, which is brittle in consistency. For this reason, and because the thin vertical cover in the area, the rock above the tunnel roof ridge was stabilized by artificially freezing the ground water (Bodenvereisung). In the rear of the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> section, undepleted anhydrite posed different problems, because this mineral, when it comes in contact with water, tends to massively expand, which puts enormous pressure on the tunnel structure. For this reason, the inner shell of the tunnel in the area is up to 1 metre thick.|$|R
40|$|The {{terminal}} {{structure of}} the linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from three yeast species has been examined. By enzymatic digestion, alkali denaturation, and sequencing of cloned termini, it was shown that in Pichia pijperi and P. jadinii, both termini of the linear mtDNA were made of a single-stranded loop covalently joining the two strands, {{as in the case}} of vaccinia virus DNA. The left and right loop sequences were in either of two orientations, suggesting the existence of a flip-flop inversion mechanism. Contiguous to the <b>terminal</b> <b>loops,</b> inverted <b>terminal</b> repeats were present. The mtDNA from Williopsis mrakii seems to have an analogous structure, although <b>terminal</b> <b>loops</b> could not be directly demonstrated. Electron microscopy revealed the presence, among linear molecules, of a small number of circular DNAs, mostly of monomer length. Linear and circular models of replication are considered, and possible conversion mechanisms between linear and circular forms are discussed. A flip-flop inversion mechanism between the inverted repeat sequences within a circular intermediate may be involved in the generation of the linear form of mtDNA...|$|R

30|$|Almost all pre-miRNAs in {{eukaryotic}} cytoplasm {{are recognized}} and processed into double-stranded microRNAs by the endonuclease Dicer protein comprising of multiple domains. As {{a key player}} in the small RNA induced gene silencing pathway, the major domains of Dicer are conserved among different species {{with the exception of the}} N-terminal components. Human Dicer’s N-terminal domain has been shown to play an auto-inhibitory function of the protein’s dicing activity. Such an auto-inhibition can be released when the human Dicer protein dimerizes with its partner protein, such as TRBP, PACT through the N-terminal DExH/D (ATPase-helicase) domain. The typical feature of a pre-miRNA contains a <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> and a stem duplex, which bind to human Dicer’s DExH/D (ATPase-helicase) domain and PAZ domain respectively during the dicing reaction. Here, we show that pre-miRNA’s <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> can regulate human Dicer’s enzymatic activity by interacting with the DExH/D (ATPase-helicase) domain. We found that various editing products of pre-miR- 151 by the ADAR 1 P 110 protein, an A-to-I editing enzyme that modifies pre-miRNAs sequence, have different <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structures and different activity regulatory effects on human Dicer. Single particle electron microscopy reconstruction revealed that pre-miRNAs with different <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> structures induce human Dicer’s DExH/D (ATPase-helicase) domain into different conformational states, in correlation with their activity regulatory effects.|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> is in leached Gipskeuper rock.

There was a geological problem as the back of the <b>terminal</b> <b>loop</b> was situated in Gipskeuper layers containing anhydrite, which swell strongly when in contact with water, which is inevitable in a tunnel, and create strong forces {{on the sides of the}} tunnel. Accordingly, the inner shell of the tunnel is up to 1 m thick.|$|R
50|$|The fourth torc is a <b>looped</b> <b>terminal</b> torc, {{complete}} {{and in good}} condition. It is made from eight gold wires twisted together.

This might have been made for a local chieftain by a craftsman who had learned his craft in the Mediterranean region, and with the third torc suggests significant links between Scotland and Southern Europe. There are no directly comparable other artefacts. The last significant find of torcs in Scotland was in 1857, when gold ribbon torcs were found on Law Farm, Moray. The eclecticism of the styles and origins is comparable to that of the objects in the Broighter Hoard from Northern Ireland, probably of a slightly later period.|$|R
