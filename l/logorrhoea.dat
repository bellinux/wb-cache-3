5000|$|Logorrhea or <b>logorrhoea</b> (from Greek λογόρροια, logorrhoia, [...] "word-flux") is an {{excessive}} flow of words.

The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.|$|E

Logorrhea is sometimes {{classified as a}} mental illness, resulting {{from a variety of}} psychiatric and neurological disorders including aphasia, localized cortical lesions in the thalamus, mania, or most typically in catatonic schizophrenia.|$|E

50|$|The word <b>logorrhoea</b> {{is often}} used pejoratively to {{describe}} prose which is highly abstract, and, consequently, contains little concrete language. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems as though it makes no sense, and that all the words are excessive. Writers in academic fields which concern themselves mostly with the abstract, such as philosophy, especially postmodernism, often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas. In an attempt to prove this lack of academic rigor, physics professor Alan Sokal wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (Social Text) as a practical joke. The journal kept defending it as a genuine article even after its own author rebuked the editors publicly in a subsequent article in another academic journal. The episode {{has come to be}} known as the Sokal Affair.|$|E
5000|$|One {{character}} speaks at a {{time and}} only when a strong spotlight shines in his or her face. The style is reminiscent of Mouth’s <b>logorrhoea</b> http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/logorrhea%20 in Not I, the obvious difference being that these characters constantly use first person pronouns. Clichés and puns abound. While one is talking the other two are silent and in darkness. They neither acknowledge the existence of the others around them (M: “To think we were never together”) nor appear aware of anything outside their own being and past (W2: “At the same time I prefer this to [...] [...] [...] the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments”). Beckett writes that this spotlight [...] "provokes" [...] the character's speech, and insists that whenever possible, a single, swivelling light should be used, rather than separate lights switching on and off. In this manner the spotlight is “expressive of a unique inquisitor”. Billie Whitelaw referred to it as “an instrument of torture.” The spotlight is in effect the play’s fourth character.|$|E
50|$|Back in Hackers office, Sir Humphrey seems uncharacteristically {{detached}} and the Minister {{asks him}} about the Mails story. Hacker is interested to know {{the identity of the}} offending civil servant, and, as everything is documented, the information is bound to be on file somewhere. He tells Sir Humphrey of his plan to allow Andrews a free run of the departmental papers under the 30-year rule. The Permanent Secretary is mortified and tries every argument he can think of on the grounds of national security, but to no avail. Dejected, he walks out. Hacker is puzzled over Sir Humphreys demeanour and confides in Bernard. They both realise that it may have been Sir Humphrey himself who was responsible for messing up the MoD contract, and a glance at Whos Who confirms it. Hacker is quietly gleeful and asks Bernard to invite Sir Humphrey back in. The mandarin does not walk in confidently as is his habit, but instead timidly puts his head around the door. Hacker states that he wants an inquiry to establish the name of the official who was in charge, and subsequently wasted £40 million of taxpayers money. Sir Humphrey gives the Minister a list of costly government projects that have been perceived as failures, but Hacker is adamant. A demoralised Sir Humphrey sits down and confesses all, with typical <b>logorrhoea.</b> The Minister forgives him and pledges to conceal the offending papers from the Daily Mail — so long as Sir Humphrey agrees not to discipline South Derbyshire. He concurs, and already has to hand a list of the standard government reasons for exempting information from the 30-year rule: it covers every document in the file.|$|E
40|$|A {{disinhibition}} syndrome affecting speech (with <b>logorrhoea,</b> delirium, jokes, laughs, inappropriate comments, extraordinary confabulations), was {{the main}} manifestation of a right-sided thalamic infarct involving the dorsomedian nucleus, intralaminar nuclei and medial part of the ventral lateral nucleus. Resolution of conflicting tasks was severely impaired, suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction. These abnormalities correlated with the finding on SPECT of a marked hypoperfusion in the overlying hemisphere predominating in the frontal region. We suggest that this behavioural syndrome was produced by disconnecting the dorsomedian nucleus from the frontal lobe and limbic system...|$|E
40|$|BY {{acquired}} aphasia {{in children}} we mean the language disorganizations resulting from focal cerebral lesions occurring during childhood. In such circumstances aphasia consists in a regression of psycho-linguistic performances which has some analogies with the aphasic disorders {{in the adult}} but differs from it in that the disturbance bears upon the function of language and, more generally, upon the nervous system during their maturation. Acquired aphasia in children is entirely different from retarded speech often unfortunately labelled congenital aphasia, charac-terized by a defect in language elaboration at the origin of which there is or {{there is not a}} cerebral lesion. Acquired aphasia in children has been known for long but a few studies only have been devoted to this subject. It is common belief that it is a rare disorder and moreover that it is remarkably transitory so that sequelae are very few or absent. Exception being made for isolated cases, the work of E. Guttmann (1942) is the earliest comprehensive review of the symptomatology and evolution. Guttmann (1942) reported 16 patients with aphasia among 30 {{children under the age of}} 14 having hemispheric lesions. He emphasized the fact that the aphasia was characterized by a reduction of verbal expression, whatever the situation of the lesion; in other terms that jargonaphasia and <b>logorrhoea</b> did not occur. The rapidity of recovery of the language was remarkable. Further-more, Guttmann (1942) pointed to the intellectual deficiencies which may last, and rightly ascribed them to brain damage rather than to aphasia. A. Branco Lefevre (1950) and J. de Ajuriaguerra (1958) con-firmed Guttmann's observations and drew attention to the disorders of written speech and to the fact that recovery progresses often less quickly than it is commonly admitted. In this paper we report 32 children suffering from acquired aphasia, studied during several years, while rehabilitation was carried out. De-tailed results of this study will be published elsewhere. We report here the general conclusions under three heads corresponding to the thre...|$|E
