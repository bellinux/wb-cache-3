A new LED <b>lighting</b> <b>package,</b> {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew.

Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights to the base of Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E

The ambient interior <b>lighting</b> <b>package</b> consisted of the installation of electroluminescence that gave the driver the ability to choose various color combinations for the instrument cluster, sound system and climate control displays, as well as light emitting {{from the top of}} the front footwells and from beneath the rear seats.|$|E

The experimental study of <b>light</b> <b>packaging</b> waste pyrolysis has brought some valuable information on: mass variation and balance (the results can be applied on a kinetic model development), activation energy, energy potential of solid and liquid by-products and chemical composition of solid and liquid pyrolysis products. The optimal temperature for <b>light</b> <b>packaging</b> waste pyrolysis (paper, cardboard and plastics) was established to be more than 500 °C. This experimental study leads to the optimisation of air gasification process parameters at industrial scale in a rotary reactor lab-pilot installation using <b>light</b> <b>packaging</b> waste mixtures. It was concluded that hhigher equivalent ration lowers the gas quality because of oxidization reactions at occurs at the being of the process.

500|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the <b>lighting</b> <b>package,</b> including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the <b>lighting</b> <b>package.</b> The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.|$|E

The more you can warp the frame a little bit, the more it speaks towards what’s going on". The film was shot hand-held, digitally with multiple cameras, often with a RED Epic, and used a Lensbaby Composer with Double Glass lens on a Canon 7D to differentiate certain scenes.|$|E

50|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Clair, consisting of Martin Audio products including WSX subwoofers and W8C loudspeakers, which were powered by Martin MA 2.8 and 4.2 power amplifiers. Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill did not use stage monitors or in-ear monitors; instead they relied on custom-made speaker cabinets to monitor themselves, a ritual that both Gibbons and Hill have used for years. Bandit Lites provided the <b>lighting</b> <b>package,</b> including mostly Vari-Lite fixtures, with VL3000 and VL2500 spotlights, as well as VL3500 floodlights. Martin Light MAC2000 floodlights, Atomic 3000 strobe lights and Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12 LED fixtures completed the <b>lighting</b> <b>package.</b> The lighting was controlled by a grandMA lighting control console. In 2005, the band had custom microphone stands made by John A. Douglas, who designed one of several skull-themed drum kits for Frank Beard used on the tour.

50|$|The first Kino Flo {{unit was}} created in 1987, during the filming of the movie Barfly. Director of {{photography}} Robby Müller was filming in a cramped interior, and couldn't fit traditional lights into the location. In order to work around the problem, the film's gaffer Frieder Hochheim and best boy Gary Swink designed a high-output fluorescent light that had a remote ballast, allowing the lamp unit to become small and lightweight enough to be taped to the wall. Hochheim and Swink subsequently created a company, Kino Flo Incorporated, to manufacture and market their innovation to the film industry. The new lights were quickly embraced by cinematographers, and now are considered a staple of a standard motion picture <b>lighting</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
