5|$|By the 7th century Reculver {{had become}} a <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the {{establishment}} of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.|$|E

25|$|A heerlijkheid (a Dutch word; pl. heerlijkheden; {{also called}} heerschap; Latin: Dominium) was a <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> {{that served as}} the lowest {{administrative}} and judicial unit in rural areas in the Dutch-speaking Low Countries before 1800. It originated as a unit of lordship under the feudal system during the Middle Ages. The English equivalents are manor, seigniory, and lordship. The heerlijkheid system was the Dutch version of manorialism that prevailed in the Low Countries and was the precursor to the modern municipality system in the Netherlands and Flemish Belgium.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in America, John Read {{purchased}} a large <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> in Cecil County, Maryland, and founded, with six associates, the city of Charlestown, on the headwaters of Chesapeake Bay, twelve years after Baltimore was begun, {{with the intention of}} creating a new market for the northern trade, and thus developing northern Maryland and building up the neighboring iron works of the Principio Company, in which the older generations of the Washington family, and at a later period General George Washington himself, were also largely interested.|$|E
25|$|Folklore {{seems to}} have favoured the loser {{in the battle of}} the giants, as Goram is commemorated in the {{features}} Goram’s Chair and Footprint (some versions seem to treat these as the same thing, saying that the Chair was formed by the giant stamping his foot) and Soap-Dish in the gorge of the Hazel Brook. Perhaps the nearby feature Lover’s Leap also recalls the legend, but this is a conventional name for precipices which often have unsubstantiated tales of lovers' suicides attached. A pub of the early 1960s on the Lawrence Weston housing estate in west Bristol is called The Giant Goram, and there was formerly (from about 1954 sporadically to 1996) a funfair bearing Goram’s name on the Blaise Castle <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> (by then in the hands of Bristol City Council) in Henbury.|$|E

25|$|As {{land prices}} and incomes {{continued}} to fall, the great London palaces {{were the first}} casualties; the peer no longer needed to use his London house to maintain a high prestige presence in the capital. Its site was often more valuable empty than with the anachronistic palace in situ; selling them for redevelopment was the obvious first choice to raise some fast cash. The second choice was to sell part of the <b>landed</b> <b>estate,</b> especially if had been purchased in order to expand political territory. In fact, the buying of land in earlier times, before the reforms of 1885, to expand political territory had had a detrimental effect on country houses too. Often when a second estate was purchased to expand another, the purchased estate also had a country house. If the land (and its subsequent local influence) was the only requirement, its house would then be let or neglected, often both. This was certainly the case at Tong Castle (see below) and many other houses. A large unwanted country house unsupported by land quickly became a liability.|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, Eugene Onegin is a bored Saint Petersburg dandy, {{whose life}} {{consists}} of balls, concerts, parties and nothing more. One day he inherits a <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> from his uncle. When {{he moves to}} the country, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, a starry-eyed young poet named Vladimir Lensky. One day, Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fiancée, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting he also catches a glimpse of Olga's sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic and the exact opposite of Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech {{is often referred to as}} Onegin's Sermon: he admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other Nazi {{concentration}} camps across German-occupied Europe, in which prisoners {{were used as}} forced labour for the German war effort, death camps (Vernichtungslager) like Treblinka, Bełżec, and Sobibór had only one function: to kill those sent there. To prevent incoming victims from realising its nature, Treblinka II was disguised as a transit camp for deportations further east, complete with made-up train schedules, a fake train-station clock with hands painted on it, names of destinations, a fake ticket window, and the sign [...] "Ober Majdan", a code word for Treblinka commonly used to deceive passengers departing from Western Europe. Majdan was a prewar <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> [...] away from the camp.|$|E

500|$|In 1812, {{the priest}} {{responsible}} for the church was Edward Hughes, whose wife was the niece of the owner of Llys Dulas, the <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> in the area. He employed an architect to carry out some further restoration work, although the details are unknown. [...] The church {{was in need of}} further repair {{by the middle of the}} 19th century, and the congregation needed a larger building. [...] A new church was therefore built between 1854 and 1856 about two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) away, financed largely by the widow of William Hughes, 1st Baron Dinorben (the son of Edward Hughes). The old church, which was allowed to fall into ruins, stands in a disused cemetery surrounded by trees.|$|E
500|$|Fillmore was {{the first}} {{president}} to return to private life without being independently wealthy or {{in possession of a}} <b>landed</b> <b>estate,</b> and, with no pension to anticipate, was unsure how he would make a living consistent with the dignity of his former office. His friend, Judge Hall, assured him that it would be proper for him to practice law in the higher courts of New York, and Fillmore intended to do so. The Fillmores had planned a tour of the South after leaving the White House, but Abigail caught a cold at President Pierce's inauguration, developed pneumonia, and died in Washington on March 30, 1853. [...] A saddened Fillmore returned to Buffalo for the burial. The fact that he was in mourning limited his social activities, and he made ends meet on the income from his investments. [...] He was bereaved again on July 26, 1854 when his only daughter Mary died of cholera.|$|E
500|$|Reculver {{was part}} of a <b>landed</b> <b>estate</b> of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent by the 7th century, {{possibly}} with a royal toll-station or a [...] "significant coastal trading settlement," [...] given the types and quantity of coins found there. Other early Anglo-Saxon finds include a fragment of a gilt bronze brooch, or fibula, which was originally circular and set with coloured stones or glass, a claw beaker and pottery. Antiquarians such as the 18th-century clergyman John Duncombe believed that King Æthelberht of Kent moved his royal court there from Canterbury in about 597, and built a palace {{on the site of the}} Roman ruins. However, archaeological excavation has shown no evidence of this; Æthelberht's household would have been peripatetic, and the story has been described as probably a [...] "pious legend". A church was built on the site of the Roman fort in about 669, when King Ecgberht of Kent granted land for the foundation of a monastery, which was dedicated to St Mary.|$|E

500|$|Many constituencies, {{especially}} those with small electorates, were {{under the control of}} rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be in the pockets of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large <b>landed</b> <b>estate.</b> Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that [...] "The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!" [...] T. H. B. Oldfield claimed in his Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election.|$|E
500|$|One of de la Pole's first {{commissions}} {{under the}} new regime was to accompany Edward [...] on his campaign against the Scots in winter 1462, although he had returned to Norwich by early the next year. Suffolk also attended the reinterment of the king's uncle and cousins, Richard, Earl of Salisbury and his son Thomas at Bisham Priory in 1463. Soon after, Suffolk's dukedom was confirmed to him by Edward IV in letters patent dated 23 March (possibly, it has been suggested, on account of contemporary uncertainty {{as to whether he}} ever had been downgraded in 1460). He actually took seisin of his estates six months before coming of age, and was absolved from having to prove his age as was the legal custom. He was a trier of petitions at the parliament later that year. In 1465, the king granted Suffolk an annuity of 100 marks (nearly £67) a year, although this was only during the life of his wife, the king's sister. It may only have been compensation for lands lost by Edward's need to endow his queen with a <b>landed</b> <b>estate.</b> Two years later, in a clear mark of royal favour, his eldest son John was created Earl of Lincoln. Suffolk himself regained his father's Wallingford and Chiltern Hundreds offices, with a £40 per annum salary for it. In 1467, he acted as feoffee for his sister-in-law (the King's sister), Anne, Duchess of Exeter.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of <b>land</b> <b>estates</b> and farm-sizes {{are the basis}} of a competitive agricultural production, hence these questions belong to the evergreen themes both of theory and practice also on international level. In Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), the change of political and economic regime virtually tore into the agriculture in beginning of 1990 s, destroying the existing {{structure of}} <b>land</b> <b>estates</b> by the privatization, restitutions or restoration of ownership rights resulting in fragmentation of land ownership. Over the past 10 - 15 years this situation has not undergone any fundamental changes. Due to economic and political situation in the transition countries market forces can not function as primary engine for land consolidation. For that very reason the land-estate policy is of outmost importance nowadays in these countries. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} show the process of agricultural reforms driven mainly by <b>land</b> <b>estate</b> policy in connection with their outcomes in CEECs. <b>land</b> <b>estate</b> policy, <b>land</b> ownership, land use, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
