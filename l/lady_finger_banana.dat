40|$|This study {{involved}} traditional and molecular methods {{to track the}} movement of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in the vascular system of banana. Traditional studies were conducted in the field using naturally-infected <b>Lady</b> <b>finger</b> <b>banana</b> plants, and molecular studies are currently being conducted at UQ using banana plants artificially-inoculated with GFP-transformed Foc isolates in the glasshouse. Panama disease is a polycyclic disease where inoculum causing infection is produced in individual plants infected {{during the course of}} the epidemic. This field study clearly demonstrated that the sap produced in such plants will be contaminated with Foc, and will contribute to epidemic build-up if allowed to contaminate the soil. Thus, sap as a source of inoculum is very important when managing disease containment. The study also suggested that the laticifers are not colonised by Foc and that when a pseudostem is cut, the sap from the laticifers is contaminated by inoculum from severed vascular strands and/or associated necrotic tissues. It is difficult to separate these tissues, but results suggest that mycelial fragments may come from severed vascular strands or xylem fluid, and microconidia from necrotic cells adjacent to the vascular bundles. It is anticipated that GFP-transformed isolates being used in the experiment at UQ will provide more definitive evidence on the systemic infection process of Foc in banana. It will determine whether movement in the vascular tissue is via mycelial growth or microconidia, and may explain why the incubation and latent periods for the disease are often so long. Chemical intervention to reduce inoculum levels may be possible but will require much more detailed research. The production of a volatile chemical (bicyclo(4, 2, 0) octa- 1, 3, 5 -triene) detected in this study by race 4 strains of Foc in culture is interesting and presents the opportunity for detection of disease by “sniffer” dogs before external disease symptoms are produced. Whether this chemical is produced in infected plants is yet to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Bananas are an {{extremely}} important crop, serving as both a staple food in developing countries and as a dessert fruit in Western society. Two of the most devastating pathogens currently affecting both commercial and subsistence banana production are Fusarium oxysporum (Foc; causal agent of Fusarium wilt) and Mycosphaerella species (causal agent of black and yellow Sigatoka). Conventional breeding programs designed to improve the disease resistance characteristics of the commercially elite Cavendish cultivar have, thus far, been largely unsuccessful. Genetic engineering is now regarded as the most promising method to generate enhanced disease resistance in banana. In other crops and model species, strategies to enhance disease resistance have included the transgenic expression of defense-related genes such as; disease resistance genes (R genes), downstream signaling genes (eg. NPR 1, non-pathogenesis related) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The overall aims of this research were to amplify and compare the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domains of potential disease resistance genes from disease resistant and disease susceptible banana cultivars. To isolate and compare complete R gene sequences from these cultivars. To generate transgenic <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>banana</b> plants expressing the D 4 E 1 antimicrobial peptide {{under the control of}} two different promoters and finally to assess extracts from these plants for their ability to inhibit the growth of Foc Race 1. Using degenerate primers, the NBS domains of six resistance gene candidate (RGC) sequences were amplified from the disease resistant cultivar Calcutta 4 (C 4) and the disease susceptible cultivar Cavendish (Cav). The RGC 1, 2, 5 and 6 sequences showed similarity to previously characterized R gene sequences isolated from monocotyledonous plant species, while RGCs 3 and 4 showed similarity to R genes which form part of the Fusarium wilt resistance locus isolated from the dicotyledonous species, Lycopersicon esculentum; as well as other monocotyledonous R genes. RGCs 1 - 4 and 6 were present and transcriptionally active in both C 4 and Cav, whereas RGC- 5 was present in Cav only and was not transcribed. The transcripts could not be detected by Northern analysis, which is consistent with previous reports that R genes are constitutively transcriptionally active at only low levels. The NBS domains of RGCs 1 - 6 showed less than 65 % similarity (amino acid level) to one another but when each individual RGC isolated from the C 4 and Cav gDNA and cDNA templates was compared the sequences showed greater than 97 % similarity (amino acid level). Comparative sequence analysis revealed amino acid positions that were consistently different between the C 4 and Cav clones. Southern analysis revealed that RGC 1 - 5 were present in both the C 4 and Cav genomes in only low copy number (1 - 2 gene copies with 1 - 3 alleles), whereas RGC- 6 showed high copy number in both cultivars. Complete RGC sequences were subsequently amplified by RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) -RACE and 3 '-RACE using specific primers designed to each of the RGC 1 - 4 NBS domains. Amplicons for each RGC were assembled to form potentially complete RGC sequences. Analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of coiled coil (CC) motifs in two of the amino terminal sequences while leucine rich repeats (LRRs) were identified at the carboxy terminal of all sequences. Multiple 3 '-RACE products were amplified for each RGC sequence. Although the polyadenylated products were of different lengths, the sequences were greater than 98 % identical at the amino acid level (except an RGC 3 clone which was 91 - 95 % identical to the other RGC 3 clones due to a 37 amino acid deletion). Specific primers used to amplify each complete RGC sequence from both C 4 and Cav DNA revealed that: RGC 1 (3. 53 kbp) could be amplified from both C 4 and Cav; RGCs 2 (2. 99 kbp) and 4 (4. 44 kbp) could be amplified from only Cav, however, the proposed truncations of these sequences (RGC 2 : 1. 3 kbp, RGC 4 : 2. 8 kbp and 2. 9 kbp) could be amplified from both cultivars; RGC 3 (4. 57 kbp) could not be amplified from either C 4 or Cav, however, the three shorter sequences (1. 96 kbp, 1. 34 kbp and 1. 28 kbp) could be amplified from both templates. The functional significance of the truncated sequences is currently unknown, however, truncated sequences have been detected in a number of R gene families isolated from other crops. No major sequence differences, such as deletions/insertions or early stop codons, were identified between the RGC sequences amplified from C 4 as compared to Cav (greater than 91 % amino acid similarity) and no sequence was identified as being present in the susceptible but absent from the resistant cultivar. However, comparative analysis of multiple clones isolated from C 4 and Cav did reveal amino acid residues that were consistently different between the two cultivars. These differences may result in differing resistance capabilities, functional genomics studies would need to be undertaken to determine this. It has been proposed that CC-NBS-LRR type R genes employ NDR 1 /HIN 1 -like (NHL) proteins, after pathogen invasion is detected, in the signaling process that ultimately leads to the elaboration of a defense response. A NHL partial sequence (420 bp) was amplified from the C 4 banana cultivar. The complete sequence of this gene (termed NHL- 1) was isolated using RLM and 3 '-RACE technologies (576 bp and 535 bp amplicons, respectively) and subsequently the 1. 106 kbp sequence was PCR amplified from both the C 4 and Cav cultivars. The banana NHL- 1 gene contained conserved motifs/domains previously identified within other NHL-type gene sequences. These included a signal peptide motif, a transmembrane domain and three previously identified conserved motifs. Based on current research into NHL type genes, the banana NHL- 1 sequence may not be useful as a transgene to enhance disease resistance in elite cultivars. However, it potentially {{plays an important role in}} the defense response signal transduction pathway and therefore will further our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions in banana. Transgenic <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>banana</b> plants expressing the D 4 E 1 antimicrobial peptide under the control of either the maize polyubiquitin (Ubi) or banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) DNA- 6 (Bt 6. 1) promoters were generated. These plants were subsequently assessed for the ability of their crude protein extracts to inhibit the germination of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Race 1 conidia in vitro. These anti-fungal bioassays revealed that fungal colony growth was reduced by 37 - 100 % using extracts from the pUbi-D 4 E 1 transgenic lines and 89 - 99 % using extracts from the pBt 6. 1 -D 4 E 1 transgenic lines. The transgenic lines are currently undergoing multiplication in preparation for glasshouse and small plant challenge trials for resistance to Fusarium wilt. These preliminary results suggest that D 4 E 1 may be useful in enhancing disease resistance in banana...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} impedance parameters of two varieties of bananas: Cavendish bananas (Musa sp., `Williams¿) (AAA) and <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>bananas</b> (Musa sp., `Lady Finger¿) (AB) were studied during ripening periods with a Solartron¿ Impedance/ Gain-phase Analyzer and an Hewlett-Packard¿ LF Impedance Analyzer with a sweeping frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Tin-plated copper electrodes and Ag/AgCl electrodes {{are used in}} measurements. The Ag/AgCl electrodes show better performance without polarization effects. Fruit peel colours were employed as a routine approach to determine the ripening stages visually. The impedance results were further applied to two previous proposed plant cell electrical models, the Hayden¿s model and the double-shell model. The double-shell model gives better description of the electrical properties of banana, which shows that the whole fruit impedance, cell wall resistance, and vacuole resistance have positive linear relationships with peel color grade for the <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>bananas.</b> And the whole fruit impedance of Cavendish bananas displayed an increasing trend {{for the first few}} days, and a drop in the following two days. The respiration climate during the Cavendish bananas¿ ripening period are shown directly based on the observed {{electrical impedance}} changes. Moreover, the potential applica¬tion of the findings from this investigation regarding the prediction of fruit storage period is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|An offtype {{has been}} {{identified}} from micropropagated <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>bananas</b> (Musa spp., AAB group, Pome subgroup) that is characterised by its slow growth and poor bunch size. Bunch weights were approximately 25 % those of normal <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> plants {{and all of the}} fruit produced was unmarketable. This particular offtype is the most commonly encountered from micropropagated <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> plants and, in 2 instances, blocks of 3000 and 1500 plants were entirely comprised of this single offtype. Detection of offtype plants was possible during establishment and growth of plants in the glasshouse by the presence of chlorotic streaks in the leaves. In more severe cases the streaks coalesced into chlorotic patches that developed thin, necrotic areas that eventually produced holes or splits in the leaves. Symptom expression was not ameliorated by the addition of fertiliser and even though symptoms were similar to severe Ca and B deficiency, both normal and offtype plants had similar levels of these elements in the leaves. The offtype plants were also slow growing in the glasshouse and produced significantly (P< 0. 05) smaller pseudostems and leaves than normal plants. Offtype plants could be readily detected after 4 weeks deflasking using the presence of chlorotic streaks in the leaves as the main selection criterion. Maximum discrimination was possible between weeks 5 – 7 and at the 6 -leaf stage when all of the offtypes could be detected...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of banana cultivars, some of them the most popular varieties, now appear to be {{susceptible}} to Fusarium wilt. This is particularly critical in East Africa where the wilt is spreading rapidly. In Australia, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI) has produced a video entitled Panama disease - the banana industry under threat (Panama disease is a colloquial name sometimes used for Fusarium wilt). The video covers the development, management and occurrence of the disease causing fungus in bananas in Queensland. It describes the life-cycle {{of the disease and}} shows the symptoms in roots, stems, leaves, bunch stalks and fruit in both Cavendish and <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>bananas.</b> Both internal and external damage are illustrated.

40|$|Unripe Australian-grown Cavendish and <b>Lady</b> <b>Finger</b> <b>bananas</b> {{were stored}} at 15, 20 and 25 °C in an {{atmosphere}} containing 0. 001, 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1. 0 μL/L ethylene in air and the green life was determined as the time to reach the respiratory climacteric. As expected, green life increased as the temperature and ethylene concentration decreased. The equation describing the relationship between temperature, ethylene concentration and green life of Cavendish bananas was applied to a five-day 3000 km road transport route from the major tropical production area to the major urban markets. It predicted that bananas transported in the prevailing mean summer temperature of 25 °C would not require refrigeration if the ethylene level did not exceed 0. 58 μL/L while transport at the mean winter temperature of 14 °C fruit could withstand a level of about 0. 90 μL/L without ripening en route. The equation was also applied to a shipment protocol of 19 days for bananas exported from Central America to southern Europe. This predicted that fruit could be transported without refrigeration if ethylene levels were maintained at 0. 04 μL/L during the winter temperature of 17 °C and at 0. 002 μL/L at the summer transport temperature of 24 °C. Since a range of technologies are available to maintain such low ethylene levels or reduce the action of ethylene, {{these findings suggest that}} the current refrigerated transport of bananas could be minimised or eliminated. The use of higher temperatures in the supply chain would reduce energy consumption with resultant environmental and economic benefits...|$|R
