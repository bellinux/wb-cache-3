40|$|International audienceThe {{expanded}} {{bow shock}} on and around "the day {{the solar wind}} almost disappeared" (11 May 1999) allowed the Geotail spacecraft to make a practically uninterrupted 54 -h-long magnetosheath pass near dusk (16 : 30 - 21 : 11 magnetic local time) at a radial distance of 24 to 30 R E (Earth radii). During most of this period, interplanetary parameters varied gradually and {{in such a way}} as to give rise to two extreme magnetosheath structures, one dominated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects and the other by gas dynamic effects. We focus attention on unusual features of electromagnetic ion wave activity in the former magnetosheath state, and compare these features with those in the latter. Magnetic fluctuations in the gas dynamic magnetosheath were dominated by compressional mirror mode waves, and left- and right-hand polarized electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves transverse to the background field. In contrast, the MHD magnetosheath, lasting for over one day, was devoid of mirror oscillations and permeated instead by EIC waves of weak intensity. The weak wave intensity is related to the prevailing low solar wind dynamic pressures. <b>Left-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> EIC <b>waves</b> were replaced by bursts of right-hand <b>polarized</b> <b>waves,</b> which remained for many hours the only ion wave activity present. This activity occurred when the magnetosheath proton temperature anisotropy (=) became negative. This was because the weakened bow shock exposed the magnetosheath directly to the (negative) temperature anisotropy of the solar wind. Unlike the normal case studied in the literature, these right-hand waves were not by-products of <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> but derived their energy source directly from the magnetosheath temperature anisotropy. Brief entries into the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and duskside magnetosphere occurred under such inflated conditions that the magnetospheric magnetic pressure was insufficient to maintain pressure balance. In these crossings, the inner edge of the LLBL was flowing sunward. The study extends our knowledge of magnetosheath ion wave properties to the very low solar wind dynamic pressure regime...|$|R

Using both the DE- 1 particle and wave measurements, we can positively identify those electromagnetics lower hybrid like waves as fast magnetosonic waves and the upper cutoff of these waves is the local lower hybrid frequency. From the upper cutoff of the frequency spectrum, one can infer the particle density and the result is in very good agreement with the particle data.

30|$|The Martian {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} the presence of heavy (oxygen) ions of planetary origin which strongly influence the solar wind dynamics, including the bow shock structure and position and may cause additional plasma boundaries in the magnetosheath. In this paper the dispersion characteristics of low-frequency electromagnetic waves (LFEW) in the proton gyrofrequency range are studied. The excitation of these waves results from the relative motion between the solar wind protons and planetary heavy ions, which are considered as unmagnetized and, therefore, may act like a beam in the solar wind. The model takes into account the small extension of the Martian magnetosphere compared with the pickup gyroradius of an exospheric ion. From the dispersion analysis {{it was found that the}} most unstable waves with relatively high growth rates propagate oblique to the ambient magnetic field. For small propagation angle to the magnetic field these are right-hand <b>polarized</b> whistler <b>waves</b> in the solar wind frame, and due to Doppler shift they appear near to the proton cyclotron frequency as <b>left-hand</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> in the beam (spacecraft) frame.

Especially, the so-called Phobos events marked by spectral peaks around the proton cyclotron frequency may be interpreted as signatures of the solar wind interaction with a tenuous gas torus. A comparable situation is known from the AMPTE Ba and Li releases where during the late stages of the experiments an enhanced proton cyclotron emission was observed as well. Another important aspect of LFEW excitation is its role in proton deceleration and heating upstream the bow shock where turbulent processes may provide a strong momentum coupling between the solar wind and the newly generated ions of planetary origin.|$|R

Growth rates calculated using bi-Lorentzian forms {{for the main}} and beam proton as well as core and halo electron velocity distributions do not differ significantly from those calculated using bi-Maxwellian forms. Using distribution parameters determined from 17 measured proton spectra, we show that considering the uncertainties the magnetosonic wave may be linearly stable and the Alfven wave is linearly unstable. Because proton velocity distribution function shapes are observed to persist for times long compared to the proton gyroperiod, the latter result suggests that linear stability theory fails for proton-driven ion cyclotron waves in the high-speed solar wind...|$|R
40|$|Recent interplanetary {{observations}} presented {{evidence of}} simultaneous excitation of high-frequency Langmuir waves and low-frequency electromagnetic whistler {{waves in the}} magnetic holes of the solar wind. In this letter, we formulate a broadband theory of the interplanetary Langmuir-whistler events. We show that whistler waves can grow exponentially {{as a result of}} nonlinear interactions of Langmuir <b>waves</b> and <b>left-hand</b> circularly <b>polarized</b> radio <b>waves.</b> In particular, the growth of whistler waves favors propagation parallel to the Langmuir waves. Key words: plasmas [...] solar wind [...] turbulence 1. Introduction Ulysses observation of high-frequency electrostatic Langmuir waves in close temporal correlation with lowfrequency electromagnetic whistler waves suggests that nonlinear coupling between these two types of plasma waves may occur in the solar wind (Kellogg et al. 1992; Lin et al. 1995; Stone et al. 1995). These interplanetary Langmuir-whistler events were seen within the local depressi [...] ...|$|R
