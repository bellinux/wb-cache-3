50|$|The Frei {{test was}} {{developed}} in 1925 by Wilhelm Siegmund Frei, a German dermatologist, to identify <b>lymphogranuloma</b> inguinale. Antigen made from sterile pus aspirated from previously unruptured abscesses, produced a reaction in patients with <b>lymphogranuloma</b> inguinale when injected intradermally. Other sources of antigen have been explored, most deriving from various tissues of mice infected with Chlamydia. The test is no longer used but stands as a milestone {{in our understanding of}} immunology. A heat inactivated LGV 0.1ml grown in yolk sac of embryonated egg is injected intra dermally on the forearm and a control material prepared from noninfected yolk sac on the other forearm i.e. control. After 48-72 hours, an imflammatory nodule more than 6mm in diameter develops at the test site.|$|E

50|$|Esthiomene is {{generally}} the visible result of <b>lymphogranuloma</b> venereum, lymphatic infection by Chlamydia trachomatis.

Neoplastic aetiologies include lymphoma, leukaemia and metastatic disease from primary tumours in the lower limb, external genitalia or perianal region and melanoma.|$|E
50|$|João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme {{proposed}} that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, {{helped by a}} high frequency of genital ulcers, caused by genital ulcer diseases (GUD). GUD are simply sexually transmitted diseases that cause genital ulcers; examples are syphilis, chancroid, <b>lymphogranuloma</b> venereum, and genital herpes. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01-0.1% to 4-43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated T cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.|$|E
