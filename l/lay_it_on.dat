It begins to compost, generating new organisms over time, Chadwick had {{to top it}} up daily to maintain its levels. During the exhibition a small leak appeared in the tower and {{in a state of}} panic the ICA staff laid the column, splitting a seam. When they attempted to <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> its side, ten gallons on fermented liquid sloshed and blew off the end of the tower. Newspapers broadcast this accident, bringing attention to Chadwick as an exciting nonconforming artist.|$|E

500|$|Palmerston died in 1865, {{and after}} a brief {{ministry}} led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament {{for the first time}} since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. [...] "Everyone likes flattery," [...] he said, [...] "and when you come to royalty you should <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> with a trowel." [...] With the phrase [...] "we authors, Ma'am", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were [...] "a public meeting rather than a woman".|$|E

500|$|Although {{initially}} {{curious about}} Disraeli {{when he entered}} Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. [...] He told Matthew Arnold, [...] "Everybody likes flattery; and, {{when you come to}} royalty, you should <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, Adam Kirsch, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, Lord Melbourne. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to kiss hands, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, [...] "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage." ...|$|E

[...] The other said, [...] "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me." [...] The phrase [...] "night witch" [...] was thought to mean [...] "night watch"; when the notes were {{initially}} read aloud, night watchman Newt Lee is reported by police to have said, [...] "Boss, it looks like they are trying to <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> me" [...] (or words to that effect). Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.|$|E
