6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} been living in your hole!" [...] Mrs. Luna exclaimed. [...] "Olive came home six weeks ago. How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> expect her to endure it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> cut those fuses to burn?" [...] {{he said to}} Jimmy, who, {{though by}} no means fond of {{physical}} exertion, had come up to assist him from the ranch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think you}} could find happiness, in calling {{beautiful}} gardens into existence, one after another?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Putting {{down your}} tools would cost you something," [...] he resumed. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> imagine {{it would take}} to persuade Kerr?" ...|$|R
2500|$|When asked [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think a {{child should}} be allowed to cry after being punished? Is there a limit?" [...] Dobson responded: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then she laughed, and {{her husband}} laughed, {{doubling}} himself into a knot of merriment. [...] "Oh, but that's rich!" [...] said he. [...] "You've been asleep exactly {{an hour and a}} quarter," [...] he added. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think you'd slept--two days?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lanfear, {{sitting by}} the bed, {{in the light of}} the wasting candle, which threw a {{grotesque}} shadow of him on the wall, shook his head. After a moment he asked: [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell me her swoon had lasted after the accident to her mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{doubt she}} will,' said the miller; 'for I {{have never known}} thee wanting in sense in a jineral way.' He turned his cup round on its axis till the handle had {{travelled}} a complete circle. 'How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say in your letter that you had known her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that's the case, {{they may}} organise around here," [...] said Ralph. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose {{it will be}} before father gets back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are people}} who would {{spend most of their}} life doing it," [...] said Austin, reflectively. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> propose to allow yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How many leagues <b>long?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> intend it to last {{all the way}} to Montevideo? The {{longer it}} is the sooner you ought to begin it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An old coat {{is an old}} friend, old Binnie. I don't want {{to be rid of}} one or the other. How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> and my boy sit up together--isn't he a fine lad, Binnie? I {{expect you}} are going to put him down for {{something}} handsome in your will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went at twelve, from Whitehaven. Only so high," [...] {{raising his}} hand some four {{feet from the}} deck. [...] "I was so small, and looked so queer in my little blue jacket, that they called me the monkey. They'll call me {{something}} else before <b>long.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever sail out of Whitehaven?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Although {{you have}} given me no proof of your statements, which seem to be founded on conjectures, I have not said that I intend to let it drop. In the {{meantime}} I am entitled to ask for some information about yourself. You look like an Englishman and have not been here <b>long.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> leave home after the war broke out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you a brute, or a fool, or both?" [...] she said, {{letting her}} temper loose. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> intend to stand there, doing nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go too far," [...] Sylvia warned him. [...] "But I'd better {{understand}} the situation. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> expect me to be amiable to the man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> give me," [...] he asked, {{putting his}} third {{question}} in a quieter tone, [...] "before the clock strikes and the seal is broken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine {{was a very}} foolish request," [...] she {{admitted}} quietly. [...] "I am sorry that I ever made it. It was just an impulse, because the little building we were speaking of has been connected {{with one or two}} very disagreeable episodes. Nevertheless, it was foolish of me. How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think of staying there--that is," [...] she added, with a faint smile, [...] "providing that you find it possible to prove your claim and take up possession?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Things {{take too}} long in this world," [...] he said. [...] "I detest all this Barkerian {{business}} about evolution and the gradual modification of things. I wish the world {{had been made in}} six days, and knocked to pieces again in six more. And I wish I had done it. The joke's good enough in a broad way, sun and moon and the image of God, and all that, but they keep it up so damnably <b>long.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever long for a miracle, Bowler?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hen Billard was the worst; {{he said he}} {{reckoned}} {{the circus}} magician got scared when he saw what a whaler Pony was, and told the circus men {{that they would have}} to get a new tent to hold him; and that was the reason why they didn't take him. Archy Hawkins said: [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have to wait on the front steps, Pony dear?" [...] But after that he was pretty good to him, and said he reckoned they had better not any of them pretend that Pony had not tried to run off if they had not been up to see.|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think I {{can stand}} it on four doughnuts? Here are you fellers livin' high, an' I'm goin' 'round jest {{about ready to}} die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have?" [...] the Capataz de Cargadores {{repeated}} cautiously. [...] "Well, that is wonderful. And how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think you}} are going to keep it up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Annie judiciously; [...] "not exactly dissolute. Feeble's {{more the}} word. Weak, 'E was. Weak as water. 'Ow <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like your eggs boiled?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{were over}} two hundred men out, and Phineas {{began to think that}} it might not be so easy {{to get out of the}} crowd. A crowd in a fast run no doubt quickly becomes small by degrees and beautifully less; but it is very difficult, {{especially}} for a stranger, to free himself from the rush at the first start. Lord Chiltern's horse plunged about so violently, as they stood on a little hill-side looking down upon the cover, that he was obliged to take him to a distance, and Phineas followed him. [...] "If he breaks down wind," [...] said Lord Chiltern, [...] "we can't be better than we are here. If he goes up wind, he must turn before long, and we shall be all right." [...] As he spoke an old hound opened true and sharp,--an old hound whom all the pack believed,--and in a moment there was no doubt that the fox had been found. [...] "There are not above eight or nine acres in it," [...] said Lord Chiltern, [...] "and he can't hang <b>long.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever see such an uneasy brute as this in your life? But I feel certain he'll go well when he gets away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{from the}} age of fifteen, when I ran away from home, and went cabin-boy on board an Indiaman, till now, when I'm fifty year old, pretty nigh, them women have always been my ruin. Why, it was one of 'em, and with such black eyes and jewels on her neck, and Battens and ermine like a duchess, I tell you--it was one of 'em at Paris that swept off {{the best part of the}} {{thousand}} pound as I went off with. Didn't I ever tell you of it? Well, I don't mind. At first I was very cautious and having such a lot of money kept it close and lived like a gentleman--Colonel Altamont, Meurice's hotel, and that sort of thing--never played, except at the public tables, and won more than I lost. Well, sir, there was a chap that I saw at the hotel and the Palace Royal too, a regular swell fellow, with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin, Bloundell-Bloundell his name was, as I made acquaintance with somehow, and he asked me to dinner, and took me to Madame the Countess de Foljambe's soirees--such a woman, Strong!--such an eye! such a hand at the pianner. Lor bless you, she'd sit down and sing to you, and gaze at you, until she warbled your soul out of your body a'most. She asked me to go to her evening parties every Toosday; and didn't I take opera-boxes and give her dinners at the restauranteur's, that's all? But I had a run of luck at the tables, and it was not in the dinners and opera-boxes that poor Clavering's money went. No, be hanged to it, it was swept off in another way. One night, at the Countess's, there was several of us at supper--Mr. Bloundell-Bloundell, the Honourable Deuceace, the Marky de la Tour de Force--all tip-top nobs, sir, and the height of fashion, when we had supper, and champagne you may be sure in plenty, and then some of that confounded brandy. I would have it--I would it go on at it--the Countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me, and we had cards as well as grog after supper, and I played and drank until I don't know what I did. I was like I was last night. I was taken away and put to bed somehow, and never woke until the next day, to a roaring headache, and to see my servant, who said the Honourable Deuceace wanted to see me, and was waiting in the sitting-room. 'How are you, Colonel?' says he, a coming into my bedroom. 'How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> stay last night after I went away? The play was getting too high for me, and I'd lost enough to you for one night.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, the pavilions {{architect}} {{was present}} {{and gave a}} speech in which when asked [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> think the structure would stand?" [...] Answered [...] "Well, my body at almost 85 years of age, it's stood along time, but I've had maintenance; and if I had so little maintenance as that structure I would have been gone long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|She also debated [...] "Mr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may, {{as we were}} saying, leave town. How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think you}} can bear it without them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pray, madam, how <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean to stay here? I {{see nothing}} to eat, and {{though you may}} be very charming, the sight of <b>you</b> <b>does</b> not prevent me from famishing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Five years," [...] {{said the}} old woman, shaking her head and folding {{her hands in her}} lap. [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say you’ve been looking for Captain Jackson?" ...|$|R

Senator WARREN. Colonel, you have been on the other side, have you not? Lieut. Col. RIGBY. Yes, sir. Senator WARREN. How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> serve over there? Lieut. Col. RIGBY. I went over there, sailing on the 7 th of Apri l last, I think. I was not over there prior to that. I came into the service from civil life, from the practice of law, in August, 1918. Senator WARREN.

40|$|Election policy gets {{made in a}} {{world without}} data. Recently I 2 ̆ 7 ve {{proposed}} a solution to that problem - creating a Democracy Index, which would rank states and localities based on how well their election systems are run. Imagine a U. S. News and World report for the election system that would rank jurisdictions based on basic questions that matter to voters: How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> stand in line? How many ballots got discarded? How many machines broke down? This idea - one that was put into legislation by then Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton - is {{the first and most}} useful step we could take to improving our badly administered election system. Elsewhere, I have described why a Democracy Index should help get change passed. Here, I want to focus on a different question: how to figure out what kind of change we want. Part II describes the problems associated with policymaking in a world without data. Part III explains why a Democracy Index, by pulling together the right data in the right form, would provide a much-needed corrective to ongoing debates about election policy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether parents understand and adhere to preoperative fasting instructions. AIM: To identify how we may reduce perioperative morbidity relating to failure to fast. BACKGROUND: Children are routinely fasted preoperatively {{with the aim}} of reducing the risk of aspiration of gastric contents and its sequelae. METHODS: Parents of children on the day case ward following elective surgery completed a survey asking: (i) For how long was your child asked to fast? (ii) How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ensure your child was fasted of food and clear fluids? (iii) What {{do you think is the}} purpose of fasting? We also asked the parents to complete a checklist of items they thought acceptable to consume when fasting. RESULTS: Despite affirming fasting status in the preoperative check, 13. 5 % were not fasted. Parents reported advised fasting times of 1 - 24 h (median 6) for solids and 0. 5 - 24 h (median 3) for fluids. Children were fasted of solids for 3 - 40 h (median 9. 5) and of fluids for 0. 5 - 24 h (median 5). Regarding the understanding of fasting, 9 referred to aspiration and 53 to the prevention of nausea or vomiting. Thirteen believed that fasting status altered the efficacy of anesthesia. During the fasting period, 4. 9 % would allow French fries, 22. 3 % toast/crackers, 17. 5 % cereal, 14. 7 % a sweet, 14. 9 % gum, and 12. 6 % tea with milk. CONCLUSIONS: Children we believe to be fasted may not be. Parents may deliberately misrepresent the actual fasting status of their child. Adherence to fasting advice may be affected by parents' recall and understanding of fasting advice...|$|E
