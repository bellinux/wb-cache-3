At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood.

After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot {{in a room full}} of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.|$|E

25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength.

His face <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full of anxiety as if {{he knows that he}} should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E

This program builds upon the former Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI), which concluded in December 2004 and focused on weapon and drug trafficking, as well as counterterrorism. Previous U.S. military activities in Sub-Saharan Africa have included Special Forces associated Joint Combined Exchange Training. Letitia Lawson, writing in 2007 for a Center for Contemporary Conflict journal at the Naval Postgraduate School, noted that U.S. policy towards Africa, {{at least in the}} medium-term, <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely defined by international terrorism, the increasing importance of African oil to American energy needs, and the dramatic expansion and improvement of Sino-African relations since 2000.|$|E

25|$|His first {{venture into}} etching {{seems to be}} a single self-portrait {{inserted}} into a large print of the ceremonial entry of the new Duke Henri into Nancy in 1610. The established printmaker Friedrich Brentel and his young assistant Matthias Merian—later a major producer of maps and town views—had been brought in to produce a series of prints depicting the funeral of the old Duke Charles in 1608, and the celebrations for the new duke after mourning was complete. Plate 10 of the series shows a large group of mounted courtiers as part of a procession, and it was realized in 1971 that one of the figures, and his horse, is etched in a completely different style, that can be related to Bellange's other prints. It is now generally agreed that Bellange persuaded Brentel (or vice versa) that he should portray himself. This would have been in 1611, and a bookplate that <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an early effort is dated 1613; after that, none of his prints are dated, although most are signed.|$|E
25|$|The myth of Crane {{has been}} studied by M. Renard and G. Dumezil. The first scholar sees in it a sort of {{parallel}} with the theology underlying the rite of the Tigillum Sororium. Crane is a nymph of the sacred wood of Helernus, located at {{the issue of the}} Tiber, whose festival of 1 February corresponded with that of Juno Sospita: Crane might be seen as a minor imago of the goddess. Her habit of deceiving her male pursuers by hiding in crags in the soil reveals her association not only with vegetation but also with rocks, caverns, and underpassages. Her nature <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> also associated with vegetation and nurture: G. Dumezil has proved that Helernus was a god of vegetation, vegetative lushness and orchards, particularly associated with vetch. As Ovid writes in his Fasti, 1 June was the festival day of Carna, besides being the kalendary festival of the month of Juno and the festival of Juno Moneta. Ovid seems to purposefully conflate and identify Carna with Cardea in the aetiologic myth related above. Consequently, the association of both Janus and the god Helernus with Carna-Crane is highlighted in this myth: it was customary on that day to eat ivetch and lard, which were supposed to strengthen the body. Cardea had also magic powers for protecting doorways (by touching thresholds and posts with wet hawthorn twigs) and newborn children by the aggression of the striges (in the myth the young Proca). M. Renard sees the association of Janus with Crane as reminiscent of widespread rites of lustration and fertility performed through ritual walking under low crags or holes in the soil or natural hollows in trees, which in turn are reflected in the lustrative rite of the Tigillum Sororium.|$|E

500|$|Wales wrote favorably {{about the}} film in 2007 during its production, and noted, [...] "Director Nic Hill is making what <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fabulous film about Wikipedia and Wikipedians worldwide." [...] However, Wales commented {{negatively}} about the delayed release, {{in a statement to}} PRNewser. He said the movie was dated due to its delay. He commented that the documentary was lopsided towards reliance on expert commentary and did not feature enough weight towards depicting community involvement in the online project. Wales posted to a Wikimedia Foundation mailing list, [...] "the film was poorly received in Poland, and it is seriously out of date." [...] Larry Sanger commented he thought the film was, [...] "Not too bad, from what I saw." [...] Wikimedia Foundation board member Samuel Klein commented, [...] "In general, I like the film a lot more after seeing it for the second time, in a very different audience (and seeing their live reactions)." [...] Sage Ross, an attendee of Wikimania 2010, commented that the film appears to take a mainly negative point of view towards Wikipedia, [...] "The film gives a lot of focus to some shallow or misleading lines of criticism, and on an intellectual level, it comes off as largely anti-Wikipedia, contrasting the reasonable-sounding arguments of mature critics with the naive optimism of youthful Wikipedians." [...] Author Ted Leonsis commented favorably about the documentary, at his blog, Ted's Take, characterizing it as, [...] "A great film about the Wikipedia movement."

500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance tonight is funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where I am from. I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working for Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. Why is she rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E
